Story_ID: 13159
Speaker 1: Tell me what you can about your family history.  How far back can trace your family?  What do you know about them?
Speaker 2: Well, I can trace my family back to my grandparents, and have an idea about--it's somewhat sketchy about where they grew up and where they were from.  My father's [Albert Douglas Smith] family is mainly from Kentucky and Tennessee.  My mother's [Shirley Rhone Smith] family is from Mississippi.  I'm not sure where my mother's father is from.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that they passed down from-from the nineteenth century from, slavery or Reconstruction, stories of life in the south before they moved to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, all of my family--my grandparents--relate to slavery as far as the whole--the issues of slavery, of segregation, Jim Crow.  Those kinds of things.  Another story they told us about was really coming from the South to the North.  Moving to Chicago was a very common thread of leaving a situation where they felt, you know oppressed.  They felt like they had no real future, no ability to improve their lives.  Where they were whether it was Mississippi or Kentucky or Tennessee in coming to Chicago.  So, those stories of that kind of oppression.  My grandmother, my father's mother, can also remember being told stories about slavery.  She was born in the 1890s.  So she can--she related to me some stories about her parents and her parent generation in the issues of slavery.
Speaker 1: Were there specific stories that you remember that she told you?
Speaker 2: The only ones were really general things where, you know, she--the fear that she had, and her family had living in the South.  Of her parents.  How you had to know quote unquote "how to act" or you could be killed or hanged, things like that, so.  But nothing more specific than that.  I can remember my mother's mother talking about picking cotton.  That's a very vivid memory.  They talked about how, you know, you had--it was almost a competition, you know how many pounds you could pick a day; and the good pickers, how many bags they could pick.  And you'd be, you know, asked to come back again and pick cotton.  So, until their fingers would be bleeding, and so forth.  And she remembers that very vividly and would share it with us.
Story_ID: 13160
Speaker 1: Tell us about your parents, starting with your mother.  Can you give us her full name and date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother was born in Chicago [Illinois].  Her name was Shirley Rhone Smith.
Speaker 1: How do you spell 'Rhone?'
Speaker 2: R-H-O-N-E.
Speaker 1: That's her family name, her name before she got married.  Her maiden name.  And she was born in Chicago.  Year my mother was born, I'll have to think about this. Can always subtract back from my own age, 1920, 1931.  My mother's only eighteen years older than I.  I was eighteen--she was eighteen when I was born. She was very young.  My mother didn't live very long.  My mother died right before her thirtieth birthday.
Speaker 2: What was she like, and what did she do?  Do you remember much?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, my mother had six children.  So she was a homemaker.  She was a mother.  Typical mother of that age who really was in charge of the house, ran the house, did all of the organization about the house, the cooking, the cleaning.  She also did--my mother would do jobs during seasonal times.  I remember her working at the post office, you know, beginning in October in preparation for Christmas.  So she'd work for those two months.  Sometimes she worked in the summertime as well, but mainly right before Christmas.  But she was a homemaker, and raised her six children.  That's what she did.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What was her personality like?  Was she, was she a happy person?
Speaker 1: Oh very happy person.  My mother comes from a large family of about--I think there were thirteen of them.  She was one of the younger ones, but very effervescent.  Very positive, outgoing life.  My mother, in fact my personality, I think, in my early years more than anybody else, she was the one that would talk to me about education and the benefit of it and what I could be and her hopes for all of her children including myself.  And so, had a huge impact on my outlook on what could be.
Speaker 2: Now did she have opportunity for much education herself?
Speaker 1: I think my mother went to high school.  I think she finished high school.  But no further than that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Where did she go?  Do you remember?
Speaker 1: Boy, I can remember where my father went to high school but not my mother.
Speaker 2: I think in those days they just had [Wendell] Phillips [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] for the most part--there were some other ones.
Speaker 1: Well my dad [Albert Douglas Smith] went to Dunbar [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  I think as well as [Wendell] Phillips.  My mother may have gone to Phillips High School here in the city.  But she also--she went to, early on she went to Catholic schools, because her, family was Catholic.  So I think in grammar school she did go to Catholic schools.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You say she died when you about--
Speaker 1: When I was ten years old.  Right.
Speaker 2: What happened?  Was it--was she sick?
Speaker 1: She was not sick.  She died of what we would say today--she died of what is called sepsis.  She got an infection that really spread to her bloodstream and her kidneys.  And died very-with a-within two days.  I can remember very clearly.
Speaker 2: Nobody really knew that she was in that kind of danger?
Speaker 1: No, I remember her having a fever one day, and going to the hospital the next day, and the next day she died.  It was very abrupt, very sudden.  And, you know, she had very young children.  I mean, my brother, my youngest brother [Robert] was only eighteen months when she-my mother died; and the oldest one of us was my brother [Albert Jr.] who was older than I am, and he was, eleven.  So we were all very young.
Speaker 2: So there were four of you?
Speaker 1: There's six of us.  Right. I have three brothers and two sisters.
Story_ID: 13161
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father.  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father is Albert Douglas Smith.  A-L-B-E-R-T, that's his first name.  My father is a retired Chicago [Illinois] policeman, and that was his career.  But I remember before he was a policeman, it was, a huge event when he became a policeman because not many African Americans in those days became policeman.  That was not a job you could get.  But I remember my father being a cab driver for years, doing odd jobs, different jobs like that to make ends meet.  I can remember when he became a policeman, too.  He's a retired Chicago policeman.
Speaker 1: Now, what was his date of birth?  And place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, my father must've been--is only a year older than my mother.  So he is probably born in 1930.  He was born in Chicago as well.  He is only nineteen years older than I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, he have a--why did he become a police officer?  Was for economic reasons primarily or--?
Speaker 2: I think it was primarily economic.  I think that those jobs began to open up and he had the opportunity to become a policeman.  It was a very good job.  Excellent salary for that time and also excellent benefits.  And so it was a prize job to have.  I don't think he went into it at all for the, adventure.  I think he realized the danger of it.  I can remember very clearly my mother [Shirley Rhone Smith] being always concerned when he'd leave the house, would he come back home and we would, as young kids, be a little bit frightened about it.  You know, he was a policeman.  He had to carry a gun.  He could get shot, you know, he was in dangerous situations.  And my father is not the one who would look for danger.  But I think he did--he was an excellent policeman.  He enjoyed his job.  But, I think he went into it mainly for economic reasons.
Speaker 1: How was he deployed by the Chicago Police Department?  In what way did he--?
Speaker 2: Well, he worked in different areas.  I can remember him working in Gresham [neighborhood].  I can remember him working from the--at that time the 11th Street main headquarters during his later years as a policeman.  And then other areas where we lived, we lived on Oakenwal-, on Oakland Boulevard, he worked in that area as a policeman.  He drived a patrol car for years and years.  I can remember him being written up in the paper as (unclear) a couple of times. There was a fire.  He rescued some children, something like that.  And it was a big thing.  He was in the [Chicago] 'Defender' [African American newspaper], you know, and there was a write-up about him.  I can remember him being a patrol officer.  I can remember him--I realize now a part of his parenting technique.  He would tell us, as boys growing up, he'd say, "You know, I'm a policeman.  That means I can be, anywhere at any time, so I'm always watching you."  We'd always think of our father was always watching us.  In fact, we'd be playing like baseball or something, and he would drive by in his patrol wagon very slowly, then just drive off.  I think it was to say to us, 'I'm always watching you.'  We'd always think Dad's always watching us.  So, I think it was a parenting technique.
Speaker 1: How did that affect you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my father was a policeman.  He was a no-nonsense guy.  In all of the neighborhoods we were known as the--you know there is four of us--but the neighborhood knew, and we knew our father was a no-nonsense guy.  I can remember growing up in the projects on 43rd [Street] and Lake Park [Avenue], when the gangs in the '60s [1960s] were very prevalent.  And I can remember moving into the apartment.  I can remember my father, the first week, put on his uniform going downstairs where the gangs were, and he called the gang members around him and he said to him--to them and us, he said, "I have four sons."  He said, "They will not be in gangs."  He said, "You will not recruit them.  If you do, I'll get you and them, too."  And none of us were ever in gangs.  Father was, he was the ruling power and you followed his rules.
Speaker 1: Well that was a--sounds like a pretty straightforward message.
Speaker 2: Very straightforward, and we got it.  And we realized, you know, we could not get into trouble.  We knew if we got in trouble we'd have to go, you know, we got arrested he wouldn't, you know, he'd tell, "I'm not comin' to get you.  You, stay out of trouble, you do your--what you're supposed to be doing, and keep yourselves out of, mischief," so.  It helped a lot.  None of us went to jail.  I can't remember any of us ever getting arrested.  So, it worked.
Speaker 1: Now, did he have any, moments when he was in a lot of danger? Or did you hear about any stories about--?
Speaker 2: I can remember him being involved in a situation where there was gunfire, and--but fortunately, he was never shot that I know of and never hurt.  So I think that it was a general concern that we had about him.  I can remember my mother saying again about, you know, "He could get shot, he could get killed," you know, and--but fortunately, he never, got hurt on the job that I know of.
Speaker 1: How-how do you feel about the, the Police Department in the city of Chicago in general?
Speaker 2: I think he enjoyed the department.  I think, he had some mixed emotions about it.  I think for African Americans, even today, there are mixed emotions.  On one, hand you are, you know, a part of the government.  You are a part of the enforcement part of our society; and on the other part, you also see sometimes the inequalities that exist as well.  So that, I think, there, are mixed messages, and sometime difficult to, do your job because you do see some of the inequities, whether they are real or proposed.
Speaker 1: Now, did he become a policeman while your mother was still alive?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was a policeman for a number of years before my mother died.
Speaker 1: You said it was a big celebration when he became--.
Speaker 2: Well, it was a big thing, you know.  It was, a job that we knew would help us economically.  I mean there was six young children.  And again, I can remember growing up--you know, during that time you were poor, but you didn't know you were poor.  I mean, you ate every day, you know.  But you could also remember--you know, I can remember very clearly the first part of the month--the meals we would eat, and how the meals would change during the last parts of the month when the money would run low.  So I remember those kinds of things.  And I remember him becoming a policeman.  That changed somewhat.  I mean, his pay was better.  We were better off economically.  So I think the celebration--I can't remember a specific celebration. I remember, you know, just the joy that we all had that he had this job that was much better than what he was doing before.
Story_ID: 13162
Speaker 1: Can you reflect back on growing up?  You grew up basically in the Kenwood-Oakland section of Chicago [Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can remember growing up.  We're living on 38th [Street] and Indiana [Avenue].  As a very young child--two and three, and four years old.  And then, on--in Oakland for the, you know, from the ages about ten or eight or nine or ten until about seventeen or eighteen.  So my real formative years.
Speaker 1: What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh boy!  Growing up--I was remembering the neighborhood going out to play with our friends that--you know, neighborhoods were true neighborhoods then.  I mean, you knew everyone in the neighborhood, they all knew you.  They were your--the adults were all your extended parents.  And they, in fact, parented you because you knew they knew your parents.  And so, they kind of served as a check and balance with you.  I can remember things like going to the A & P [Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, grocery] store with my wagon that my parents had bought me to earn money on Saturdays, you know, delivering groceries. That was a big thing.  First time I could make money on my own. I can remember rock fights, you know.  Throwing rocks at each other, having rock battles.  Nobody ever got really hurt, but, things like that growing up when you are eight, nine, and ten.  And there were very close friends that you grew up with.  Going to school was for me a, big thing.  I was one of those strange kids who really loved school, and enjoyed it. You know, I looked forward to going to school everyday.
Speaker 1: Were your other brothers and sisters like that too, or just you?
Speaker 2: Not as much.  And, in fact, it sometimes caused a problem.  My brother [Albert Jr.] was only--is only eleven months older than I am, so there was always this comparison, you know.  I was a student who, you know, loved school and, in fact, one of the reasons I did well in grammar school was because I would get my brother's books, who was a year ahead of me, and I would read them.  So when I went to the next grade I had read that material.  I knew it already because I read his books.  And so--but it got him in trouble because they would always compare him and me you know, "Why aren't you more like Horace?" you know. He--my brother was--I think he was, he was smarter than I was--as far as his IQ [intelligence quotient].  I think he was real--he' a sharp guy.  He didn't enjoy school that much, though.  When he applied himself he did great, but you know--.  So, I can remember those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Where do you fall in the order--you're not the--?
Speaker 2: I'm not the--I'm second oldest.  I'm--out of six.  So there is my older brother, who is Albert Jr., then myself, then my sister Geraldine [Smith Peacock], then my brother Sidney [Smith], then my sister Joyce [Smith], then my brother Bobby [Smith].
Speaker 1: So you were-you enjoyed learning and reading.  What kind of books did you like to read?
Speaker 2: I, loved history books.  One of, one of my real interest is history.  U.S. history, world history, ancient history, civilizations.  I love history.  I, read a lot.  So history was a big thing for me, and science.  I've always enjoyed science, and read science books and research kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were coming along television was making its big impact on your age group.  I know that myself.  When did you all get a television set?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember our first black and white television set.  It was a big thing to get it.  I must have been, maybe eight, when I can remember, around eight years old.  And us having a television set.  I remember it being in our parents' room.  And we could only go in there and watch in their room, I think maybe an hour a day or so.  But, I remember those--early television, you know.  We watched shows like 'Garfield Goose,' 'Bozo's Circus' later on, things like that--those kind of shows.  Also, I can remember growing up watching TV on Friday nights--'Shock Theater' where they showed the horror shows on Friday night.  It was crazy because we'd all be totally frightened and wouldn't want to go to bed.  So we would have to all go to bed together, but we would all stay up and watch this show like at ten o'clock at night, you know, to about eleven [o'clock].  And we would all be terrified.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the kinds of movies they were showing?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely!  The first mummy movies, and 'Frankenstein', 'The Werewolf'--those were--the big three were 'The Werewolf', 'Frankenstein', and 'The Mummy'.  Those were the big three, and we'd watch them and they come and watch them over and over again, and be totally frightened.  You know, especially if there was a storm outside, it was lightning, and oh my God, you'd be terrified.
Story_ID: 13163
Speaker 1: What else did you do when you were growing up?  I mean, was church a big deal (unclear)?
Speaker 2: In my family church was not.  My parents were not regular churchgoers. My church influence came from my father's [Albert Douglas Smith's] mother who was a very avid churchgoer and I remember going over to her house.  When you go over to her house you'd go to church every Sunday.  I mean, you had to.  And then when my mother [Shirley Rhone Smith] died when I was ten, we lived with her for a year.  And I began to go to church a lot then, and from that, I think my interest in church was really peaked.  Even before that when we lived on Oakland--on Oakland Boulevard.  I could remember going to church there on that street, and also going to Holy Angels [Church] with my mother every now and then.  Had some interest in church, but my parents were not big churchgoers.
Speaker 1: Do you any idea why? (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Not really sure why.  For my father, maybe because his mother--my grandmother, I'm sure he went to church every week when he was growing up.  But as an adult I can't remember my father going to church when we were just growing up, at all.  And my mother would go every now and then.  Not--maybe once every couple of months or so.  I'm not sure exactly why.  I think they both believed in God, had a belief in God, but they were not churchgoers, didn't belong to a church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about school.  Let me go back to the church thing for a second.  You didn't have a lot of responsibilities in church or anything like that when you were growing up, I take it?
Speaker 2: No.  Not at all.
Story_ID: 13164
Speaker 1: Tell us about school, now.  What was grade school like?  Where did you go?
Speaker 2: Well, I can remember--I can remember almost every teacher I had in grade school, and every school I went to.  My, my first school was, Oakenwald [South School, Chicago, Illinois].  And I went from there to--well, my first school was Oakland, then Oakenwald.  And Oakenwald in the third grade was probably my most profound experience in school.  In the third grade with Mrs. Zeller.  And I was just, probably I was in love with her, loved school, and really from that, school became just a great experience I looked forward to.  So I remember going to, Oakenwald through fifth grade.  And it was in fifth grade my mother died.  My mother died, we moved to-to my grandmother's house which is 36th [Street] and Indiana [Avenue].  And I went to Raymond Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois] for sixth grade. And then I went to [Wendell] Phillips Upper Grade Center [Chicago, Illinois] for seventh and eighth grade.  And I can remember, you know, every year in school and really enjoying it, and really beginning to understand the value of education.  I can remember doing, you know, having a spelling bee in third grade, and being the--in spelling bees you'd all stand and if you miss a word you'd sit down.  I can remember me and this one girl being the last two left.  And I can remember the word they asked me that I missed, and, that damaged me.  I never forgot that word again.  That word was 'autumn'.  And I spelled in phonetically, A-U-T-U-M, not A-U-T-U-M-N.  That was in the third grade.  But I remember that.  Remember very vividly and remember, you know, being in the third and fourth and fifth grade doing science projects where I won like first place in our school.  I did a project on an oil well, with sand and the oil coming up.  And that was a huge thing.  And I remember my teachers, you know, in fourth, fifth, and sixth grade, and each of them and their impact on, my learning.  I began to become very competitive, I think, as far as school trying to be the best, trying to do the best.  I can remember one story that I shared with an interviewer years ago--they wrote an article about me in 'Reader's Digest' [periodical] some years ago, and it was--I think it was entitled, 'You Can Do Better.'  And the quote is from my father--I think I was in, like, sixth grade or seventh--and I had never gotten a C.  But I told you about my older brother [Albert Smith, Jr.], I hate to bring him up, you know, he would just get by.  And so, this one class I got a C in, and all my other grades were higher than that.  And I came home, and my father [Albert Douglas Smith] just was totally upset.  And, you know, and I, couldn't understand.  I said to him, "You know, this is the first time I ever got a C," and "Why are you upset?"  I remember him saying, "Because you can do better."  And that was better profound for me.  I think what that said to me was that he was telling me, "You have a potential," and kind of boosted my issue of, you know, you can't do C work if your potential is higher than a C.  But that really was very profound for me.  I think that again, kind of motivated me more to do the best I could.  And I can't remember getting a C since that time.  Certainly in high school [at Robert Lindblom Technical High School, later Robert Lindblom College Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois] and whatever.  So it was, this big motivation to do well.  I think we--I saw education as a way of making my life better.  You know, using all my potential and realizing my dreams.  So education became very paramount for me, it was kind of a driving force.
Speaker 1: You pretty much set your own standard, I guess (unclear).
Speaker 2: I think I did.  I can remember my mother [Shirley Rhone Smith]--she and I talking.  I can remember a conversation--we talked about.  My goal was to be a school teacher, and how proud she would be if I would be a school teacher, and be a science teacher.  And I can remember those things.  I remember she and I talking about, you know, dreams of becoming a physician.  So I think that those things were imbedded in me early on with my parents.  And then, a lot of it then was self-nurturing, but there are also people that, you know, I look back on my life now, and I'll tell people that who say I'm successful.  And I can remember at every era of my life there were people who come into my life besides my parents who would augment and support the whole idea of excellence, achievement, being the best I could be, and in a very strategic way would not allow me to be mediocre.  And so those people became--you know now we talk about mentorship.  During those times you didn't, we didn't call it that.  That's really what it was.  There were people who mentored my life.  But I did have a lot of self-energy that was, I think, implanted in me to do well.
Speaker 1: Who were some of those people that influenced--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Mr. William Dooley, D-O-O-L-E-Y.  He owned a [Chicago] Daily [News] newspaper branch office on 36th [Street], right just west of Michigan Avenue.  And my mother died we went with my grandmother at age ten, at age ten and a half or eleven I had my first paper route.  And he was a branch owner and manager.  And he had two sons and two daughters, and I was, age-wise, right between his two sons.  So I grew up with them, and they really emphasized education.  And his older son was a very bright kid, and his younger one, too, in a different way.  So he, William Jr. and myself were always very competitive in school.
Story_ID: 13165
Speaker 1: You were talking about Mr. [William] Dooley [entrepreneur]?
Speaker 2: Mr. Dooley. Right. In fact, for years I was known as a "Dooley Boy."  Mr. Dooley was of the African American entrepreneurs in this city. He owned a Chicago [Illinois] Daily [News] newspaper branch.  So he employed a lot of young men to deliver newspapers.  And so, you know, my mother [Shirley Rhone Smith] dying was very devastating, and for the first six months or so, you know, difficult for me to function.  When I, when I met them, went to school with his sons, and then I was hired as a newspaper delivery boy.  And it was much more than a job.  It was a community and a culture.  It was young men who worked together to deliver papers in all kind of weather, and so forth, and had to deliver the papers, collect the monies, things like that, so it was our first business.  But Mr. Dooley really became a mentor.  And for some reason, maybe 'cause I went to school with his sons, he--it was almost as if he and his wife adopted me as one of their sons again.  And so I spent a lot of time in their home.  And my route became larger and larger, you know, and then I can remember my first plane trip was because we had a--they had a competition of selling subscriptions for the paper to go to the [1964] World's Fair in New York [New York].  Must be like 1967 or so.
Speaker 1: The World's Fair in--'64 [1964].
Speaker 2: '64 [1964].  '64 [1964].  This was my first plane--so, and I, and I won that trip.  And his branch also won.  So his family went, and myself, and a few others.  And I remember going to New York for the first time, and riding in an airplane.  And from that we really became very close, and I grew up with his family--in fact, we're still very close to his family.  He has since died and his wife.  But he was an influence because they had a very strong family unit, they had a very strong family tradition, they went on outings, picnics.  I was always with them, you know, so that, again, he was one of those persons--and his family--that became really for me, role models in a way--in addition to my own father [Albert Smith]--who always strove for excellence.  He was someone who was very--impactful on all the young men about going to school, staying in school.  And--so that academics was very important in that arena as well.  So it really, again, helped to shape my character--working in all kinds of weather, being responsible--collecting your monies--you know, delivering the papers on time, those kinds of things, but a very profound effect.
Story_ID: 13166
Speaker 1: Then, of course, when I started going to the--to the church [Apostolic Faith Church, Chicago, Illinois], the pastor of the church--Bishop [John] Holly and his wife--along with many of the members there, three of four of the men there who were my father's [Albert Smith] age, became mentors to me as well.  There's a gentleman and his wife, Brother Lewis Irving, who, again kinda adopted me again, and took me under their wings.  I would counsel with them and my pastor.  My pastor was a very--was very influential because in the Pentecostal Church, who believe very strongly in faith healing and so forth--as I became well-known in the church and became involved in the various activities, people had expectations for me in the church.  And so when I talked about going to medical school, for some of them it was like, "Well, you can't become a doctor because--," you know, "--we believe in God's power to heal."  But my pastor was, you know, was very intuitive, and he'd say to me, "Look, they love you, they mean well.  You stay in school."  And he would encourage me to go to school. When I wanted to become--to go to medical school, he encouraged me to apply to medical school and those kinds of things.  So, again, my pastor, the Irvings, there are others I could name--the Dooleys.  These are people who profoundly affected my life.  And all of them in a very excellent way, as far as education, faith, academics, character.  And that's why I'm a firm believer that a huge issue today for young people is the lack of older persons to affect their life.  If you don't have--I have a saying I always say--I would also use, "You cannot be what you cannot see."  If you don't see success--you don't see--you can hear people talk about success, but if you don't see people being successful, and modeling it themselves, it's hard for young people to relate to a--to words and a theory if they don't see it being acted out.  That's why I think that's one of the-the responsibilities of the former generation is to be those role models, is to model things--and I can look back now I'm grown up, and realize, you know, I had that in many, many--and I had it in a multiple number of ways that really kept me, you know, on path, gave me--gave fuel to my dreams, and really kinda acted to make me accountable for my life.

Speaker 1: Well, tell me about school, I mean, high school.  Now, you went to [Wendell] Phillips [Upper Grade Level, Chicago, Illinois] for middle school.
Speaker 2: Yes. high school was for me, was a crossroads and a culture shock.
Speaker 1: Because of--
Speaker 2: I went to [Robert] Lindblom [College Preparatory] High School [formerly Robert Lindblom Technical High School, Chicago, Illinois]
Speaker 1: There's a big difference, too, between Phillips and Lindblom.
Speaker 2: Well, we lived on 43rd [Street] and Lake Park [Avenue] in the projects.  If you're gonna go to college, at that time, you would then go to [Edward] Tilden Technical High School [Chicago, Illinois].  And my brother, in fact, went to Tilden Tech.  When I finished high school that summer, Tilden Tech became a general high school.  And Lindblom was now designated as the technical high school.  So I was going to Lindblom High School.  What I didn't know, that I had to take two buses and an 'el' [elevated train] to go to Lindblom.
Speaker 1: Now that's in Englewood [neighborhood], right?
Speaker 2: It's in Englewood.  However, back in 1963, less than 1 percent of the student population in Lindblom was African American.  And the entire neighborhood was--was Caucasian.  I can remember getting off the bus at 63rd [Street] & Wolcott [Avenue], and having to walk to 61st [Street] and Wolcott, people come out on their front porch, and throwing rocks and bottles at us. And saying, "You niggers get, get out of this neighborhood!"  Walking those two blocks to school.  Oh, it was--it was--it was very difficult.  I had never been around people other than African Americans my whole life.  And, you know--you know, there is an old saying--people don't say it as much now--that African Americans, they all look alike?  You know, that white people can't tell us apart, years ago?  Well, and we used to laugh at that.  Well, I have to admit that the first six months of high school I couldn't tell white people one from the other.  I couldn't tell Mary from Jane or Alice.  Because I had not been around them.  I realize that what that means now is that if you're not around people, you can't tell differences.  You really can't.  It took me about six months to begin to understand how each person was different.  But I would be total--I was totally confused.  So it was a cultural shock.  It was tough because it was very, very few African Americans in that school.  And even the administrators of the school, I wouldn't say they were racist. They were not racist intentionally, but--I remember the principal using terms like 'You people'.  I knew what that meant.  That meant 'We minorities'.  That was very clear.  But it was an excellent high school.  Excellent academics--I had never seen a place that had so many shops. Wood shop, metal shop, plastic shop, auto shop, all kinds of opportunities to be involved in writing, poetry, chess--it was a whole new world for me.  But, for me, it was like, great.  I mean, it was challenging--I remember the first semester I had a rough time in algebra-trig[onometry].  The first time I ever had a rough time in a math class.  But it showed me I had to really work even harder in that culture.  But I thrived in that culture.  But it was tough for us socially.  That was in the time of the '60s [1960s], and riots, and things like that.  I can remember the police being called in and having to call in buses for us to have to be bussed out of the school a couple of times when there were fights.  But it was good for me academically, and it was good for me in the long run socially.  I had to deal with the majority population for the first time on a day to day basis, and that was good.
Story_ID: 13168
Speaker 1: In terms of status in high school [Robert Lindblom College Preparatory High School, formerly Robert Lindblom Technical High School, Chicago, Illinois], did you get a chance to run for student body president or any clubs with kids?
Speaker 2: Not--not--not student body president.  Again, you know, we're the minorities, but I did participate in things like baseball.  I tried out for the baseball team.  Didn't make it, but I was a pretty good pitcher.  Played intramural sports--basketball.  I was involved in the science team, chess team, things like that.  But a big part of my social life was not the--when I'd leave school I would pretty much leave it behind, and go back to where we lived, which was totally different.  So I didn't, I didn't--I wasn't involved in a lot of the socialized parts of the school.  But some of the extracurricular we were involved in the academics.
Speaker 1: Now did you, this may seem like a odd question, but did the students dress different at Lindblom than in your own on the South Side [of Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I think they dressed better by and large.  And again, I can remember the styles from that time.  I can also remember that we didn't have a lot of money.  I tell a story about, in my church, and my family knew about these green pants.  I had--I can remember for about a year and a half I had--I had one pair of pants.  I wore them every day.  It was during that time,  part of that time.  I can remember that.  That was tough because, you know, in high school, fashion can be a pretty big thing, you know.  But I can remember during that time there were two groups of styles.  One was 'Ivy League', and one was what they called 'Gouster' [teen clothing style].  And I was called--I was 'WWIG', which stood for "Wear What I Got."  So--.
Speaker 1: We're talking about the black community, then, in terms of the 'Ivy League'.
Speaker 2: Pretty much.  Right. Right.  That was the African American community which you related to in that school.  I mean, you didn't want dress like the other culture, I mean, it would never enter your mind to do that.  They dressed differently, I mean, you know.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Jeans and plaid shirts.
Speaker 2: Jeans, and, yeah, plaid shirts, sweaters, you know, lettered sweaters, things like that, you know, we didn't wear that.  I can remember, however, in the last year getting a--getting a sweater.  That was a big thing--a Lindblom sweater, you know, that was a big thing but a--yeah, but for me, even--even within the African American culture, fashion was never a big thing for me, and I didn't really feel too much left out.  You know, that wasn't my orientation, books were.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what about parties and dating and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Not within that group.  And even in my social culture I was never a big partygoer.  I dated sparingly in high school.  I can remember one or two girlfriends.  The church for me was a huge influence.  I think when my mother [Shirley Rhone Smith] died, the church became for me a haven.  And I was just beginning to forming my own personal faith, which profoundly affected my choices and my lifestyle.  So I was never a partygoer.  My father [Albert Smith] wasn't a partygoer.  So I don't think--I think I was pretty backward in that regard.  I was what they called 'square'.  I wasn't a partier or whatever, you know.  I had a couple of girlfriends, but that was not a big part of my life, even in high school.  Wasn't until college that I began to be more social, but during high school I wasn't very--had a lot of friends.  Had a great time.
Speaker 1: Was it easy to make friends in Lindblom, or do--or was these friends from the neighborhood, basically?
Speaker 2: No, no. I developed some very, very strong friendships with mainly--with the African Americans there, but also with the other population, too.  Some very good friends.  And some very strong friendships from my high school days.  And guys who were not a part of our neighborhood who I continue to know and associate with from--throughout my adult life.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, when you were in Lindblom were you an honor student?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Most of the time I was an honor student at Lindblom.  When I graduated, I graduated with honors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was in a number of honors programs.
Story_ID: 13169
Speaker 1: So when you were on the verge of graduation [from Robert Lindblom College Preparatory High School, formerly Robert Lindblom Technical High School, Chicago, Illinois], you knew you were going to college, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that--that was difficult because, again, economically--my father [Albert Smith] had told me that, you know, he couldn't afford me going to college, I mean. So, I wanted to go to college.  I can remember my teacher talking to me about, you know, going to college and applying, but we didn't have the money for me to go.  However, I can remember about one or two weeks--maybe a little bit longer than that--maybe three weeks before graduation, one of my advisors identified a scholarship that I received that paid four years of college and I went to Chicago State, now it's called Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois], then it was Chicago Teacher's College.  But up until about two or three weeks before graduation, I didn't know I was going to go to college.  I didn't have the money to go.  My plan was then, I was going to work, and maybe go to junior college.  So it was really just the last week or two of--of high school that funds were identified for me to go to college.  And that was a little bit scary for awhile because I mean, I wanted to go to school.
Speaker 1: Who identified the money for you?
Speaker 2: I think it was one of my advisors at school who identified it, and I--they said, "You'll receive this scholarship to go to college."  Up until that time, I didn't know how I was going to go.  And it was, you know, and--it was the pay, tuition, and fees for four years.  And I went to Chicago State University.  It was Chicago Teachers' College at that time, and that's how I went.
Story_ID: 13170
Speaker 1: What was it?  Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: It was Chicago State--it was Chicago Teacher's College.  It was on 67th [Street] and Normal [Avenue] before they--I can remember being involved in a couple of the projects, from a student point of view, to design what they called the 'New Campus' on King Drive [Chicago, Illinois].  In fact, my diploma says, "Chicago State University."  It was the first diplomaed class that said, "Chicago State University" even though we had not moved formally to the new campus.  It was--my first degree is in Secondary Education in Biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How was Chicago State?  I mean, what did you--were there good teachers there that made an impression on you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I enjoyed Chicago State.  I could--it was challenging for me.  But I got acclimated pretty quickly, you know I made it pretty quickly there at Chicago, and I majored in biology.  And I did very well.  I had a B+ to an A average.  It was there in my third year in a physics class, I had a lab partner.  He was an older gentleman, and he was my--we were lab partners.  He said to me one day, he said, "You know, you're really good at science.  Why don't you go to medical school?"  And I said to him, "You know, I've dreamed about going to medical school, but I'm," said, "but I'm not going," I said, "because I don't have the money to go."  He said, " Well, I know this program that you can apply to, and if you have the grades to get in, they will pay your first two years of medical school tuition."  That's how I identified how to go to medical school.  And I applied at, I think, to ten schools through that program, and I think I got accepted at three or four medical schools and they paid--I think they paid tuition for two years, is what it was.  But then the second year of medical school I became a RA [resident assistant] in the dorm [dormitory], and that paid my tuition for the next two years.  But that's how I went to medical school because I wanted to go, but I didn't have the--again, the money to go.  But this lab partner who knew about this program I could apply to that I wasn't aware of.  But, again, a year before graduation I was able to identify it, and apply, and I had the grades to get in, and was able to go.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any aspirations to become a doctor when you were in high school or early part of college?
Speaker 2: I did.  When I was in high-you know, I knew I wanted--I knew I wanted to be a teacher.  I mean, I'm a teacher now.  My--my heart is teaching.  That's what I am.  I'm a teacher.  Even in medicine, I'm a teacher.  But I really didn't think I would be able to go to medical school.  I knew it was very expensive.  And so, I had dreams about it but I wanted to go--I wanted to go into teaching.  And, in fact, I even student-taught at [John F.] Kennedy High School [Chicago, Illinois] for my student teaching, and took all my methods courses for teaching.  But after that, I was accepted at medical school, then I realized I was going to go to medical school. But--so I had dreams about it, but didn't know if I had enough money to get to go, and really didn't think I was going to be able to.  It was just that--that, again, my end of my junior year that I begin to think, "Boy, maybe I can identify scholarships and monies and go."  And I'm glad I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--so you went to school at UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: University of Illinois.  Not really UIC.  UIC is really the undergraduate--we used to call it, Circle Campus.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I went to University of Illinois Medical School.  Abraham Lincoln School of Medicine [later the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois], which is the medical school campus, which is west of UIC.  And that was another big shock.  Here's this huge medical school, but it was also the time when they were recruiting minority students.  There were--I think there were forty-four minority students who started in my class.  One of the difficult things there was when I finished four years later, only eight of us finished in four years.
Speaker 1: Out of forty-four?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now along the way, I think, in five years and six years a few others came out.  But of that number, I think six or eight of us finished in four years.
Story_ID: 13171
Speaker 1: Now you were in Chicago [Illinois]--just to back track a little bit--you were in Chicago during the civil rights years.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] came to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Did, did you have a chance to meet him or anything?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  And, in fact, that--you know--I can remember my father [Albert Smith]--all, of course, Chicago policemen were called in on extra duty during those times.  They were all on alert, they were all on extra duty.  And I remember him telling us to stay away from those areas 'cause of the--potential for violence, and to see the city's reaction in Marquette Park [neighborhood] to Martin Luther King Jr. [King and his followers were harassed and assaulted by white residents as they marched to protest discriminatory housing practices in July 10, 1966] and so forth.  And so, I never met him.  I was aware of what that was going on, but I was not really a participant in it.  In fact, my father would have discouraged that.
Speaker 1: Marquette Park was not that far from [Robert] Lindblom [College Preparatory High School, formerly Robert Lindblom Technical High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: You didn't--you didn't, as an African American, you did not go into Marquette Park.  You did not go past Ashland Avenue.  Well, you didn't go past Western [Avenue].  Probably Ashland, yeah.  I can remember those--I had an experience when we were about twelve.  And, I don't know if you are familiar with Riverview Park [amusement park].  Riverview Park is--is like [Six Flags] Great America to us today--the amusement park.  But it was at Western and Belmont [Avenue].  I can remember my brother and I, and some other young guys, our vacation every year was to go to Riverview Park for a day.  And, I remember us going there--I must have been about eleven years old--and my brother was the leader of the group.  And we were at the park, and we were having a great time.  And we always had to save enough money to get on the bus to go back 'cause there were two buses to take to go home.  My brother told me, "Don't worry about that.  You don't have to have money to go back on the bus." But I'm kinda the good little boy, didn't understand that. So I spent all my money, and he did too.  And so we--we snuck on the back of the bus, 'cause it was a huge crowd.  What we didn't realize was that the bus what was at Western and Belmont, so the bus goes to 39th [Street] and Western.  What we didn't realize that we got off at Western, there's another bus, there is no crowd.  So we couldn't get on the bus.  Now we're terrified.  We're in this neighborhood, that we don't know anybody.  It's totally white.  And we had to walk--can you imaging being eleven years old, having to walk from Western and 39th Street all the way over to well, past State Street.  I mean that--it was like, to us, almost unsurmountable even to walk that far [three miles].  Well, we got chased four or five times by people, literally, who called us "niggers" and threw things at us.  I have never been as terrified in my whole life.  So I can remember going through those neighborhoods and being deathly afraid, and, you know, crying, then walking and running and being chased.  So, you know, it gave me a background of understanding.  You know, you don't go in certain neighborhoods.  And during the time of Martin Luther King, I can remember my father saying, you know, "Don't go near there, don't go, don't participate."  You know, and that was discouraged even in our church [Apostolic Faith Church, Chicago, Illinois].  And our church was very conservative, you know.  It was not thought to be Christian to be involved in some of those things, in the protests and whatever.  So from both sides I was discouraged to be really a part of what was going on then.
Speaker 1: What denomination were you in?
Speaker 2: This--our--it is really Pentecostal.  It is the Apostolic Faith Church.  But it is a Pentecostal church.  'Cause I remember--well, Bishop [Arthur M.] Brazier, who was one of the elders of our--not our particular church, but in the same denomination--he was very much involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  He marched with King and so forth.  He was involved in organizing.  And he was ostracized within his own denomination for doing that as a minister.
Speaker 1: That was the same kind of dilemma Dr. King himself was in the same kid of dilemma with the Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  So yeah, I remember King coming.  I remember those times, but I did not participate in those activities.
Story_ID: 13172
Speaker 1: Now, did you follow the Civil Rights Movement sorta, or did you keep it--?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  Followed it, you know, again, I'm an avid reader.  I would read one or two newspapers every day, and I followed up with it point by point in what was going on.  And the different court decisions, the March on Washington [1963], and all those things with me were huge.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what you were doing when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed?
Speaker 2: Yes. I remember--he was killed in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: You were in college, a freshman.
Speaker 2: I was in college.  It was my second year of college [at Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].  I remember being at college when he, when he, when he was shot.  It was devastaing.  Like you'd had lost a parent.  Very dark days.
Speaker 1: All right, did the students do anything special?
Speaker 2: We didn't.  I don't remember us doing anything in particular.  I think there was a moment of silence, things like that.  But I don't remember us doing--I can, I can remember the controversy about, talking about making his--his birthday a holiday.  And how most people were against it on the other side.
Speaker 1: Were you affected by the riots [in Chicago following King's assassination in 1968], being a commuter student and all that?
Speaker 2: Somewhat.  You know, but it was mainly on the West Side, somewhat on the South Side.  I remember the riots, remember the neighborhoods being burned.  What I remember most of all is the feeling of hopelessness and despair from when [U.S. President John F.] Kennedy was killed [1963] and King, and then [U.S. Senator] Robert [F.] Kennedy [assassinated in 1968]. Yeah, those were days of despair.  Like light was being dimmed.  Tough times--very tough.
Story_ID: 13173
Speaker 1: Now, we're going to take you back to medical school [Abraham Lincoln School of Medicine, later the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois].  Well, you said it was a challenging but--.
Speaker 2: Very rigorous.  I was not prepared for it.  When I say I was not prepared for it, I was not prepared for--I don't think medical school, to me, conceptually is that difficult.  But the volume of material is almost insurmountable.  I mean, to have to read a hundred pages of biochemistry, and a hundred pages of biology, and microbiology, and histology, and anatomy, all at the same time, was overwhelming.  The amount--the workload was just overwhelming.  The other part I realized soon after that, was that within our class, most of the students had a background in biology--had either parents, uncles, cousins who were in medicine, you know.  My father [Albert Smith] was a cab driver and a policeman.  And nobody in my family had gone to college.  So I think that, even though I was a great student and undergrad, and so forth, even academically, I realized I had to really study many, many more hours.  And I can remember the first couple of years being just--I don't know, a lot of motivation was fear--fear of failure, a fear of not doing well, you know.  And I can remember being up in anatomy lab at one in the morning studying the human body, and up to two or three in the morning reading, you know, histology and biochemistry over and over again.  Because I realize that it was high echelon learning, and it was just so much material that it could be overwhelming.  But I enjoyed it.  Again, you know, it's kind of a dichotomy.  It was tough, I was frightened, but I was focused, too.  And I had a lot of support from my family--from my church [Apostolic Faith Church, Chicago, Illinois]--who were very proud of me.  And so, it was a motivation, but--but it was tough.
Story_ID: 13174
Speaker 1: So, what was the toughest part of medical school for you?
Speaker 2: Boy, I think the toughest part was biochemistry.  Toughest part was in the University of Illinois [Abraham Lincoln School of Medicine, later the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois] medical school is a little bit different than many medical schools, in that they had, they had in my time what was called comprehensives. So, in medical schools you take national board examinations.  And these examinations that are, you know, national standards.  And they're all the same for all medical schools.  And it's the way they, evaluate you.  However, in some schools, like where I went, they had comprehensives [examinations].  So you could pass national boards, but if you didn't pass their comprehensives you would not get a diploma.  And that's what it was, it was a comp [comprehensive examination], it was a comp.  So the first year was a first year comp.  Which meant you had to learn--had to remember everything of the basic science of the first year.  It was the toughest part of the curriculum.  Everyone knew that. The first--if you could get a first year comps, you could do anything.  You could walk on water.  And so, it was really challenging.  That's where many people really were delayed in their education, or didn't make it because of first year comps.  So that was tough because it combines biochemistry, histology, anatomy, physiology, all the basic sciences.  So that was tough for me, and, but I got through it.  And it made me a better student.  Because you had to retain all that information and be able to share it back in a comprehensive way.
Speaker 1: Did you form alliances to study with other students?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Oh, yeah, we had study groups.  I don't think you could make it without being in a study group.  I was in more than one study group.  There were study groups for different things.  Some were general study groups, some were study groups for like, anatomy.  Like there were--in the anatomy, gross anatomy lab, there were like--in our school there was about four hundred students.  There were a one hundred bodies, there were four students per body.  And throughout the year you had to dissect the body completely, each organ system, and know every structure, every muscle, nerve ending, you know, organ, and so forth. And so that was a study group you had, too.  And you could go up to the lab--I can remember, you know, getting over the fear of dead bodies very quickly.  Because, you know, if you wanted to really study it, you had to go up there by yourself, in the lab, pull the body out and study it.  So that, for some people that was very challenging.  I got over that very quickly.  So we had different study groups, and they were your, life link to different parts of the curriculum.  And that helped a lot.  So you--you formed alliances with people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did mainly the black students study together, or what (unclear)?
Speaker 2: There was a lot of that, that kind of grouping.  But some of us were part of, a wider study group as well, you know.  But a lot of it was cultural, and with your cultural group, your ethnic group.
Story_ID: 13175
Speaker 1: That was there ever a time--or can you tell me about a time when you thought about just giving up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I can remember preparing for first year comps [comprehensive examinations] and thinking I can't do this, you know, it's just too much.  And would get discouraged.  It would be then, you know, I would go to church and be encouraged.  That was my life link there.  And again, the people in my life, "You know you can do this," you know.  "You have the tools to do it."  And then, not always believing in myself, but having those who would, you know, encourage me to re-believe and to believe.  But you know how it is from discouraging dark times, you know, being discouraged and--I mean, you have to regroup.  I think one of the real issues of successful life is that you gotta be persistent.  It's not going to always be victory and success.  That's not realistic.  There's a Bible verse that says something like, "It was good for me to be afflicted."  Sometimes it's good to fail.  Failure, I think, teach you whether you really want it or not; and make you regroup, re--look at it, and go at it again.  And so, I can remember those times.  Not doing well on an exam, you know, and then wondering, you know, am I really cut out to do this?  Can I compete with these other people?  You know, can I really make the grade?  There's always that self-doubt, even though you've had success, you know.  But you also had some bumps in the road where you wonder, can you do it.
Speaker 1: How did you feel when you knew you were gonna finish and did you have a, well how did you feel?
Speaker 2: Oh boy, I felt fantastic.  I--you know, I think you know you-when you get to your second year, in your second year you've been to clinicals, you know you're going to make it.  There is--the rate there is like 99.9 percent, if you make it that far, you're going to make it.  You're going to graduate, you're going to--and you knew that then.  Now, there are challenges that--because the challenges then are more clinical, you then began to see patients, and you're really evaluated by your patient load, and your ability to do a good history physical.  Your ability to put together information systematically, come up with a differential diagnosis, those kind of things.  Figure out clinical issues in problems.  And for me that's very--that's the very exciting part of medicine.  It was like problem solving, you know.  That's the fun part for most of us who are physicians.  But you, I mean you feel like you're on top of the world.  You feel like you can do anything.  I remember those days, too.  I remember, you know, being on the wards, and being a raw student.  I remember when I began to, become more experienced and feel much more able to do the work, and, you know, that feeling of accomplishment. You know, I can remember starting my first IV by myself.  I can remember doing my first procedure, you know, bone marrow, spinal tap.  I can remember all those things.  And those are times when you really get that real jolt of adrenaline that says boy I can do this!  And the endorphins kick in, and you know you can make it.  Very exciting times.  Very encouraging times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You passed the medical boards [examinations] in '78 [1978] I believe it was?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I finished medical school [Abraham Lincoln School of Medicine, later the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois] in '75 [1975].  In medical boards there is a number of boards that you take.  So, yeah, but the first two to get your license are the ones that you take--boards part one and boards part two.  I think I did boards part two and--see I finished medical school in '75 [1975], then I did a three year residency, and you take your third-your boards part three rather, your first year residency.  So that must have been 19--yeah, 78 [1978].  After my third year residency.  I'm getting a little bit mixed up.  You take your other boards after your residency.  So I took it after my first year, which would've been 19-let's see-75 [1975], '78 [1978]--about '77 [1977], yeah.
Story_ID: 13176
Speaker 1: Now, throughout the '70s [1970s]. I guess beginning around '72 [1972] or '73 [1973] people began to talk about sickle cell anemia, it got a lot of media, and you, in a sense, had become an expert in a sickle cell anemia.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: How did, did you first hear about it then, or had you known about it before?
Speaker 2: Well, when I went to medical school [Abraham Lincoln School of Medicine, later the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois] in 1971, after my second year, one of my professors was Dr. George Hoenig who then became my true mentor and the one that kind of guided me through hematology.  He was a hematologist.  Really a world-renowned hematologist, and he was, in fact, was called a hemoglobinopathist which is the study of hemoglobins, sickle cell is an abnormal hemoglobin.  So I knew about sickle cell early on in my medical school career, and had an interest in hematology.  So I remember when in the early '70s [1970s] and the talk about people being screened.  And it was very controversial, I mean, if you can understand that.  Because sickle cell disease was--is mainly seen in persons of African descent.  Being screened for it sounds like a good idea, however, in the African American community there was hue and cry against it.  Because people didn't want to be identified.  They thought, "If I get screened, and I'm positive--," how will it affect their insurance history, how will it effect their work history and so forth.  So, even though we had the tools to screen people, to identify the disease early on, it was not very popular in the community.  And so the interest in, in it kind of died, as far as screening itself.  In fact, screening didn't really then occur in Illinois until 1989.
Story_ID: 13177
Speaker 1: There was a lot of controversy about it as I recall.  'Tony Brown's Journal' [public television program] did a whole piece on it early on.  Part of the controversy was that people felt that it may be a sign of inferiority to have this disease that just affects black people.
Speaker 2: Yes, but of course you know, those, a lot of those are half-truths.  First of all, it does not affect just black people.  I have white patients who have sickle cell disease. Even by where sickle--the sickle cell gene is most prevalent anywhere in the world where malaria is endemic the sickle gene can be found.  Because, in fact, to carry one copy of the gene gives you protection against malaria.  So, in fact, it is a mutation that if you have it, protects you if you're in and endemic area for malaria.  So that persons of Greek, Italian, as well as African descent, Indian, East Indian, Pakistani, can have sickle cell.  Hispanics can have sickle cell.  But it is most prevalent in persons of African descent.  So, the first part is that anybody can have the sickle cell gene, even though it is most prevalent in African Americans.  Number two, I'm not really quite sure about the whole issue of inferiority, because if you carry the trait, as we know it now, it does not affect you clinically at all with one or two small caveats.  To have the disease, of course, means you have a chronic disease.  Does that cause you to be inferior?  Not inferior, but it does give you a chronic disease that can affect literally every organ in the system, including your brain, including your liver, including your spleen, your lungs, and so forth.  So, you have a chronic pain syndrome.  You have a syndrome that can cause you to be in the hospital on a regular basis.  So any chronic disease is going to effect the person's life in a negative way.
Speaker 1: Some of the talk (unclear)--,
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --people had fears about it--.
Speaker 2: People were very afraid that if they got identified, even to carry the trait, which does not carry the disease, you'd be labeled as having a problem, and not be hired, not be insured, you know, not have certain jobs.  Lot of fear.
Story_ID: 13178
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, they never--I don't think it [widespread fear over sickle cell anemia] ever got off, the ground, because there were no--there were no broad range screening programs.  There were some areas in communities that did screening, but it was never, it was not widespread.  And so, there was no chance for it I think to be used in a broad way, in a negative or in a positive way.  Now, almost every state in the union persons are screened for not only for sickle cell, for hemoglobinopathies, in general.  And it's--it definitely has improved the quality of life of persons with the disease because you're identified early on, you can get treatment that is appropriate early on in life, and it makes a huge difference as far as your long-term prognosis.  But is has to be used by people who understand the disease, understand its ramifications as well.
Speaker 2: Now, why did you get involved in the treatment of sickle cell?
Speaker 1: Well, again, my interest in medicine has been, from the beginning, hematology.  And I am by trade a hematologist oncologist in pediatrics.  And that is the study of and the care of people, young adults and children with blood diseases and cancer.  So that sickle cell is one of groups of diseases or hemoglobinopathies that a hematologist would deal with.  And that's been one of my interests from the very beginning in hematology oncology.  And in specific, in sickle cell and what is called thalassemia.  Those two areas.
Speaker 2: Has the treatment for sickle cell improved over the years?  I mean, what are the symptoms of sickle cell crisis?  I think of, then to, you can have the trait but not be sick.  But then you can have the disease.
Speaker 1: Well, in fact, the--you carry--everyone carries two basic genes for hemoglobin.  You can have one gene that's a sickle gene you carry.  It's called the trait.  And again, the trait, by and large, does not carry any clinical significance.  You can have the trait all your life and never know it, because you're healthy.  You're not anemic, you don't have pain crisis, you don't get infections.  It's only when you have two abnormal copies of the gene, do you have the disease.  Having said that, you can have the disease and not be sick.  There are persons with sickle cell disease who have never been hospitalized.  So even though we talk about sickle cell disease, like any other disease, there are permeations, there are people with very severe clinical manifestations, there are those with very mild clinical manifestations.  So it kind of depends on where you're fit.  And there are some persons who are hospitalized on a regular basis.  Now, the treatment, however, having said that for those who are the most severely affected has improved, in my estimation, greatly.  There are now medical treatments that can allow you to ameliorate the effects of this disease.  And some of the newer studies and newer treatments, I think, can in fact prevent you from having major complications. And those are being studied clinically, and those are being applied clinically, and people have benefited from those research projects.
Story_ID: 13179
Speaker 1: There was a rush to try to find something to cure it [sickle cell anemia] at one point.  It was highly publicized cases of one thing or another.  I remember there was a chew stick from Nigeria that was being imported over here, and a claim that--there was a claim that it would cure the disease.
Speaker 2: Well, and even today, there's not six months that goes by that you don't hear about a quote unquote "cure" whether it's homeopathic, or organic medicine, as well as some of the newer medicines that are being developed.  You know, quote unquote "cures."  But there is no cure presently for sickle cell disease other than bone marrow transplant.  Now, bone marrow transplant is a cure, or can be a cure.  But bone marrow transplant, number one, you have to have ideally a brother or sister who is a, what's called an HLA [human leukocyte antigens] match.  HLA is a certain group of genes that affect any transplant.  So if you have a brother or sister who had these six genes in the HLA region like you do, then they could become a donor.  But if you look at statistics, only one out of three of any persons has a sibling who is an HLA identical match.  So number one, only a third of persons across the board has that person as a match.  Then, having said that, the operation itself, bone marrow transplant, does carry significant risks and some people can die from the transplant.  So, even though you may have a match sibling, if you have a mild disease you may opt not to have a bone marrow transplant.  So bone marrow transplant is a cure now, and they're working on other areas, looking at you know, really the whole human genome process gives great hope for sickle cell because sickle cell is a genetic mutation, and there will be a cure genetically for sickle cell disease.  That cure is down the road, but it will occur.  And there is some medicines I think that are excellent as far as minimizing the effects of sickle cell, and in some cases preventing the effects.
Story_ID: 13180
Speaker 1: Does sickle cell [anemia] account for a large number of deaths these days?
Speaker 2: Well, relatively it does.  The prevalence, one out of four hundred births in Chicago [Illinois] of babies have sickle cell disease.  The mortality for sickle cell has, thank God, decreased over the last twenty years.  When I was in training in the '70s [1970s], the mortality for young children with sickle cell disease in the first five years of life was about 20 percent.  One out of five would die.  Now, with early identification, proper treatment and care, that risk is less than 3 percent of death in the first five years.  So, again, I think what's critical here is that people are identified early on and that they get the proper treatment for their disease.
Speaker 1: So children at the most risk of premature death (unclear) from sickle cell.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The first two years of life, the major cause of death is infection.  So that infection early on is the highest risk of death.  After that, when you get into your second decade of life and so forth, there're other causes of death.  Mainly lung disease, some call it acute chest syndrome, which is sickling in the lungs and infection or a combination, stroke, neurologic complications, somewhat less cardiac than others.
Story_ID: 13181
Speaker 1: So, I can remember being a senior student in hematology oncology, and caring for a child with leukemia, or common ALL [acute lymphoblastic leukemia].  And the prognosis at that time only--more than 85 percent of those children would die in the first three years from their leukemia.  And today's medicine, however, less than 5 percent of children would die from common ALL.  Having said that, there are other cancers and one thing that the general public may know about is that in hematology oncology there are many different kinds of cancer.  People use the term--cancer is almost a layman's term.  People say, "Oh, he had cancer."  Well to a hematologist he would say, "Well, what type?"  There are hundreds of different types of cancer.  So cancer itself to us doesn't mean a whole lot. It depends upon, you know, its cell of origin what type it is.  So I've seen tremendous advances in most cancers in children.  I've seen tremendous advances in a lot of the hematological abnormalities in children.  So it has been very satisfying to see the improvements in care, in treatments, in cures, and so forth.  Having said that, the whole field is still one where children get sick and die.  Both from sickle cell, thalassemia, other hematological abnormalities, and cancer.  And so, there's still a great deal of work that needs to be done in those areas.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now you've been director of the center for--what do you call the center?
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm the director of the Comprehensive Hemoglobinopathy Program at Children's [Memorial] Hospital [Chicago, Illinois] which includes sickleing diseases and something called thalassemias.  I've been the director there for over thirteen years.  And we deal with families whose children have a sickling syndrome or thalassemia, which is another chronic anemic syndrome.  And we've been directing that program, as I said, for a number of years.  And many of those families we got to know from one, two, and three generations.  Which has been very fulfilling for me.
Story_ID: 13182
Speaker 1: Now this is intense work but you've also found time to become a pastor?
Speaker 2: Yes, boy.  I became the pastor of the Apostolic Faith Church [Chicago, Illinois] in 1980 just as I finished my fellowship in hematology oncology.  The church at that time was relatively small.  Less than two hundred members.  The first, in fact, the first four or five years of my pastorate I was not on a full time staff at Children's [Memorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] because I was focused mainly on the work of the church.  I was still on staff at Children's as a volunteer attendant.
Speaker 1: Why did you become a pastor?  I mean, how did this happen?
Speaker 2: That's a long story.  The church where, that I'm a part of, I was involved in its ministry.  Again, I'm a teacher by training, and by degree.  So I've always been involved in every area of the church, but not the preaching ministry.  I was involved heavily in the youth ministry, music ministry, and the teaching ministry.  But I really felt the call to the preaching ministry, oh, about a year before our pastor [Bishop John Holly] died.  And I became a licensed minister in our organization.  And then it still attended to focus on the teaching ministry.  Our pastor of fifty-three years died in 1979, and the assistant pastor who was his son was the Interim Pastor.  I was very involved in the church, but had no desire to become a pastor, was very satisfied with doing my medical work and involved in other parts of the church.  The church went into leadership crisis.  Some of the board members and other persons there felt through prayer and so forth that I would become their pastor.  I didn't feel that way and when they approached me about considering running for the pastorate--in our church there is an election that's held, and a person who is a minister can run to become the pastor.  I had really no desire to do that, but the board, a couple of board members asked me to pray about it, and that's why I kind of, got caught.  Because I believe very strongly in spirituality and prayer, that my life is not mine.  It belongs to God.  I felt that most of my adult life in growing up in the church.  As I prayed about it, I was really conflicted because on one hand, I didn't feel I was called to the pastorate, on the other hand, I felt I had to be available to what God wanted.  The church was going through some difficult times and we were going to have that was going to have an election that was going to include eight or nine candidates, most of which were my teachers in the church.  But I really, you know, felt after prayer and with consultation with various ones that I was supposed to at least run and I became the pastor.  It's a long story.  And I became the pastor of the church during that time in 1980, in March of 1980.
Story_ID: 13183
Speaker 1: Again, the church [Apostolic Faith Church, Chicago, Illinois] was relatively, of a relative size.  I could still do some medicine, and as the church began to grow, however, it began to be a challenge.  And, I can remember that we really felt we had to build a new church, and that church building probably began in 19--well, the design phase began in 1983.  We actually broke ground in 1985, and the church was built by '87 [1987].  But we felt very bad because I wanted to take the lead in giving toward that building.  Our church has a very strong history of not believing in long-term debt.  And this church would cost about three million dollars.  And I was not able with my church salary to lead in giving.  It was at that time when the hospital [Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] called me and asked me to come back on a full-time basis.  I told them I couldn't.  And they looked at me, "Well, why can't you?"  I said, "Well, you know I'm involved in the ministry now."  'Cause of--they really--a little regression--they groomed me to become a full time hematologist.  They were very taken aback when I became the pastor of the church, which in some ways curtailed my medical activities.  So for--there was a hiatus every two or three years, and they called me and said, "We really want you back in the program.  We--you are a excellent teacher." And I had to tell them what it meant to be a pastor.  I said, "It means, you know, I can't take night call."  They said to me, "Fine."  I said, "I can't work on weekends."  They said, "Fine."  And so they really made me a contract to allow me to give a certain number of hours at the hospital and--but did not impede my pastoral work.  Well, over the years the church has grown, and now it's greater than three thousand families.  So that it is really impacted my abilities in my mind to do them both.  Even though I'm still at the hospital twenty hours a week--that's my stated time--I'm usually there more than that.  It's become increasingly difficult to give the proper time to both.  So I--I'm conflicted in that regard, even though I do have specific duties at the hospital, even those specifics now are difficult to do those as well as be a pastor of the church, and I'm also a bishop in our organization. And I have my own diocese, which is about fifty-three churches in Kansas, Colorado, and Missouri that I'm responsible for as far as being a mentor and a leader for those fifty-four pastors and their leaders.  So, it is quite challenging.  I've had to learn the discipline of schedule, I've had to learn priority.  And even with that, I'm always in the dilemma of, you know, how long can I continue to do what I'm doing at this level.
Story_ID: 13184
Speaker 1: ...They are alive at Christ's second coming, they will not die.  They will be raptured.  So a part of that is, that there is a fervent hope--and the Bible teaches that--to be alive during the rapture.  Therefore you will not die.  So even though we know, in part, that we will probably all die, but if Christ comes in our lifetime, we won't.  So that--that begins to say that the issue of eternal life could be that I will not die physically.  That's number one.  Number two--since Christ did heal, there is some expectation to believe that Christ still heals.  And I believe that God does heal.  I believe in miracles.  I believe that people are miraculously healed.  I've had cases where as physicians we would say, "This medicine has failed.  This has failed, this person is going to die," and they didn't.  We don't know how to explain that, and some would say, "Well, that's because something else happened in their body, they got better."  Well, you can call it whatever you want to.  I do believe in miracles.  However, I don't believe that the scriptures teach us to rely on God for our health and our healing.  I think that it teaches us that God is the originator of all knowledge, and any knowledge that we have as human beings, I believe, comes from God.  I use an analogy--you know, there is a story about the people of Israel crossing--crossing the Red Sea.  And I tell people, "Well, if there had been a bridge, then God would not have parted the Red Sea."  In other words, if the knowledge was there for a bridge, there's no need for a miracle.  So where God gives us knowledge, I believe that we are responsible to use that knowledge.  And in issues of health, preventive medicine, healthy lifestyles, all those things, we have an obligation as Christians to utilize the knowledge God has given us.  Now, having said that, does God heal miraculously?  Yes, he does.  Should it be a daily expectation?  I think that's misguided, and I think that that medicine and theology is totally compatible.  But again, going back to my origin, by some persons in the church [Apostolic Faith Church, Chicago, Illinois], I was discouraged from becoming a pastor because they believed in faith healing and then in their perspective, there was incompatibility between being a physician and trusting God.  I don't think that exists.  I think that medicine and spirituality--in fact, I make a statement sometimes that I believe that persons who are true scientists have the greatest chance to be the strongest believers in faith, because, when I study the human condition, and I know how the body is designed, I would have to be a fool to believe it happened by chance.  It's like saying if you see a [Boeing] 747 [airplane] in the sky, it evolved.  You know, good and well, what the millions of parts of that plane--each part was designed for a purpose.  That says there is a designer for it, not by evolution.  I believe that we were designed by God, and that's why the human body is the most tremendous masterpiece on earth.  To say it evolved takes--it's a far reach.  It's a real reach.  Even those that are true scientists know that the issues of evolution--I believe in evolution to a degree.  But when you go back to first causes, we as scientists have no, no clues.  You know, people talk about, you know, recently, the Big Bang theory--that the universe began with a big bang.  Okay, fine.  How did the Big Bang start?  There is no logical explanations for our existence.  There are none.  When you go back to the earliest archaeological findings, you have to start with something.  If you start with--and I learned in school that we started as single celled creatures.  Okay, fine.  So where did the single cell come from?  Well, it came from carbon atoms.  All right.  Where did the carbon atom come from?
Speaker 2: But is it--is it just as easy to imagine nothing?
Speaker 1: Well, it is difficult for the human mind to imagine nothing, because nothing means just that.  Nothing.  You cannot imagine nothing.  It doesn't exist.  Nothing does not exist.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) It's hard to objectify nothing, because it's nothing to compare it to.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Exactly.  So people who laugh at people who have faith in a god, I think, are totally misguided, because they themselves have no explanation.  They just choose to believe there is no God.  All right.  But they have no explanation, and there is no scientific data to substantiate the origin of what we are.  There is none.  When I say there is none--what we have is limited.  We cannot explain it.
Speaker 2: So the trail can only go back--goes back so far.
Speaker 1: We can only go back so far, and then, we don't know.  Now people have said that as science progresses, you know, we--you know, fifty years ago, a hundred years ago, we didn't know about antibiotics.  Now we do.  And they would say, "Well, so, in centuries to come we'll explain all--answer all questions."  I don't believe that for one moment.  It is not logical to believe that.  I think that true scientists who see the wonder of the human condition have to conclude--there's got to be a designer.  I mean, we're too perfect.  The human body is too wonderful.  I mean, even the immune system, you know, with HIV [Human Immunodeficiency Virus] and all the research into the immune system, we've discovered things that would just blow your mind.  How a cell that you lack, a type of cell that you lack, when you lack that cell, then other transmitters can tell that cell to become a different cell.  That's all by chance?  Boy!  What--what's the chance of that?  You have a better chance of going and winning the roulette wheel in Las Vegas [Nevada].  So I'm just saying that I--as a scientist, as a man of faith--I don't find a lot of incompatibility.
Story_ID: 13185
Speaker 1: Now I have some unanswered questions for sure that I wonder about, that I ponder.
Speaker 2: Like what for instance?
Speaker 1: Like--age-old questions.  Why, why do children suffer?  Why do quote unquote "innocent people suffer"--although I have answers to those too, because there are no--you know, when I say innocent, you know again, the world is not fair for anyone.  But I think that there are things that as--as a compassionate human being, you have no answer to.  Last week, you know, a drunk driver runs off the road and kills two adults and two children.  There is no answer to that.  There is no spiritual answer to that.  There is no faith answer to that.  There is no academic answer--I don't know those answers.  I am confident, though, that there are answers.  I am confident that God will give us those answers.  But we don't have them.  Does that negate my faith?  I don't think so.  Does it negate my ability to reason as a scientist?  I don't think so.
Story_ID: 13186
Speaker 1: Do you think it matters in terms of faith, I mean, do you see that people who believe that they're going to get better, get better basically?  Does it have to do with specific belief systems that they're--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well, I don't know if you can say that.
Speaker 1: Or is it frame of mind?
Speaker 2: In the last ten years one of the things I've studied in this whole arena of--there's a book called 'The Faith Factor' [by Dale A. Matthews] that looks into the outcomes as well as it can, of persons with various conditions, diseases, and tries to compare those who have faith--and it's not a specific faith--it's a faith in a god and so forth, versus those who don't.  There is no question that peoples' outcome are affected in part by their faith orientation, by their life outlook.  There have been some nationally, federally funded programs--and the funding becomes increased every year--looking at issues like, what is the role of prayer in medicine?  What's the role of prayer in disease outcome, what--and the NIH [National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland] and others have sponsored some of these conventions and programs to look into the whole issue of spirituality in medicine.  Because we, as physicians, know that there are some factors beyond what we can measure that affect peoples' outcomes.  So yes, I believe that a person's faith--look at things like quality of life, longevity, peoples' belief systems and their faith--in some measure, studies do show a positive outcome.
Speaker 1: Is there--is there a story that comes to mind on account of your experience that could kind of dramatize this--.
Speaker 2: Well, I--I--there's a couple of them.  One young man who has since died--I took care of--I don't know if I can use his name or not.  But he was diagnosed with cancer as an eighteen-month old in another institution.  Came to ours and he was treated at Children's [Memorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] with the latest medicine and so forth, and he relapsed, was retreated again with experimental medicines, he relapsed.  At one point as I took care of him, he was, he was, he had gotten more of this newer medicine than anybody in the world had ever gotten.  Went off the medicine, was doing well, and relapsed.  And then, with some general treatment, went into remission and stayed in remission for fifteen years.  Unexplainable.  Now, his parents are very spiritual.  Took him to church, believed in the power of God.  My colleagues told me when he relapsed the second time--and they said to me, in effect, "You need to begin to disconnect, at least emotionally from this kid."  What they were saying to me was that don't become so attached, because you know he going to die.  I mean he is going to die.  And--and in my mind, yes, he was--I mean if I'd all of the issues that I understood about his prognosis, he was going to die.  There was no question about it.  But he didn't.  At least for those fifteen years he didn't.  Unexplainable.  We cannot explain it from the medicine.  He had failed the treatments. Unexplainable.
Speaker 1: Did he eventually die with it?
Speaker 2: No, he then had a third cancer he developed which--one of the long-term effects of intensive chemotherapy that is repetitive, there is a higher risk of developing a secondary cancer.  His developed something called AML [acute myeloid leukemia] which was probably was a direct link to years ago, having been treated at least on four or five different occasions in a very intensive way.  And he contracted that from that and he died.  But his original cancer stayed in remission and did not come back after the fourth time which--unexplainable.  That faith--was faith a determining factor there?  Well, I'll tell you this.  We didn't--we don't understand medically how it happened.  And there are other cases where we had people on respirators and we took them off, knew they were going to die, and they didn't.  They recovered.  But again, those are what we call, anecdotal cases.  And a true scientist would say without a controlled study you cannot say definitely that this is what made it better, or that made it worse or so forth.  So, you know, there are no controlled studies, however, having said that, I think, if you survey patients across the board--they, patients probably--one year I was doing some research in, three years ago--patients want physicians to talk to them about their faith.  As a whole, physicians are very reluctant to talk to the patient about their faith.  They see that as being a conflict.  One of the areas we are looking at in medicine is that how do you improve medicine?  Well one way you improve medicine is that if the-if the physician is a better communicator with the patient, he can relate to the patient, he can do a better job with those patients.  But then you have this bugaboo where patients want physicians to ask them about--I mean we--we take a history from a patient, supposed to ask them everything: their sexuality, their drug use, all those things.  But not their faith.  But if you ask patients, "Do you want your physician to ask you about your faith?"  The patients will say, "Yes.  I want them to know that that's a part of my life, too," and if they can make that relevant to their treatments, they want that.  But in formal medicine that's like a taboo.  But I think that those walls are being pushed further away where we're beginning to realize that you can practice--let me reword that--I don't--I don't try to--I don't try to introduce my patients to my faith.  I think that is--that is an intrusion.  But there are some of my patients who choose me because of my faith.  And their confidence in me--not only because I'm a physician, but because they know I have faith in God.  And they will ask me, "Will you pray for my son or daughter here in the room?"  Should I deny that?  No.  I pray for them.  And they believe, and I believe that's a part of our relationship.  I think those walls are being pushed back because there are dimensions of medicine that go beyond what we can quantify.

Speaker 1: Do you feel more doctor than--than minister or vice-versa?
Speaker 2: (Laughs) It depends on the setting, you know.  People asked, have asked me a different question, you know, if you have to choose--and it becomes increasingly apparent that I'm going to have to choose in some way--my choice is always clear. My call to the ministry supersedes my call to medicine.  However, the reason I've been in medicine so long is that I believe medicine is also a calling.  I don't believe you can--medicine really is not a job.  If it's a job to you, you're not going to do a good job.  You're not going to the job you really could do.  It's a calling.  It can't be a job.  And so I feel very strongly about both, and I believe I've made an impact, and continue to, in both areas, and so my impact is valuable.  So I don't minimize either one.  But if I'm forced to choose I will, today, then I choose the pastorate because of the effect in people across the board.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: For the black community?  Boy!  One of my hopes and concerns is--I mentioned a little bit before--is that we take better ownership for our future.  And what I mean by that, is that I understand issues of inequities, I understand institutional racism, I understand those things.  But I believe that we have to foster genuine black mentorship, leadership. I think we have to face the issue of the black family.  I think that many of our ills are because of poverty, and much of that is because of the lack of the male in the home, and much of that is because we're not prepared academically, and so we have to start early to keep our young people in education, in academics--and a part of that is again, this intangible of parents--male and female mentors who they can see.  If you look at statistics about single parent homes in the African American community, I think it's abysmal.  I think it's a terrible statistic of the lack of black males in the family.  And I'm not against women raising children.  I think it's a bad idea.  I think that it is inherently flawed.  Children need father and mother, and, I think in my own case--I look at my dad [Albert Smith] who insisted on things in my life.  Could my mother [Shirley Rhone Smith] have done that?  Sure she could have, but there is no question that men make a difference, and when you--when the man's not there, if you look at women and their ability to raise a family, their economic condition, they're always struggling.  I think that we start behind, so we have to begin to address family values, and reaffirm the value of the family.  We have to reaffirm the issue of education.  You know in some sectors of our--of our community, you know, to speak properly is to be--try to be white.  That's a terrible negative self-assessment.  So to speak properly is to be black?  I mean to speak--I mean to speak broken English is to be black?  Or to be ignorant is to be black?  I think that's terrible!  And it's the wrong message.  I think we have to--to take some responsibility for our--our children's education.  We have to be involved in the schools, you know.  I grew up, I was educated in Chicago public schools.  Different system than now, because parents were invested in the schools.  They have to be invested now.  I think we have to do those kind of things.  I think the church has to also take responsibility.  It is the strongest institution in the African American community.  It has to be more functional.  It has to be more involved in academics, education, entrepreneurialship, business, you know.  It has to foster people who are leaders in those areas for people to say, "I can be that. I can do that."  And so I would--I think that we have to step up to bat and not wait for people to give us things and do things.  I believe in affirmative action in its proper application.  I believe that people must be given opportunity.  I believe, however, that they must be prepared to embrace those opportunities, and if they're not trained, if they're not schooled well, they won't be.  And it will be all for naught.  I look at it, we need--we need better leadership at the--at the grassroots level.
Story_ID: 13189
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you, at this point I have to ask, what do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, my legacy!  Well, my heart, my training, is education of young people.  Not only because of me--there's been many other people who are involved in this whole adventure, but I can point to, in our church alone, a number of persons who have become physicians--five, six, seven, eight, nine of them who are going into medicine.  I've mentored young people outside of our church community in academics.  I think I serve as a role model for many of our young people, not only in the church community, in the medical community--I've stayed in medicine a lot because I want to be a mentor for young black persons in medicine, and many of them tell me that, "I'm in medicine because of you," or, "You influenced me," or whatever.  And also, in the--in the spiritual part of my life, I try to be a genuine role model into values, and so.  I would like my legacy to be the fact that I influence young people, and hopefully for men--as a husband, as a father which we didn't talk about at all, which are very important parts of my life.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Now you have children?
Speaker 2: I have three children.  I have three girls who--but they're not young anymore.  My oldest is a senior in college, second oldest--my oldest is Lauren, she is a senior in the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign, Illinois].  My second oldest, Rachel, is nineteen.  She's--well, she's a sophomore, but really she'll be a junior--she's ahead of herself at the University of Illinois in Champaign.  In fact this summer, she's doing a summer research project on religion in America.  And then my youngest who is Emily, she's seventeen.  She's a senior at Oak Park [and] River Forest [High School, Oak Park, Illinois].  All of them are doing very well and made me very proud.  And my wife [Susan Davenport] is a pharmacist as well as a church administrator, Susan.  So those parts of my life, you know, are a part of my legacy.  I want to be a role model as a husband, as a father to people.
Story_ID: 13190
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I think about that sometime.  And, you know, not a whole lot.  I don't think I would do anything that is foundationally different.  And I--and I hesitate to even to--I don't really know of--I guess in some areas that I would give more emphasis to that I didn't.  Having the knowledge I have now, maybe put more time in developing more institutions in the community versus in the formal institutions that I'm in.  And that's still one of the dreams that I--that I have.  But, I wouldn't do a whole lot differently in my life.  I don't--I don't have a lot of substantial regrets that I should have done this differently.  In medicine or in theology.  I enjoy what I do.  And hope to continue to do it for awhile.
Story_ID: 13191
Speaker 1: And one final question is slightly different from legacy, is how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh!  I'd like to be remembered as somebody--someone people could trust.  I think that--and that's trust in the broad term--they could trust what they see, they could trust my counsel, they could trust me as a person.  I'd like to be remembered as somebody that people could trust.

Speaker 1: This picture here is my grandmother, Alberta Pryor.  Outside of my mother [Shirley Rhone Smith], she has had the most effect upon my life as a woman.  She helped to raise us when my mother died, and she probably is the--one of the major reasons for my faith.  She had a strong faith in God, and taught me the same, taught me the love for gospel, and gospel music, and for people.  She also has--my grandmother was a writer.  She writes poetry and prose, and my love of academics, I think, comes from--from her.
