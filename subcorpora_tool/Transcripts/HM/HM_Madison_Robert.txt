Speaker 1: Good afternoon [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert P.] Madison and thank you again for agreeing to share your life story with The HistoryMakers.  We're going to start by slating the interview.  My name is Regennia Williams and I'm the interviewer and Matthew Hickey is the videographer and we have no observers today, it's just the three of us.  I would like to address you as Mr. Madison or sir throughout the interview (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, well, thank you.
Speaker 1: And would like to get started by asking if you would please state and spell your name first, middle and last.
Speaker 2: Robert P. Madison, R-O-B-E-R-T, middle initial P., Madison, M-A-D-I-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your date of birth and location of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is July the 28th, 1923.
Speaker 1: And the place of your birth?
Speaker 2: Cleveland, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That makes me an octogenarian.
Speaker 1: And a native Clevelander.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Wonderful, and today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is March the 17th, 2004.
Speaker 1: And the location of this interview?
Speaker 2: We are at my office [Robert P. Madison International, Inc.] in Cleveland, Ohio at 2930 Euclid Avenue, 44115.
Story_ID: 216647
Speaker 1: We're going to continue with the slating just by asking some People magazine-ish type questions.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Can you please tell us your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Wow, I suppose my favorite food for breakfast would be bacon and eggs, and for lunch would be peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and for dinner fish or beef, pretty much chicken and fish, those kinds of dishes.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I think the warm climates or the warm weather is much preferred by me, which means from April to November.
Speaker 1: Okay, and favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Unequivocal.
Speaker 1: Okay and a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, once upon a time we use to go down to Montego Bay in Jamaica, and I liked that very much, but in recent years I would say Florida, where I've begun to play golf, and therefore I seek those places where there's a good golf course.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  "Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither suffer much nor enjoy much because they live in the gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat," [sic.].  That's a quote from [President] Theodore Roosevelt [Jr.].
Story_ID: 216648
Speaker 1: I'd just like to talk about your family background, and would like to start by asking about your mother, what was her name and where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother was Nettie Josephine Brown Madison, and she was born in Selma, Alabama, and she was an only child, and she went to Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] and majored in drama.
Speaker 1: And did she grow up in Alabama also?
Speaker 2: She grew up in, oh yeah, she grew up in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she ever share any stories with you about her childhood in Alabama?
Speaker 2: I don't recall any stories about childhood in Alabama, no I don't.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother was very religious, very committed, very courageous, very determined and a tremendous mother.
Story_ID: 216649
Speaker 1: Can you tell me a little bit about your father's background?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father was born in Mobile, Alabama and he grew up in Mobile, Alabama.  He had two brothers who were killed, one was drowned, and one was in an automobile accident before they reached maturity, so he practically also became almost an only child in that regard, but he is my hero and I say that because he went away to the boarding school called Snow Hill [Normal and Industrial] Institute in Snow Hill, Alabama and from there he went on to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] to study civil engineering, and I say, my hero, because how can a man back in the nineteenth--turn of the [20th] century, black man, want to become an engineer.  Everybody was becoming doctors and lawyers, et cetera.  He wanted to become an engineer and that's why he studied at Howard University, got his degree and he was an engineer.
Speaker 1: And your father's name again, please?
Speaker 2: Robert J. Madison.
Speaker 1: Okay and these are both historically black colleges [and universities (HBCUs)] or institutions?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Snow Hill is--
Speaker 2: Snow Hill is a black--
Speaker 1: Grammar school?
Speaker 2: It's sort of like, he wore a uniform, it was almost like a-- he stayed there at boarding school and from I think about the fifth grade to high school--but they didn't have high schools for black youngsters back in those days.  I'm talking about just after the turn of the century.  So these academies sprung up like that and that's where he went to school there.
Speaker 1: Okay and that too was in Alabama?
Speaker 2: At Selma, Alabama [sic.].
Speaker 1: And Howard University in our nation's capital?
Speaker 2: Right, Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and so he's also growing up in Alabama, again did he share with you any stories about his years as a child in that southern state?
Speaker 2: Not a lot, not a lot of stories, I can't recall, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 216650
Speaker 1: Can we talk a little bit about how your parents [Nettie Brown Madison and Robert J. Madison] met, and then how the family ended up in Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I'm not too sure how they met except that Selma [Alabama] was the birthplace and home of my mother, and this high school, Snow Hill [Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama], was in Selma.  So he came from Mobile [Alabama] to study at Selma.  He may have met my mother there, maybe, but he went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and graduated in the year 1922, I think it was, and I was born a year later in Cleveland, Ohio.  Now in Cleveland, Ohio, because when my father completed his work as a civil engineer, there were no opportunities for black engineers back in those days, and it happens that my mother's parents [Julia Watkins and Prince Watkins] lived in Cleveland, and I suppose they came up during the Great Migration, but she, they were in Washington, D.C. and then that's where he graduated, and therefore they came to Cleveland for mother to be with her mother while I was being born, that's how we got to Cleveland the first time.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But six months later, we left Cleveland because he got an opportunity to teach at Selma University [Selma, Alabama], teach physics and mathematics and coach the football team, and so we were there in Selma for about three years, then we moved to, he got another job at Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina, again teaching physics and chemistry and all those scientific technical courses.  Stanley was born there, I have three brothers all born in a different place.  He taught there for two years and then decided I guess to--finally he was given an opportunity to go to work in the War Department [U.S. Department of War], then called War Department, which was the--in the federal government as an engineer, he finally got an opportunity to practice his engineering, but the Great Depression came, and when the Great Depression came, the last to be hired is the first to be fired.  So he was fired, or released, whatever you want to call it, because of the Depression, and we were there in Washington, D.C. for a number of years and it was time for me to go into high school, and they felt that I would be better served by studying architecture at East Technical High School in Cleveland, Ohio.  Also that was where my maternal, mother's grandmother was and that would be a kind of a home place for us.  That's how we got back to Washington [sic. Cleveland] after I had been away for about ten or twelve years.
Story_ID: 216651
Speaker 1: So you're back in Cleveland [Ohio] and you've mentioned your maternal grandparents.  Can we talk a little while about them?  Your grandparents' names and what neighborhood they were living in, in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Julia, Julia, it escapes me right now, but her name was Julia, and they lived in the Central area of Cleveland, but when I came back, no, she was still living.  Well they lived in the Central area of Cleveland around--something is missing here.  Central area of Cleveland it was, something is missing because I recall that when I went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] my grandmother died during the Thanksgiving holiday, and I was unable to come home for her funeral because we didn't have any money, but I do recall her passing on at that period, but it was in the Central area which is 40th Street, 43rd Street, Central Avenue, Cedar Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you remember your maternal grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was Prince; Watkins was his name, Watkins, Prince Watkins.  That was--his last name was Watkins, it was Julia Watkins and Prince, that's what it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, your maternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay and they were living in Central which at that was the primary community of residence for--
Speaker 2: That was a ghetto of black people (laughter).
Speaker 1: The ghetto, see I wasn't going to use that term.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well that's what it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, well pretty much a racially homogenous kind of neighborhood.  All right so a lot of African Americans were in that east side community in the City of Cleveland, and for your father's [Robert J. Madison] family, do you remember your paternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: I remember very well my father's, much better than I knew my mother [Nettie Brown Madison].  My father was, as I said, from Mobile, Alabama.  Unfortunately, his parents divorced, and each of them remarried.  Therefore, that's one reason why he went away to boarding school [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama] because one family over there started a new family, and my paternal grandfather, who was a minister, moved to Hazard, Kentucky but my grandmother, Julia Craig, on my father's side, was a power in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, you know those ladies who know everything and they controls and runs the whole show in the A.M.E., in the Metropolitan A.M.E. Church in Mobile, Alabama and they had--my mother's, my grandmother's new husband now--Craig it was.  They had two, three children.  They had Cloveese Craig [ph.], who was killed and they had two daughters, Julia [ph.] and, we call her "Sister," Lorraine [ph.], and they're still living, and I'm in communication with them and it happens that my aunt is three months older than I am (laughter) because of my father's, his--their second marriage and something like that.
Speaker 1: Now can you remind us again what the A.M.E. stands for in that--
Speaker 2: African American Epi--African A.M.E., African Methodist Episcopal church, A.M.E. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 216652
Speaker 1: And so you're in Cleveland [Ohio] now, and you're a student at East Technical High School [Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yeah, but let me go back to my father [Robert J. Madison].
Speaker 1: Well, oh, should we go back a little bit?
Speaker 2: I haven't given you the real history of why I told you he was my hero.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't understand how he decided to go to study engineering at Howard University in Washington, D.C.  That, I wish now that I've had a chance to ask him, but I don't, but he went back there to study at Howard.  Now this, a young fellow coming from Snow Hill [Normal and Industrial] Institute [Snow Hill, Alabama] in Alabama, getting to Howard University.  He had to work during the night at the post office while he went to school in the daytime.  He was also captain of the football team, and he was one of the honor students in the engineering school of physics and chemistry and mathematics and all of that, and I think the kind of effort it took to study engineering at that period of time with no promise of what might eventually come of it, and becoming a tremendously competent and capable person so that he could go on to teach these fields down in Selma [University, Selma, Alabama] and in Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina], and in Washington, D.C.  And so with that he really became the kind of role model from an intellectual point of view that I think was what has driven me, but you see my mother [Nettie Brown Madison] was the spiritual side of this, this group here.  My father had the bravado and the courage, my mother had the spirit, she said "God will take care of us," she was praying all the time.  So the two of them were quite a couple.  That's my mother and my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: During the [Great] Depression which was very destructive for us, after the war [sic.], after the Depression when he was laid off, he couldn't get a job because he was too well educated for the jobs that were available, like running an elevator and stuff like that, and those jobs he was qualified for they wouldn't hire him because he was black.  So here is an over-educated black man who really suffered and during that course of time I remember he drove a taxicab for a while, he was a caddy at a golf course, and I find myself somewhat resentful to see my father, with the college degree with mathematics and all that, out there carrying the golf clubs of some of these kids at a golf course.  But he did it, and one thing is that he was absolutely determined that we would make the best of our opportunities, no matter what the obstacles were out there, and I'm sure that a part of my drive now is to overcome some of those things he could not.  He died at the age of fifty-one, and I'm eighty years old see, so I (laughter) still got a few more years to make up for what he (laughter), that's what--that's sort of a commentary I wish to make.
Story_ID: 216653
Speaker 1: You mentioned the great black migration [the Great Migration] in connection with your mother's [Nettie Brown Madison] family's sojourn to Cleveland [Ohio], and I joke with folks all the time because they say, "Cleveland is Alabama north," but, and they say that's a myth, but it's confirmed over and over again as I talk to longtime residents here, but their story is still not the typical migration story, if there is one, because the myth says the migration was primarily from field to factory but--
Speaker 2: I don't know about that.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Well, well I'm agreeing with you, but I don't know about the field to factory, I don't know but I believe, I hear what you're saying.
Speaker 1: But certainly you've given us reason to believe that there are educational opportunities in the South.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And that people aren't necessarily leaving the South to be educated but there are some opportunities there.
Speaker 2: Oh no, oh yes.
Speaker 1: That can be taken advantage of?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I wanted to say too, in case I get a chance to interview this other HistoryMaker and we need to illustrate how sometimes the stories overlap, that the founder of Snow Hill [Normal and Industrial] Institute [Snow Hill, Alabama], one of his descendants is a HistoryMaker in Cleveland, [HistoryMaker] A. Grace Lee Mims.
Speaker 2: I know, I sponsored the program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I sponsored the program for five years, 'The Black Arts.'  Oh, yeah, I know her very well.
Story_ID: 216654
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask again about your experiences as a student in Cleveland [Ohio], and especially at East Technical High School [Cleveland, Ohio].  Now was it co-ed at that point, or still all boys?
Speaker 2: All boys.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you tell me about your experiences there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, first of all, the reason I went to East Tech was to study architecture.  You see in Washington, D.C. what--they had a segregated school system there, and back in those days, I'm talking back in those days, you were not born then (laughter) of course, but in Washington, D.C. they had three high schools for colored children, [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.], Armstrong [Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.] and Cardozo [Senior High School; Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.].  Cardozo was for students who wanted to go into business if you were like clerk, typing, that sort of thing.  Armstrong was what was called a technical school for going in for studying masonry and building construction, et cetera.  They did have some drawing courses, but those drawing courses did not lead towards an architectural career. Then there was the mighty Dunbar, if you haven't heard of the mighty Dunbar you should hear of the mighty Dunbar.  Dunbar was the school for the elite, for the intelligentsia.  Well, my parents [Nettie Brown Madison and Robert J. Madison] wanted me to study architecture, as did I, and therefore I couldn't--Dunbar, Armstrong would not do it for me because they didn't have a college curriculum course and Dunbar didn't have an architectural course, but back in Cleveland they had East Technical High School, which at that time was one of the best schools in the nation.  So I came back to Cleveland just to go into East Technical High School to study architecture.  At that time you had to be selected, because there was a East Tech and a West Tech [West Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio] and the students on the east side of Cleveland who wanted to be in the technical school went to East Tech and students on the west side of town who wanted to be in tech went to West Tech and so you were selected on the basis of your, your academic credentials, most of us were, and when I went to East Tech it was all boys, nothing but boys, and there were only a few black students, only a few.  I don't know the exact numbers, now my wife [HistoryMaker Leatrice Branch Madison] said it changes every time I tell the story, but of the three thousand students at East Tech back in those days, there were not a hundred blacks, I know that, but my classmates, my wife kids me about this too, were Synkovich [ph.], and Leskovic [ph.], Loluskovat [ph.] because they were the ethnics who went in there to go into the factories, the machine shops and the wood shops and all that, and it was excellent, but it was also superb because it was East Tech, that I studied French, they taught Latin and they taught me architectural drawing to such an extent that when I got to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], I could draw as well as anybody from any place, and as many--as a second year student at Howard. That's what East Tech was all about, and it happens that East Tech was on 55th Street, we lived at 43rd Street, so we could walk to school back then, but it was a very closed society in that it was not the neighborhood school, so students came from all over the east side, Collinwood [Cleveland, Ohio], to study at East Tech, and so there was not the, the kind of after school activity among classmates because after school you dispersed, but it was tremendous educational environment, really school, that's what it was.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is a very selective public school?
Speaker 2: Public school.
Speaker 1: In the City of Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And all boys at that point?
Speaker 2: All boys at there--
Story_ID: 216655
Speaker 1: I'm just wondering how you came to know that you were meant to be an architect, 'cause it sounds like that decision was made before you came back to Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You're right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You're right, I was in the elementary school, and I do believe it was the first grade, and I had come home and I'd shown my mother [Nettie Brown Madison] a drawing that I had made of a sailboat in elementary school and she thought it was wonderful, and she said "Bobby [HistoryMaker Robert P. Madison], you're going to be an architect," and I said, "Yes mother." That's what you said back in those days.  I hadn't the slightest idea what an architect was, but she said so, and I said, "Fine," and that's all I've ever done, all of my life; but see it, the plot thickens because my mother, as I said the strong spiritual force had determined that my father [Robert J. Madison] had had such a difficult time trying to find employment that she said, "We will build our own architectural firm and never have to ask anybody for a job again."  So when Julian was born, second son, she says to him one day in the third grade, "Julian, you're gonna be an engineer," he said, "yes mother," and Stanley was born she says, "now we got--my father's an engineer, Julian's an engineer, Bob's gonna be an architect, we need somebody to pray for all this, you're gonna be a preacher, Stanley."  Well he rebelled, he didn't become a preacher, he became a medical doctor, but then when Bernard was born, she said "Now okay, we got Bob's an engineer, my father's an engineer, Bob's an architect, Julian's an engineer and then an architect, Bernard, you be an architect," and he said "yes, mother," and that's what it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we went right through and each of us did exactly except Stanley, he became a medical doctor.
Speaker 1: So your mother has a family of sons?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, now can you give me the names one more time in birth order so we have everyone on the tape?
Speaker 2: Robert P. Madison, I'm the oldest; Julian Clifford Madison, he was three years younger than I am; Stanley David Madison, he was two years younger than Julian; and Bernard Edward Madison, he was the fourth son.  Those are the four boys.
Speaker 1: Okay, and by the time that you're in high school at East Tech[nical High School, Cleveland, Ohio], is the whole family together then?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: In Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the grandparents are here too?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 216656
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask also about your, the time that--for you to leave East Tech[nical High School, Cleveland, Ohio], okay--
Speaker 2: East Tech?
Speaker 1: You're graduating class of 1940?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Well, what was your question?
Speaker 1: Well, when you're about to leave East Tech, how did you decide to go to Howard University [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: You are young aren't you (laughter), what I'm saying is that to study architecture back in those days, the choices were so few, I would come back to [Western] Reserve [University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio] later on, but graduating from East Technical High School and wanting to study architecture there were only three black schools--time for the tape to be changed?  Three black schools in the country where you could study architecture.  One was Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], one was Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and one was Howard, for a black person to study architecture.  Now it is said that some of the Ivy League schools would, you know had open enrollment, but we could not afford to go one of those schools, plus I had a scholarship, an academic scholarship.  I could never have gotten there if we had to pay for it, 'cause we didn't have the kind of money then, but I had, I was an honor student at East Tech and my father [Robert J. Madison] had been a graduate of Howard University and they had a school of architecture at Howard University and I was an honor student--natural.  So that's how I went to Howard University, scholarship.
Story_ID: 216657
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert P.] Madison, you were starting to tell me about the nation's capital [Washington, D.C.], and the choice, in many ways it was made for you, to go to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] because that was one of the few places that an African American could study.
Speaker 2: Architecture.
Speaker 1: To prepare for architecture.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: As a career.  So can you tell me what the nation's capital was like then?
Speaker 2: I can tell you something about my experiences there.  First of all, please understand I was one of those students who was very poor in terms of having money to spend.  We got there on this scholarship and the scholarship took care of room and board and my mother [Nettie Brown Madison] said, "We'll send you what we can, whenever we can," and I was working around and making.  So I didn't get a chance to travel with some of the people who were on out-of-state aid.  Do you know about out-of-state aid?
Speaker 1: A little.
Speaker 2: These are students from--my classmate was from, my roommate was from Arkansas.  He got out-of-state aid, now what that meant is that if you were living in Arkansas in a segregated system, and you wanted to study architecture, and they didn't want you in their schools there.  They wouldn't have you, you could go out of state and they would pay your whole tuition.  So (laughter) he came to Howard University with a trunk full of shirts.  My roommate had twenty shirts and I had three, but that's the way it was.  Howard was pretty provincial, I mean Washington D.C. was a pretty provincial town back, this is before the Second World War [World War II, WWII] now, we're talking about 1940.  It was segregated, we didn't go in places where we were not wanted.  The whole school system was segregated then.  We, I spent most of my time on campus.  We went down to--in what is the ghetto, which used to--do you know Washington at all?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well U Street down to T Street they had Father [Major Jealous] Divine's church and Bishop, I can't think these, remember these names now, but these were religious ministers in the--performing with the African American community, and we would just go to these churches to enjoy what was then as--I was seeing holy rollers and I didn't know what a holy roller was until I went to this church.  [Charles Manuel "Sweet] Daddy" Grace (laughter).  I guess what I'm saying is that my movements were confined pretty much to the campus and to the community of where African Americans lived.  We didn't bother to go out, et cetera, I didn't a car.  We didn't have cars back in those days, but campus life was fine.  I enjoyed it very much.  I said we were not, we were pretty much, when you came to Howard University you came pretty much to study and have fun on campus.  We didn't do much off campus, but the other thing though, I was only there for three years, two years.  So, I hope that helps you but I can't speak that long about it.  It was fairly provincial; it was not the Washington, D.C. of today.
Story_ID: 216658
Speaker 1: I can recall reading something written by Zora Neale Hurston suggesting that Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] was the Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for black Americans, and since you've had the benefit of attending both universities, I wonder what your take was on that.
Speaker 2: Well my take was this, my take was that indeed Howard called itself the Harvard of--course at the capstone, the capstone of Negro education that was number one and number two, indeed it was the Harvard of that era because you see again, this is what segregation did.  Eminent professors could not teach at Harvard, Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], so what you got teaching at Howard University were the finest minds in this country, E. Franklin Frazier, [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin, I can go on and on about these scholars who studied all over the Sorbonne Ecole des Beaux-Arts [University of Paris, Paris, France] in Paris, and teaching at Howard University.  We had the yard there where we--campus.  It was a school that fashioned itself to be the elite school, capstone of Negro education and we acted like that, (laughter) a bunch of snobs.  We went to Howard, you know.
Speaker 1: So this is a liberal arts institution, you're not preparing necessarily for a career as a professional farmer or agricultural science?
Speaker 2: No, no agriculture, no, they had chemistry, physics, medicine, medicine, nursing, library sciences, architecture, engineering, law, it was a professional school.  No, not agriculture, nothing like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's our nation's capital [Washington, D.C.] then?
Speaker 2: That's our nation's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the capstone?
Speaker 2: Capstone of Negro--
Speaker 1: You said for Negro education?
Speaker 2: Capstone of Negro education, that's what we called ourselves--
Story_ID: 216659
Speaker 1: And you said you were there for three years, and this is the 1940s.  What's gonna take you away from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) War [World War II, WWII], war.
Speaker 1: The war, okay, and what was your involvement in it?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I will never forget that.  In the [Howard University] School of Architecture [and Design] we worked all the time, all day Saturday, all day Sunday, because that's how we designed things, and I will never forget December the 7th, 1941, we were in the school of architecture working on our design problems.  One radio in the room there, it think this was Sunday I think it was, all of a sudden the program was interrupted, the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] wanted to make this comment or this statement that the Japanese attacked [Naval Station] Pearl Harbor [Honolulu, Hawaii].  At which time I was in what was called ROTC, Reserve Officers' Training Corps, and which means--I was not immediately drafted but I finished up that semester and then went into Senior ROTC in '42 [1942] and in '43 [1943], they were trying to get everybody in.  In February of 1943 we were into the [U.S.] Army as privates first class and the ROTC cadets, but we were on our way to Officer Candidate School [OCS] because were Reserve Officers' Training Corps.  So I went to Camp Croft, North Carolina [sic. Spartanburg, South Carolina] for what was called basic training, came back to Howard University while they were waiting to send us to Officer Candidate School, because you see black people were not supposed to be officers in the Army and they had to wait for this slot to open up, and there were seventeen of us and we were a group so we sort of bummed around from Camp Croft, then we went into North Carolina A and T [Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] for a couple of months.  Then back to Howard in what's called ASTP, which is the Army Specialized Training Program, and then we were shipped out to Fort Benning, Georgia where I was commissioned to second lieutenant in 1944 in May, '44 [1944] and then from there I went to Fort Huachuca in Arizona.  I was there in Fort Huachuca until August, I think it was the 15th of '44 [1944].  We set sail for Italy and we landed in Naples [Italy].  I'm sorry, we must've left on the first of August, 'cause we landed in Naples the 15th of August, 1944.  In Naples, which was called the-- we were bivouacked in the king's hunting ground, the king of Italy, and this was the 370th [Regimental] Combat Team and we were there for about two weeks, and I must tell you this, I never believed we would go into combat, into battle, because they had not used black troops in battle before, and we didn't have any guns.  They didn't give us any weapons, and they didn't do that because they didn't know what--can you imagine getting a thousand black people together with guns, you don't know what they're gonna do, that's what they thought back in those days, and I said, I was an officer--I said, "No, we're not going into battle, they just, we're gonna be--" but sure enough they started issuing us ammunition and on the first day of September we went into the front lines just on the south side of the Arno River just north of Pisa [Italy].  I was an intelligence officer and I was an intelligence officer because I'm told, they never told me this, but at Fort Benning, Georgia I scored one of the highest marks that has been scored in the going through, and course the 92nd [Infantry] Division was all black, and the officers were below the rank of captain were all black, but above the rank of captain were white officers.  It was a segregated Army with white officers and I guess I was considered to be one of the best black officers, I was made a battalion--battalion intelligence commander, battalion intelligence officer.
Story_ID: 216660
Speaker 1: And I made a cardinal mistake (laughter) I'm crazy.  You, are you interested in these crazy stories about me?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes this is wonderful.
Speaker 1: You know I was, I believed in the letter of the law and the book and what I learned at Officer Candidate School [OCS] we had to do, so we were in, I was at battalion commanders headquarters, and on September the 1st, the order came down from Mark [W.] Clark, who was the general of the [U.S.] Army, saying we had to go on a reconnaissance across the river, the Arno River in preparation of attacking the next day, okay.  So I went down to the front line and met some of my friends who were down, they were officers.  I said "Look, we're gonna attack, we're gonna attack at midnight tonight, we're gonna cross the river."  I said, "I'm going back up to headquarters and get the orders so we can get the ammunition and the artillery fired over there."  That's what you're supposed--that's what they taught us to do.  So I went back up there to the commander of the--I was second lieutenant now, I said to this battalion commander who was a major, he was white.  I said, "Well, the troops are ready, major, and we are ready for the artillery to start."  He says, "There's not going to be any artillery."  I said, "Wait, what do you mean there's not going to be any artillery?"  I said, "This is what--you're supposed to send artillery over there to soften up the enemy, so the troops can come in!"  He said, "There's not going to be any artillery fire."  I said, "Well, who said so?"  He said, "Mark Clark, the commanding general."  I said, "Get me Mark Clark on the telephone" (laughter).  It's (laughter) (unclear), I'm crazy.  So they, of course I didn't get Mark Clark on the telephone, but the audacity of this, but I was right, according to the book.  The reason they didn't want to send up the artillery, because to stop it you have to send flares up, and if the flares go up, then the enemy would know where we were.  And anyway we crossed the river that night and we didn't find any troops on this side, and so the next morning we attacked, but what happened though after we went over there, as we were coming across the river, the Germans withdrew and we came back, that was reconnaissance but when the full, the whole body of troops went across there, they had laid landmines and a number of the men in my group were--had their legs blown off and feet when I scathed all right.
Story_ID: 216661
Speaker 1: I read a lot about the Double V campaign during World War II [WWII], led by the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], victory over fascism abroad and victory over racism and discrimination at home.  Were you aware of the NAACP's activities at that time?
Speaker 2: We were not aware, 'cause we were overseas then, but we were not even aware of the fact that, I can't think of his name now but, [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt sent a black person to Europe to the war to, to understand how the troops were being treated and when the report came back, the report came back that it was a segregated [U.S.] Army and that--I must tell you this that the officers that we had in our command were the misfits from the white regiments--got rid of them.  Where did they get rid of 'em, dumped them on the 92nd [Infantry Division] (laughter), so we had dumb officers, excuse me for saying so, but it's proven to be correct, but no we didn't, I was not aware, we were not aware.  We were so busy surviving over there that we had this thing, but it was a different kind of war than you talk about today.  I mean it's a very civilized and we went and in Italy, we went through the villages and people welcomed us (clapping) and we--gave us food and all that for moving the Germans back.  That's what I did in the war.  I was wounded, incidentally.
Speaker 1: Yes, and so you received the Purple Heart?
Speaker 2: I, oh yeah, the Purple, well I was, this was in Gallicano [Italy], it was on December the 26th, 1944 and I was, as an officer I had a driver of my jeep and I said to him, look, you don't have to go with me this morning because, just get some--it's the day after Christmas, enjoy yourself, and I was driving myself in this jeep up this road to headquarters and the German shells, the German artillery began to shell the road and a--one shell came over and hit the vehicle that I was driving and it happens that it--had I been sitting where I was supposed to be sitting on the right side with the driver, I would have been dead today.  So the fact that I told him to stay where he was (laughter) and I drove the jeep, is why I'm living today, but I was, I got hit by shrapnel, and in my liver and in my ankle, and I was taken to battalion headquarters and a battalion aid station and they patched me up until I got back down to the field hospital and they took out all the shrapnel, and yes I did get the Purple Heart, and I had three battle ribbons, I was in three battles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 216662
Speaker 1: Wanna just stay with the theme of the [World] War [II, WWII] era for a few more minutes anyway.  It was a major turning point I think in American history, especially with the Manhattan Project and the development of the [atomic] bomb and the way that the war ended.  How did you feel at that point in time about the use of the bomb in 1945, and how do you feel about it now?  Was that the right thing to do?
Speaker 2: Well first of all, it's a very good question that you ask.  We were busy surviving; we were busy trying to stay alive.  It was not, you know, we knew where the enemy were, they knew where we were and it was a kind of maneuvering that you see where you outflank this one and outflank this and they would surrender, not this mass kind of madness, shooting up villages and towns, you go to Italy now and some of those great monuments are still there because they were civilized enough not to--we're not going to tear down these great buildings.  Well, it happens that I was in the hospital recovering from my wounds when the war--no, I'd gotten out but I was, yeah I'd gotten out just in time when, when the D-Day came, not D-Day came, but Victory Day came in Italy, which is in April [April 25, 1945], and the war was over in Italy and we were very happy about that, but we were scheduled to go to the Pacific [Theater], and I was scheduled to go because as an officer, I did not have enough points, it's called, to come home.  I had points because I was wounded, I had points because I had been in battle for so many days, but that was not the critical line, so we were preparing to go to the Pacific.  None of us wanted to go to the Pacific and all of a sudden we heard about this great explosion, and the war was over, but we didn't have any idea, I didn't have any concept of what the atomic bomb did, could do or how it was even delivered.  We didn't know that and, but we didn't have to continue fighting and as far as I was concerned, I was--whatever was the reason we were not going to fight anymore.  That was then, but as I think in retrospect now, I think that the bomb unleashed a power, a destructive power that--first of all, when it was dropped on Hiroshima [Japan] and Nagasaki [Japan].  These were innocent people, this is not like the battlefield where we--the troops over there, we're here, if you got a uniform I'm going to shoot 'em.  If he doesn't have a uniform on, let him pass through, but when you started dropping bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so many innocent people died, we are seeing the results of that today, 9/11 [September 11, 2001], and the train over here in Spain [the 2004 Madrid train bombings] and all those things that--we've lost sight, I believe, of honorable combat, if there is such a thing, but I just think that it was, I think it was a mistake to have done that but I wonder if mankind had that kind of knowledge, it eventually would have made it.  Whether they would have used it is another matter, but I'm regretful very much so that we have the kinds of conflicts that we have today, and I would suggest to you that when we dropped that bomb we lost all of our consciousness and morality, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Innocent people, not only present, but future generations; that was not the way wars were conducted in the past.  There were certain wars, they'd rape and pillage and that, but it was not, mass thing like this.
Story_ID: 216663
Speaker 1: So, the war [World War II, WWII] is over, this is late summer 1945 with the bombing.  Now we have V-J Day, victory over Japan and victory over Europe [V-E Day] had come in the spring.  I read in some accounts of World War II that there were experiments with integrating the ground forces in Europe before the official end of the war?  Did you see any of that in your days?
Speaker 2: I didn't see any of it, no.
Speaker 1: Didn't?  Okay, just wondered.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, we, (laughter) I must admit though that it, I'm smiling because there was the First World War [World War I, WWI] and African American troops, black troops went to fight that war and they fought.  There was the Civil War, black troops fought that war and they fought too.  The Second World War, but what you had here was a difference and this was the first time this many educated black men went to war, and these men, some of them were far more educated that the officers who were commanding them, and therefore there was a challenge all the time to say that integration, it was not an integrated [U.S.] Army, yes there were some experiments with white officers and black officers, but not during my time, but it's also true that the pressure was coming that you don't find somebody who's got a master's degree in engineering who's going to take orders from some white person who happens to have a high school diploma who happened to go up the rank to be captain.  It just got to be out of kilter, and that's, and that was a lot of pressure from us on that basis.  We drove some of those people crazy though (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay so it sounds like there are a number of battles being fought on the ground in Europe, some against this enemy, whether it's the fascist Italian--
Speaker 2: Oh, no question.
Speaker 1: --or the Germans?
Speaker 2: No question.
Speaker 1: And this is the era of the Holocaust, so there's a lot going on, but other battles fought along racial lines within the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And I'm thinking also about some of the things that were going on stateside with A. Philip Randolph, and some of the war production industries mobilizing in support of the guys who were over there making the world safe for democracy and doing other great things in the name of America, and so it again it's, I see it as a historian, I see it as a period of tremendous change, major watershed in American history.
Speaker 2: You're right, oh, you are absolutely right.
Speaker 1: Okay so I can believe what the historians are saying about this period.
Speaker 2: Not only that, but you know what, you are so right.  I didn't know you were a historian, but now I know that and I'm glad you are, but you see why were we, why did we go to battle?  And we said, "We're going to battle because we're gonna prove it.  We are going to fight to make this world safe for democracy.  Therefore, when we come back we expect our due."  That was the expectation of these blacks, you're absolutely correct about that.  It was a turning point, and there was much more courage among black men, they said "Look, we're not taking this stuff anymore."
Speaker 1: In the academy we talk about that rising tide of expectations, and things have gotten better, relatively speaking, as far as education is concerned since the era of World War I, but people continue to expect more, they want full freedom, you know, uncompromisingly so, and so a lot of the officers I see, just in looking at those individual stories, come home with very high expectations of this country (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Story_ID: 216664
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into the Cold War period yet, because I also understand that you met your wife [HistoryMaker Leatrice Branch Madison] in the nation's capital [Washington, D.C.] before going to Europe?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, to serve in the [U.S.] Army, so can you tell me about Mrs. Madison and how you came to meet her?
Speaker 2: Okay, (laughter) sure, I was in Washington, I was at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and I told you I went to an all-boys school [East Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio], and I was an absolutely devout churchgoer at St. John A.M.E. Church [Cleveland, Ohio], and I had no sisters (laughter) which meant (laughter) that I was totally ignorant about ladies, girls or women at all, and I remember going on the first date that I was, which is a blind date, and that was a disaster (laughter).  So I was around there being very disgusted and I said to one of my friends, "You know, I'm not for girls, I don't--I can't get along with these women."  He said, "I got somebody I want you to meet," and he mentioned Leatrice Lucille Branch, who lived in Washington, D.C. and I called her up on the telephone, and I went to see her and I fell in love with her, but she didn't love me (laughter) at all. It was nice and crazy, I was, I told you I was commandant of the cadet corps at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  That was that interim period between Camp Croft [Spartanburg, South Carolina] and going to Fort Benning, Georgia. I was so much in love with her I decided to have a parade for her on a Thursday afternoon, and I called out all my troops, and marched through the quadrangle there, and she was standing behind me when I received all present and accounted for and I received the salute and there was--she wasn't impressed at all (laughter).  I said I got the whole cadet corps out there.  At any rate, I went away to [World] War [II, WWII] and I stayed in touch with her, and I came back, and when I came back she was, had somebody else that she had found that she liked very much, and shortly thereafter I got back I met a young lady whose name was Coretta Scott, from Antioch College [Yellow Springs, Ohio] and we were very close for about a couple of years, and then I decided, no, we decided I was trying to be an architect, and she was going to be an opera singer, that wasn't going to work.  So we decided not to get married, and it happens I married Leatrice, and then when I was at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], we were walking across the yard there one day and here's this voice, "Hi, [HistoryMaker] Bob [Robert P. Madison]."  I looked up, it's Coretta, and at that time she'd just met [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.], so she came over our house and we had quite a little chat and I met, she met Leatrice and I said I'm gonna (unclear) and so Leatrice was why I--and so I married, I met Leatrice and I've been married to her for fifty-four years now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right, isn't it, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: So this is 19--
Speaker 2: Forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 1: Forty-nine [1949], okay, all right, so then, oh, this is gonna be your fifty-fifth anniversary this year?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the date of your wedding?
Speaker 2: April the 16, 1949.
Speaker 1: And I just wanna state for the record too, this is Coretta Scott and Martin as in King.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Martin Luther King, Jr.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right (laughter), that's right, oh yeah.  Everybody teases me about that now.  I said, "Well she wanted to be famous, and so she is," but no, I haven't seen her.  I saw her once after Martin died and we spent a little while talking.  I met him when he came to Cleveland [Ohio] you know, he was a remarkable person.  Yes, that's, that's her.
Story_ID: 214572
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert P.] Madison, we were talking about the 1940s, and you just shared with us that you met your future wife [HistoryMaker] Leatrice [Branch] Madison in Washington, D.C. at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and that you all were married in 1949.  Okay, can you tell me a little bit about her background?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you want to get from '46 [1946] to '49 [1949] or want to go to '49 [1949]?
Speaker 1: Well 1946, the war [World War II, WWII] is over, and where is Robert Madison?  What are you doing in '46 [1946]?
Speaker 2: That's the point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I came back to Cleveland [Ohio] of course in June of '46 [1946] and I was going to continue my education in college.  It happens that I had two brothers at Howard University at that time, Julian [Madison] was at Howard studying engineering, and Stanley [Madison] was at Howard studying pharmacy, and I said, "Gee whiz, I don't need to go down to Howard now, because I got two brothers down there already and my mother [Nettie Brown Madison] and father [Robert J. Madison] are trying to sustain them.  I have the G.I. Bill of Rights.  I will therefore go to the school of architecture in town," which was Western Reserve University [Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], and my mother and father said, "that's a great idea, why don't you do that," and I said, "yeah, I'll do that. " So I got myself organized and went up to Western Reserve University and met with the dean of the school of architecture and I was very gracious, and I said to him, "Dean, you know, I'd like very much to find out where I can fill out my application so I can be admitted to your school of architecture here," and he said, "you know, don't think we can do that.  He said, "We have not had any Negroes to finish this school, and if you did, there were no opportunities for you to get a diploma, and therefore you would be wasting the time of the teachers and the professors here, because there is nothing for you to do when you get through anyway.  Sorry, but we, we--can't come in."  So I thanked him, and I got angry (laughter) and I came back home and I guess this is what drives me.  I said, "I'm not gonna take that."  So three days later, I put on my uniform with my Purple Heart and my battle ribbons across the front here and my bars on my shoulder and my cap, and I went back to school, Western Reserve University, and I asked to speak to the dean of admissions, not the dean of architecture, and I said to him, "I'm here, I wanna enter the school of architecture but the dean has said to me that that's, I don't think we can do that."  I said, "Now I've come back here in my uniform because my blood is over there on the soil of Italy fighting to make the world safe for democracy, and for this world, and this country, and you're telling me I can't enter your school of architecture here?"  Well, he was a bit understanding, and he said, "Just a minute."  So he sent for a professor in the school of architecture who came down and talked to me, and I showed him some of my work at Howard, you see I was transferring; and his position was, "I don't see why he can't study here.  He's as good as anybody else we got in the class."  So that was, he said, "Well sure, why not, why don't we let him come in?"  So apparently the dean of admissions had called the dean of architecture and said, "What's with this, you know, we think this young man is capable of going here," and apparently the dean of architecture said, "well, we better test him."  So they asked me if would take these tests.  So starting in the middle of July, every Saturday morning I was up at Western Reserve University taking a test, English, algebra, geometry, whatever they thought they could do or give me, and I got no answers to what had happened except the day before admission the dean called me and said, "You can enter our school of architecture."
Story_ID: 214573
Speaker 1: And I went up, it's fine, went to enter the school of architecture [at Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], and after about the--I was the only black person in the school of architecture of course, in fact, as a matter of fact in the whole university we couldn't field a basketball team, we couldn't.  That's how it was, but I remember this very clearly, they were gonna get rid of me, and they decided that I would take the toughest courses which was physics and French and et cetera.  Well, and you had a lecture room of three hundred people, you know, tiered seats like that, and the professor would go to the blackboard and he would start at nine o'clock in the morning and write for an hour, this, that and the other, "Goodbye, your lesson for tomorrow is this," and we'd go home.  So I said to myself, I better get ready for the lesson tomorrow, and sure enough I studied half that night what was to be done and I came into school the next day, school of architecture, physics class and after the professor opened up the meeting, he said "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert P.] Madison, will you come to the blackboard?"  So I said, "Okay," and I went to the blackboard, and he started asking me some questions.  We were up there writing together.  I was ready, and that day afterwards he never asked me (laughter) another question, but what happened was this also, I realized they had given me courses that this was 1946, and I wanted to finish in 1948, but the way they had scheduled me I was not going to finish in 1949, and I started in 1940.  This is nine years later.  So I said to myself, "I gotta do something about that."  But I must admit this, I did play, now I'm being honest now, this is the first time I ever admitted this, I used my strategy on the basis that they didn't expect anything of me anyway.  So I looked at the curriculum, and saw, now I had to take steel structures before I could take concrete structures, and steel structures started back in September.  It is now March, what am I gonna do?  So I went to the professor, and I said, "Look, I'm so looking forward to taking your course next year.  Do you mind if I audit your class?"  "Oh, whatever, whatever."  So I slept, I studied half the night going back to September, and I immediately come to his class and immediately go to sleep (laughter).  Well anyway I did that for--it didn't bother him, he's over there sleeping, they didn't expect anything of me anyway.  So when it came time to take the final examination I said, "Professor do you mind if I take the final examination because I'd like to know what I'm gonna be up against."  "Why not?"  I took the final examination, when they graded it I got a B, and those students that had been there since September got Cs and Ds, and so what are they gonna do now?  So they passed me (laughter) (unclear), but the best story of all and I sort of enjoy telling these because the same dean who told me he couldn't do anything with me.  He taught history of architecture, and I had to take his courses in sequence.  So I went to him one day and said, "Dean, I'm so looking forward to taking your course, I want you to help me."  I said, "Dean, you know the Gates of Paradise at the Cathedral of Florence [Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore , Florence, Italy], I'm not too sure whether they were designed by [Donato] Bramante or [Filippo] Brunelleschi," (laughter) and he decided he didn't want me in his (laughter) class asking questions like that.  This little fellow--so I passed that, they just waived that, and so they starting waiving classes right and left to get me outta there.  That's how I got graduated from Western.  I still never qualified for a degree at the school of architecture, 'cause they just waived me because I'm not gonna be an architect anyway, what difference does it make?  As a matter of fact, and I was--after I got my degree and my diploma the dean said, "What are you gonna do now?  You gonna work in a lumberyard?" And I said, "Oh, no, dean, I'm going to be an architect."  It happens that he was right though, because I had my degree in my hand.  I won a couple of prizes, right, I got the, I won the Rome Collaborative Prize [Prix de Rome Architecture Competition], a national prize.  I went to the architectural offices in this town [Cleveland, Ohio] and said, "I'd like to fill out an application," right?  And their answer was, "We don't hire colored."  So I walked the streets of this town for a month, right, with a degree.  "We don't hire colored people."  So finally I went to one fellow, I said, "Look before you can a word, I'll work for you for nothing for two weeks, then you can decide whether you want to hire me or not."  It happens he was my teacher too, it was a--and so two weeks later he called me back and said "come on in," and I went to work for him and I worked for him for two years, then I went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 214574
Speaker 1: I had a question I wanted to ask about the university [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful story that you tell, but I'm just wondering, I believe I read somewhere in preparing for this interview that you were the first African American trustee?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: At CWRU, now, well, for a time Case Western Reserve University, but they have a new logo now, and just says "Case," and all those alums like you who went through Western Reserve, a lot of them I know are angry, 'cause my Ph.D. is from CWRU and I'm a bit miffed myself, and I just wondered what you thought about that, the changes at the university that you've seen?
Speaker 2: Well, well I was at a meeting one day and the then president, I think it was [David H.] Auston.  He was talking about Case and I said, "Excuse me Mr. President, but you mean Case Western Reserve University don't you?" "Oh, yeah, yeah."  To answer your question, I am resentful of the fact that they have dropped Western Reserve University and just call it Case.  Now when I joined the board of trustees, and that was another historic moment, oh my goodness, you know it's once denied a student, now trustee.  I was the first black, African American, all that sort of stuff.  But when they federated, they didn't merge, and that meant the Case [School of Applied Science; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio] people, the Case trustees and the Western Reserve University trustees came together, but a merger is when you sort of do this, but a federation is like the federation of states, you know, this state's got its own state's rights, its state's rights, state's rights.  Well when I came on the board two years after its founding, it was obvious that the trustees of Case resented the trustees of Western Reserve University, and not only did they resent that but the president at that time, Bob Morse [Robert W. Morse], who was really a marvelous human being, he was doing everything he could to make that university really significant and meaningful.  The Case people resented him very much, to such an extent that they started cutting off the monies and he finally was--he resigned, but those of us from Western Reserve University, not only do we not like the way it was done, not that we don't like it, but nobody asked me, and nobody asked any of the alumni, and yet they want us to give money.  I'm not sure why it was done this way but it was not done in the same kind of respectful, honorable conduct and behavior that you would expect, it's a great university.  I don't even know what the logo means, nobody can explain that to me, but they have their own ideas of what they want to do and I guess they're doing it, but I don't like it.
Speaker 1: Well that was an interesting way that you presented that image of the two, Case and Western Reserve University sort of coming together, but not necessarily merging (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They didn't merge.
Story_ID: 214575
Speaker 1: I suspect that your union with [HistoryMaker] Leatrice [Branch] Madison was a bit more than just a coming together if it lasted almost fifty-five years.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: So I wanna get back to that subject (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I wanna hear that story about how the two of you came together.
Speaker 2: Well, as I said before I--Jeff Roy [ph.], I had told Jeff that I was having difficulty with the girls on campus, goes, "Got the right person for you [HistoryMaker] Bob [Robert P. Madison]," and so I said, "okay."  So I got her telephone number and I called her on the telephone and I said, "I'd like to come and see you."  Well she had heard, he had told her also to expect my call, and so she said okay you can come over on Saturday, and I said fine, and she was continuing to talk.  Well I'm not use to talking on the telephone idly, and I was really kind of nervous, because you know, carrying on a conversation, anyway I went to see her that Saturday and she had two sisters.  There were three girls in her family; there were four boys in my family.  She was living there with her mother [Julia Bailey Branch] and her father [Hayes Branch] and her grandmother.  So there were five women in this house, and I went there one Saturday to wait for her while she was doing whatever she was doing and there was discussions and talking back and forth all over the place and I'd not been accustomed to this kind of three and four conversations going on at one time, so I started talking to the canary who was standing in the corner (laughter).  We had a good time, but it was funny because you see, back in those days it was a different kind of a courtship.  You invited a lady to go with you to a dance or something like that, and you went and you came back and you saw her at the door, and she lived at home and you said goodnight.  It happens that I didn't have a car, I didn't have any money.  So, I invited her to go to my fraternity dance on the streetcar (laughter).  People today think I'm crazy, dogs ran through the streetcar.  She--you're gonna interview her next month I understand in June, somebody told me it is June.
Speaker 1: I certainly hope so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I went away to war [World War II, WWII], and I told you I, and I came back from the war and I contacted her again.  I had a couple of years Coretta [Scott King] and I used to see each other, and she--and then one day when my friend Jeff again said, "She's not married yet."  So I went back to see her, and we started seeing each other, and we set a date for the wedding and we got married.  She is the oldest of three girls; she's a very intellectual, very bright scholarly inquisitive person.  She reads everything that's ever been written; she even reads the dictionary (laughter).  I've seen her reading the Yellow Pages (laughter), I mean really, but she has been tremendous for me because I'm different and she is exacting.  As an architect I'm kinda of this way, but she's always pushed me.  She has been the one who really got me to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] because she said there was--I said I wanted to go, she said "Well why don't you go," and well, we applied.  So we applied to Harvard and she went with me and we were at Harvard for a year getting my master's degree and she was working at the library at Harvard University because they had a position open there and somebody asked if there was a wife who needed a temporary job working in the library [Frances Loeb Design Library, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So she got the job working in the library and in the library she read, opened up and saw an application for a Fulbright fellowship to study in Paris [France].  She said, "Go for it," so we filled it out, wrote it, sure enough we were selected to go to Paris, and so it happens though that was a weird time, because I graduated in 1952 and I got my degree in June of '52 [1952] and Jeanne [Madison], our first born came in July of '52 [1952] and I was supposed to sail for Paris in September of '52 [1952], and here we asked and I said, "What'll we do now," and so I said, "let's go," and she said, "let's go," with the baby and all.  Well it was her mother [Julia Bailey Branch] who thought we were absolutely crazy but we said "Why not?"  So Leatrice called up the Fulbright fellowship people and said "What do you do?"  They said, "Not a problem."  Little did we know that going into a foreign country--I spoke the language pretty well, but she didn't speak it fluently and here we are with a two-month old baby (laughter) traveling through the streets of Paris, but we made it, and but Lee has been a stalwart.  She's been there and there's no question if it had not been for her, I can't say I would not have succeeded, who knows about that?  But she having been there certainly has made every contribution possible to my success.
Story_ID: 214576
Speaker 1: And in addition to being wife and mother, I also understand that she [HistoryMaker Leatrice Branch Madison] was an educator?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah she taught school, yeah, as a matter of fact she went through the public school system of Washington [D.C.].  She did not go to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]; she went to Miner Teachers College [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] which is right on, over across the fence from my Howard.  That's where the guys and girls got together, but she went to teachers college and then went, from there though she went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] to get her master's degree in education.  Yeah, she was an educator and she taught school for, I guess up until 1960.  We were married in '49 [1949], so off and on she was teaching and that's what helped me to get started because I could not have made it without that income, and even after leaving the teaching profession, she has been involved in seminars and she's got a career of her own in community service.  She's gonna get the Golden Age Community Service Award in the month of May for her contributions, and she got the University of Chicago Alumni Award a few years ago.
Story_ID: 214577
Speaker 1: And before we get too far away from the point that you made about the [Fulbright] fellowship in France.  Was that a teaching fellowship or for further study (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was a scholar--for further study, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, still in architecture?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah that's all I've ever done, yeah, yeah.  It was a, it was a fellowship and I was assigned to L'Ecole des Beaux [Arts, Paris, France] which is the School of Beautiful Arts in Paris and it was to study prestressed concrete, because at that time prestressed concrete was a common method of construction in Europe but not in America, and the reason is, that in Europe steel was very costly and labor was cheap.  In America the reverse, labor was so expensive here, but steel was cheap, and so what I was learning was how to use the steel in order to offset some of those costs in prestressed concrete, as well as with Le Corbusier who is a great international architect with my professor at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], who was [Walter] Gropius.  Gropius came from the Bauhaus in Germany and Le Corbusier was from Paris [France] so that's what I was studying, I got a chance to travel a lot too.
Speaker 1: Throughout France or throughout Europe?
Speaker 2: Europe, well went to Paris, of course, France, I went to Norway, Sweden, Stockholm [Sweden] and then all through the boot [Italy] and stuff like that, so it was great.
Speaker 1: And this is all in the one year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That you're in Europe?
Story_ID: 214578
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're coming home then in 1953, okay, and again another period of tremendous change when I think about the big sweep of American history, but just on the eve of the [U.S.] Supreme Court's decision in the Brown case [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], and did you notice there was a certain kind of electricity in the air, or what's happening in your life?  You're coming home and you've got all of these qualifications?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I didn't tell you (laughter), I didn't tell you one thing.  What happened after Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], after, after Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I got my degree, but I was working and I was working at Howard University.  I went from Harvard, 'cause again, I was elected president of the class at Harvard.  President of the class.  And all the architectural firms in the country came to Harvard to get the master's class, but nobody even interviewed me you see.  So I was offered this position to teach at Howard University and therefore I went to Howard University to teach there, then the fellowship came, I went to Paris [France], so I came back to teach at Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're not coming back to Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: No, I came back to Howard.
Speaker 1: In '53 [1953], okay so we're still in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm teaching, and I said, you know there's something wrong with this.  You're out here teaching young kids to become architects, and there are no opportunities for them when they graduate.  Somebody's got to do something about this.  I said, me.  So I resigned from the faculty of Howard University, lots of people were very upset, very discouraged.  My mother-in-law [Julia Bailey Branch] said I was crazy, "Got a good solid position here."  She was right, except that I knew where I could go at Howard.  I was going to be dean, there was no question about that.  I was scheduled to be dean in twenty years.  I knew how high I could go.  Out here in this world I knew how low I could go, I could starve to death, but I had no idea what the limit was, and so we took that chance and we came back to Cleveland and then my wife [Leatrice Branch Madison] went to work teaching school--
Story_ID: 214579
Speaker 1: And I opened my office in 1954, and you're right, that was a year.  That was the time of the Freedom Riders [sic.], the school, Board of Education, Brown v. Board of Education [of Topeka, 1954].
Speaker 2: Brown v. Board.
Speaker 1: Brown v. Board of Education, 1954 and I remember then all the turmoil that was going on.  I was flying down to Alabama and I didn't know which, what to do when I got off the airplane, you know.  I knew that you--waiting room, colored waiting rooms, white.  It was all right in Atlanta [Georgia], but in Mobile [Alabama] it was colored and white, so it was like this all the time, and we didn't know what Board of Education meant, Brown v. Board of Education, in terms of what did it really mean?  So it was, it was really a trying period for--and then following that was Rosa Parks, and of course [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.], so that was quite a volatile period in American history for black people.  For me and my office, we didn't have any work that was given to us by clients who were white.  All the work that we had, and I was the first architectural firm of African Americans opened in the State of Ohio.  There weren't many in the whole country, but we did churches, you know small churches and, and we did some remodeling for people to stay alive, and only after much of the Civil Rights Movement did we really get an opportunity to do the kinds of things that we're now doing.
Speaker 2: So fiftieth anniversary year for the Brown decision in 2004, fiftieth anniversary year for--
Speaker 1: Me.
Speaker 2: Madison.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: The architectural firm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I think the name was a little different then, was it not Madison and Madison?
Speaker 1: We've had--it's been several names.  It was, it started out Robert P. Madison, Architect.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then my brother joined me then it became Madison, Madison; that was Julian [Madison], then Bernard [Madison], you know my mother's [Nettie Brown Madison], my mother's dream.  Unfortunately, my father [Robert J. Madison] died before this even became a reality, but she did see Madison; Madison, Madison; Madison, Madison and Madison [Architects and Engineers; Robert P. Madison International, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio], and this was from 1960 until 1970, and in 1970, Bernard, the youngest, who had married a girl from Baltimore [Maryland]--Bernard had a difficult time because he was the youngest and even though he was far more talented, I believe, than I am from a design point of view, he was not motivated, you know he, 'cause he was always looking for the footprints, where's the nearest footprint (laughter)?  He got Stanley [Madison] in front of him, and Julian in front of him, and me in front of them all, but so in 1970 Bernard said, "Look, you know he's always going to be Bobby's [HistoryMaker Robert P. Madison] little brother," so he decided to go out on his own, okay?
Story_ID: 216665
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert P.] Madison, you were talking about the launching of your firm [Robert P. Madison, Architect; Robert P. Madison, International, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio] in 1954, and then the early changes in the name as we moved through the '60s [1960].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah during the '50s [1954], '54 [1954] after we opened--after we, you know our practice was pretty much our friends, and we had a doctor who wanted me to do his office over and his wife wanted me to do the back porch and do the recreational room and the basement.  That was work.  And then Nick Hood [Reverend Nicholas Hood, Sr.] out of Detroit [Michigan] had a church [Plymouth United Church of Christ, Detroit Michigan], and we started doing a church as well as what we call 221(d)(3) housing, federal government housing, and we did a number of government housing projects throughout Detroit and Columbus [Ohio] and Washington, D.C. and Bernard [Madison]--it was Julian [Madison], Julian joined in '56 [1956], and it was Madison and Madison, and then Bernard came on in 1960 after he graduated from his school [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], and so it's Madison, Madison and Madison [Architects and Engineers], and we practiced like that for ten years, and which as I said before he was getting a little bit, and he was right.  People would come into the office and say, "I want to speak to the big boss," you know.  He was never given the kind of recognition that a partner should get, so he just decided to go out on his own.  He went to Washington, Baltimore, Maryland, and we sort of gave him a stipend and he started his own practice, and he practiced until about two years ago.  Then it was Madison, then we went back to Madison, Madison International in 1970, right, and that was Julian and I, and we practiced there until 1983, in which Julian's daughter, Sharon [Madison], who was in Detroit, had joined him; and Julian and I had problems all along, the thirty years of practice.  They were ideological problems. He was--I'm an architect, he's an engineer and we didn't recognize this early on, but architects are dreamers, wild-eyed, "Look, the beauty of the thing is the essence of it," but Julian was far more practical, he was an engineer and for thirty years the struggle between me and the creative effort and Julian the good old practice, "let's get bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger."  Julian was a tremendous person in marketing, he was outgoing, he was a lot like my father [Robert J. Madison] with a kind of bon vivant attitude about life, but in 1983 we'd gotten to a point where he wanted to keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and I said, "Gee whiz I'm tired of getting bigger and bigger," because we had, we had 150 people working for us at one time.  We had offices in Detroit, Chicago [Illinois], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Atlanta [Georgia] and New Jersey, Newark [New Jersey], and I said, "You know Julian, I go to Chicago, and I meet people who are on my payroll I don't even know, (laughter) and what can they do," and I'd go to Detroit, same way, and I said, "so we said look, we've proven we can do so let's just say okay, let's prove that we can still go our separate ways."  So, he, we broke up.  He took over the offices in Detroit, Chicago and Milwaukee [Wisconsin], and I took over the offices in Cleveland and Atlanta.  Soon the office in Atlanta closed, and I retrenched pretty much, because most of the work we had was in Detroit, Chicago and Milwaukee, and he, his office thrived and he did very well, and he was killed, as you may have heard, in 1989 which I was just stunned by, but that was why the Robert P. Madison, Madison, Madison; Madison, Madison, Madison; Madison, Madison; and now back to Robert P. Madison, go the full circle.
Speaker 1: Okay, in fifty years.  So when was it officially Robert P. Madison, International?  Was that a rather recent?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-five [1985].
Speaker 1: Oh, '85 [1985].
Speaker 2: Eighty-five [1985] yeah, '85 [1985], yeah 'cause we left, we started the separation in '83 [1983] and we finally signed the papers in '85 [1985].
Story_ID: 216666
Speaker 1: But I'd like to backtrack a little bit because you talked about your wife [HistoryMaker Leatrice Branch Madison] working while you were establishing yourself as a practicing architect, and she's teaching in Cleveland [Ohio], and soon by the 1970s we're gonna have major problems with charges of racial isolation and other forms of discrimination in the schools in the City of Cleveland.  Some people say ironically, the same time that black teachers are finding employment in the system, in larger and larger numbers, usually in majority black neighborhoods, but, what were your experiences as a--'cause you're living in Cleveland too, I'm assuming at this point.  I know you told me there was one baby [Jeanne Madison] there in 1952, '53 [1953] who went to Paris [France] with you, so what are you thinking as you watch the schools in Cleveland and you've got a little one in your household?
Speaker 2: So this is really interesting, and that's interesting that you should bring that up.  We had an experience that nobody else will ever have.  In 1965, the [Cleveland] Board of Education decided to go on school building projects in which they were going to build whole bunches of new schools called the neighborhood schools, and they asked Madison, Robert P. Madison, no, Madison and Madison [Robert P. Madison, International, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio] at the time, to design the Captain Arthur Roth [Elementary] School [Cleveland, Ohio] out on Woodside Avenue, and we were thrilled to death, absolutely wonderful, and we went to work like mad, and you just wouldn't believe the energy and effort that was put out.  But then the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] said, no, these schools are being built to maintain segregation, because instead of--if the school population was dwindling in the existing buildings, then move the children to where there's open space and where there's open space, in these neighborhoods where they're predominately white.  Well there got to be quite a conflict about the receiving school, that's what it was called, not wanting the sending school to have their children there.  So the NAACP went out and protested and boycotted, protested the construction of these schools.  There I am, in the middle, in terms of "Wow, I'm a member of the NAACP and they're right, they shouldn't build these schools to segregate--but I just got a contract, I'm an architect.  I'm designing a school building, it's gonna cost $2.5 million.  I've never even been able to count that kind of money before, bingo!"  So my brother [Julian Madison] and I said, "Look, we have got to fulfill our contract," which we did.  We completed our work and drawings, completed our specifications, and walked to the board of education at four o'clock on a Friday afternoon and presented the documents to them as they asked us to do, came out the front door, and walked right down to city hall and sat on the floor to protest the construction of the building I just designed.
Story_ID: 216667
Speaker 1: One terrible day, [Reverend] Bruce Klunder was killed and I went up there.  I'm not sure who the mayor was at this time [sic. Ralph Locher], but anyway, the newspaper--it spread like wildfire.  It was the school [Stephen E. Howe Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio] on--it starts with an L, the street up there that starts with an L.  Anyway, we're on 126th Street and--Lakeview [Road], Lakeview, and they announced that somebody had been killed at the site of the Lakeview school and I went up there, and it happens that the lawyer for the [Cleveland] Board of Education was [William T.] McKnight, Bill McKnight.  He was a fraternity brother of mine.  The crowds were emerging like you wouldn't believe, coming from all over because Bruce Klunder was a minister, was a priest, a white man, and he was also leading, in concert with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the protest not to build these schools, and to show his commitment he laid down on the ground, and it happens that the bulldozer driver didn't see behind him, ran over his body and crushed him to death, and of course everybody came from everyplace to see this, to protest that.  It was a terrible time in the history of Cleveland schools.  Of course, they continued to build 'em, and they finally built my school [Captain Arthur Roth Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio].  It's a nice building, but I wonder now about what we seeing here, and we're going into another building program right now, which is also waste in my view of what could've done back there in the '60s [1960s] rather than wait this long.  I believe that the school system has reacted to the society's concerns and demands, and there were those in Little Italy [Cleveland, Ohio] who didn't want those black kids to come out there and in Collinwood [Cleveland, Ohio] and et cetera, et cetera, and they started this and didn't work either, so we're still going around in circles because consistently the education is beginning to be deteriorated.
Speaker 2: Okay, so if I'm not mistaken, Reverend Klunder's death took place in 1964?
Speaker 1: Was it '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure because people are starting to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think you're right, no you're right, you're right and it was '63 [1963] that I got that building to do, right, it was '63 [1963] right, you're right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right because--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah I'm sorry, it was--
Speaker 2: Because people are revisiting that.
Speaker 1: No, it was '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Since this is 2004.
Speaker 1: It's '63 [1963], '63 [1963] is when I got my job, '64 [1964] is when he died, you're right.
Speaker 2: Okay, and so.
Speaker 1: Well, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 2: We have all these things happening in the early '60s [1960], you know at the same time they were getting all of these promises coming out of Washington [D.C.] on the heels of the great March on Washington, and then tragically Kennedy's [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] assassination, but then the promise of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 you know that finally it's in writing that this kind of discrimination that blacks have experienced for hundreds of years is now against the law.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Reinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the [U.S.] Constitution.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 216668
Speaker 1: In the early '60s [1960] is your wife [HistoryMaker Leatrice Branch Madison] still teaching in the [Cleveland public] schools as they're going to--
Speaker 2: She stopped teaching in 1960, she stopped teaching (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so at the beginning of that decade.  Okay, and what's happening at home?  You have the one child that you told me about?
Speaker 2: Oh my God, yeah, yeah, yeah, that was terrible (laughter), that's--at that time we were living on Willowmere [Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio], and she [Jeanne Madison] was enrolled in a school which was the same situation, she had to cross several streets to get to Columbia School [Cleveland, Ohio] that she was supposed to go to, and then they transferred her from there to Franklin D. Roosevelt [Elementary] School [Cleveland, Ohio] which is around the corner, except half day.  They were only going a half day, and they had some kids come in the afternoon and some in the morning.  Well, I said, "This is un--this is ridiculous."  So I wanted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's the reasoning, excuse me, behind that, why the relay classes, well why were they doing that?
Speaker 2: They had more children than they had buildings.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't have rooms for them.
Speaker 1: So that's how they deal with overcrowding, just give a half day of education?
Speaker 2: That's exactly it until they built new buildings, which is why I was saying they could've sent them someplace else.  But I went up to the school and I said the teacher, "Look I can't do this, I'm not gonna do this, I'm not going stand for that."  So then that teacher decided to send her to Major Works [Major Work Program].  She was tested and she went to Major Works and that was how that problem temporarily was solved, but I said, this is not working either, so we finally, I just got, bought a lot in Cleveland Heights [Ohio] and designed the building, the house, and we moved to the house and she went to Cleveland Heights school [sic. Roxboro Elementary School, Cleveland Heights, Ohio], but that was how we personally solved that problem, but so many could not do that.
Speaker 1: And just for the record that Major Work Program, that's an honors program for academically talented students.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, you gotta be good.
Speaker 1: And you have two daughters right?
Speaker 2: Two daughters, right.
Speaker 1: Okay and what are their names?
Speaker 2: Jeanne Marie Madison, that's the oldest and Juliette Branch Madison, that's the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay, did either of them follow you in--
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: No, they have their own interests?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they really are talented but they should have, but I don't know.  Maybe somebody says, children do not follow in the footsteps of their fathers who are architects, because they see them working all the time (laughter), Saturdays and Sundays, but they're very talented, artistically.  Jeanne is now in the development department of Case Western Reserve University [Cleveland, Ohio].  She got a degree from Case Western Reserve University, a first degree, and a second degree from Case Western Reserve University.
Speaker 1: Not Case [School of Applied Science, Cleveland, Ohio], but Case Western Reserve University?
Speaker 2: Case Western Reserve, she got a degree in philosophy, the first degree, a bachelor's [degree] from Case Western Reserve University, the second degree was from the Weatherhead School of Management [Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], Case Weatherhead School, and she's now teaching, she's now working up there in the development department.  The other daughter is in Washington, D.C. and she was a--she took a course, she got her degree from Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] in what's called urban studies, and she was working in a number of planning areas, planning firms, doing very well, and she finally got connected up with Fannie Mae  [Federal National Mortgage Association, Washington, D.C.] and worked for Fannie Mae for a while then she got an offer to go with PMI [Mortgage Insurance Co.], which is a private mortgage investment company, one of the top Wall Street firms, and she was the vice president there, but then they had a retrenchment in force and she was let go, and so she decided to become a potter.  She's now making pots (laughter), but she's happy, she's happy.
Story_ID: 216669
Speaker 1: We've heard a lot about the institution of the family and how that shaped your experiences while you were a student, and then as you ventured out to establish yourself as an architect.  I'd like to talk also about some of the other organizations and institutions that you've mentioned.  You mentioned your fraternity without mentioning the name, but can you tell me a little bit about your fraternity and how you came to be a member?
Speaker 2: Well two of them, one of them is an undergraduate fraternity at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], that's Alpha Phi [Alpha Fraternity].  I don't mind.  You don't want me to tell you the names, or--
Speaker 1: Oh, no please do.
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity is at Howard.  I got there; I was initiated at Howard University and Howard at that time, the Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] of the black--capstone of Negro education.  Alpha Phi Alpha considered itself to be the elite fraternity of the elite school, that's the Alphas, and you just pledged to be there, and you were happy to be there, so I was an Alpha man.  Sigma Pi Phi [Fraternity] is another fraternity.  That's a graduate fraternity and it's--it was founded in 1904, the hundredth year for it, this year, great big celebration in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] where it was founded.  But W.E.B. Du Bois was one of the prime movers in this, and he had authored that phrase about the talented tenth, all right, and you'd get the talented tenth that could do this, that and the other, so I was elected to Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, the Boule, it's called, in Cleveland [Ohio] and it would be forty years ago.  Is it forty years ago?  Yeah, '63 [1963], no it was forty years ago last year, but that's a fraternity of supposedly, you know I think that's great, distinguished, accomplished persons.  We have, the President of Tri-C [Cuyahoga Community College, Cleveland, Ohio] was a member there, the president of The [Cleveland] Foundation [Cleveland, Ohio], Steve Minter [HistoryMaker Steven A. Minter].
Speaker 1: So was that President Nolen Ellison?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know Nolen?
Speaker 1: Know of his work.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Nolen.
Speaker 1: Didn't know him personally.
Speaker 2: Nolen Ellison, so it's a collection of men who are--black men who are considered by their peers to be among the achievers.  We're not necessarily friends, but we had come together once a month and we have so many diverse interests there and professions there.  There are doctors and lawyers and dentists and architects and scientists and ministers and that's what the fraternity, that fraternity is.
Speaker 1: Okay, and with that group, especially with the influence of Du Bois, do you still focus on this charge that he gave to the talented tenth to uplift the race?
Speaker 2: We do, not as much as we should, but you see the other thing though is that as time goes on, the theoretical need for that diminishes because we got a freer society now and all.  See you know when that happened, for example, I couldn't occupy a building on this corner back in those days, a black man, but as society has changed the need is still there, we both know that, but somehow it's deluded by a number of other organizations who think they can do it and we don't have to do it again, but we try to set an example.  I remember once we went, we adopted a school and we went out to see the elementary school.  We went out to see all the--only the males in the senior class of the elementary school, sixth grade, and we walked into that room and the teacher says they had never seen so many black men with neckties on, suits on, lawyers, one was a judge, lawyers, doctors, and it was just an uplifting experience for those youngsters, because they didn't have to be basketball players, which is what is the biggest thing I have in my whole thinking process, is we've got to break away from that mold, that sort of stratifies who we are and what we can become, that's what fraternities do.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity is the oldest African American (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, Sigma Pi Phi, Sigma Pi Phi is the oldest African American fraternity, period.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Alpha Phi Alpha is the oldest undergraduate fraternity and that was in 1906.
Speaker 1: For African American men?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Story_ID: 216670
Speaker 1: But there are other institutions that you mentioned too, especially the African Methodist Episcopal [A.M.E.] church and, and your mother's [Nettie Brown Madison] roots in the spirituality that's associated with that institution, and how different perhaps that religious experience was from the holy roller experience (laughter) that you noticed in [Washington] D.C., but can you tell me about St. John A.M.E. [Church, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, St. John A.M.E. at the time I went to school there, it was incredible.  I mean, of course to be an A.M.E. was also--see Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio] was funded by the A.M.E. founder, and Wilberforce's ministers of A.M.E. church were all educated because they went to theological school, therefore theoretically, the A.M.E. church attracted the intelligentsia, theoretically, but for me and there's no doubt in my mind that when we went to St. John's A.M.E. Church during the [Great] Depression years, it was a source of inspiration, a source of everything and we were in church on Sunday, all day.  It was Christian Endeavor, and come back on Wednesday (laughter), and on Saturday and almost and my mother was a devout power in the  Church, she got to be a big deacon and all that sort of stuff, but it was a formative ground for me.  I was the oldest, a little less so for Julian [Madison] and as they grew older, it became a little less, less and less, but St. John was really a--it was the inspiration for me and my life.  I, we, you really believe that if God meant it to be so, it would be so, and whatever happened, well that's God will, and my mother particularly, you know.  The world could be falling down, "It's God's will," you know and (laugher) and, so it was a source for her of survival.  My wife [HistoryMaker Leatrice Branch Madison] says denial, I mean things get bad, couldn't pay the rent, man come to collect rent, she says, "Don't worry, I can't pay the rent today, but I'll buy the house next week." (Laughter)  Another week goes by, but for my mother and for me there's no question that the church, and it's a national A.M.E. church connection all over, has been.  It's sorta seen some--well, all religion is not seeing the days it use to see, because you know what's happening in society, but it was really the fountainhead of much of the energy and belief that I have, and my mother had, and my brothers had.
Speaker 1: We drove past St. John A.M.E. this week, historic St. John right on East 40th Street.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's it, that's it.
Speaker 1: And that's the church that you attended as a child.
Speaker 2: That's it, that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay, same location?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right, and St. John, according to the best historical record that we can reconstruct, is the oldest African American congregation in the City of Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, probably.
Speaker 1: So when you say you're at church all day Sunday and back on Wednesday, and did you say Saturday also?  What's going on there?  Is it all religious services and prayer meetings or what other kinds of things are happening?
Speaker 2: Well for us, in the--they had a youth program there which was, we'd go on roller skating trips, but it was a--this group, Christian Endeavor.  We had study of course, we had parties, you know, good Christian clean-living parties.  It was, outside of the school, that was where we went, and I went to an all boys' school [East Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio], so that was where I had most of my, really the kind of--what activity we did have socially was sprung from the church.
Story_ID: 216671
Speaker 1: And I wanted to ask also about another organization that you mentioned, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and that you were a member of the NAACP in this period of school protest even as you're getting your first contract (laughter) to design a school [Captain Arthur Roth Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: But what did the NAACP represent at that point in African American history?
Speaker 2: The NAACP at that point represented the organization that was on our side.  You know it was, "I'm on your side."  They truly was on, were on our side from the point of view.  The legal department fought the battles that had to be fought, job opportunities.  The NAACP inquired why certain things were not being done for the employment of other people. The NAACP was an absolute powerhouse of activity, it was, everybody who really believed belonged.  You contributed because they were out there in the firing lines.  Thurgood Marshall was truly involved in that.  It was a source of not only for African Americans, but for good white people, who believed that this in truth was how America should be and, there were those who participated fully contributing to make it a better society.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you have this multi-racial coalition within the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: In Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You see that same kind of mix.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's in the 1960s again with all the activism especially around the issue of education, but the '70s [1970s] things are heating up a little bit more, 'cause we're getting close now to this desegregation suit being filed by the NAACP.  Do you recall what you thought when that suit was filed in Reed v. Rhodes [1976], what you thought about the state of affairs in the public schools in Cleveland as described by the NAACP?
Speaker 2: Which suit was this?
Speaker 1: Reed v. Rhodes the desegregation case in the Cleveland schools?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I remember that, but there's a step before that.
Speaker 1: Okay, well let's (laughter).
Speaker 2: A step before that; and the step before that was [Mayor] Carl Stokes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now when I said the step before that because you see you have to have the climate of the administration of the city plus councilmen who were able to bring about political, shall we say, influence that could make this thing go.  I think that the integration effort was well thought out, well planned and I think it worked, but you had to have a political power behind it and in the '70s [1970s], you know the '50s [1950s] was Brown v. Board of Education [of Topeka, 1954], the '70s [1970s] was the emergence of black mayors and black power.  Now I don't mean this, I'm talking about real power, and that's why we had these offices in Detroit [Michigan], (unclear), Detroit, Chicago [Illinois], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Atlanta [Georgia], black mayors, Gary [Indiana], New Jersey, they had black mayors.  Black mayors could hire black architects; that's how we got work.
Story_ID: 216672
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert P.] Madison, it's 1967, and Carl Burton Stokes has just been elected mayor of the City of Cleveland [Ohio], first African American to serve as mayor of a major northern city, and a lot of people are celebrating, okay.  Was there really cause for that kind of jubilation that I see on all this footage from 1967?
Speaker 2: First of all you had to go back to '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You see in '65 [1965] he ran against Ralph [S.] Locher, who was the incumbent mayor, and he came right very close, very close but, what it did say was, wow, this is possible, and so from '65 [1965] to '67 [1967] we were getting ready.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were getting ready, and it was a coalition of blacks and whites 'cause there was not a majority population in Cleveland of blacks, and we really worked, and I was with Carl a lot because I was writing the material that he was reading about urban renewal, the stuff I knew about.  So I was sort of his urban renewal guru if you will.  As a matter of fact I was appointed on his quasi-cabinet for a while, but the absolutely poignant occurrence happened at the City Club [of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio] on that famous Friday [November 3, 1967] before the election in which Seth Taft was his opponent, and Seth Taft was white.  Seth Taft was the son or the grandson of not only the Senator [Robert Alphonso] Taft, but President [William Howard] Taft; all of that.  Carl Stokes, whose mother [Louise Stokes] was doing cleaning and who did not have a--that kind of heritage, so you got this almost classic contest between the elite Brahmin-type and the untouchables, and it happens that I knew them both very well, and the City Club debate when the tight was--the race was very tight, Seth Taft had talked about how Carl Stokes was an absentee this, was an absentee that, he didn't serve the legislature very well, he didn't do this and that and Carl at the very last minute pulled out this letter that said, "Dear Carl Stokes, I commend you for the record that you have made as a member of the state legislature in Columbus, Ohio" signed Seth Taft, and Carl Stokes threw it down and you could hear the towel fall apart.  Well, when he was elected he was like the messiah had come, and perhaps it was too much expectancy.  I mean, to believe that a black man could be elected mayor of a city like this back in those days was definitely unthinkable.  This morning I gave an example of what I regard as the kind of qualificationing [sic.] when Marian Anderson wasn't allowed to sing only because she was black.  So here was Carl Stokes elected a mayor of this city.  In other words, it disproved everything that had been said before.  We thought really that this was the greatest thing ever to happen, and we celebrated, and we loved it, and I think Carl Stokes did a great job, but the expectancy of what he was supposed to do could never be fulfilled.  You know, people who were out there walking the streets said, "Oh, Carl will give me a job."  Well, he couldn't give people jobs (laughter).  He couldn't make instant people over, he couldn't change--he did all he could but it was, it was--first of all the exercise of power and the fact that he could sit in that chair and say, "This I will do" even though he didn't have all the votes, et cetera but at least it was symbolic power that he represented--power, success.  He was a very good looking guy, he was a good dresser and he made us proud, he really made us proud, but he had his problems too and not only his problems.  But what happened, and I won't forget this, was there was a shooting up at 110th Street, some sort of supposedly black na- see, a couple of things.  You know about Cleveland: Now!, when he asked everybody to give money, and these school children from all--even the suburbs were putting their pennies in the pot to make Cleveland great.  Well when Ahmed Evans, I think his name was, and his group [Black Nationalists of New Libya] started this conflict up there, they finally found out that he had been funded by some of the money that went into Cleveland: Now!  Carl didn't give them the money to buy guns, Carl gave them the money to buy food and to buy housing and to buy this, but when it was found out, 'cause that's what this money came from then the whole thing fell apart, and it was a terrible embarrassment, but he survived that, and I think that his legacy was he had done it, and he gave us pride, and he gave us the sense that we can too, and he changed things around--
Story_ID: 216673
Speaker 1: --For example, after all the years I had been trying to get a job, that's what I meant by the '70s [1970s].  He [Mayor Carl Stokes] could say I want [HistoryMaker Robert P.] Madison considered for this project.  Nobody else even bothered, and I was considered, and we did deliver, and that was the beginning of our portfolio in terms of, yes.  We were ready, though, I'd been ready, getting ready for them, so when he asked, he said, do it, we did it.  It wasn't a lot of work but it's symbolic that we were able to design the first and fourth district police stations for the City of Cleveland [Ohio].  First time that had ever been done, that was with Carl, and not only Carl.  So then came [Mayor Richard G.] Hatcher in Gary, Indiana and [Mayor Harold] Washington in Chicago, Illinois and Detroit [Michigan], I can't think of his name right now, and in--
Speaker 2: Well [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. W.] Wilson Goode [Sr.] was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] right?
Speaker 1: Goode was in Philadelphia, right.
Speaker 2: Detroit.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That's terrible.
Speaker 1: I'll think of it in a minute, Mayor Coleman.
Speaker 2: Coleman Young?
Speaker 1: Coleman Young, yeah and in Atlanta [Georgia] was Maynard Jackson and we began, and this was, this was the beginning of real power that these black people had.  So I could then go to city hall and say, "I'd like to get a job," and nobody would say, "there's the back door." (Laughter) Come in, let's see what you can do.  So that was really, I mean the--all you want about Rosa Parks, and the fist and all that, that was all a part of the beginning, but finally when we got a hold of the reins of power, and the political machinery, things then really began to change for black Americans, for African Americans.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you, that term that you've used several times now, real power, you see the basis for that power in political power, economic power or combination of the two?
Speaker 1: Both of them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Both of them, because if you've got political power and we don't have any jobs to give people, that doesn't mean anything, but you've got to have the kind--and that, and it springs from that.
Story_ID: 216674
Speaker 1: And this is in that Black Power Movement era of the late '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: Do you see any good coming out of that?
Speaker 2: Well, well, let's take that on for a minute too, because I remember when Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] was walking through Mississippi and all of a sudden put up his fist and said, "Black power, black power, black power."  Well, in effect what that was to do is as far as I'm concerned, was to undermine the image that African Americans or colored people had of themselves.  That image emanated what from white people thought of black people, in that lighter skinned white people were here, better educated, darker skinned black people were not to be reckoned with, but when you said black power, it wasn't colored, it wasn't Negroes, it was black, and I mean we all were there to get it.  So no matter how light you were, and how many dollars you had, you were still black and this is when people started going through saying "Hi brother," we in the black--you didn't speak to people--
Speaker 1: Outside of the church?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, and I think that--but you see the only thing about that black power as far as I'm concerned, it was corrupting, because it's all right to say that "I'm somebody."  But--and we're all together, but to say because I'm black, I'm entitled to this, and because I'm black I can put on the dashiki and you gotta take me in, because I'm black I can use black English.  That's the corrupting of this black power thing is what I'm saying.  I mean black power in my view is that "Yes we must have," but if we're in this framework we've got to compete in this framework, and I remember when they were talking about black English and I said you can't compete in Wall Street speaking black English, and I can't compete here as an architect designing buildings that fall down.  So then when black power might be an entitlement for me to have an opportunity, it does not entitle me to be selected to do unless I can, I can really deliver, and to some extent I think that it was stretched too far.  Are you with me on what I'm--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I think so, I mean, and I do get a little bit concerned about, if we're still in the framework of America, if we're still in the framework of teaching at the university, you ought to come to the university looking like you're a university student.  You ought to come to the university looking like you are a university professor.  I see some of these people who think well, "I'm black," (unclear) and you go to some of these public schools, the elementary schools, I'm disappointed in that the teachers don't take upon themselves, in my view, an image of themselves, but say just because I'm black I can do what I wanna do, and I don't--that's what I believe about the corrupting of that phrase "black power" and some people take it to become lazy, you know, I don't have to do, I'm black, stuff like that.
Speaker 1: All right, but again another kind of power movement or empowerment movement rooted in the 1960s.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you know, when I think about this image that you presented to us earlier of having come full circle, [HistoryMaker] Robert P. Madison, starting with that name and then here again after 1985 with that name again, and maintaining that now in the early years of the 21st century.  Maybe by the 1960s the era of [Mayor Carl] Stokes--we've come the semi-circle, you know and now you've got the opportunity to be empowered.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now you can compete.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: The door's open.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and tell me about--you said that was the beginning?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 216675
Speaker 1: What was the next step beyond the [Mayor] Carl Stokes era, beyond 1971?
Speaker 2: I think you know which is also very interesting about this, the Black Power Movement is that, you know once upon a time Karamu [House, Cleveland, Ohio] was a really truly integrated institution, and when the Black Power Movement, I'm talking about that kind of black power of "We're us, you're them, them and us."  Karamu, people began to push out the white participants there, funding and all that, and so what you then began to get was these two separate societies.  You know we're doing like this and then black power tends to do it like that.  Well, that's not gonna succeed in America, I mean it's got to be a thing together.  I think that, I think, I must tell you I have very ambivalent feelings about the things that took place in my life because I remember when there were drug stores on corners owned by African Americans, by black people.  I remember when there were excellent restaurants owned and operated by black people.  I remember when there were architectural firms owned and operated, in the South, not in the--in here, doing work in the colleges, Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama], but then with this elimination of that, you don't see the corner drug store and black folks in drug stores anymore.  You don't see black people with restaurants that are classy like they used to be.  You don't see the nightclubs owned by blacks, you don't see those things happening, because ostensibly we are desegregated, but we're not integrated, and it's an interesting phenomenon because right now my predecessors in the architectural profession were people like McKissacks [Moses McKissack III and Calvin McKissack] and [Albert I.] Cassell.  They built and designed and built Howard University [Washington, D.C.], they designed and built Lincoln University [Chester County, Pennsylvania], they designed and built Southern University [and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia].  Today, I'm an architect and I go down there, I can put my credentials in and some white firm out in New York City [New York, New York] is getting the contract at Hampton.  Now, we can compete with them, and we should compete with them, and I don't mean it should be reserved, but I can't go to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and get a job teaching (laughter) designing a building.  I can try, but the likelihood is that doesn't happen, so there is, we have a serious conflict here about the black professional, the black, you know I was thinking there used to be black hospitals, now, I'm having a problem with it all, do you follow me?  Well, they, we don't have it anymore and you can go to any hospital you want to, but black administrators in hospitals are no longer there, so it's a real dilemma that we're going through, and I think this will be struggles, and eventually though, tracks will be formed and we'll be all right, but I won't be here.
Story_ID: 216676
Speaker 1: Well as someone who had a hand in rebuilding the city as part of urban renewal, you know in this Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] era, the fifty years since the 1954 ruling in the [U.S.] Supreme Court case, what's your assessment of the balance sheet on the new Cleveland [Ohio]?  You know with slum clearance, urban renewal, are we better off building wise, architecturally because urban renewal was a part of Cleveland's history?
Speaker 2: I think urban renewal was a terrible--I think the way urban renewal was done, it was a mistake, and I think urban renewal was done, and I don't believe altruistically.  I remember when they said we would clear out the Central [Cleveland, Ohio] area, all those houses go out there and they did.  Went in there and bulldozed them and built public housing. Now what they did was to recreate the ghetto with cleaner rooms, but it's still the ghetto.  I remember seeing vast areas just bulldozed out.  I'm talking about residential areas now and then you get block after block after block of uninspired, minimalist buildings for people to live in.
Speaker 1: Are these the projects?
Speaker 2: These are the projects?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You've been to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know anything about, not (unclear), but--
Speaker 1: Cabrini Green [Homes, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Cabrini Green and Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois], I mean those things are--my point is that the idea of removing slums, yes, but do you rebuild them so inexpensive, so cheaply that the same people move back there.  So all you got, all you have now is a cleaner slum.  So what I'm saying, buildings can influence behavior of people.  I believe that as an architect.  And I believe that buildings can inspire people, because you walk into them and, "My goodness, this is wonderful."  I don't think that we have taken that seriously in terms of our urban renewal philosophy in the cities that I know about, because if the house is bad and you got ten of 'em in a row okay, but the ten people there don't have to be the same and if we had dispersal throughout, we wouldn't have what we have today.  So as I go, as I drive through Cleveland now, I weep sometimes.  I'm talking about from my office [at Robert P. Madison International, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio] drive through to--I live now in Shaker Heights [Ohio], but I see vast acres of nothingness.  Where once I use to play on those playgrounds; St. John's A.M.E. Church [ St. John A.M.E. Church, Cleveland, Ohio] was full of houses, we went to and we'd go to church in the morning.  The playground was right across the street in the backyard and the street, all that.  Vibrant, community, poor, but there and it was the street, and there was the corner drug store and the corner grocery store (laughter) and we knew the corner and the guy would loan you credit, let you have a piece of candy, life, but that's gone now to the extent that we've got a socioeconomic grouping of people here and they, it's nothing but a downward spiral and I'm--I don't mean to say that other than the fact that I weep for what I see in some of these areas where it didn't have to be that way.  Therefore, the philosophy of urban renewal, sometimes was construed, not to mean urban renewing but renewal, removal and sometimes it just reinforced a kind of a stereotypical grouping of people and--you see, I lived in the projects when I was there earlier, right?  Projects--we lived at 2566-B, East 43rd Street [Cleveland, Ohio].  My mother [Nettie Brown Madison]--'cause that was new housing then, but in that grouping you had different--my father [Robert J. Madison] was a college person.  We just didn't have enough opportunity to afford other kinds of housing, but now you got almost a similar socioeconomic grouping right across the board, and that is not inspiring, and I lived in the ghetto when I lived on 59th Street.  It was the ghetto, and right across the street was a doctor, and there was a funeral director moved down the street here and there was a lawyer up the street here and there was the pimp running around the corner and there was the prostitutes on the other street (laughter), it was all there and the only thing we had in common, we were all black.  And I could look across the street, "I wanna be like that doctor," or I could be like the pimp, but more than likely we would be like the doctor or this, but now with the stratification it's not--am I talking too much?
Speaker 1: No, this is fine.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: It's your story, you get to tell it.
Speaker 2: Theoretically I'm talking, I'm really, I guess I am--architecture is my vehicle, but what I think about life is what I think is what makes us go.
Story_ID: 216677
Speaker 1: Just because you've made this connection earlier between something that was aesthetically pleasing to your mother [Nettie Brown Madison], your picture of the sailboat, and her fueling your desire to be architect, or sort of planting that vision in your mind, I wanted to ask about art and architecture.  You talked about Karamu [House, Cleveland, Ohio], our historic theater for African Americans in Cleveland [Ohio].  Do you think that art still has an important role to play in shaping the visions of young people in the 21st century?
Speaker 2: Sure I do, and art in the form of music, drama, architecture, sculpture, all of that to me is art, and I think that after you get out of the sciences, art is a thing that is inspirational, that you can connect to, you can react to. There is no doubt in my mind that more of that in the lives of young people, and I'm talking art, paintings, sculpture, lithographs, whatever, and I'm talking music.  I was at the office [Robert P. Madison International, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio] this morning.  We were talking about one thing, why are there not more black people playing in the Cleveland Orchestra [Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 1: And how many do we have, if I may ask at this?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Two.
Speaker 2: One black woman, one black man, and I'm really--I said, look, this is unacceptable.  How long has it been like this?  That's when I give the story about Marian Anderson again (laughter), but the point is, what drives me crazy, is to talk to young black kids and they say, "I wanna be a basketball player."  Well we know why, so I said we've got to start making heroes out of art people.  Heroes out of people playing in the violin section of the orchestra so somebody, "I wanna be like them."  So yes, I do think it is not only important--necessary.  It is something that you can latch onto.  A kid could get a piece of crayon and do something like that, and get something out of it.
Speaker 1: And you're pointing to an architectural drawing which is off-camera.  I just wanted to say that (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, well this happens to be the drawing we made for when we were designing the community college out there on the eastern campus [of Cuyahoga Community College, Cleveland, Ohio].  I believe they were.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the arts are important.
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: And I know that you're an important patron of the arts in Cleveland.  You told us earlier--
Speaker 2: I'm a patron of the arts, yeah.
Speaker 1: You sponsored the radio broadcast?
Speaker 2: I have sponsored the radio broadcast to [HistoryMaker] A. Grace Lee Mims called 'The Black Arts.'
Speaker 1: And you're a trustee for the Cleveland Orchestra?
Speaker 2: I'm a trustee on the board of trustees for the Cleveland Orchestra and the Cleveland Opera [Theater, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I happen to like music.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I love it.
Story_ID: 216678
Speaker 1: I love opera, that's another story.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'll tell it to you (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right now?
Speaker 1: Right now.
Speaker 2: Okay, let's hear it.
Speaker 1: In the school of architecture [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I told you about the school of architecture.  We worked every Saturday, every Saturday.  We used to work, architecture, designing buildings, you don't know when the inspiration is gonna come.  Well it was, in this, back in those days only one radio owned by one person in that class, and he happened to like opera, and he happened to turn it on and there were ten of us in the room, and we said, "Look, turn that thing off.  We want to hear some Duke Ellington or some Artie Shaw, something like that."  He said, "This is my radio, you don't have to listen."  Well, he turned on the Metropolitan Opera [New York, New York] every Saturday and so we'd sit up there and say this is crazy.  Well, after the forced exposure to it, we said, "Well, let's listen," and pretty soon we started listening more and more and more and I'll tell you what really captured the imagination, and very few can understand this.  In my day the motion pictures in terms of depicting black people was Tarzan, and Africa, and they were all savages, and jungle people, you know.  That is what the movies had.  Here was an opera called 'Aida,' [Giuseppe Verdi] and we started listening.  Here was a king of Egypt, who was black, and the king and queen of Ethiopia, Aida was an Ethiopian princess, wow.  This is some great stuff isn't it, and then we got captured by the music, and we said well if somebody in Italy can write about Aida, about how wonderful it is to be black, then this is good, this is for us. Then later on, about a year later I went to Italy to fight the war [World War II, WWII], and when you get over there, that's all you see is opera, all you hear.  We started going to the opera houses every weekend when we were off, just like you go to the movies here, and I really began to not only fall for the opera, the stories, but almost a critic of it.  I know opera cause I heard it over there where it started, and that's how I got involved and I--for me I can play it and it becomes peaceful, like, and it just stirs me up to such an extent that it makes life worthwhile, and I--a lot of youngsters can do that, and I think we must do more of that, not just opera, but music and art as you say, and I would like architecture to believe that becomes a part of it.

Speaker 1: But this is your fiftieth anniversary year for this firm [Robert P. Madison International, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio] and you're living your dream.  You talked about the small projects at the beginning.  I read something that talked about millions of dollars in work in recent years, have you arrived?  Are there other things out there on the horizon that you want for the firm (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you see, first of all, the one thing about architecture is after you finish one project, you have to go looking for another one (laughter). You see, it's not like making widgets where you keep on making widgets.  It's not like having a patient and you keep coming back, we designed, we were working on the Cleveland Browns' football stadium [Cleveland Browns Stadium, FirstEnergy Stadium, Cleveland, Ohio].  We were not the design architect; we were what we call the architect of record.  It was my job to transform the design into working drawings, so you could build it, and we were responsible for getting it built. "Well how many stadiums do you build?" (Laughter) One, so, better go look for another job.  The point I'm making is that we have arrived at the point that no longer does anyone question our ability to do big things, we can do it.  No longer does anyone question whether or not these, this firm is capable.  We can do that.  We have not arrived yet, because we are not getting the private work, and I say that by saying we were interviewed by a private school and I showed them dozens of classrooms we've done for the public schools.  They said, "Oh [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert P.] Madison what a wonderful portfolio you have, but how many private schools have you done?"  And we said, "What's the difference between a private school classroom and a public school classroom?"  Nothing, so we have not arrived from the point of view of people saying "Yep, let's look at his credentials and employ him."  We still have a struggle in the private sector, but that too will come.

Speaker 1: This is a photograph of the American embassy office building in Dakar, Senegal.  This is a photograph, night shot and as you know Dakar is, was formerly the capital of French West Equatorial Africa and on the right is the foreground, fore court which has the fountains in it.  Now mind you, this building was designed in 1965, completed in 1977, and that was before we had these terrible things happen to embassies throughout the world.  So you see we built right on the street because at that time we could be very invitational, so the Dakar people could come into the United States Information Service [United States Information Agency, USIA], a very open, a very friendly, very nice building.  The--I'm told that all the diplomatic corps who've seen it like it very much.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And me at some fundraising dinner some years ago.  John Glenn was the senator from Ohio at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Suppose this is one of my favorite pictures (laughter).  It's a picture of me as a freshman at the school of architecture at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and that drawing board and the pencil became my--and T-square became my companions for the rest of my life.  That's how I designed buildings.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Photograph of the graduating class.  No, that's a photograph of me in my cap and gown when I graduated from East Technical High School in Cleveland, Ohio.  I think I was sixteen, I was sixteen years then when I graduated.
Speaker 2: Tiny, tiny, tiny, wow!
Speaker 1: That's so small.
Speaker 2: The significance of this photograph is that I was a--this is the master's class at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I am obviously on the left.  I was president of the class at that time, and in the center is Walter Gropius who was our professor, and at the time Walter Gropius only took in eight students a semester and he was very selective.  We had classmates from China, Hungary, Germany, and all parts of the United States.  So if you got in the master's class at Harvard, you were somebody, theoretically, so we thought.
Speaker 1: And this is very good to follow with this next picture because these are my classmates.  Those were my classmates at Harvard.  These are my classmates at Western Reserve University [Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], except the difference is, the picture of Harvard was taken in 1952, when I was a student there, and this picture was taken when we had our fiftieth anniversary from the Reserve which is 1998 (laughter) so there's a difference of time between those two pictures.
Speaker 2: This was me and a young lady friend from the church [St. John A.M.E. Church, Cleveland, Ohio], and I was home on leave from the [U.S.] Army prior to going overseas, Second World War [World War II, WWII].  That picture would be 1944.
Speaker 1: Where was that taken?
Speaker 2: That was taken in the projects of Cleveland, Ohio (laughter) where we lived at that time.
Speaker 1: I have no idea why this picture was put in, but it's just a picture of me and two contractors.  I guess it was some kind of a fundraiser, but you can see I'm much older than I was in the earlier pictures.  Two contractors, one is Mr. Leroy Hassan [ph.] on the right, and the other is Thomas Cook, I think, on the left.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me in high school.  Wait a minute, I think that's a picture of me, probably, no it's more likely a picture of me in my freshman year at college, 'cause I have a mustache that's rather pronounced at that time, and I was wearing bow ties.  Hairstyles do change.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This, I looked at this, saw all that hair on my head.  My goodness gracious!  This was, this is a picture of me with the president [of Cuyahoga Community College, Cleveland, Ohio], that's Nolen Ellison right there at some function.  This would be about vintage, about, let me see about twelve years ago.  That would put us at about, what 1990, middle of 1990 I think.  I don't remember who the third guy is, I think that's Jack Flower [John Flower] who probably is now--that look like Jack Flower, he's the President of CSU [Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Um?
Speaker 1: It may or may not be.
Speaker 2: But definitely Nolen Ellison.
Speaker 1: That's Nolen Ellison, oh yeah, that's Nolen Ellison.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is a photograph of me and my mother [Nettie Brown Madison] and my baby brother [Julian Madison], my younger brother.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Straighten it a little bit, I'm just getting a glare.
Speaker 2: Okay, let's see.
Speaker 1: I don't know who the woman is on the right but that was, that was a period of time when I was--my father [Robert J. Madison] was teaching at Selma University [Selma, Alabama] and we were rather affluent at that time.  You see a car, that's our car and then the [Great] Depression hit, okay.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Photograph of me taken at the dedication, no, I'm not sure when that picture was taken.  At first I thought it was a dedication of a building I designed but it may be at the commencement exercises for my daughter.  I think that's what it is because I can see the building in the background. It looks like something on a campus.
Speaker 2: Okay, that is me and my wife [HistoryMaker Leatrice Branch Madison] when she gave a sort of impromptu birthday party for me when I was seventy-five years old.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a picture of me when I came home between finishing the Officer Candidate School [OCS] and going overseas and that is Stanley [Madison], my brother Stanley in the housing project.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Picture of me, and yeah that's a picture of me on the right, Julian's wedding. Julian is the--in military uniform and his bride, Mildred [Madison] and my mother and Bernard [Madison], my younger brother at Julian's wedding in 1948.  Whew, boy!  You saw me earlier, my mother and me, that's not my father, I don't know who that man is, but I thought I had more pictures of my father.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's my father right there.  Gee whiz, those were the days, wow, were they the days.  This was at Selma University.  He was coaching the baseball team.  Imagine what he would do in college and I was on the bench there, I probably was at the other end with the babysitter, but that's my father on the extreme left with the, yeah, and that would be circa 1928, '29 [1929] around that year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this is the whole gang.  This is my mother and her--my mother is in the center.  Let's go to the back row, on the back row starting on the left, Bernard, then me, then Julian and Stanley.  I didn't realize we were such stepping stones in terms of the getting taller, and taller and taller.  In front of each of us is our wives, Vivian [ph.] in front of Stanley, Mildred in front of Julian, my mother, and Leatrice in front of me and Bernadette [ph.] in front of Bernard and then they're all holding their children.  Bernadette is holding Bernard, Leatrice is holding Julie [Juliette Madison], 'cause Jeanne [Madison] is right down in front of her.  Oh yeah, then Bernadette on the left with Bernard on the floor in front--and Kevin [ph.] in her lap. Then my wife with Juliette in her lap and Jeanne in the front, my mother then Mildred with her daughter Roberta [ph.], and then on the floor is Carol [ph.] and Sharon [Madison] and Robin [ph.], and Vivian did not have any children at that time.
