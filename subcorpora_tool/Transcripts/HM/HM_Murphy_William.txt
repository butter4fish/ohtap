Story_ID: 11189
Speaker 1: You were the youngest of seven children.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I'd like you to talk--to tell me about your father, and, what you know of him.
Speaker 2: My father [William H. Murphy] was an elementary school principal here in Baltimore [Maryland].  I doubt whether he graduated from high school.  But I know that he went to school.  His teachers were white as, he told me.  And he was exceptionally well read.  And he was one of the first black, public school teachers in Baltimore.  He--he, he taught teachers how to teach.  And I attended elementary school at his school.  The discipline was excellent.  The teachers were wonderful.  They wrapped their arms around the students.  And, the majority of them did well.  When his students graduated to a junior high school, the principals and teachers at the high school we went to, Booker T. Washington Junior High School were always delighted to have Mr. Murphy's children come, because they were well read, well disciplined and eager to learn. he, he enjoyed his work.  He loved it.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me a little bit more about him?  What type of man was he?  or did he--You know, what kind of person was he?
Speaker 2: He was very friendly, very, civic minded, church oriented.  his family grew up in the AME church.  And, for--I don't know.  His father was the superintendent of the Bethel AME Church here in Baltimore.  And I don't know why he, changed from AME to Presbyterian, but he did.  And, he was an elder in the church, church treasurer.  It was a very active congregation.  They always had, learned ministers.  And the church had great out-reach programs in the community.  And, they had a significant number of schoolteachers, doctors, lawyers, business people and the church was always on firm financial footing.  And it's still in existence today, and still has great out-reach programs.
Speaker 1: Now I wouldn't usually ask this.  But, who--now his--you knew his father right?
Speaker 2: No I
Speaker 1: You didn't know.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know his father.
Speaker 1: (simultanesously) Okay.
Story_ID: 11190
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother then.
Speaker 2: My mother?
Speaker 1: Give me her name and tell me about her.
Speaker 2: My mother's maiden name was Grace Lee Hughes.  And her father was James William Hughes, and her mother was Rebecca Lee Heiner.  And, he--I'm not sure whether he was a slave or not.  But I know he migrated from rural Virginia.  He came through the Eastern shore to Baltimore [Maryland].  But he had a friend, I can't think of his name right now.  Maybe I'll think of it later.  They left Virginia at the same time.  And when they got to Cambridge, Maryland, they discussed what direction they were going to go in.  And, his friend decided to go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And, my grandfather decided to come to Baltimore.  But they had been houseboys on this plantation in Virginia.  And so they were attuned to the social amenities and necessities and everything that, wealthy people had.  And, my fath-- my grandfather became a house servant for a wealthy family here in Baltimore.  And, the same thing happened to his, friend who went to Philly. And they both--and they, they were in touch with each other quite frequently.  And, they both decided to become caterers, and both became very, successful caterers.  When my grandfather died in Baltimore, he left his will $157,000 in 1922.  So you translate that into today's dollars, it's probably a million and a half.  He had five daughters.  All of his sons died in infancy from childhood ailments that they probably would have survived, today.  And his wife worked with him in the business.  And when it became more successful, she retired.  And my mother became his office manager.  And, that's it.
Speaker 1: So your mother was--your mother was from a privileged background really.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  When, when she married my father, I think he had just begun to teach school.  And, her father gave her five investment properties.  She collected the rents from them.  Because he said that, "He would never be able to support his wife in the kind of--in the manner to which she was accustomed to living."  My grandfather owned a big townhouse in, in the downtown section of, Baltimore, where all the wealthy white people lived.  And they were, they were his, clients, his customers.
Speaker 1: Now how did they meet?  How did the two--How did your, your gra--I mean your mother and father meet?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Do you think they--? You have no, no idea at all?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you think their families knew each other? Or--
Speaker 2: I think, I think the Murphy's knew the Hughes.  That was probably-- probably--both of my grandfathers probably knew each other.  And they were both civic minded.  So I think they met in, in that arena.  And then I guess my father met my mother through my grandfather.
Story_ID: 11191
Speaker 1: Your grandfather, the Murphy grandfather owned the Afro-American paper?  Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about that?  You were starting to do that, you know, before we started.  You were saying that the--I think you were saying (unclear).  That the paper was bought at an auction?
Speaker 2: The Afro [American] Newspaper was a church paper.  And it was owned by two or three ministers.  And, some how or another the, the paper became available.  And my grandfather Murphy didn't have any money, and because he was a whitewasher, a laborer, a church person.  But his wife Martha Howard was the daughter of George Enoch Howard, a prosperous farmer in Montgomery County [Maryland].  And, he owned 888 acres, that he bought out of slavery.  In other words, he was a field hand.  He was a foreman for this wealthy white farmer.  And, he, he would take the farmer's produce into Baltimore [Maryland] to sell it.  And, and slaves could have their private plots.  Their own gardens.  So he took some of his produce with him and he sold it.  And he accumulated $3000 in 1857.  And the slave owner began to have financial difficulties.  So he brought Howard up to the big house and said, "Look here Howard," He said, "I here you got some money."  He said, "I'll, give you your freedom for the money you have."  So my gran-- great grandfather said, "I want my wife's freedom and my two children's freedom."  And the, the, slave owner went into a rage and put him in chains in a dungeon.  And so his economic situation began to deteriorate.  And so he brought him out and said, "Okay, I'll give you your freedom, your wife's freedom and your two children's freedom."  And he said, "Yeah, but I want those two farms."  And one was named Little Egypt and the other was named hard to Get and Dearly Paid For.  And he got the freedom and, and the farms.  So now when my grandfather--Oh, so my great gran-- great grandfather gave his children each a hundred acres.  So when Martha Howard married John H. Murphy Senior, she sold her 100 acres to one of her brothers for about $200.  And then she loaned the $200 to her husband so he could buy the Afro.  And that's how the Afro became Murphy owned.
Speaker 1: Now one thing I, I want not to belabor things, but I find curious.  Was it common that--you said slaves often were given plots of land.  Was that common?  Or were some slaves given plots of land?  You said,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Some, some.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, Maryland, Maryland, was not a deeply entrenched slave, state.  Montgomery County had maybe 25 or 30 big plantations, if that many.  And, the, the wives of the plantation owners were primarily antislavery.  And they encouraged people to try to buy their freedom.  The White women didn't, didn't cotton to slavery like the Deep South people were.  And, it was not as brutal as it was in, in the southern states.  two, the Howard family have a reunion every two years.  And one, and one year we meet in Montgomery County, and then the next year we meet in, some place in Canada.  Because some of my cousins, two of them, I can't think of their names, fled slavery.  And they walked all the way from Montgomery County to Detroit [Michigan] and then crossed the river into Canada and started a big branch of the Howard family up there.  we had a reunion this past--last year, and there were 350 of my cousins there and another 250 who didn't make it.  So it's a huge family.  But, my great grandfather was a great farmer.  He prospered--had a great farm.  Wealthy man.
Story_ID: 11192
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, 'cause you were the youngest.  Right?
Speaker 2: Of seven.
Speaker 1: Of seven.  Can you describe your household and, you know, what it was like.  I mean you have--I know you have your oldest sister who's still alive.  But I'm just wondering what, what was the household like that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Well, there were nine people.  We had a nice big three-story house.  And, my father always made an adequate, living.  So we didn't have any, severe economic problems.  And then, of course, my country cousins would send down a wagon load of food every Thanksgiving.  And then we visited them.  And, they would give us food.  You know, smoked hams, vegetables, things like that, fruit.
Speaker 1: Now what was--what was the community like that you grew up in?  Can you describe that?
Speaker 2: It was a segregated Black community, on a street called Argyle Avenue.  A really wonderful community, good people, honest people, and, neighborly.  And many of them were schoolteachers like my father.  Some were ministers.  And then many of them were butlers and, chauffeurs for wealthy white people.  So it was a very comfortable area.
Story_ID: 11193
Speaker 1: One question I have about your father.  Did he ever--He never worked with Afro-America--Was it called Afro-Americans then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was!
Speaker 2: From the beginning.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He was a member of the board of directors.  And he was the, secretary of the corporation.  But he never worked actively in it.  He was always in the public school system.
Story_ID: 11194
Speaker 1: And I'd like you to  share some stories of just growing up.  That you--some fond memories that you have, you know, growing up, in your early years.
Speaker 2: Well, my father used to give me an allowance of 15 cents a week and I was nine.  So, one day I went into his office at the school and said, "Pop, you know, you only give me 15 cents a week.  And Benny Brown's father gives him 85 cents a week."  He said, "Well, William, I'm glad you brought it up."  He said, "I've been thinking about it."  And he said, "I've decided that I'm not gonna give you any further allowance.  Your brother is gonna-- I've arranged for your brother to give you five, newspaper customers.  And you'll be able to make more money working for yourself than I'll ever be able to give you in a lifetime.  So as of now, you have no allowance."  So needless to say, I was disappointed.  So I went home and told my mother what happened.  Of course, I didn't know they had already planned this thing.  And I said, "Ma, can't you give me 25 cents a week?"  And she said, "Oh William!  Gentlemen don't take money from ladies.  I couldn't do that.  You wouldn't want me to do that."  So I had a difficult time the first week I was, selling my newspapers.  I didn't know how to collect money from people.  And so I had to borrow money from my father to pay the Afro for the papers that I got and hadn't been able to collect on.  And so my mother made me, and I had to sign a note to my father.  And I had to agree to pay him back three cents a week, until I paid him in full.  So I began to hustle.  And, before you know it, I had a good newspaper route.  And I, I never had to ask my father for a nickel from that point on.  And then I would, deal in junk.  I'd sell the newspapers to people.  Then I'd ask them to rather than throw them away, just save them for me.  'Cause I had a wagon.  And, I'd collect them and take them to a junkyard.  And I made money that way.  And then I would pick up scrap iron on the street.  they had--All these old trucks had, had, scrap, scrap metal in the bodies of the trucks, and they would lose them.  And then I would, I would find nuts and bolts and, I would save them.  And, I had a great time.  I always made money.
Speaker 1: So now what other stories would you like to share?  Are there others?
Speaker 2: (Long pause) Can't think of any right now.
Speaker 1: Ha?  Nothing?  Now, with--I'm told that you had, you had servants.
Speaker 2: Yeah my, my mother
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously)  (unclear) family.
Speaker 2: My mother and father always had a, a housekeeper.
Speaker 1: It wasn't--Was that unusual?  On your street, was that unusual?
Speaker 2: No, I think we were probably--Well there--There were--I think there were about sixty houses in the block.  And there might have been two or three others who had, a housekeeper.
Speaker 1: And so this housekeeper helped your mother and fa--But your mother was, was--She was a full time housewife wasn't she?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) She did--
Speaker 1: So she worked as an office--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  She looked after the children.  Bathed us, did the house cleaning, things of that sort.
Speaker 1: Um-
Speaker 2: Of course, when I grew older, I did the marketing.  She'd give me a list and I would go to the public market every Saturday and do the buying for the family.  Of course, by that time, most of the kids, my brothers and sisters had gone.
Story_ID: 11195
Speaker 1: Now you also had nice--a nice household with china and (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that?
Speaker 2: It was--well, we moved from Argyle Avenue [in Baltimore, Maryland] in 1922, to a townhouse on a street called Druid Hill Avenue.  And, and the neighborhood had been white.  But it, it had turned black in that era.  And it was a handsome house.  Hard wood floors, tiled,  bathrooms.  It was a lovely mansion.  I'll tell you a story.  In the 1930s, my father had retired from school principal.  Around 1933 or '34 [1934].  So they were building public housing projects in those days, developing.  So one bright sun--one afternoon, this little short Jewish fella came to the door, wanted to know if he could speak to Mr. Murphy.  And I said, "Who are you?"  He said,  "My name is Andrew Rossov.  I'd like to see your father."  So I went upstairs.  We had a parlor and then we had a living room.  And so, I said,  "Have a seat in the parlor."  So I went up and told my father about this man.  And he said, "Well, send him upstairs."  So, uh--and I noticed he had a brown envelope on his--but I didn't pay any attention to it.  So, all of a sudden after about half an hour, my mother and I were sitting in the dining room.  And my father said, "Get out of my house.  Don't you ever come in my house again."  And, the guy trotted down the steps and left.  So we tried to find out who--what made my father so angry.  And it was unusual for a black man to be outraged by a white man no matter what he did or said to you.  So finally one Sunday at the dinner table, with just the three of us.  'Cause I was--I was the last child and I was with them for about maybe seven or eight years.  So he finally told us.  He said, "The man tried to bribe me.  He offered me $50,000 if I would try and use my best efforts to get him the contract to build a public housing project in a neighborhood called Cherry Hill."  Where I eventually moved to.  And, my mother said, "Well George, why didn't you take it?  Nobody would know about it, but you and him."  And my father got upset with her.  He said, "Well Grace, that would be dishonest number one.  And number two I would know that I had been bribed.  And I would not be able to live with it."  Well, see her, her father was a caterer.  And he would bid on jobs.  For instance, Bethlehem Shipyard would launch a ship and they would employ a caterer to have a nice big banquet on the ship, you know.  And you'd have to bribe the superintendent to get the business--commercial bribery.  It's a fact of life then and now.  And, he said, "No, he couldn't do it."  And I always remember that.  Because when I, when I was in practice, I'd heard about corrupt judges, you know.  We had some of the finest judges money could buy and, and I always thought about it.  Not that I was ever even remotely tempted to, take a bribe.  But I, I would feel the same way my father did.
Story_ID: 11196
Speaker 1: When we lived on Argyle Avenue, one of our distant cousins from Montgomery County migrated to Baltimore [Maryland] and she lived with us.  And, and in return for her living, expenses, she did the majority of the housework, the laundry and cleaning the house.  Because, you know, seven children is quite a job, even with help.  So when we moved to, Druid Hill Avenue, the townhouse, they employed a young man from Western Maryland.  His name was Charlie Brisko.  And he was the--he was our houseboy.  He, he cleaned, cleaned the house, washed the dishes, made minor repairs and he, kept the coal furnace going, you know, in the wintertime.  So then he finished high school and went back to Western Maryland.  And, my father employed another young man named Elijah.  My father used to get his name mixed up and he'd call him Hezekiah or Ezekiel.  He finally got his name right.  And he, he chauffeured my father.  And he did--he stoked the furnace and did minor repairs around the house.  And then, my mother had a young woman named Mer--Mertis.  And, she was my mother's housekeeper.  After Elijah left and got employed at the Afro [American Newspaper, Baltimore, Maryland], and he encour--He encouraged him to take up printing.  And he got a nice job at the Afro.  And then Mertis worked for mother for years.  And then, she got married and, and there was another young woman who lived up the street from us, who, was my mother's housekeeper in her failing years.  So they, they were always quite comfortable.
Speaker 2: So did you have a sense yourself growing up that your family was special in that way?  Or, you know, on the upper, upper end of, the scale?  Was there a sense about that?  I mean--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) No.  And I'll tell you why.  One Sunday, I was at the dinner table with my mother and father [Grace Lee Murphy, George B. Murphy.]  And something came up.  And I was talking about how great the Murphys were, and how wealthy they were, and how influential they were.  You know.  And, my father said,  he said, "William, let me tell you one thing," he said, "You know, there are a lot of people who know the background of my family."  He said, "I was one of 13 children while the Afro was getting started."  He said, "We were evicted for the nonpayment of rent 13 times!  Set out in the street!  In winter, summer, spring and fall."  And he said, "There a lot of people who knew how poor we were.  So I wouldn't be, bragging too much about that."  And that, that taught me something.  In fact, I never boasted after that.  Because I couldn't imagine that the Murphys had been that poor.  But it was true.
Speaker 2: But you did have a sense then as a young person that you were privileged.  You did have--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) But I didn't think of it in those terms.  I was not a braggadocio.  And where was we at.
Story_ID: 11197
Speaker 1: Now one of the things, that, you know, Laura [Murphy, daughter] had mentioned before was, going back to Hughes.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh my grandfather [John H. Murphy Sr.].
Speaker 1: Your grandfather.
Speaker 2: He and his wife, you know, ran the business.  And these wealthy white people would come in to-- for their coming out parties or their weddings and things of that sort.  But then there was a new mercantile class beginning to develop in the white business community.  And these were the nouveau riche.  And, of course, he was the premiere caterer during that era.  And they came to him to handle their, weddings and parties and things of that sort.  And they didn't know beans about social etiquette or what foods to have.  And he had a section in his house, a table where he taught them how to use the knife and fork, napkins, fine glassware, the social amenities and, that was a part of his service.
Speaker 1: So now this is, this is--so you got exposed to this young too then.  'Cause this was--This was how your mother was trained.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Incidentally, when I was in my last year of law school [University of Maryland School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland], I worked in the catering company on Saturdays.  And I was in charge of the liquor and the wines.  Because you always had a problem about waiters pilfering, you know, the liquor and wine.  And then I, I was a truck driver for the catering company.  I'd get there at 6:00, Saturday morning, load the truck with all the food, drive it to the place where the affair was, unload it, help to set up the affair, look after the bar.  And then, and reload it, take it back to the catering company place, unload it and go home.  I'd get home about 10:30 [p.m.].  And I'd get $6 for the day.  This was in 1945 or '46 [1946] which wasn't bad.  And then, of course, the, a lot of the food was left over by--my uncle-in-law was the manager.  His wife was the, general manager of the catering business.  And, they'd find out, "Mr. So-and-so, what do you want to do with all this food's left?"  "Get rid of it."  Historically my grandfather [James W. Hughes] used to give it to, an Episcopal home for girls and an Episcopal home for boys.  And, later when I worked for the catering company, they'd give the food to the servants.  And I'd take home a Smithfield ham, chicken salad, finger rolls, mints, cakes, you know.  Stuff like that.
Story_ID: 11198
Speaker 1: I want to go back to your household.  You said there wer--You--You're the youngest and you said that you were on your own with your parents for about seven years.
Speaker 2: I was home alone.
Speaker 1: Oh, home alone.
Speaker 2: Only child.
Speaker 1: Only child.  So that's from like what?  You were what age?  Starting at what age?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I must have been maybe 10 or 11 something like that.  Yeah.  Ni-- Nine!  I think.
Speaker 1: Now who, who was right above you?
Speaker 2: My brother Houston.  Houston finished--he was graduating that year.  He had graduated.  And, my mother, my brother and my sister Rebecca, what--drove up to, a resort in Michigan, Woodland Park Brightly Michigan.  And, my mother was in a rowboat, my sister was on the shore.  I forgot where my other brother was.  And my, my brother Houston got a cramp and drowned.  He went down and never came up.  And he--his trunk was packed.  He had been admitted to Lincoln.  And so that's when I became the only child at home.
Speaker 1: That was probably devastating to you.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--and he was supposed to have been a doctor.
Speaker 1: And all his, four or five of his high school classmates became doctors.  The mothers had all decided that that's where the kids were gonna--what they were gonna do.  And I didn't know it.  But she'd determined that I was gonna be a lawyer.  Because four of her sons worked at the Afro.  And she said, "George, I've given you four boys to the Afro and I'm not gonna give you William."
Speaker 2: So talk about those years that you were with your parents, you know, growing up.  You know, that seven year period.
Speaker 1: Because you must have formed a bond in many ways.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh ,yeah.
Speaker 1: It was different from, you know, your other siblings.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I--We, we had an enjoyable time.  And I was, I was a good kid.  I didn't give them any trouble.  'Cause I--they always said I was a mistake.  And, after Elijah left, the employ, I became my father's [Geprge B. Murphy] chauffeur, you know.  And, I learned a lot about being prompt.  We were one of the few families that had a car.  It was not common, during that era, during the '30s [1930s].  It was a massive Depression.  And, he'd say; "Now William, pick me up at the Afro [American Newspaper, Baltimore, Maryland] at 3:00 [p.m.].  I have a meeting to go to.  And I want you to--"  'Cause he never learned to drive.  And, I'd be there 10 minutes early.  Because I'd like to--I could use the car Friday nights to take my girls to a dance.  You know, or go to Washington to a dance.  And, the car had to be in the garage at midnight.  And I would never be late.  Because the garage owner would tell my father if I had been late.  But I had a lot of, a lot of fun.  My mother and I bantered a lot.  And I was in law school.  You know, and I'd come home.  And she'd say, "William, is that you?"  I'd say, "No Ma,  I'm Amos Jones."  We'd banter.  I'd kid her, you know.  And, my father was always busy.  He was, on the board of Provident Hospital.  And then he became chairman of the board.  And incidentally, my oldest brother became chairman of the board.  And my next oldest brother became a board member for Provident Hospital, and I became bhairman of the Board of Provident Hospital.  It was a--It was a mission for us.  And he belonged--he was on the board of the Urban League, and he was the treasurer of the local chapter of the NAACP.  And Thurgood Marshall used to call my father long distance collect from Southern cities where he was.  And he'd be stranded and didn't have any money.  The national office couldn't always pay his expenses.  So he'd be stranded.  So he'd, call my father.  And,  he was treasurer.  And my father would say, "Okay, Thurgood, how much do you need?"  He'd say, "Well, I need $20 or $30."  And he'd say, "I'll check with, other board members.  But I'm pretty certain you'll get the money."  He said, "I'm gonna send William down to the telegraph office for you to, for--to send the money to you."  And, he was active in his church.  He was an elder and treasurer of the church. So he was busy.  He had meetings to go to almost every night, after he retired.  And I was home alone with my mother.  And we, we would play cards together, and talk together.  So it was a most enjoyable, childhood--and, teenagehood for me.
Story_ID: 11199
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a young person?  I mean did you have, you know, any dreams?  I know you say that your, your mother [Grace Lee Murphy] had started you to be a lawyer.  But I mean, you know, as a young person we always
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: dream about what I'd might like to do (unclear).
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a junk dealer.  Because I had dealt with junk dealers.  And there's no such thing as a poor junk dealers, junk dealer.  They're all wealthy.  They make money.  And I had experience with dealing with junk dealers.  You know.  And I knew how they would cheat, the people who brought in the junk to them.  And, I learned how to deal with it.  I learned how to compete and not to be a crybaby.  For instance this one junk dealer had--he had scales that were rigged against the poor black people who brought their junk to him.  So my mother said, "Well, William, get yourself a hand scale.  And then you weigh your bundles when you take them up there.  And you argue with him.  And you go inside of the--his office."  Because the scale was out here and he was in a little office.  And he had a window to look at the scale.  And I'd argue and fight with him and cuss him out.  And he'd say, "Don't you dare call me Sam.  You call me Mr. Sam."  And my mother would say, "William, don't you call him anything else but Sam," you know.  So she taught me to be aggressive, and not to be a crybaby.  Learn how to compete.  And, there have been very few situations where, I'm not--I'm comfortable in competing.  No point in crying.  We di--We do too much crying anyway.  Learn how to compete.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of person would you describe yourself as?  And in that, you know, what do you think you got from your mother?  And what do you think you got from your father?
Speaker 2: I got civic duty, from my father.  And, competiv--competitiveness and business from my mother.  She, she made me save half of my Afro [American newspaper delivery] profits every week.  And she made me keep my books.  And I deposited it in a saving and loan--black savings and loan association in the next block.  And this savings and loan had been started in 1920 by 12 black men.  And all of them had been messengers or butlers for wealthy people.  And, they started it and, it survived the Depression.  When all the banks closed, this savings and loan called Ideal Building and Loan Association survived it.  And then, after the Depression, the, the older people died and they left it in charge of one of my boyhood friends.  And they told him to either breathe new life in it or dissolve it.  And he didn't do either one.  He put a warm blanket on it and let it lay idle until 1963.  And, in that year, one of my mother's sisters died.  And I was the executor of her estate.  And she had a--it turned out she had an account, a savings account there. Of $900.  So I talked to the, the guy in charge.  His name was Teakle.  Teakle Wallace Landsey.  And so I said, "Teakle let's revive it."  And he said, "No", he wasn't interested in reviving it.  So I said, "Well, I think we ought to."  Because black people in the '60's [1960s] were having difficulty borrowing money to buy homes from these White savings and loans associations.  So any way, I found out there were thirteen accounts.  And so I called a meeting of the thirteen accounts.  And the vote was seven to six to revive it.  And I became president of it.  And, it grew and grew and grew.  And then it grew up to about maybe 6- $700,000 which was a lot of money in the '60s [1960s].  And then I was elected and I turned it over to, Teakle's brother.  And, of course, it's still in existence [now known as Ideal Federal Savings Bank, Baltimore, Maryland.]
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What's its name now? Same thing?  Is it named the same thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah I--It's called Ideal Federal Savings and Loan now.
Story_ID: 11200
Speaker 1: Now the Depression.  Do you--Were you impacted at all, your family, with the Depression?
Speaker 2: Weren't touched at all.
Speaker 1: We never had any problems.  Ate well, dressed well, had vacations.  I used to, uh--When I was--became 16, I got my driver's license.  And I'd, I'd drive my mother and father up to, Saratoga Springs [New York].  They'd go up to Saratoga Springs for--every summer in August for two weeks.  And they would take the salt baths, you know, and what not.  And then, later on we'd go up to a resort in Old Orchard [Beach], Maine.  A black family owned a cottage up there.  We'd go up there for two weeks.  So everything was fine.
Speaker 2: Now that's--I want to understand, Black society back then. I mean in terms of, you know, these places that you were going.  The place in Sarasota and the place, you know, in Maine.  Were there--Would other people congregate?  Were they mainly from the Baltimore and DC area?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah, Baltimore [Maryland] [Washington] DC area.
Speaker 2: And were there certain families that always participated?
Speaker 1: Oh yes.
Speaker 2: Can you tell me?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I can't think of the woman's name who owned the house in Saratoga Springs.  But she was from, she was from, DC.  And she had this big old mansion!  And she started out, because her husband would go up there and work in the hotels.  And then she began to take in the waiters because they couldn't find any place to live.  You know.  And finally, she prospered to a point where she--where the waiters were able to make other arrangements to stay.  And then she had all her society friends from Baltimore and Washington to come up and stay with her.  And the same thing, was a family in Old Orchard was named Cummings.  And, I forget what the husband did.  But the wife ran this boarding house and she catered to Black people from the New York area, from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  It was a lovely place.  And, it was a nice place to go to.
Speaker 2: Okay, so we're talking about the '30's [1930s] at this point?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  '30's and '40's  [1930s and 1940s].
Speaker 2: Thirties and forties [1930s and 1940s], okay.  And--was there, was there--tell me about the discussion that would occur.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) But (unclear) I went, I went to Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't want to have you on college yet.  But we can go to Oberlin.  But can we just--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah, all right.
Speaker 2: Okay, I was just wondering, during these summers and even during, you know, at home.  What discussions would occur about, you know, the black race and all of that?  Would there be discussions around
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh, yeah.  My father was connected with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  So that was a, a significant portion of the conversation around the dinner table.  And they were fighting for the equalization of, of teachers' salaries in the '30's [1930s].  And, or I was, or if it was about politics.  I remember when I became of age to vote, I re--registered a Republican.  Because a young Black lawyer was running for the House of Delegates and I wanted to be sure to be able to vote for him.  And, I--In selling my newspapers, my father would get literature from the black candidates for me to distribute, you know, to black voters.  So it was high priority in the family.
Story_ID: 11201
Speaker 1: Now you registered republican because that was the party of choice at that point.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.  That's ri--yeah, my mother and father  [Grace Lee Murphy , George B. Murphy] were Republicans.  And they, they were more accommodating to Black people than the Democrats.  The Democrats were racists. But then later on in my--when they organized the housing authority of Baltimore City [Maryland] to build  the public housing projects, there was a black politician named Tom Smith and he was a Democrat.  And, he, he controlled his district, you know.  He delivered the vote.  And so the mayor said to him one day that, "Tom, I'm gonna let you name the colored member of the, Housing Authority Commission.  So whoever you want me to appoint, I'll appoint."  So he appointed my father.  And he told him.  He said, "Mr. Murphy, the reason I'm gonna appoint you is you're the only honest man I know in Baltimore.  I want a man who is completely honest.  I don't want any hanky-panky."  And he said, "I'll never ask you to do anything that you feel uncomfortable in dealing with."  And Tom Smith was a wealthy man.  He was in the lottery busin--the numbers business.  You know, like the Big Numbers Byrnes in Chicago?  And, he had a hotel.  And I used to serve the Afro [American newspaper] to him.  He was my first customer.  Because it was just across the street from the Afro building.  And, he, he--the paper was six cents.  I'd pay four cents for it and sell it for six.  And he'd give me 25 cents tip every Friday.  I never missed him.  But, that's how it was.
Story_ID: 11202
Speaker 1: What names were important and being bandied--?  Who was im--significant in the black community when you were growing up?  What names were, were mentioned?  I know you say the NAACP was really sort of heard of.  But who--I'm talking about you in your teens and sort of early, you know, 20's.  Who were the people that were important?
Speaker 2: Tom Smith, a man named Morris Callaway who was Republican.  Carl Murphy who was the editor/publisher of the Afro-American [Newspaper, Baltimore, Maryland].  He was a very powerful man during that era.  And then before him, a minister named George Freeman Bragg, an Episcopal minister.  He had a great congregation.  And he was a writer.  And he wrote a book called 'Men of Maryland', that talked about the Black men of prominence during that era.Think that's all I can think of at the moment.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Oh, [tape break] there were bishops, black bishops in the AME [African Methodiest Epicopal] church.  The Bishop that I knew and remembered was, who lived across the street from us on Argyle Avenue, Bishop W. Sampson Brooks.  And, the Black Bishops were prominent people too.  Plus the schoolteachers.  I mean the school principals were prominent.  And, business was--We had a golden age of business when I was coming up.  We had thirteen black savings and loan associations, three commercial banks--two dozen drugstores and all the corner grocery stores were black until we broke the barrier.  And then they were all Jews. 'Cause they were sitting there waiting for us to come over.
Story_ID: 11203
Speaker 1: So you were saying that there was one person you know--you were saying--you were asking about the conversations around the dinner table.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it, it was about politics.  there was a lawyer named Warner T. McGwen.  He graduated from Yale College and Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut].  And he was befriended by what's the--I can't think of his--you know about--I can't think--Anyway, he was one of my role models.  He was the lawyer for the Afro-American [Newspaper, Baltimore,Maryland].  And, there was in the 2300 block there was a black dentist.  In the 2100 block, there was a black doctor.  In the 2000 block, there was two, two black doctors and in the 1900 block, there was a black lawyer.  In the 1800 block, there were two lawyers.  One was Thurgood Marshall and the other was named George Pendleton.  And then there was a doctor/ lawyer in the same block.  He was both a doctor and a lawyer.  And then in my block, there was a George Pendleton Jr., a doctor.  None in the 1600.  In the 1500 block, there was two doctors.  Dr. Gezell and Dr. Cadoser.  And then, across the street was a lawyer named Roy S. Bond.  Then in the 1400 block, there was a black doctor.  In the 1300 block, historically there was a city councilman named--the first black city councilman named Harry S. Cummings.  In the 1200 block there were two black doctors.  And then in the 1100 block another black doctor.  And then on Druid Hill Avenue there were--there were five or six black drugstores, beginning at Druit Hill and Viddle, Druid Hill and Oxford, Druid Hill and Hoffmann, Druid Hill and, Dauphin.  One on each corner, Druid Hill and McMakin, Druid Hill and Pressman.  And, it was a prosperous neighborhood.  So I had all the role models in the world.  Nothing but doctors and lawyers. And I sold the Afro [American Newspaper] to all of them.
Speaker 1: And all those doctors could make a living?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. Well, white doctors didn't want 'em.
Story_ID: 11204
Speaker 1: I want to go back to you in  high school, so  were you a good student?
Speaker 2: I would, I would, I'd come home and bring my report card," Look ma I made all B's.  She'd say, "William you could've done better.  You could've made A's."  I didn't--I didn't push myself.  I was too interested in girls.  And making money.  Girls and money.
Speaker 1: So, so how were you checking out the girls?  Was this--were you introduced to people?  Was it a society introduction?
Speaker 2: No.  They all lived in the same neighborhood.  And Douglas High School was composed of people in the same neighborhood.  You know, so we were all classmates.
Speaker 1: Was there any activities that you were involved in?  Like was there a debate--were, were there any things like that?
Speaker 2: I, I was in the swimming club.  But, I was selling newspapers and I, I couldn't neglect my business for something like that.
Speaker 1: See that's interesting.  The business part you chose--you really I mean you wanted--But, so now I want to know how it came about that you went to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio].  Why, how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my mother's sister went to Oberlin in the early 20's [1920s].  And incidentally she hated it.  she was very fair.  All, all of the Hughes were very fair.  I never thought my grandmother was anything but white.  And they all passed for white when it served their interest. To go to restaurants or stores downtown.  But my high school counselor had gone to Oberlin.  And my mother [Grace Lee Murphy] felt that I needed to, need, needed a change in locality.  Get, get into the white community and find out, you know what it was like.  Because she assured me it was no different, you know.  And so, she decided that I should go to Oberlin.
Speaker 1: Now what, did she feel that way?
Speaker 2: Well, Baltimore [Maryland] has always been a very provincial town.  In the white community and in the black community one couldn't be too much different from, you know, the other.  And she th--thought I ought to get out of the city.  and she had--my next brother had gone to Lincoln which was ex--which was an excellent school.  But, she just pers--was persuaded that I ought to go to a white college.
Speaker 1: And so you applied--What was--how was it at that point you just wrote to, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Just wrote and I was accepted.  I had a B average.
Speaker 1: And what was that experience like? Because it's the first time your out, I mean besides going on vacation and things. I mean it's the first time you're out of Baltimore.
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: Isn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah. It didn't bother me a bit.  I wasn't excited about it one way or the other.  And, Oberlin had, of course, you know had a reputation for admitting black students and I--and I was admitted, during the 100th anniversary of the admission of blacks to Oberlin.  But Oberlin historically admitted, black women.  Not too black. They were generally quite fair.  And they were from the South.  And, a lot of the sponsors were, their illegitimate father.  And actually it turned out they only admitted four or five black students every year.  When I went there, they admitted five of us.  Four, four men and one woman.  And the woman was a very pretty woman from some place in Mississippi.  But she didn't make it.  She dropped out at the end of her first year.  And, the four, the four men graduated.  And we all became professionals.  One was a doctor.  No there were three of us.  Three of us graduated.  Two of us became lawyers and we both became judges and the other became a psychiatrist in Chicago named Dr. Nellinger.  but, I, I, was going with a young woman from New York.  Her name was Elizabeth Bishop.  Her father was an Episcopal Minister at St. Phillips Episcopal Church.  A big Episcopal Church in Harlem [New York, New York].  And she was very fair.  She looked like a German blond.  And, I would take her to dances.  I'd go pick her up with my bicycle.  And, she'd sit on the crossbar and take her to the dance.  So she, she transferred because they were constantly after her, to identify herself when these white guys wanted to date her.  She, they--the dean of women and the dean of the college said, "You, you have to tell these young men that you're colored you know."  And she said, "I'm not going to wear a sign on my back."  And of course she was, if she had stayed at Oberlin she was Phi Beta Kappa.  So she transferred back to New York and went to Barnard College.  And one, one day, my dormitory had a dance.  And, one of my classmates, a nice fellow, a white fellow, his, his, his mother and father were missionaries in China.  And they sent all their children back to Oberlin you know, to go to school, college there.  And, he said--and you know we had dance cards.  Every dance you had a card you exchanged the third dance, the fifth dance and I think there were twenty-five dances.  And at the end of the twenty-five dances, you'd go, you'd go to your dormitory. So he said, "Bill how about changing the fifth dance with my girlfriend?,"  who was white.  And so I said, "Okay I didn't think anything of it, you know." And, I danced with her.  I think I danced twice with her.  And then somebody else asked me to exchange dance with his date, white.  And I didn't think anything of it, you know.  Just another, just another young woman.  The next day the dean called me into his office.  And he said, "Murphy, I hear you were dancing with three white women last night.  Let me tell you one thing.  Everything that is legal isn't sensible.  I don't ever want to hear of you dancing with a white woman again."  And of course, when I was in Oberlin, there were no black college professors. There were no black people working in any other capacity other than cooks, maids, and groundskeepers.  It wasn't until maybe ten years after I graduated from Oberlin they employed the first professor.  it was a good experience for me.  It was an awakening experience. But, I never cared for the college.
Speaker 1: It was awakening because this was your first time.  You had been really in a very much--a cloistered Black environment--
Speaker 2: Yeah. And, and to live with white people.  And I, I ate my--we didn't have a dining hall in my building.  We ate in the dining--girls' dining hall.  And I ate with the girls--white girls all the time you know. So, it was no big deal.  I didn't have any particular fascination for 'em one way or the other.  If they want to be friendly, be friendly. If they don't want to be friendly, it didn't bother me.  I knew a lot of nice girls in, in the town, you know black girls, you know?  A lot of nice people.
Speaker 1: Now in the--did you live in dorms?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: And so you lived with the whites?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There were no frictions there?
Speaker 2: No, no.  None.  I never experienced any overt racism in my four years of--in Oberlin.  The only racism I experienced was from the dean.
Speaker 1: Now what--how do you think that experience at Oberlin would have differed from an experience had you gone to some place like Lincoln?
Speaker 2: I think I would have done just as well or better.  Lincoln [University, Lincoln, Pennsylvania] turned out more outstanding black graduates outside of, Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and the Southern college Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama]  those, those were great schools.  And they produced outstanding people.  So I don't--I don't think--I know it wasn't any better than Lincoln. And, Lincoln of course, had all white administrators and professors.  And they were all Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] graduates.  And, they, they really hammered in an, an education.  I mean they, they wrapped their arms around those young men.  You know Thurgood went to Lincoln.  One of my brothers went to Lincoln.  And, they didn't tolerate dummies.
Story_ID: 11205
Speaker 1: You graduated from Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio].  Now what did you major in?
Speaker 2: Economics.  And Political Science.  I minored in Political Science.
Speaker 1: And what were your thoughts when you, when you chose those majors?
Speaker 2: Well I chose economics because  I wanted to be in business.  As I said I wanted to be--I wanted, I wanted to go to M.I.T.  [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] really, and, and be a mechanical I mean a civil engineer.  And build houses and bridges and streets.  And the reason I thought of M.I.T. was we had a country cousin named Parker who went to M.I.T. in the early 30's [1930s].  And he graduated.  And, and I told my father I'd like to go to M.I.T. and he said, "Well, William there's no point in going to M.I.T. because there are no opportunities for black engineers,  you know."  So, he graduated and he couldn't find a job in the United States and he, he got a job helping to build railroads through the Andes in Brazil.  And then he came back to New York and he was one of the engineers for the Holland Tunnel.  And his name is on the plaque.  As you go into New York you can stop and see his name on the plaque.  So--and the irony of it is if I had gone to M.I.T. and graduated, hell this guy Rossov would have given me a job in a minute!  It was a changing time.  but I, I liked building.  And I like dealing in junk  'cause junk is gold!
Story_ID: 11206
Speaker 1: When you refer to your 'country cousins' are these the cou--I think of the
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Clampets [ref. to characters from TV show, 'Beverly Hillbillies'].  Is the (laughs) are these the-- are these the other side of the track relatives?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: (laughs) What are the country cousins?
Speaker 2: No.  They, they were all farmers you know.  And they, they did well.
Speaker 1: I'm expecting you know--they're hauling up to the house, you know (laughs) and your mother is like no, no you can't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but wait a minute now.  One of my cousins, cousin Sam, lived in the slave house that our relatives--our relatives built in 1792.  And he was living in it and of course Sam had a farm.  His father gave him a hundred acres.  He had a nice farm.  Nice house.  He was prosperous.  But then he got into bootlegging and did a little time.  And, and that's another story I'll tell you about.  Anyway, he lost everything and he moved back into the slave house.  And with no bathroom inside, no running water.  No toilet inside.  And I use to take the kids up there you know and my, my, my cousin's wife, would let the kids go out and look--hunt for the eggs you know, not, not these.  But, [children William Jr., Madeline] Billy and Madeline.  And, collect the apples and she'd make--all kinds of scrapple, goodies and what not, you know.  So yeah, but, but, but they were all literate.  All of the Howard's were literate.  Their father, Sam's father, built a church for his, family, employed the minister and he built a school across the road from it where all of the Howard's went to school.  And they were all literate and wrote excellent penmanship and what not. They were no Clampets.

Speaker 1: I want to ask about passing.
Speaker 2: About what?
Speaker 1: Passing.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Did you--did any of the Hughes' just pass over-- did you lose members of the family?
Speaker 2: No.  No. No one went over for good.  In my wife's family, her uncle went over and they lost him.
Speaker 1: Was that ever discussed at all when people would do that?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yeah 'cause my mother use to pass when she would go downtown.  Her father would pass.
Speaker 1: And it was just a way of getting, getting, getting what you needed.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My aunts passed.  And their children passed.  Of course I couldn't pass.  the only time I ever passed was I was on a train from Chicago [Illinois] going to San Antonio [Texas].  And I was able to get a Pullman [sleeping berth].  Because I couldn't get it out of Baltimore [Maryland].  They wouldn't sell black people Pullmans you know.  So I went to Chicago.  And, they--and I got a Pullman.  And so the next morning you know I woke up and the porters dismantled the Pullman.  Because you know what a Pullman is don't you?
Speaker 1: It's a sleeping--it's a sleeper car. I've--
Speaker 2: You never were--That was before your time.
Speaker 1: (laughing) No I sa--I never slept on a--a, a train but I mean I understand--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So anyway, this white couple and their two children were in the same compartment with me and they said--we were talking about this, that and the other.  And the train was going into the station.  And the husband said, "You know we, we were wondering what nationality you. We know you're not a nigger."  and I said, "No, I'm not a nigger. I'm a colored person." And he tried to die! So I, so I stayed overnight in San Antonio.  I had to go to Alexandria, Louisiana.  So, I got a early train going toward Alexandria.  And they stopped in--I forget the name of the town.  And I went up--I wanted to get some breakfast.  So I went upstairs and there were two, two dining rooms.  I, I looked at both of them.  They both looked alike, identical.  So I went into the one on the right and took a seat and a little black kid came over and said, "Pardon me mister, but the boss man wants to know is you colored."  I said, "No, I'm not colored!"  And he went back and told him that I said no I wasn't colored.  So the white waitress waited on me.  And that's the only time I ever passed.  Accidentally.
Speaker 1: Did, did anyone ever think you were Jewish?
Speaker 2: (nods head no) White people ask me from time to time what nationality I'm--I'd say, "I'm from lower Slobovia."
Speaker 1: (laughing)
Speaker 2: You don't know that one do you?
Speaker 1: (laughing) No.
Speaker 2: Al Camp, Lil' Abner [ref. to comic strip 'Lil' Abner']?
Story_ID: 11208
Speaker 1: When you graduated, did your parents come to graduation?  Was it that type of thing or not?
Speaker 2: No my mother came.  But I think my father had a stroke.  And I think he was in recovery.  So he didn't make it.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Incidentally--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I want--so you come back.  You graduate, you come back right to, to Baltimore [Maryland]. At that point.  Now what is your--what is your thought at this point?  Is it to go straight on or are you still thinking business or are you thinking--
Speaker 2: You mean now?
Speaker 1: No. I'm talking about you've finished--you graduate Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] in 1939?
Speaker 2: Then I, I went to law school at the University of Maryland [Baltimore, Maryland] for two years.  And then I was drafted in 1941.  And then I came back in 1946 and finished my last year.
Speaker 1: Now was that your decision at that point?  Did you want to go into law school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because I remember you said--had your mother been having an influence on you at this point?  You know or some point?
Speaker 2: No, but she was--as it turned out she was quietly programming me.  Programming.
Speaker 1: And what would she say?
Speaker 2: "Well William!"  She had a bigger party for me at a hall--some, somewhat like a Bar Mitzvah.  When I became--when I was thirteen and confirmed in the Episcopal Church and she decided to have a Friday afternoon party for me.  And she had a card printed "William H. Murphy Esquire."  It was very subtle.
Speaker 1: My father was like that to me too.  (Laughing) He kept saying, "You know."  He had wanted to be a lawyer.
Speaker 2: So you know.  but then--so you got--you came back immediately from Oberlin and went into the University of Maryland?
Speaker 1: Right. Graduated in June and went to law school in September.
Story_ID: 11209
Speaker 1: How many blacks were--Weren't you the first that--?
Speaker 2: No I was the third.  I was the only black in my class [at the University of Maryland School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland].  And it was a pleasant experience.  I didn't have any problems.  As I probably told you earlier the, the dean of the law school was a very fine gentile from a old Maryland family.  He went to Dartmouth and Harvard Law School. He never wanted to practice because he had money you know. And, he created an atmosphere.  I'm not going to tolerate any prejudice in this school.  You're all going to talk to the professors.  You're gonna teach, treat Mr. [Donald G.] Murray who was the first black, like anybody else.  I grant that the court of appeals has said that colored people can come to this school and they're welcome.
Speaker 1: Now what year did Murray go in?
Speaker 2: I think he went there in '35 [1935].
Speaker 1: And then who followed Murray?
Speaker 2: A man named Calvin Douglas.  And then I was the third.
Speaker 1: And, now how was this experience to you at this point?  Was it different from Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio], in many ways?  Was law school--was it different at all?
Speaker 2: Well, don't forget I was married in my last year.  And I didn't have any time to fool around with college people, you know!  I had to get home, get my books--of course (chuckle) I was--I'd go to a public auction every Monday to buy damaged and unclaimed freight.  And I'd buy commodities and what not and sell 'em; you know and make a few bucks so I was always hustling.  And, and then my wife was a notary and she picked up a little money doing that. And, I lost my train of thought.
Speaker 1: You were saying that, where you--I don't know where you were headed with it but you were just talking about you didn't have--you know you didn't have time--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have time to socialize.
Story_ID: 11210
Speaker 1: Now I want to ask--so how did you meet your wife?  How, how did that come about?
Speaker 2: I, my, my older sister's husband is from Wilming--was from Wilmington.  And so we'd go to Wilmington [Deleware] from time to time to visit, my brother-in-law's mother and sisters and we became family.  Then I met a friend who was in, in Lincoln.  Who was a friend of mine. And I went up one Saturday to the football game.  I think Lincoln and somebody and, he lived across the street from my wife's girlfriend. And that Saturday Afternoon he introduced me to my wife.  And, and I, I met her, and I fell in love with her and I said, "that's the woman I'm gonna marry."  And so I pursued her for three years.  And we got married.
Speaker 1: So you met her in like your sophomore year of Oberlin?  Is that
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No I was in, law school.
Speaker 1: Oh in law school.  (unclear) No, no, no!  You said you were married your first year in law school.
Speaker 2: No.  I was married in my last year in law school.
Speaker 1: Okay, Okay.  I see, okay.  See I was--okay.  But you--
Speaker 2: No.  We got married in 1942.
Speaker 1: 1942, you graduated in 1939 from, from, Oberlin.
Speaker 2: Right.  So I was in law school when I married her.
Speaker 1: Okay, '46 [1946] you got, okay.  But that's what I was wondering.  So were there any courses in law school that you liked particularly?  Did you like the whole experience?
Speaker 2: No.  I wanted to get in and get out.  I, I didn't have any time to fool around.  I didn't try to make law review or, get, get the hell in and get the hell out.
Speaker 1: Now when you graduated, you have a wife, you have any kids at this time?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Two!  You have two okay.
Speaker 2: Um-
Speaker 1: And, and so what are your thoughts about setting yourself up in your pro.. profession?  You--when you first got married, were you--did you set up a house s--separately?  Or were you
Speaker 2: No I was in the army.
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: So we didn't live together.  She lived at home.
Story_ID: 11211
Speaker 1: You finish law school [University of Maryland School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland].  You had--are you still involved in the junk business?
Speaker 2: No.  I, when I--when I passed the bar, a lawyer who is a friend of the family said, "You can start your business from my office."  And so he, he, he didn't, he, he'd get me to do titles, you know.  Nine dollars to run a title but, I had to make my own business, you know.  And, my business just went off.  I never looked back.  I never had a bad month in practice.  And every time we'd have another child, my business would go up maybe by ten thousand dollars more a year.
Speaker 1: Now why do you think your business went off like that?
Speaker 2: Well, because of my father and then the Afro [American Newspaper] didn't hurt.  Half of 'em liked me.  Half of 'em like the Murphy's and half of em hate the Murphy's.  Because you know you're right and they're right about your business.
Speaker 1: Now I--the question I have is you, here you are, you've, you've come back--you've, you've come back to Baltimore and your family is very established.
Speaker 2: Um-
Speaker 1: You start this practice.  You say the person who started it was a family friend.  Had he grown up on Argyle or I mean--
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Was he--the gentleman who started you out the lawyer?
Speaker 2: Oh no.  He was from Philadelphia and migrated to Baltimore to practice.
Speaker 1: And, so and the nature of your practice at that time was?
Speaker 2: General.  Accidents, divorces, estates, general.
Speaker 1: And did you--is this something that you grew to love?  I mean was it a profession that you grew to love?
Speaker 2: I didn't particularly care for it one way or the other.  It was a, a, a matter of making a living. In fact, after twenty-three years in practice, I was suffering from burnout.  And because law is very de--practicing law is very demanding.  And so I decided that I wanted to be a judge and, that's it.
Story_ID: 11212
Speaker 1: In this, whole period, we're talking about, the 40's [1940s] and--you know we're talking about 40's, 50's [1950s], and 60's [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Um-
Speaker 1: You know n that 23-year-period.  And I'm just wondering were there things that were significant during that period that happened or--you know were sort of the background of changing times--you know?  Arthur was talking about you know after the war the whole community sort of changed--you know Baltimore Community changed--
Speaker 2: Um-
Speaker 1: Around and you moved to an area called Cherry Hill.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When you moved there, was that a middle--was it; was it a middle class neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Poor neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Now why did you choose that?
Speaker 2: Well I lived in a--before we moved to Cherry Hill, I lived in a--when, when I moved my family to Baltimore after the army, I moved in a place called Sparrow's Point.  Bethlehem  Steel Community Company Town and there was a new development for black people built in this area called Day Village.  And so we moved there.  Nice new unit you know.  And, then I was living on the G.I. Bill that paid for my last year college you know, and gave me an allowance of ninety dollars a month and the rent was fifty two dollars a month.  And so it was, it was a little more than we could afford.  So, I applied for housing in Cherry Hill and they were just finishing the building of the project.  And, we moved into a brand new unit.  Two bedrooms.  The rent was $19.25 cents a month.  Heat, light and gas included.  So it was a--we lived there for about a year and-a-half.  And then I finished law school and we had to move because we would be over income.  And you couldn't practice--be a tenant and practice law.  And so we decided to stay in Cherry Hill.  And that's where I built my original practice.
Speaker 1: Now what was happening on Argyle Street or the other area you mentioned?  What was the, the hill?  What's the hill?
Speaker 2: Druid Hill.
Speaker 1: Druid Hill was famous in, in the sort of black society.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was, it was the neighborhood. As I said there were all, all professional people up and down the whole street.
Speaker 1: So those places were still intact?  Druit Hill was still intact at that time, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you ever think about moving there or was that not for young couples?
Speaker 2: No I, I never considered moving back.  My mother was distressed that we moved to Cherry Hill.  And she owned a lot in Morgan Park which is a very exclusive neighborhood next door to Morgan College [now Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And she said, "William I'll give you that lot if you'll build a house on it." So, I said, "Ma thank you just the same."  But I said, "I can't make a living in, in Morgan Park. All those professional black people go to white lawyers."  So I said, "no."
Speaker 1: And that was the case. So there had--things had changed a little bit right?  They had changed from the time that remember when you said you were growing up and everyone used everyone else's services?  Remember you were saying--
Speaker 2: Oh, but that was for doctors.
Speaker 1: That was for doctors but not for lawyers.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay. Okay.  So lawyers--blacks always went to white lawyers.
Speaker 2: Um-
Speaker 1: Black--other black people went to white lawyers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But my clientele were working class black people.
Speaker 1: And what made you identify--made you identify with the working class black person--it was just practical.
Speaker 2: It was, those were my newspaper customers.  And in Cherry Hill they were my neighbors.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And we were very active in the community in Cherry Hill.  We were two of the founding members of the Cherry Hill Presbyterian Church.  My wife worked at the church in outreach programs and political, education programs and what not.  Everybody in Cherry Hill knew us.
Speaker 1: Now when I di--wasn't your wife also from an established family?
Speaker 2: Um-
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did her--did her family have--your mother had some issues.  Did her family have issues about her--you know you setting up shop in Cherry Hill?
Speaker 2: My wife's family [Madeline Wheeler Murphy].
Speaker 1: No they were indifferent about it.
Speaker 2: They were indifferent.
Speaker 1: They accepted it.  They were never critical about it.  They were always down visiting us.
Story_ID: 11213
Speaker 1: This whole thing of being involved in the community.  That's something that you and your wife shared right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And the Presbyterian Church.  You had--you had grown up in the Presbyterian Church?
Speaker 2: No I grew up in the Episcopalian Church.
Speaker 1: The Episcopalian Church. So what happened?  How did his change over to, to--
Speaker 2: Well I we--I went away to college.  And, my mother said, "Now you be sure to go to church."  So I, I went--no before that, when my sister wanted to become a nun, the, the diocese in Maryland, refused to admit her because they said that they weren't satisfied that she had gotten the call from God.  Can you imagine that?  And I became angry with them.  And so when I went to college, I joined the church and I was an alter boy and the priest wouldn't have me.  And so that just ended the relationship with the Episcopal Church forever.
Speaker 1: So now what attracted you to the Presbyterian Church?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we, lived in the projects and, a nice young black Presbyterian minister was, brought to Baltimore by the Presbytery to start a church in Cherry Hill.  And he lived across the street from us and we became friends and we became involved and so we joined the church.  And we helped to build it.  And all of our children went there.  And it was a very progressive church.  It was a seven-day institution.  All kinds of outreach programs, you know.  And the ministers lived in the community!  And, and we had a succession of three very capable, very honest, very committed, young ministers.
Speaker 1: Now is this black Presbyterian?  Or white Presbyterian?
Speaker 2: What.
Speaker 1: The church.
Speaker 2: It's black.
Speaker 1: It was black.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was black--all black neighborhood.
Speaker 1: 'Cause there, there are not that many black Presbyterians.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Ask him.
Speaker 1: Third person:  "Point, .000, .0 3 percent or something like that."
Speaker 2: Okay.  I mean I had involvement with our white Presbyterian Church in the small town I grew up--and they are very you know, active.  But you don't really--you know that's not a ch--a church of choice mainly in the black community.
Speaker 1: Well I--I, I, I joined it because it was near.  And it was just coincidental that my father was a Presbyterian and I had gone to his church from time to time, you know.  So, within the black Presbyterian community, the churches were highly regarded.  And they had all--and all of their ministers were highly educated, you know, very fine men.
Story_ID: 11214
Speaker 1: Now, what I'm trying to get an idea of in this period of time where you're practicing--the twenty-three years that you're practicing.  You know you're obviously--you're--you know, you and your wife are having children, and you know, you're raising them.  But I'm trying to get a sense of what were the things that were affecting you at the time?  You know you were active in the community you know, but what were the things that were sort of pushing you?  Of, you know either your concerns or you know? Were they mainly family concerns? Concerns for your family, concerns for the black community, concerns--What were the things that were--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well were--we were interested in politics, my wife and I.  And all the children were in politics and, I ran for public office four times.  I ran once for city council, once for the house of delegates and once for the orphans court and finally the municipal court I won.  And my wife [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] ran for public office two or three times and [sons] Arthur [Murphy] ran for public office and, [William H . Murphy Jr.] Billy ran for public office.  So, we were very politically oriented.
Speaker 1: Now why, why was that?
Speaker 2: Because--
Speaker 1: I mean its one thing to say your kids--your kids are crawling in your footsteps so why, why you and your wife?
Speaker 2: Because, it was no point in complaining about the white man.  You've got to achieve public office.  And be in a position to, make change.  And you can only do it through the political system or the economic system.
Speaker 1: And who were. Who were the people who were your role models at this point in time?
Speaker 2: Well, they were all old, you know.  Warner T. McGuin, a man named, Walter Anderson, Harry S. Cummings, George Waddy.  There were any number of, of early on, black politicians.  So even as a child, my family were voter oriented, you know.
Story_ID: 11215
Speaker 1: And the--and the Afro-American [Newspaper, Baltimore, Maryland]was driving a lot of the--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Discussion in the community.
Speaker 2: Oh it was a very powerful, publication.  Like the Chicago Defender [Chicago, Illinois], Pittsburgh Courier [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  Those were the--the big three.  They were, influential in their local communities and nationally also.  And it was all about politics.  And they--they urged people--black people to vote and to vote for black candidates.
Speaker 1: Now are there stories about the Afro-American that you would like to share or you know things where it took maybe a position or you know that had repercussions or--
Speaker 2: No but it was--The Afro [American] was hard nosed.  I mean the, Carl Murphy [uncle] had the guts of a burglar.  He didn't back off from any white person.  And, people read it and loved it.  Very influential.
Speaker 1: Did he ever get any threats or anything like that?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: No. Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  That wasn't Maryland.  They did the lynchings on the Eastern shore.
Story_ID: 11216
Speaker 1: Let me tell you a story.  I retired, but you know I had been sitting for the last eighteen years in retirement.  Oh about ten or fifteen years ago, they asked me to sit on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  So I was in this, town in Jers--I mean on the Eastern shore I can't think of it.  Snow Hill.  So I'm down there for a couple days.  I take my wife with me.  She stays--we stayed on the board walk in Ocean City [Maryland].  So, I had this case of these three young white girls from Montgomery County and, they were using dope on the beach.  Openly, you know, and arrogantly.  And they were arrested and, I was the trial judge.  And I found all three of them guilty.  And I'm--there are only two black people in the courtroom.  And the courtroom is wall-to-wall white people.  And I sentenced the three, white girls to thirty days in the county jail.  And this black man sitting on the second row said, "Jesus Christ!"  (laughs)  So I didn't pay attention to it.  But anyway after my session was over, I saw him on the outside.  He was waiting to see me.  I said, "What were you--wha--what was that all about?"  He said, "Judge,"  he says, "let me tell you one thing.  He said, "I aint never seen a black--colored judge in my life. And I aint never seen a black man send three young white ladies to jail."  And nobody wanted them to go to jail.  The state's attorney didn't want them to go, nobody wanted them!"  He says, "You're gonna have some trouble down there."  And I said, "Naw, I wasn't even worried about it."  But, I think the, the, the sheriff came up to--he said, "Judge, he says you know you upset a lot of people down there.  He said, look, and I'm concerned about your safety.  He says now I want you to follow me until we get maybe 25 miles up the road."  I said, "It's up to you.  I don't care.  I ain't worried."
Story_ID: 11217
Speaker 1: You know, you just said no I never had any problem. They were--you know the guy who headed it up--
Speaker 2: I, I was admitted to law school and one day the president of the University of Maryland [Baltimore, Maryland] called me and asked me if I'd come down to see him at the headquarters in College Park [Maryland].  So I said, okay and I went down.  And I took my sister-in-law.  I suspected something was amiss and I took my sister-in-law as a witness.  So he said, "Murphy," he said, "Look I, I don't have a lot of time to talk to you."  He said " Look, you've been admitted to the University of Maryland Law School [Baltimore, Maryland].  I don't want you to go there.  I don't want no colored people in my law school.  He said, "I heard that you were admitted to the Harvard Law School," [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I said, "That's right."  He said, "Here's what I'll do.  I'll pay your tuition, room board, books fees and three round trip tickets from Boston [Massachusetts] to Baltimore if you go to Harvard and not to the University of Maryland."  So I said, "No, I, I don't want to go to Harvard."  And it, it--I think it was one of the best judgments I ever made and I'll get to it in a minute.  I said, "No, I've been away for four years.  I only lived twelve to thirteen blocks from the law school.  I can walk to law school and I said no I don't want it."  He said, "Well let me tell you this.  You can get in but can you get out?  Suppose you fail.  No other law school is gonna have you.  You'll never become a lawyer."  So I said "Well I graduated from one of the five best academic schools in the United States.  And if I can get through Oberlin, I can get through anything you got here."  So I said, "good day."  So then about a month later, I was in downtown Baltimore and I ran into, the dean of, Howard University Law School [Washington D.C.]. A great man named William Henry Hastie.  You've heard of Hastie.  So he, he knew me.  He knew my father because they were all active in the NAACP.  So we were talking about this, that and the other and I happened to mention the experience that I had.  He said, "Well, Bill you know you got to go because you're the only applicant.  If you don't go the door will close."  I said, "But Dean Hastie I'm not thinking about not going!  I just happen to mention it to you.  I'm gonna go.  I said don't worry about it!"  So he said, "Now in the unlikely event that you fail, which ain't likely at all graduating from Oberlin, you know," he said, "I'll admit you to Howard University Law School in your second year as if you passed."  So I had a backup.  I was mildly intimidated by the president.  Mildly but not panic you know, because as I said I, I believe that--in, in one of my political science courses we had a professor who was talking about the Supreme Court and we read all of the famous cases out of the Supreme Court.  The Dred Scott decision, you know, this one, that one, the other.  So I was thoroughly prepared.  Then I knew and the--and the dean of Howard Law School was a man named Erwin Griswold.  And he inter--he was a trustee of Oberlin.  And he, he interviewed the five, five or six of us who had applied to Harvard Law School.  And I made all D's my first year.  And, and in my third year, I made all B's you know.  So he said, "Oh you're admitted."  I said, "I'm surprised that I'm admitted that I would be admitted with that academic background."  He said, "Well the first year it doesn't count.  We don't count that at all."  He said, "You made all "Cs" in your second year, all Bs in your third year.  You're ready."  And he said, "We keep statistics on the performance of all college graduates. And he said we'll, we'll admit an Oberlin student with a C and maybe a D+.  Because no Oberlin graduate has ever failed Harvard Law School.  He said by the same token, we wouldn't admit an A+ student from the University of Notre Dame.  Because none of them ever graduate."
Speaker 1: Now you said you made the right choice.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, because from an academic--from a economic point of view, when I graduated, all of my classmates became, lawyers for big insurance companies, state legislators, assistant prosecutors you know.  And so it was made doing business in the legal community so much easier.  For instance I had a--I had a case to try in Baltimore and the same day I had a case over on the eastern shore of Maryland.  So now I got to get up at 5:00 in the morning, drive all the way over (unclear) to get the case postponed, and I'd be worn out you know.  So I, I said, "Oh the states attorney is my classmate."  So I call him and said, "Clayton, this is Bill Murphy.  Look you know I have a case here."  He said, "Yeah I know.  Your appearance is in."  I said, "Look I get this pand--I got this carry over trial in Baltimore and I don't have to come down there and ask for a personal."  He said, "Bill don't worry about a thing.  I'll postpone it."  That's what I'm talking about.  Economically!  Politically!  You see what I mean?
Story_ID: 11218
Speaker 1: What about the first black law partnership at One Charles Center?  What was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, what happened was a friend of mine, was appointed a municipal court judge.  And he had to run to keep his seat and he lost.  And so one night I was at home just lamenting the fact that, he had lost and he's got to start all over again you know.  So--and my wife said, "Why don't you form a partnership and rescue him and have him in it?  And go over and see them.  Brown, Allen and Watts were, were not a true partnership but they were--they were--shared expenses.  But they only had--they bought the building together but they--their practices were independent of each other.  And so I went over to em one day and I talked to, one of them named George Russell.  He was an associate in that firm.  Not a partner.  So he bit at it like a barracuda.  And, and my wife said, "You know you can get spacing in One Charles Center which is a brand new office building."  But my wife was on the community action commission and they had something to do with it.  And they had to have a clause in there that--you had--they had to accept you know all tenants.  Irrespective of nationality.  So, we got together, we rented space in Charles Center and we figured that the five of us together would generate maybe twenty per cent more business.  It was 200%!  We went into orbit!  And in ten months we got together March 1st, moved in, we did $385,000  worth of business in ten months of 1963.  That's a hell-of-a lot of money.
Speaker 1: You were millionaires really! That's a--that's amazing.  Still with the same clientele.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well all of us brought our client together--
Speaker 1: Clients together--
Speaker 2: Plus new clients.  I, I had a schoolteacher, who wanted, wanted--needed a will.  And she said, "I almost went to a white lawyer.  But then I remembered you and George Russell and how you boys got together and I thought I'd come down and, and look you over."  And she was just overwhelmed.  And she talked about all of her other teachers and we got all kinds of business.  Then, the judge who lost got reappointed and won and then another partner became a judge.  Then I became a judge.  And another partner became the assistant state's attorney.  And the other became a master in chancery and we didn't have the vision to make it continue.
Speaker 1: That's a shame in a way.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's you had it right there in your hand--you had that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, so people just sort of left it then did their own thing at that point.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Point.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 11219
Speaker 1: when you made the decision to run--you know, for you know to seek judgeship--
Speaker 2: Um-
Speaker 1: Tell me what that whole process was like.
Speaker 2: Well, it cost money to run.  It cost money to run.  So, my wife agreed with me that that was what I wanted to do and so she went along with the program.  And, we, we decided to put up some money.  And we figured that what amount of money we would put up that I wouldn't blow my brains out of I lost.  Or wouldn't effect us economically.  So I think we agreed on $30,000.  So, I didn't have any fund-raisers, no, no politicians would back me because they figured it's hard to unseat a sitting judge.  And, and we won!  I won as, as a judge.  My former partner, won as states attorney, first black state's attorney, Parren [James] Mitchell won his first seat in [U.S.] Congress and it was a joint ef--effort.  It ran citywide.  And then we picked up two new state senators and four new members of the House of Delegates.  It was a fantastic year politically!  But it, it, it was never really publicized to the point that it was resaturated the black community about the enormity of the win.
Story_ID: 11220
Speaker 1: I'm not asking for negativity.  I'm asking for introspection, you know, that, you know that, why--because we all come to decisions at certain--You know, for certain reasons.  You know and so that's what I was really trying to understand.  You know, from an introspective mode.  What you felt. Because you obviously got very active, you know, in a, in a sort of, you know, help pull people up.  These were--you were--I mean these were your clients. Right.
Speaker 2: Also and they were providing an income for you.
Speaker 1: But you could have been living in another community and have your office over on Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: You began to identify with the plight of your client.  And you saw your middle class peers hold contempt for black lawyers and--So I just want to understand.  Just--. I mean not that much on it.  But just from a, you know, what was going on inside.
Speaker 1: That's true.  You know, I've, I've joined the Alpha fraternity because all of my brothers were Alphas [ref. to Apha Phi Alpha fraternity] and Tom Murphy was an Alpha.  And, they were buying a fraternity house in Baltimore.  And, and the president who was a lawyer didn't put in the "if" clause, "If you can't get financing, your $5000 would be refunded,"  you know.  Because the white person owned it and agreed to finance it.  But he didn't put it in.  The lawyer didn't figure it was, you know.  The guy was trustworthy, a businessman, you know.  So, he reneged at the last minute.  So I was president of the Ideal Savings and Loan Association.  And he came to me in a panic, and said, "Bill, you gotta finance it."  And I said, "You know, Charlie, we, we don't make commercial loans. We--you need $20,000 held over.  That's about $5--4,000 mortgages that we can loan to Black people to move into the new areas.  Because the white savings and loans wouldn't finance that area."  So anyway, I, I put it through.  And they had a opening ceremony and moved into the house.  There were about forty or fifty brothers there, and you know.  They introduced me.  Charlie Hyde praised me for saving the day, and asked me to have a word.  So I said, "Brothers, I was glad to do it."  And I said, "You know, this is the only commercial loan we ever made.  We're home buyer people, loan people."  So I said, "What I'd like you guys to do is all of you open up savings accounts of $500 some minimal amount to replenish the $20,000 to loan to black people."  I got one account and that was the president.  And we had guys in there, doctors who could have financed it themselves, you know, out of their own resources.  Not one.  And it just made me angry.  So I haven't bothered to, go to fraternity meetings at all 'cause they,  we don't do anything of any moment.  they have a big convention every year, spend $2 million.  Well the AKA's [Alpha Kappa Alpha]--. Well the AKA's and the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta sorority] are getting more politically active.  They're, they're very active.  But the Black Greek letter fraternities are still back in the--on the plantation.
Speaker 2: Now that's what I'm saying, Judge Murphy.  So what was the--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously)  (Unclear) and I didn't join the Boule'.  A good friend of mine, a Boule' man, he's a doctor.  And I was his lawyer.  And he said, "Bill, come on.  I want to sponsor you for the Boule'."  And I said, "George, you--" And I went on to tell him.  And he said, "I know all that.  But we need somebody like you who can put some spark in it."  I said, "Man, that's a farm that I ain't prepared to plow.  And it's too difficult."  I wouldn't join.  And then--I was, I never joined the--What's another--?  Lodgeman.  I was never able to join--I was never asked to join.  And I would not. I would have been blackballed if I had been asked and applied, you know.  And my wife [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] never joined a sorority.  And our girls [Madeline Murphy Rabb, Laura Murphy] will never join sororities.  Of course, it had its downside.  Then they, they, all belonged to the Eastern--Northeasterners.  And we kid each other.  "Now daddy, we're going to the Northeasterners and we're not going to do a single thing but eat and have fun.  Nothing else." (Laughing).  But we were never socially oriented.
Story_ID: 11221
Speaker 1: Your brother George Murphy--You represented before the House Un-American Activities [Committee].  And I want to talk about that.  Because it fits in this foray we've been talking about, about social activism. And, talk about him a little bit and how, you know, in what role-- 'Cause he was let--. He was sort of left of center of you.
Speaker 2: Was he?  Was he, wa--?
Speaker 1: He was a-a-a-all the way over.  He was a dyed-in-the wool [member] of the Communist party of the United States.  Now what else.  You couldn't be any more left than that.  And, he was a tiger.  So, he was brought up before the House on Un-American Activities Committee.
Speaker 2: Now what year is this?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-one I think.  He really didn't need a lawyer.  But he had a Jewish friend who was a left wing lawyer too.  And I was on the left. I had entertained the idea of joining the Party.  But from an economic point of view, it made no sense whatsoever.  And I, I wouldn't join.  So, we appeared and they put him on the stand.  (Changing voice) "Now Mr. Murphy, we want to know if you're a [Communist] ?" "Don't you dare ask me a question like that!  You're from the 44th district of Mississippi and you've got those black people in peonage.  And you ought to be doing so--"  and he went on and on.  "Better hurry up and get him off!  Get him off!  Get him off!"  He was on the witness stand 20 minutes.  So I represented a number of people who were accused of being Communists during that era.  And there were only three or four lawyers, of all the lawyers in Baltimore City [Maryland] who would take the cases.  So I was representing this black trade unionist.  And he was scared to death, in anticipation of going there, you know.  So, they, they call the lawyers in the afternoon before.  "Murphy, let me tell you one thing.  You're representing this Communist.  And if you're not careful, we're thinking seriously about bringing you before the Committee."  You know.  And I said, "Yeah."  And I said, "If you do--and when you do, when I get on the witness stand, I'm going to talk about you goddamn fairies.  All of you are homosexuals."  And one was--Roy Cohen, his buddy.  His fairy girlfriend and Mc--Joe McCarthy was gay, you know.  "All of you ought to be exposed.  Don't you fuck with me."  And, of course, when I appeared before them, he--my client was only on the stand about 15 or 20 minutes and they let him go too, (laughs).
Speaker 2: So you actually said that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, .
Speaker 2: Now you were so--you--even though your brother was, you know, left of center.  I mean were there--were there sort of two sides of the family?  Was this the very activist side, you know?  Who was--Or was it
Speaker 1: Yeah--he, he and I were the most, you know--My oldest brother was ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] oriented.  You know, that's respectable.
Speaker 2: [daughter Laura speaking] Oh yeah, (laughs)?
Speaker 1: In that era.  Yeah, of the local chapter.  And, my brother Jim [James Henry Murphy], I always considered him a Republican.  But he was a registered Democrat.  He was on the conservative side.  And, and I was on the left side.  Now my father was a Republican, but after [President Franklin D.] Roosevelt won, and he was appointed by a black politician to the Housing Authority, all of us converted over to Democrats.  Now my father was not left wing at all, you know.  In that era he was rather conservative.  And he didn't, he didn't--he didn't--he said, "Black people can't afford to be Communists.  It's hard enough being black.  And you're just gonna make it ten times worse from an economic point of view."  You know, which made sense.  And that's what made sense to me.  Now a couple of my Jewish lawyer friends were closet Communists.  But they all had thriving practices, you know, in the black community.  And they could afford it.  And they tried to recruit me.  But I said, "Hell no."
Story_ID: 11222
Speaker 1: What did you feel strongly that black people had to do at that time to, to, you know, get themselves together? Had that--. I mean at that particular time, I'm talking about from the '50s  [1950s] to this, you know
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It's always the same.  Put more black people in important public offices where they make important decisions.  And to get into business.  Historically we want to be schoolteachers, social workers and what not, you know.  Business.  That's where the money is. In business.  We're a capitalistic nation.
Story_ID: 11223
Speaker 1: When you were talking about growing up.  And you and your parents, you know, with you at home, you talked about sitting around the, you know, the dinner table and talking.  And, and you did that with your children also didn't you?  Okay.  Can you describe the di--? The dinner table?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the, the dinner table, I always tried to get home in time for supper.  That was one of the big arguments I had with my law partners.  I'm a come-homer.  As--money's important, but being home at dinnertime.  And then I'd come home and I'd supervise.  My wife [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] would cook the meal, put it on the table.  And we'd all sit around and eat.  The kids would be asked, "Well, what was your problem today?  What happened?"  This that and the other.  We encouraged them to talk, you know.  And, and then after dinner it was my job to see that they did the dishes and cleaned up.  And, with Laura and Houston I, I would put those two to bed.  Bathe them and put them to bed.  So there was a division of work between my wife and me.  And then we'd, we'd, talk to the--encourage them to articulate.  as an aside one day Laura came home and we were talking at the dinner table.  "What happened to you in school today?"  And so Laura said, (talking in little girl voice) "Daddy, Her--Herman Jones called me a, a white, a half white mucker bucker."  So I said, "Arthur, tell her what he said." "I don't know Daddy."  Houston "I don't know."  And I said,  "What he was saying was he was calling you a white motherfucker."  And then I explained to her what the words "mother, motherfucker" meant.  And I said,  "It was white because she is fair."  And, she said, "Ohh!" And that was the end of it.  It never came up again.  And then Houston came home one day when he was a little kid.  And we were talking about colored people and white people.  And Houston said, "I'm not to be colored Daddy!  I'm not to be colored!"  'Cause he was fair also, you know, (laughing).  And we'd go into the whole routine.  But it wasn't anything we couldn't talk about.  It was an open forum.  As I said, we encouraged them to tell it to us rather than get it in the street.  You know.
Speaker 1: Was that something you and your wife discussed?  Or it was just--Was that mainly your influence?  Or--
Speaker 2: No it was joint.
Story_ID: 11224
Speaker 1: Of course, I've never won an argument from my wife. Arthur was home from New York or some place.  And, he was in the kitchen, sitting at the kitchen table.  And my wife [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] was going up one side of me and down the other.  And then she left the room.  And he said, "Daddy, you let Mamma walk all over you.  One of these days she's gonna take your pants off and put 'em on herself."  So I said, "Arthur, let me tell you one thing."  I said, "Number one, she was completely right in her concerns.  And number two, I love her."  And that was it. I wouldn't--I couldn't--man I couldn't win no argument from my wife anyway.
Speaker 2: Now, since we're talking about, would you share one favorite story of your wife and one for each of your kids?  Would you do that for me?  You've talked about Lau--.
Speaker 1: Well, Arthur became unemployed up in New York, for the Battin-Botton?
Speaker 2: Now you can't look at him.  I'm allowing him to do that.
Speaker 1: Ogilvy and Mather.  And he was--
Speaker 2: Start again, I'm sorry.  Start again.
Speaker 1: Arthur became unemployed from, his New York employer Ogilvy and Mather.  And he wasn't doing anything, you know.  Sitting down day in and day out.  And all the kids had gone, you know.  So my wife and I were happy just to be in the house together, without any children around.  And so, I don't know how it happened.  A friend of ours was moving to Chicago [Illinois], Val.  And she wanted to get rid of her house around the corner from us.  And I encouraged Arthur to take it over.  And I put him out.  And he never, never forgave me, (laughs).  'Cause he was a pain in the rear.  Like somebody looking in your bedroom so to speak.  Not, you know, not actually.  And, I told you about Laura.
Speaker 2: What about Madeline?
Speaker 1: Well, Madeline was engaged to be married, to this young black [Johns] Hopkins [University] Medical School [Baltimore, Maryland] graduate.  Brilliant fellow.  And, we planned a big wedding, you know.  And then the night before the wedding, she came into the living room and told us she didn't want to get married.  And I think I had spent about--this was in 1963.  The year [President John F.] Kennedy was assassinated.  I, I had obligated myself for about $3500, which was, you know, a lot of money.  And, I said, "Madeline, don't give it another thought.  Don't worry about the money.  Don't worry about nothing.  If you don't want to get married, don't get married."  So we called it off.  And the Afro [American Newspaper]  had a headline in it, "Bride says No."  Or something like that.  On the front page.  'Cause the Afro would put your business in the street, in a minute.  And, the boy got married.  He married another nice young woman.  He was, he was a neurosurgeon.  And he had a problem of some sort.  And he married this very lovely, young woman in Washington [D.C.].  He was--I think he was at Howard University Medical School teaching and one day she blew him away.  So--then [WIlliam H. Jr.] Billy, a story about Billy.  He was in M.I.T [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And he fooled around in his second year and he picked up a deficiency or so.  I kept after him about, "You better go to summer school and make it up."  'Cause I said, "I promised you and your siblings four consecutive years in college.  You don't have to work. Your mother and I will pay for everything.  And I'm not gonna pay for another year."  So he fooled around and he didn't, didn't do it.  And then he said, "Well, Daddy, you know, I need to go to M.I.T. for another semester."  And my wife and I both said, "I don't care if you never graduate.  I wouldn't give you a penny."  I said, "Madeline is in college."  There were times when we had three children in college at the same time, you know.  And, so he went in to see the dean about something.  And, he said, he wasn't going to be able to graduate because he needed another half a semester.  And M.I.T. doesn't want you to fail, they don't let you in unless you're academically an A.  And if it's an economic matter, they loaned him the money to finish.  Now let's see.  Houston--we, we let--we--when, when it came time for the kids to go to college, we would give them a list of colleges that they could go to.  And they'd say,  "You can go to any one of 'em?"  "Yes."  But, he couldn't go outside the list.  They didn't know that, you know.  So Houston chose Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And it was a disaster.  It was during the takeover by college kids, you know.  Where the deans and everybody else fell back and what not.  And, he didn't graduate.  But he's done all right though, in spite of it.  College.
Story_ID: 11225
Speaker 1: Let me tell you this about Laura [Murphy] also.  She was in her last year at Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts].  And I had made an investment, a client of mine, I had got him his SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] license.  And he had his own brokerage company.  And so he, he, recommended I put Laura in a Druyfus growth fund.  Something like that, when she was about seven or eight.  And the fund grew to a point where it paid three and a half years at Wellesley.  I didn't have to take anything out of my money.  So the last year was a little tight for me.  So, anyway, she was--well, we had a telephone bill.  I mean it was enormous.  She had--"This is Laura Murphy, charge this to my account at 3 so-and-so-and-so."  And she'd talk all day with her sister Madeline, you know.  And it was enormous.  You know.  Anyway, I didn't complain about it.  So she was coming home.  And I said, "Laura, why don't you take a bus?"  (Speaking in female voice) "What!  Take a bus!  No indeed."  I said, "How about the train?"  "No!"  I said, "You know, you save me some money flying, you know."  She flew home.
Speaker 2: At least that's a good story.
Speaker 1: (daughter Laura speaking) Now that you've ragged on me.  Can you think of something great?
Speaker 2: Now you say--About each child.  They're right.  What, what are you proud of from each child?
Speaker 1: (Laura speaking) This is for a taping.
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm proud of all five of 'em.  Equally.
Speaker 1: It's a parent thing, (laughs).  I don' know, but they're right about that.
Speaker 2: So they can be right.
Speaker 1: (Laughs).  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laura speaking) Sally became a judge, Arthur ran a successful political campaign, Madeline became a prosperous artist.
Story_ID: 11226
Speaker 1: During the time that you were--You know, you've been--served on the bench.  Are there anything, any--Or during any of your campaigns, were there anything's that you considered most memorable?  You know, that you would like to recount?
Speaker 2: No, not particularly.  I made a difference.  I made a difference because number one, I was not appointed by the governor.  And I didn't have any political baggage following me when I went on the bench.  Because most, most lawyers were appointed judges know--. Owe their allegiance to the governor or their alderman or what not.  You know.  And I used to kid my, white counterparts.  "I'm the only judge on the bench who can't be reached by anybody.  I don't owe anybody any money or anything of that sort."  And I made a difference.  Because I would talk to the white judges, some of whom were very prejudiced.  And I would go into their chambers and go after them in a minute.  And this one particular judge I remember who was a racist.  He, he hated black people.  He hated Jews, and he not only took bribes, but he asked for 'em.  He demanded them.  And he had abused this young black lawyer and his client and I straightened it out.  And I went in to see him one day.  And I went after him, you know.  And, he said, "It ain't none of your business."  I said, "I'll tell you what.  You're Irish Catholic.  From now on whenever I have an Irish Catholic defendant before me, I'm gonna treat him like you treat black people.  I'm gonna give him the book."  "You wouldn't dare do that!"  I said, "The hell I won't."  I said,  "Look Harry, you forget.  We are co-equals.  We have the same power."  And I don't know whether it had any, made any change in him.  But I think he got the message.  So that, that was an important contribution, to make.  It's like, like state legislators. So you're gonna kill my bill, Okay, I'm gonna kill your bill.  You know.  And then, I, I made certain that black people were treated fairly and properly.  I never wanted to be unfair like white judges were historically.  So I think that was my  primary contribution.
Story_ID: 11227
Speaker 1: During World War II you actually lived in Chicago?
Speaker 2: For a year.
Speaker 1: And how was that experience?  You said Chicago [Illinois] was one of your favorite places.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) yeah, um-
Speaker 1: And I know she lives there now.
Speaker 2: I was in--I'd served in North Africa.  And I came back to the United States and I was in army intelligence.  We made investigations of army personnel.  I hated it.  I, I never liked the idea of inquiring into peoples' business, their most intimate affairs.  You know.  Anyway, I lived on Langley [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois]  with, the first black college professor [at theUniversity of Chicago professor, Dr.] Allison Davis.  You know his son?.  He, Allis--Allison senior was on a sabbatical in Hawaii or something of that sort.  And he was anxious to have somebody that his wife knew to live with them while he was away.  And she was from Wilmington [Deleware] also.  And, we lived there for a whole yea--Almost a whole year.  And then my sister Rebecca lived in, in, Chicago.  And she was having her--She wanted to convert her house on St. Lawrence, 6542 St. Lawrence, you know, a lovely neighborhood.  Still nice into four apartments.  But she could only get the permission if she--if it was related to the war.  And since I was a soldier, she was able to get it done.  And we lived there for the rest of that year.  And then I was sent off to OCS [Officer Candidate School] and moved away from Chicago.
Story_ID: 11228
Speaker 1: Let me ask about the values you instilled in your children.  I asked about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well we, we brought our children up in the church, we, we, feel that they should be exposed to religion.  And what they do after they become adults is entirely up to them.  but, you're not a proper parent as far as we're concerned, unless you expose your children to that area of life.  of course, we always urged them to be truthful, and to be honest, and fair with one another.  Tolerant of other people's shortcomings, you know, traditional family values.  look forward to being independent.  get married, have some children, don't live beyond your means.  Save some.  I--when she got married, I gave her a dowry of $500.  And I, I put--And rather than give cash, 'cause most people will squander it; especially young people.  I put it in a mutual fund.  You know about mutual funds.  Washington Mutual.  I used to bug her about adding $25 a month to it, you know.  And for whatever reason,  she wouldn't do it.  And finally I, I asked her whatever became of it.  And this was about two, about two years ago.  And, and she fin--she--it was almost ready to escheat to the state.  Because they--she had changed addresses so often, they didn't know where to send the thing.  And she was about to lose it.  And she finally caught it a few months before it would have escheated.  And, the thing was worth $7,600.
Story_ID: 11229
Speaker 1: That was the other story about Eddie Brown.  You know, that you had-- you--with the meeting with (unclear) Price? What, what happened there?  I mean and how did you get in--. You know, when did you first start looking at the stock market too?
Speaker 2: Ooh!  I started looking at it, when I was,  I guess in my 30's.  I'll tell you about Eddie Brown second.  I'm in my office one Friday and this bucket shop operator from Toronto, Canada calls me and said that, "I'd been highly recommended as a speculator," This that and the other.  "And I'm coming out with a new issue called, North Span Uranium.  And I can let you have 10,000 shares."  And uranium was in the market at that time.  They'd just di--beginning to understand what it was.  And I think it--You know, the atomic bomb and all that kind of stuff.  So I said, "No, I'll buy 1000 shares, 25 cents a share."  So I bought a thousand shares and I got a certificate.  I could never find out any quotation on it.  And, my broker told me that I'd wasted my money.  And I said, "I didn't ask you to characterize anything I do."  So then on a Friday I was reading the Wall Street Journal.  And it said that North Span Uranium was gonna be listed on the American Stock Exchange Monday morning.  So I was in court Monday morning.  But after I finished my case in court, I went over to the broker.  And it came across at $4.50 a share.  So I watched it, and watched it.  And on another Friday afternoon, I went by and it was up to $9.50.  And I said, "I'ma hold it until it gets to be $10.50 and I'll have $10,000."  So I got up to a corner and I said, "No, I'm gonna go back and sell this goddamn stock.  'Cause bears make money, bulls makes money and hogs lose money."  And so I got $9.50 a share.  And I sent Billy [William H. Murphy Jr.] to three years of M.I.T. [Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, Massachusetts] with that.
Speaker 1: So how did you get introduced to stock--to the stock market though?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd heard my mother, and her sisters talk about the stock market.  And they were telling a story about, how their father did a coming out party for a blue blood who turned out not to have any money.  And the guy stiffed him out of his fee.  It was a charge.  And the man gave him 5,000 shares of Cosden Petroleum that was worth a penny a share.  And so he put it aside.  And then Cosden Petroleum grew and was merged into this one and that one and the other one.  And by the time, I dissolved the trust that my grandfather had created for his wife and children, I figured out how much it had kicked out to him.  And it was something like $180,000.  So you know, that fascinated me.  So one day--I, I'd been hearing about the stock market.  And I was really upset with myself being a lawyer and not knowing anything about the stock market.  So I went to Merrill Lynch.  And it so happened that the manager of Merrill Lynch was named Warfield.  His grandfather had been governor of Maryland.  And it turned out he--He said, "I know who you are Mr. Murphy."  He said, "You're the Afro [American Newspaper, Baltimore,Maryland] people."  But he said, "Your grandfather [James William] Hughes was our caterer."  And so he assigned me to an up and coming young broker.  And, in, in those days, it was déclassé for a white stockbroker to have a black client.  And they were all in this big room.  You know.  And so I had to straighten him out, you know.  I said, "If you don't act right, Imma take you to your leader."  And of course if I did, Warfield would have chewed him out.  Anyway, he recommended a stock called Monsanto Chemical trading at 25 cents--$25 a share.  So I bought 25 shares.  "You ain't gonna make no money buying that kind of a small amount of stock."  "Just buy the goddamn stock.  You recommend it highly."  And in about eight months time, it was up to $85 a share!  And so from that point on, I began to buy 100 share lots.  And I've made money in the market and I've lost money in the market.  But I've never been out of the market.  And I follow the CNBC 'cause I have a lot of time, you know.  But I only speculate.  I'm as invested as I'll ever be.  And I have no inclination to go deeper, you know, into the market.
Story_ID: 11230
Speaker 1: Have you addressed who you have helped?  You know, and why it was so important that you help other people in other legal professions?
Speaker 2: Well, the answer to that is simple.  When I came to the bar, you, you don't know beans about the practice.  And Black lawyers always helped me.  If I had a difficult matter I wasn't sure of, I could go to any Black lawyer.  And we, we always had a segment in the Black legal community who were top drawer, you know.  'Cause we--Like anybody else, we have our dummies.  We have our 'A' lawyers, our 'D' lawyers and 'C' lawyers, you know.  and so I feel indebted to them.  And then there was one lawyer in particular.  A lawyer named Roy S. Bond, who helped me.  I was his junkyard.  He never liked to turn a client away, no matter how petty the case.  And so he'd farm it out to me.  And he gave me a lot of business.  And so I, I feel the same obligation.  That I ought to do it.  It's, it's a responsibility.
Story_ID: 11231
Speaker 1: So how many people did you--do you think you influenced during your life?  Who were young people coming through?
Speaker 2: I don't know, a gang of 'em.  I think I've, I've counted twenty-one lawyers out of Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood].  And I'm satisfied that I--I was a model, you know, for most of them.  And then, look.  And there are six judges from our community.  But, look, black people have given me an excellent living all my life; from the time I was a newspaper boy.  They gave me everything that I wanted, or ever hoped for.  They gave me the judgeship.  And so I'm forever grateful to my community.  I owe it to 'em.
Story_ID: 11232
Speaker 1: Well, what are your hopes for that community?  You've had a--you come from a prestigious family.  You're life has been involved in the Black community.  What are your hopes for the Black community now, going forward?  You have, you know, grandchildren and great grandchildren.
Speaker 2: Well, talking about the black community generally, you know, black people are a remarkable group of people.  No ethnic group in America other than the Indians has been through what we have been though.  We've been through our Holocaust.  But we are also a remarkable group of people.  We have survived the racism of South Africa.  And we'll survive.  We'll survive.  Now of course, the Indians were all but annihilated.  But they're beginning to show some signs of awakening.  But, we're a remarkable group of people.
Speaker 1: What do you hope though for  the future generations.  What do you--? What are your hopes though?  Do you have some?
Speaker 2: Well, but, we can do better.  We've got to improve the breed.  So to speak.  And we can do better.  I have--I have the young Black people before me for say, a charge with possesion of Marijuana, you know.  And I said, "Look, you know, there was one charge that they should have leveled against you."  And they said, "Well, what was it Judge?" I said, "Being stupid.  What you did was stupid.  You're not a criminal.  It's stupid.  You're bringing the house down on your head.  You're soiling your reputation."  And so I talked to people.  And, so I owe a lot.  And, I'll forever be indebted.  I don't look forward to being out of the debt to the black community.
Speaker 1: What do you think is unique about the black race?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What do you think is unique about the black race?
Speaker 2: Our survival instincts.
Speaker 1: That's it?
Speaker 2: Um-
Speaker 1: Our survival instincts.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now do you think in terms of what our legacy is in this country?
Speaker 2: (Long pause) I don't quite understand the question.  Whose legacy?
Speaker 1: The African American--black legacy.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's gonna be a great legacy.  We're gonna survive and prosper.  And, we're, we're growing politically, educationally, business wise, generally.  We're moving ahead.

Speaker 1: Do you think that the Civil Rights Movement, would you consider that the most important thing that happened to black people?
Speaker 2: Well, it was very important to, black people.  And it was not a gift to us.  Although there have been a certain segment of the non-Black community that have been, fair minded.  Like, we've had some good Presidents like Jimmy Carter, who was a good person.  An honest person, a fair-minded person.  And then we had--of course we go back to Franklin D. Roosevelt.  He's, he's the first President I voted for.  And, Franklin Roosevelt brought in these programs.  But he, he was not a liberal.  He saw the big picture.  What effects Black people effects White people.  Like social security, WPA [Workers Progress Administration].  It was across the board.  You see what I mean?  His wife was the great liberal.  then we had, of course Jimmy Carter.  I mean, [President Bill] Clinton.  Very fair.  I'm not upset ab--I'm, I'm sorry for his wife and his rascality.  But if he were--if he, Hillary--if all the men who had been unfaithful to their wives and lied about it, we'd get 90 percent of the male population.  And I'm not upset about his lying about it. What man in his right mind would confess if he thought he could get away with it and not, you know, not hurt her.  But he was a good President for Black people.  Oh, and LBJ [Lyndon Baines Johnson].  And LBJ was a dyed in the wool Texas cracker.  But of course, he was a political opportunist.  He saw the value of the black vote.  And, [John F.] Kennedy could not have gotten the Civil Rights Bill passed.  Kennedy was a snob and prejudiced too.  But, LBJ knew how to broker a deal.  "Now Henry from Mississippi, what is it you want?  You want those four federal judgeships.  All right, well then vote for this bill and you'll get 'em.  If you don't vote for it, you ain't gonna get 'em."  Or "You want this project down there with  $85 million in it.  And you're gonna get all the gravy out of it.  Then vote for this or else you ain't gonna get it."  So he was all right.  You know, and it took a lot of courage for him to, promote Thurgood Marshall to the, Supreme Court.  But the Republicans hadn't been worth a nickel to black people historically.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Just to be remembered as a decent human being, and one who they thought did his share for the group.

Speaker 1: I'm talking about Brown against Board of Education.  I wholly support it.  I want every black person to be able to make a choice as to where they want to send their children to school.  But it has devastated us historically.  In, in our community, Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland] when Brown against Board came down, they took all of our best black teachers and put them in the best white school and sent us the dregs of the white community in the black teaching community.  And it was devastating.  And we're just beginning to, overcome it.  I believe in affirmative action whole-heartedly.  I believe in quotas.  Because that's the only way we can guarantee that we're gonna be able to participate in the better things economically in the United States.  The playing ground is far  from level.  I want to be the person who determines the qualifications.  Because if, if you leave it to a group of White people, we're never gonna be even equal, let alone superior.  So.
Speaker 2: So what do you feel about integration though?
Speaker 1: Oh, it's all right.  It's all right.  It's bound to happen.  But, there are a lot of people who are not in favor of it.  so many White people who are, who are fair-minded are just scared to death.  Who, say, chairman of the Board.  Chairman of the Board gets all of his top level people and says, "Now listen goddamn it we aren't  gonna have any prejudice in this company.  And everybody's gonna be fair--Treated fairly, and promoted on merit.  And if as John F. Kennedy says, 'If you do not work with vigor, I will replace you with a nigger.'"
Speaker 2: He said that?
Speaker 1: That's what he's alleged to have said.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's alleged.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) We had a--we had a woman, who was a,  who helped the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] to come to full bloom in Baltimore [Maryland].  And the story is she called Kennedy one day and said, "Now President Kennedy, when we gonna have a black man on the moon?"  And he allegedly said, "Ms. Jackson, I assure you real soon there'll be a coon on the moon."
Speaker 2: You know that--. It's interesting your characterization of him.  Because I think that's, you know, people--Jobs can get short shrifted  a lot.
Speaker 1: Hmm?
Speaker 2: LBJ.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Gets short shrifted.  And Kennedy gets elevated.
