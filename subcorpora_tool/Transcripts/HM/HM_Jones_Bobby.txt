Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask. And they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Lightweight, okay.
Speaker 1: They're like a warm up.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) All right.
Speaker 1: The first one is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Pause) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).

Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite phrase or saying? "Amen goes right there," is the favorite phrase for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That means, it is so.
Story_ID: 652256
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family, and your father's side. But we'll start with your mother's side first. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Well, her full name was Augusta [Augusta Tharpe Jones], A-U-G-U-S-T-A, Lena, L-E-N-A, Mae, M-A-E, Sally, S-A-L-L-Y, Tharpe, T-H-A-R-P-E, Jones, J-O-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: All right. Now, because you're involved in gospel music, I have to ask you if the Tharpe is in any way related to the, a famous--
Speaker 2: Rosetta Tharpe?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They said we were (laughter). I have no documentation on it.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: For a long time--you know, because there were a lot of Tharpes where, where I'm from.
Speaker 1: Really? Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, a whole community of Tharpes, Teagues and Travises. They're all in there. And so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when we heard of Rosetta (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tharpe is not a name I've heard very much around the country, spelled like that. I've heard of a lot of Thorpes--
Speaker 2: T-H-O-R-P-E.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: These are the Tharpes. T-H--
Speaker 1: No, I haven't heard many Tharpes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I see.
Speaker 1: Rosetta Tharpe is the only Tharpe I can name, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm, you, you are just too much (laughter). You know, Rosetta Tharpe is--
Speaker 1: We had the albums at home, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sister Rosetta Tharpe.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, so, at any rate, what can you--what is your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know the year. It was May 6th.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Henry, Tennessee [Henry County, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: All right. Was she a young woman when she had you, or, can you kind of estimate about when she was--?
Speaker 2: Well, I think she married when she was fourteen. I think she was about seventeen or eighteen when I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't do a lot of questioning of our parents during that period of coming out of the country to--so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About 1911, I guess, or '12 [1912], would it be?
Speaker 2: What, when she was born?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: My dad [Jim Jones] was born in 1912. So, I would say maybe 1915, '16 [1916], something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fifteen [1915], '16 [1916], okay. So, you didn't ask a lot of questions in those days?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't. You know, we just did what we did (laughter), farm. I'm a farmer.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now, what can you--oh, where was your mother born?
Speaker 2: Henry, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: In Henry, okay, the same place. And where, where is Henry in relationship to Nashville [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Henry is about 120 miles from Nashville. The county seat for Henry is Paris, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family? I mean, how far back can you trace your ancestors, and what were they doing as to--? Are there any stories from--?
Speaker 2: You know, it's very unusual that we knew no more than my mother's brothers and sisters. We didn't know her mother [Cornelia Tharpe] or father [Moses Tharpe]. We can't trace anything any further than that. We never talked about it. And so, I knew their names, I knew her mother's nam- her mother's name and her father's name. And that's about the extent. I don't know where they were from.
Speaker 1: Do you think they were from Henry as well?
Speaker 2: In that area, of course.
Speaker 1: Okay. I mean sometimes there's a tradition that the parents came from somewhere else.
Speaker 2: No, no, they--I think they all were from that area. I really don't know (laughter). I really don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's the assumption at this point, that they're from around there--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's an assumption.
Speaker 1: --in the area. And what kind of work do you think they were doing?
Speaker 2: They were all farmers, sharecroppers, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what Henry is. It's not a city, and it's basically not a town. It's just a rural area.
Speaker 1: So, your grandparents had passed away by the time you came along?
Speaker 2: Her parents, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, so, now, how many siblings did your mother have?
Speaker 2: She had four brothers and three sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So, that's about an average size fa- family in those days.
Speaker 2: In those days, yeah, they usually had a lot of children.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind all of her names? She's got five--
Speaker 2: All of those names (laughter). Man, those are some names. I asked her about that, I did ask her about that. And she said that her mother liked--that they were all going to be her name. Instead of Augusta, it was going to be Sally. Then it was going to Mae, then it's going to Lena, you know (laughter). So, they just put them all in one frame. And we always tease her about that, Augusta Lena Mae Sally Tharpe Jones (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, tell us--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Strange, that was.
Speaker 1: Well that tells us a little about her mother. Her mother didn't, she had a, you know, was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that one sister's name--one of those sisters. Well, she had one straight blood sister, and the other two girls were half-sisters. And they didn't have long names like that, though (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, your mother was the only one that had the long name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, had the long name, yeah. But of course, the Tharpe--the Jones was added to it at the end.
Story_ID: 652257
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Augusta Tharpe Jones] say about growing up? Did she have any stories about growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: Of their lifestyle at the time?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As she was growing up?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what life was like for her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah. It was, it was a rural life, basically farming. What they did was cotton, crops of that nature, and raising farm animals that were edible. (Laughter) They--I don't know whether they had any working animals or not. They never talked about that, and we didn't either.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, sharecroppers, basically?
Speaker 2: Sharecropping.
Speaker 1: And they worked cotton for the--?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Yeah, where we were was cotton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About forty, fifty miles away, it was tobacco.
Speaker 1: And then they would grow the food that they ate?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother have a chance to finish school, or was there a school nearby?
Speaker 2: No, eighth grade. She finished the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, that's better than some places--
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: --in the rural South, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, do you know the name of the school she attended?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let me assume that it's the same one that I attended. It was Caton elementary [Caton School, Henry County, Tennessee], C-A-T-O-N, because all of us when to a one, one, one room school. Did you ever interv- interview anybody that had that kind of background?
Speaker 1: Yeah, just yesterday (laughter).
Speaker 2: Really, same?
Speaker 1: Right, right. No, Mr. Shaw. [HistoryMaker] Johnny Shaw.
Speaker 2: Johnny Shaw?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Is he from here?
Speaker 1: From Bolivar [Tennessee], yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: From near Bolivar.
Speaker 2: From near Bolivar, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there are plenty of people that have that kind of--
Speaker 2: Background?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And we've never had a family reunion. So, that's how a lot of stuff, you know, I missed, you know. So, keep going.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So, so, your mother was able to go, go to the eighth grade. Now, to go to high school, she'd have to probably have to go to another town?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Paris--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --Tennessee (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right, right. So, what was your mother interested in, growing up? Did she talk about something that she liked to do? Like, I don't know, she might have been a singer.
Speaker 2: She was just a housewife. I never heard her mention anything, or ascribe to any kind of occupation. You know, during that growing up period, when they got married, that's what they did. They farmed, raised children. And occupations were so few, as you know. And with no money, what was she going to do? You could be a nurse or a schoolteacher, maybe, for a female. It was very limited. So, no.
Speaker 1: Well, there were lots of talents you could have. So, you know, though they may, you know, be modest things.
Speaker 2: A lot of talent?
Speaker 1: Yeah, talents we could, we could have. We can sing, we can dance, or dance, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean, a lot of things.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, is there anything that she particularly--?
Speaker 2: Well, she could sing.
Speaker 1: Okay. Does that run on her side of the family, singing?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Out of the other ones that I knew, none of them sang.
Speaker 1: All right, all right, okay. So, so, she went to the eighth grade. And then she, did she get married after, after--
Speaker 2: Yes, she did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) grade school, okay.
Speaker 2: Married my father [Jim Jones].
Speaker 1: You said about fourteen?
Speaker 2: Fourteen, uh-huh.
Story_ID: 652258
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side.
Speaker 2: Now, that's even dimmer. But (laughter)--
Speaker 1: All right. Can you give us your father's full name and spell it (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His name was--now, listen. J-I-M, J-O-N-E-S, that's it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Jim Jones, okay.
Speaker 2: You brought him back alive when you said it like that, "Jim Jones." That's what they called--say it like that (laughter). Uneducated, totally.
Speaker 1: So, he didn't go to school at all?
Speaker 2: No, he couldn't read or write.
Speaker 1: And what is date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 12th, I believe it was, 1912.
Speaker 1: And where was he born, the same area?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, Henry, Tennessee [Henry County, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, you said you know even less about his side. So, you didn't meet your grandparents? You knew your grandparents on that side--
Speaker 2: I knew his grandmother, I mean, I knew his mother and father, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what were their names?
Speaker 2: Lydia Jones [Lydia Dinwiddie Jones], L-Y-D-I-A, was his mother. And Bill [William Jones], B-I-L-L, was--Jones was his father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his grandfather's name was Antiny, A-N-T-I-N-Y, I think, Jones.
Speaker 1: A-N-T--
Speaker 2: T--no, Antiny. T-I-N-Y, I believe that's how he spelled it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Antiny. His last name was, that was his mother's father. And his last name was Dinwiddie, Antiny, D-I-N-W-I-D-D-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, Antiny Dinwiddie. So, you think this, you think it was attempt to spell Anthony in a rural setting?
Speaker 2: Possibly, I never asked.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you remember the basketball player, Anfernee Hardaway [Penny Hardaway]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it seems like it was, somebody was trying to come up with Anthony.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: You don't think--
Speaker 2: No. Antiny, you know, I don't know where that came from, but I don't think it was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --related to that.
Speaker 1: The last name was Dinwiddie (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were unsophisticated people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay. So, they, your father's people were basically sharecroppers?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they were. Sisters, he had four. Brothers, I only knew of one.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, so, did your father ever talk about growing up, and what it was like for him?
Speaker 2: He was just a farmer. He was uneducated, so he just did nothing but what farming required. He had no talents of any nature that we knew of, beyond, you know, what he was doing as a farmer. He was not even a good handyman. My father's life was very dire, very suppressed. He was an alcoholic, so we didn't get very much out of him.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, he would--but he still, he worked?
Speaker 2: He worked as a farmer, a sharecropper.
Speaker 1: Would he drink on the weekend, or--?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's usually a pattern, you know. Hardworking people, you know, even in the northern cities, work--you know, factory or something, or doing labor--and on the weekend, they drink.
Speaker 2: They let it go, huh? (Laughter) Yeah, this was typical of most of those men in that little town that I can remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the same story for the coal miners, the same thing.
Speaker 2: I could see that, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I mean, was it, was it an issue when you were growing up, I mean, his drinking (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it was a major issue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so, I imagine it was a much bigger burden on your mother [Augusta Tharpe Jones] than anyone else.
Speaker 2: It was a big burden on all of us, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, how did the family manage to deal with it?
Speaker 2: We just did, just lived through it.
Speaker 1: So, was he, would he get abusive?
Speaker 2: Yes, verbally, basically. He was a small guy, so he wasn't--we could all whip him (laughter).
Story_ID: 652259
Speaker 1: That part of his [Jones' father, Jim Jones] family were mixed.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, what part of his family, I mean--or his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) My, my--
Speaker 2: --his, you mean his family--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --his family was mixed?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You couldn't tell it by looking at my grandmother [Lydia Dinwiddie Jones] and my grandfather [William Jones], basically. But his sisters looked like white women. They all were very light skinned with black hair (laughter). So, they wore wigs, even back then, if you remember that. You know, good looking women, they were. So, the most, the only story that I heard about, a little bit about them--they never, none of them ever talked about things, you know. And so, by the time I was eleven, I had left all of them anyway there. One of the sisters' sons was murdered and put on a railroad track. Well, he was white, but he was her son. But he was by a white man. So, yeah, living in that area [Henry County, Tennessee], they just killed him. I don't know the reason.
Speaker 2: You don't know the circumstances of--
Speaker 1: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) why they killed them?
Speaker 1: I don't know why. They didn't talk about it.
Speaker 2: So, was this done before you were born?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, it's basically a lynching you're talking about, even though there wasn't no rope. But, you know, they still count it as a lynching.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh. I think they shot him, I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Then put his body on the railroad track?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, I remember that much.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, I take it that race relations were not, you know, very good?
Speaker 1: Typical, typical south- southern rural.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay. Now--
Speaker 1: And oddly enough, I went there Monday of this week. My sister [Lula Jones Puckett] lives in a little place called Paris [Tennessee]. And she's aging, and she just received the message that her cancer returned. So, I went to see her and took her and her husband [James Puckett, Jr.] for a ride. And I said, "Let's go to the country." So, we drove around to try to see if anything was still there that we knew of when we were kids. It's only ten miles away. Interesting.
Speaker 2: Did you find anything?
Speaker 1: A few things. You would think that after--let's see, well, it's probably sixty years ago. So, the schools, none that was there, you know. The homes that we knew of, the roads that we knew of, had been--however, the town hasn't grown. In fact, it is, it's almost like gone. You know, there were stores when I lived there, a little strip of stores. And it was something to see, disheartening, actually. So, I sat there and I said, "This is where I grew up. God, how did I ever get to this, where I am, growing up here?" (Laughter) It's--you never know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm sure a lot of people have those backgrounds, yeah.
Story_ID: 652260
Speaker 1: Your father [Jim Jones] is a little older than your mother [Augusta Tharpe Jones], not by a whole lot.
Speaker 2: No, not by a whole lot.
Speaker 1: But, but, but a little bit. Is there a story about how they met, or--that they tell?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Or how they got together?
Speaker 2: Isn't that interesting? We never talked about things like that. It was just living and working and watching him get drunk (laughter). And all of his sisters were drunkards as well, and my mother's, they--on both sides. They all drank and had a terrible reputation--fighting and that kind of thing, on my mother's side more than on my father's side. They were the warriors, I'd call them.
Speaker 1: So, they were more dangerous on your mother's side, in terms of fighting and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother drink?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of them.
Speaker 1: Did she have--okay, so she had the same kind of, a similar problem?
Speaker 2: Not as bad as him, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I think that's because she was a female (laughter). But yeah, they both did.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, it kind of speaks to a life that's not--you know, a trying life, in a lot of ways.
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Now, when you think about your parents, their personalities, their sense of humor, how they walk, how they talk, what they look like, you know, their attitudes, their hobbies, talents, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My mother. I'd like to think so, even if I didn't (laughter). Yeah, but she was more assertive than he was. He didn't have very much going for himself. He never had jobs, just enough to maintain.
Speaker 1: Now I wondered, like, how he was, how he was able to--I know the sharecropping system. You always got cheated. But now, some people, people--even if they worked like twice as hard as everybody else, they still were behind. Did he have trouble with the landlord, or whoever it was, in terms of--?
Speaker 2: There was some (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he accused of not doing enough work?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say he had trouble, because they wouldn't allow trouble. You just did what they say do. You know, it was kind of like slavery, in a way of speaking. It was the segregation in the South. You talk to a lot of guys who went through that, too? Yeah, yeah, it was a, it was a rough life, you know. And I was desirous of being removed from that environment. And no one, either on my mother's side or my father's side, were educated. They, none of them, I think, went to high school. They didn't have a high school. They just started working after they went through grade school, if they finished grade school. So, I don't know what the history was for the rest of them. We got, you know, aunts and uncles and things. I don't know what they did earlier. I know they didn't go to high school, I know that. Because the high school was in the--ten miles away. They had no way to get there, you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Yeah, ten miles, that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they was not going to take a horse and buggy to high school every day. You know, so they had no way to get there. So, we never really talked about family background, what they did, how they got to be who they were or--you know, we never did talk about it. My sister [Lula Jones Puckett] and I would talk to each other, wondering how we got all these white women in our family (laughter). And all of them were drunks, you know. So, they led a, they led a very--I wouldn't say interesting, but, man, it was a life that I wouldn't want to live growing up.
Story_ID: 652261
Speaker 1: Can you name your siblings, starting with the oldest and, you know just kind of tell something about them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, there was three of us. My oldest brother is named James Jones, J-A-M-E-S. And my sister's name is Lula [Lula Jones Puckett], L-U-L-A, Mozell, M-O-Z-E-L-L, Jones, Puckett now.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. And what are they doing?
Speaker 2: My brother is deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a, worked for the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] in the United States Armed Forces.
Speaker 1: Now, this is interesting (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: He worked for the CIA?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, my brother was smart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He did go to college for a year or so.
Speaker 1: All right. I mean, well, you are, too. So, that's two of you. So, let's, let's, I mean, so this is an interesting story. So, this is your older brother. So, he comes out of a situation where his dad's a sharecropper, barely hanging on, he's drinking too much, you know. People are shooting and fighting and cutting each other, and he becomes a CIA agent.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh (laughter). Yep. He went to the [U.S.] Army after that. You know, we couldn't afford to send him any further than a year at Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee. And he had to go to the Armed Forces to survive, you know.
Speaker 1: So he succeeded, I guess, first, before you did, in terms of getting out of there?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's eight years older than I am. So, I was like, you know, if I'm eight years old, he's sixteen. So, that's about when he left home. And he--
Speaker 1: So, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) he lived a lot around the world, traveled an awful lot.
Speaker 1: Were you close to your brother?
Speaker 2: No, because he was gone.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a big gap. Eight years is a big gap.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: But a brother of that age in some ways can be like a father early on.
Speaker 2: But he wasn't there.
Speaker 1: He wasn't around?
Speaker 2: No, he was in the Armed Forces.
Speaker 1: Well, when you look--
Speaker 2: He wasn't around.
Speaker 1: Now, I'm just saying, when you were born, he was eight?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, I mean, he couldn't have been in the Armed Forces then? So, I mean, did he provide any, I mean was he a role model for you coming up?
Speaker 2: Well, think. He was eight--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --when I was born. When I got to be five or six--six and eight is what, fourteen, right? Okay, so he's on his way to high school, or something. So, we didn't live in the same house. He lived--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's--
Speaker 2: --with my [paternal] grandmother [Lydia Dinwiddie Jones], and I lived with my mom [Augusta Tharpe Jones] and dad [Jim Jones]. But they were close, close proximity. But no, he was not a father figure or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, the reason why I was first--like, my brother is seven years older than I am. And, you know--
Speaker 2: But you were in the same house though, probably?
Speaker 1: Yes, we were.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, the house--
Speaker 2: Did he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) makes a difference, well, more of a difference.
Speaker 2: Did he go away?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he went away to college.
Speaker 2: When you were very young?
Speaker 1: No, he left when he was seventeen. So--
Speaker 2: And how old were you?
Speaker 1: He was seventeen, I was ten.
Speaker 2: You were ten?
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, there's a difference. I mean it's a different household that's making the difference in that case. Because if he was around he probably would, you know, being in a rural setting, you'd be around him a lot, I would think, even though you may not--
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't around him a lot growing up.
Speaker 1: All right, so, and he goes off. And your sister, did she--did she leave, or did she--? Well, she's in Paris [Tennessee], you said, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, she's in Paris, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, she basically stayed, stayed (unclear)--
Speaker 2: She basically stayed in the same area. She never left the area, you know. She got married after high school, and started raising a family, and she stayed there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Fortunately, both of them are still alive, she and her husband [James Puckett, Jr.].

Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Do I have an early childhood memory?
Speaker 1: Earliest.
Speaker 2: I suppose so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) First thing--
Speaker 2: --I suppose so. I can remember things back in, generally when I first started elementary school [Caton School, Henry County, Tennessee]. Because I was like--
Speaker 1: I mean the first thing, the earliest thing, earliest.
Speaker 2: How early?
Speaker 1: At all, you know, earliest? Do you have one?
Speaker 2: No. How early?
Speaker 1: Earliest, the first memory that you can think of.
Speaker 2: The first one?
Speaker 1: Actually--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --remember.
Speaker 2: I don't know what that could be (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right, that's okay. Some people do, you know. They--
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they know when they first--they mark their memory by something that they remember. But, you know, and then some people don't. It's not a, you know--
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So, well, so, when you were growing up, it was you and your mother [Augusta Tharpe Jones] and father [Jim Jones] and your sister [Lula Jones Puckett] in the household?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And did any grandparents live with your or anything?
Speaker 2: I lived with my [paternal] grandmother [Lydia Dinwiddie Jones] for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In that same house that my brother [James Jones] did.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay. And my parents built a little house down--you know. You know what? We owned property, and I don't know where it came from. We were living on our own land, but it was not productive. It was a nice little piece of land. My uncles and something kind of lived around us a little bit, and they had their property adjacent to ours. But we couldn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's kind of (unclear). What we were saying about sharecropping--they were, I mean if you had--they had land, they weren't sharecropping. They were--
Speaker 2: Well, we couldn't, it was--the land was not fertile. And so, nothing would grow on it, basically. That's why we had to find some white guy's, you know, property, I'm sure, to sharecrop with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We could use our--we couldn't use our little bit of land.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm trying to think. I don't think my uncles could either. It just wasn't--I think they tried, you know. I think I remember us plowing it, and trying, and planting seed for cotton. But it never came, you know.
Speaker 1: It was just exhausted land that you--
Speaker 2: Exhausted land, yes, that's a good word for it. In fact, none of our neighbors used their land for agricultural processes during that period that I can remember. I'm reflecting on the land behind us, you know, and beside us. And no, they all did the same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, so, did your grandmother live like near the town of Henry [Tennessee], or the, where the stores were?
Speaker 2: It was a mile.
Speaker 1: About a mile?
Speaker 2: A mile, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, she was out in the rural--
Speaker 2: Everybody had to walk, you know, to whatever. We didn't even have animals to ride, you know, like a horse or mule or something (laughter), you know. We had to walk.
Story_ID: 652263
Speaker 1: We always ask this question: what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Henry County, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Sights were cotton fields, a few houses. Smells of cooked hog meat (laughter), of vegetables, some smoke from the train; a train ran close to our house. No distortions. Springtime was wonderful, smell of the blooming of the trees, the flowers on the trees. And yeah, that's basically it that I--yeah.
Story_ID: 652264
Speaker 1: I know church was a big part of growing up, I would think. Is that, that true?
Speaker 2: I went to Sunday school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And after Sunday school I--I'm Methodist. I went to church practically every Sunday. My parents didn't go, but I did. My mother [Augusta Tharpe Jones] would go sometimes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My dad [Jim Jones] never went until later in life.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Coles Chapel A--C.M.E. [Coles Chapel C.M.E. Church, Henry, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, it's a C.M.E. church [Colored Methodist Episcopal; Christian Methodist Episcopal], okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, and so, you would go every Sunday. Were you really involved when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I was always involved in something (laughter). Yes, I sang in the choir in the church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know when I started, but whenever I could sing, I started singing in the choir.
Speaker 1: And who was your pastor?
Speaker 2: Oh, god, I can't remember.
Speaker 1: I know as a C.M.E., like the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], you know, there're appoints--
Speaker 2: They rotated (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, appoints, yeah.
Speaker 2: But not as much in that little place, they didn't as much. One of their names was Fitzgerald, Reverend Fitzgerald [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oddly enough, the last one was Reverend Cole, C-O-L-E. But the church was not named from him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because the church was there before he came.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I remember him. Thanks for bringing those memories back. A lot of that stuff had, (laughter) you know, I haven't experienced mentally again. I think the church is still there. It looks relatively good. I saw it Monday.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, it is, is it in Henry [Tennessee]? (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: In Henry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, would you have to walk on Sundays?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: To church?
Speaker 2: We had to walk everywhere--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --unless we went to Paris [Tennessee]. Then we'd find a ride with somebody, whoever had a car.
Speaker 1: So, it would take you like, what, a couple of hours to get--
Speaker 2: To church?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, church wasn't that far.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was about a mile, like the, like the town, you know. We were kind of like a mile from everywhere that way (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right. That makes more sense, okay.
Story_ID: 652265
Speaker 1: Now, what about school? You said the name of the school is Caton [Caton School, Henry County, Tennessee]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --elementary school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: C-A-Y-T-O-N?
Speaker 2: No, C-A-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: C-A-T-O-N, okay, I'm sorry. All right. So, the school went from first grade through--
Speaker 2: All eight grades in one room.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One through eight.
Speaker 1: One through eight, all right, okay. Now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I always loved school.
Speaker 1: Were you a good student?
Speaker 2: I was smart (laughter). Yeah, I started, I made two grades in one year. So, you know, when I finished the eighth grade, I was eleven years old. I should have been twelve or thirteen or fourteen, or something like that. So, I went to high school [Central High School, Paris, Tennessee] when I was eleven.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you started school in '46 [1946]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-six [1946], okay. The war [World War II, WWII] is going on at this point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the war was '45 [1945], yeah.
Speaker 1: And were any members of your family involved in the war?
Speaker 2: I'm sure they were, I don't remember who it was. Yeah, one of my uncles was in that war. My brother [James Jones] was in the Korean War.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So, okay, so, the war's going on. Did that, did that seem like it was too far away for you all to be concerned with, or was it something that was talked about a lot when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember that one uncle, he was the only one that I can remember that was ever a soldier at that time. No, he never talk- I wasn't around him enough for him to give us any war stories of any sort.
Story_ID: 652266
Speaker 1: Did you all have a radio at home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a battery radio. It had no effect on--we didn't, didn't--no news, like that, you know. We didn't listen to news. Basically, we listened to country music on Saturday nights (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, really?  Was it the 'Grand Ole Opry'?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew them all (laughter). That was our gathering; that was our music; that was our entertainment on Saturday night while my mother [Augusta Tharpe Jones] and father [Jim Jones] would go out and drink, wherever they found it. We'd be there with my [paternal] grandmother [Lydia Dinwiddie Jones] listening to country music.
Speaker 1: Now, a lot of people say that, and that surprises people. But you know, that's the kind of music you could get, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the only kind we could get.
Speaker 1: All right. So, now, do you remember, there was one black artist with the Grand Ole Opry [Nashville, Tennessee] who played the harmonica, named Ford, something Ford. Ford was his first name.
Speaker 2: Ford Bailey [sic. DeFord Bailey], is that him?
Speaker 1: It could have been, could be, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, from here, from Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. We knew of him, but we didn't know he was black (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, because they said they didn't, they didn't advertise he was black.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. So, but at any rate--so, what about the Joe Louis fights? Did you listen to those?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we would listen to that. It was--we were excited about him, you know, as a boxer, yeah.
Story_ID: 652267
Speaker 1: Was the little town segregated, in terms of signs and stuff, like colored here and white there, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, there was nothing in these little towns, in that little town, that I can remember, that needed that. I know they had two little cafes, and we would have to go to the back. That's about it. There were no other facilities that would require that, unh-uh, just those two little beer joints they called them.
Speaker 1: So, there were few facilities to segregate, in some ways.
Speaker 2: Yeah, too few, (laughter) in Henry [Tennessee], in Henry.
Speaker 1: I imagine though, there was a white school, more than likely, right?
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) City boy, of course, nothing was mixed. I mean, you know, it was all segregated, okay.
Speaker 1: All right, all right. So, now, at Coles--no, not at Coles--at Caton elementary school [Caton School, Henry County, Tennessee], did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: I didn't really like my teachers there (laughter). So, I guess Betty Craig [ph.] was probably the--C-R-A-I-G--was the one I liked the most, I think. And she lived right over the hill (laughter). The other ones--let's see, there was a, what was that woman's name? Her face came to me, but I can't remember her name. I had three teachers in elementary school. The first one was hell; the second was okay; and the third one, we didn't think she deserved the job. You know how it is with your neighbors (laughter). But anyway, the favorite teacher, I would just say Betty Craig.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, the first one was pretty rough, huh?
Speaker 2: Oh, Miss Lee, Virginia Lee [ph.]. That was her name.
Speaker 1: I mean how so? Was there a lot of corporal punishment in school? Or, what went on?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you know, teachers were different than they are now. They had control. And so, she'd beat your butt if you didn't do right. And your mother would support it, you know, because they had good relations with all the parents, you know, of the kids that went to the school.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did you have access to, you know, newspapers and books, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Books, not newspapers. We had old books that would come from the school, the white school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they were readable and we used them, and learned how to read and add and subtract. I found out a few things about the world. I--I'll never forget, we had a little set of books with Louisa May Alcott, and there were several of those great writers. And I would just read them over and over again. Do you remember her, Louisa May Alcott and--
Speaker 1: Yeah. We had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and Hathaway [ph.], Hathaway and all of them, yeah, yeah. So, we had a few of those.
Speaker 1: Okay. These are your classic youth literature--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing. So--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, 'Little Women' [Louisa May Alcott] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. You remember that (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 652268
Speaker 1: In terms of music, you're in the choir. I mean, what, what would--were you exposed to, I guess, gospel music, I guess, at a, at an early age, I guess?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm trying to figure out if--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Well, what, what kind of music did they perform in church [Coles Chapel C.M.E. Church, Henry, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Just regular church hymns, black, no structure; you just learned them. No, no gospel.
Speaker 1: Okay. Because gospel is relatively, well, it's newer than the Negro spirituals, you know.
Speaker 2: Nineteen- 1930s--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so--
Speaker 2: --that's when gospel came.
Speaker 1: Right. So, did you see, did your church, did they sing, like, the old spirituals in church?
Speaker 2: No. No spirituals, just hymns.
Speaker 1: Just hymns, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, like 'Jesus, Keep Me Near the Cross,' 'Down at the Cross,' all them little--they had a, a little book they called the 'Gospel Pearl' [sic. 'Gospel Pearls']. But they weren't gospel songs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they were called the 'Pearl,' I'll never forget it, a little red book. And all those songs were in there.
Speaker 1: These are the basic congregational hymns?
Speaker 2: Yeah, basically, even though there was a choir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember that much.
Speaker 1: So, how many people were in the choir?
Speaker 2: Maybe six or seven.
Speaker 1: Did you have a piano?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. We didn't have a piano player for a long time, if I can remember. I don't remember having one. We basically sang a capella, if I remember right. We had a piano in there, though. Then I think at some point maybe before we left Henry [Tennessee], I'm not sure, somebody came in that could play it.
Speaker 1: Was it permissible to clap your hands?
Speaker 2: In the Methodist church?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I suppose you, you could (laughter). That wasn't the custom, you know. It was, it was just a country church, you know. There were some older women who would maybe say, "Amen," or something like that, you know. But it was just a country church. Sunday-go-to-meetings were the highlight. You know, some of the special days I can recall where you'd go out front, and you'd see there was a line of wagons and horses out there, a few cars, one or two T Models, Ford [Ford Model T] (laughter). I'm bringing all these things back. Visualization is an interesting process for the human brain, isn't it, we call it?
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, now, did you--can you recall when you were first exposed to gospel music?
Speaker 2: Relatively. I remember one day hearing a guy by the name of Alex Bradford. And he was in a play called 'Black Nativity' [Langston Hughes]. And he had, there was a song that they played called "Too Close to Heaven." And I don't think that came out of Paris [Tennessee]. I think that came out of Nashville [Tennessee]. There was a station, I don't really know where that came from. But--
Speaker 1: This was on the radio?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was on the radio. We didn't have TV then (laughter). You haven't asked my age yet. So--
Speaker 1: I thought about, I thought about--no, we did in the beginning. We asked you when you were born, so--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: But I know you could have seen it live. You know, I mean, I don't know. You know, I'm just, I don't--that's why I asked it.
Speaker 2: No, no, it was radio. Um-hm. So, that was my first exposure. Then when I went to high school [Central High School, Paris, Tennessee], I, I was exposed to it from some kids there who could play, play the piano and play gospel. And it was, it was something else. It thrilled me to no end. I just went, "Oh, play more of that, play more of that," you know.
Story_ID: 652269
Speaker 1: Was Caton [Caton School, Henry County, Tennessee] the kind of school where they would spend a lot of time--they give the students a lot of time off for agricultural work (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. Yeah, we had to take off every summer. Harvest time, they called it. I don't remember exactly what months they were, but I know it was summertime. And then there was a period I believe we had to have for planting, and then another period for harvesting, picking the cotton and doing that.
Speaker 1: Did you get a full nine months of school you think?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, because we had to, you know, take off and work the fields.
Speaker 1: I know that's what others have said too, that the amount of time that black students would get--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was limited, because of duties in terms of planting cotton and chopping cotton and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --picking cotton.
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm. And we all worked, everybody was at the same, about the same economic level. You know, everybody was whatever, poor. We didn't call it that, you know. We'd borrow from each other, sugar and flour, and whatever we might need. So, I remember all that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, now when you were, was there anything special from graduating from eighth grade at Caton?
Speaker 2: There was no graduation.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: School was just over at the end of the season (laughter).
Story_ID: 652270
Speaker 1: Now when I went to high school, we didn't, we then had regular nine months of school. We didn't take off for agricultural activities, I don't think. You know, I'm going to have to ask somebody. I don't think we did. I know I was eleven, and I finished when I was fifteen, and we moved from Henry [Tennessee] to Paris [Tennessee]. My mother [Augusta Tharpe Jones] and father [Jim Jones] separated, and I think school was kind of like a full nine months or something maybe then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Paris?
Speaker 1: In Paris, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 1: Central, Central High School.
Speaker 2: Central High School. All right, so this, I mean, was--I mean how did you feel about your parents separating?
Speaker 1: I did it, I created it (laughter). So, I felt good about it. I was eleven, and I told my mother, "I'm taking you away." And we had a--
Speaker 2: Well, what happened? What, was it just an accumulated--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was just continuing to be abusive, especially verbally, and embarrassing and stuff, and the way he treated her. And I just didn't want to take any more of that. I was always kind of always a little ahead of myself socially, growing up. So, I foresaw the possibility that he could become harmful, you know, if he continued that. So, we planned it, and says, "When he goes away again, let's go." And finally, my cousin and my sister [Lula Jones Puckett] and my mother and I, we moved away together to stay a few weeks with my cousin, our cousin that lived in Paris. And during our stay there, my mother found a job working in a Jewish lady's kitchen, taking care of her house. And we found a three room house, three room place to live, the three of us. And that's, that's how that happened.
Speaker 2: Okay. And you facilitated this yourself?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she was very co- she was tired of it, too. So, she was cooperative.
Story_ID: 652271
Speaker 1: You had a new life in Paris, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You're going to Central High School [Paris, Tennessee]. Now, how did you like Central High School? Did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was a good experience, to be in high school.
Speaker 1: And you're eleven in high school?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Socially immature (laughter).
Speaker 1: But mature enough to get your mother out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And country, at that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, okay. So, now, what subject matter did you gravitate towards at Central High School?
Speaker 2: Well, I was weakest in mathematics, and probably, and basically, all areas of mathematics. But I was very prolific with history, and any material that had to be interpreted that way. But, chemistry, I think we had. But, you know, the high schools were not really well equipped to teach us anything that was laborious and--like chemistry--
Speaker 1: The sciences?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the sciences. No, we weren't that much--English, history--through the courses like that--were what they basically emphasized the most, yeah. I can remember back to then. But I know I wasn't good at arithmetic. I was not good at all at that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, did you have to work in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I worked to help to support our family.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, this is, what 1951?
Speaker 2: To '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, '55 [1955], all right. So, this is, so what did you do?
Speaker 2: I found little odd and end jobs. The longest job I had was a waiter at a resort called Paris Landing State Park [Buchanan, Tennessee]. I worked as a waiter. A couple of the restaurants, I was a cook. This is when I was a kid, now. I think they hired me to cut potatoes or something like that, but I ended up being a cook. That's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I think my mother [Augusta Tharpe Jones] made ten dollars a week.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a low wage for even 1951.
Speaker 2: And I'm trying to think, how did we survive? But my sister [Lula Jones Puckett]--
Speaker 1: Did you grow any of your own food?
Speaker 2: Not in Paris, no. So--
Speaker 1: So, you were saying your sister--
Speaker 2: My sister graduated like two years before me, I think it was. And so, she had a job, you know. But I was just--as you were asking those questions, I was trying to think, how did we live? You know, where did I get my little pocket change from, or whatever? (Laughter) I guess it was from little jobs I picked up, you know, along the way, cutting grass maybe here or there. Maybe the ladies--the lady that my mother worked for would, I'd have to go over there sometimes and wash windows or do something, something like that.
Speaker 1: During the same period of time--I'm kind of backtracking from what I know my father made in the General Motors plant [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company], you know in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Oh, you worked, your father worked at General Motors?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Dayton [Ohio]. He worked for General Motors and he swept out the plant, you know, that was what he did. And you know, you could make--during that same period of time, he was making at least sixty-five dollars a week, seventy dollars a week. And by the '60s [1960s], he was making a hundred dollars a week.
Speaker 2: Oh, that would have been rich for us (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just thinking, this is in, you know, this is the kind of world--I mean money had different values in those days of course. But that's, ten dollars is even, that's poor by the standard of those days.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's not a lot of money at all.
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I heard in those days you could live in a place for ten dollars a week, you know, because the rent was five, maybe less, depending on where you're at. But that's the--so, so it was tough to make ends meet, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay. But your sister's working and you're contributing to your mother?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. I don't think my sister worked while she was in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Story_ID: 652272
Speaker 1: But even going to high school for us, when we first started, it was difficult. We had to ride the school bus, which would take you about--oh, we'd leave at seven o'clock, we'd get to school around 8:30 or 9:00. So we had to ride through another little country town. It wasn't a town, it was like Henry [Tennessee] (laughter), you know. You'd go through that country and pick up all those--and everything was dirt roads. I remember that, and--
Speaker 2: Was the black community basically dirt roads or gravel or something?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right. So, they did have some, some parts of it would be highway. But basically, it was dirt roads. So, yeah it was, it was tough, especially in the summer. You know, we went to school when it, when the dust would come in the school bus. I think that was probably around September, October, when we'd go back, when school would start back up. Yeah, there were about, oh, maybe fifteen to twenty--from Henry, there was probably about nine or ten, (mumbles) thirteen, fourteen. And then we would pick up another, maybe ten in Como [Tennessee], because they had to do that to fill up the bus on that routing. And then they'd take us on to Paris [Tennessee], yeah. So, I think we got out of school around 3:00, 3:30 or something, and we'd get back home about five o'clock. Yeah, something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay. Now, this is for high school? I mean--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) not for, this is--
Speaker 1: High school.
Speaker 2: All right. Now, I thought you were living in Paris for high school?
Speaker 1: Well, part of it I lived in Paris, part of it I lived in Henry.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay. So, when you went to, back to Henry, did you stay with your [paternal] grandmother [Lydia Dinwiddie Jones], or--?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: You stayed with--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was with my mother [Augusta Tharpe Jones]. We were still living at home when I first started high school.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right. And it wasn't until after you started, that you moved her--
Speaker 1: To Paris, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, I got you. So, were there any special teachers at Central High School [Paris, Tennessee] that you remember, or mentors that you, or even people in the community?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. We liked our teachers, math teacher, Mrs. Lewis [ph.], the English teacher, Mrs. Morris [ph.]. And I loved basketball, Mr. O'Daniel [James O'Daniel]--
Speaker 2: He was the basketball coach?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter). And Mr. Teague [ph.] taught history. And yeah, we, we liked those.
Story_ID: 652273
Speaker 1: So as you were, you know, approaching your senior year, what were your aspirations?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Well, we didn't have any career--
Speaker 1: Counseling?
Speaker 2: --counseling, or anything like that in our high school [Central High School, Paris, Tennessee]. So, the options still weren't that great, you know. So, I really thought I wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to do something. I didn't know, because we didn't have that. You just graduated (laughter), you know. And I think out of my class, which was thirty-two, two of us, I believe went to college, went to--the other boy, his parents were stable, and he was the valedictorian of our class. So, they could send him to school. And, but I left and went to Nashville [Tennessee], came here, and stayed with my uncle. And I decided that I was going to go, one way or the other. So, my uncle gave me my first forty dollars to register for the first quarter at Tennessee State University [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee]. And when I decided what my major was going to be, it was when I was in the line to register (laughter). I had no idea what registration was all about, because no one had ever taught it to us, you know. And I just was following the rest of the students, you know, freshman. And so, one guy was standing behind me in general registration. "What's your major," he asked. And I said, "I don't know. I think I want to be a doctor." And I said, "What's your major?" He said, "Education, elementary education." I said, "Okay, that's what I'm going to do then" (laughter).
Speaker 1: It was that simple?
Speaker 2: That simple. And that's what my major became, elementary education, I became a teacher (laughter). Oh, man.
Speaker 1: So, this is nineteen fifty--
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-five [1955], okay. So, this is Tennessee State. So, what was Tennessee State like in 1955?
Speaker 2: Pretty much like it is in 2014 (laughter). You got more buildings now. The mentality of a black college [HBCU] is something to be contended with. The secretaries and people who admitted you in school and all, had attitudes and things. It wasn't a very comfortable environment, actually. Once you got in a class that made the difference. Those teachers were excellent, but the process that you go through to get to that was, was not as it should have been. That's the way I thought. But you know, but the classroom teachers were good.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, did they make, like, class distinctions? I mean, you know, was that the kind of tension that some of the--
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: The administrators, were they, you know, were they--did they consider themselves above the students, as the students came into the school?
Speaker 2: I don't think there was, necessarily identifiable as that. You pretty much knew things by color. Light skin was in, and appearance. Those are things you knew, that they'd always been there, through the whole process of schooling. So, the students from bigger towns like Memphis [Tennessee], they would take over the campus, and they were aggressive, you know. Surprisingly, Nashville wasn't (laughter). But that's basically the only kind of distinctions that you could make. I didn't necessarily see the teachers or the instructors being other than just teachers.
Story_ID: 652274
Speaker 1: So, here you are at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], 1955, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-five [1955]. And I was asking you about some of the, well, what the atmosphere was like there--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the instructors--
Speaker 1: --and you said about the same as it is now.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, and the instructors. And, you know, I was very young when I came, and it was challenging. I missed my few friends that I had in Paris [Tennessee], and I longed to go back home. And so, I did okay my first two semesters, and then I left the third--the quarter, I mean.
Speaker 1: Did--let's see, you were what, about sixteen?
Speaker 2: I was fifteen.
Speaker 1: Fifteen.
Speaker 2: And I turned sixteen that fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And I was very, I wasn't ready for it. So, I quit and went back to Paris, and found me something to do. I forgot what it was. Anyway, but whatever it was, I--then my friends were going to be coming to college the next year, in that fall. So, I just missed that one quarter. So, the next, after the summer quarter, then, you know, we would come back for the next fall quarter. Fall, winter and spring, those were the three quarters we had. So, I came back the next quarter, after I, after my sister [Lula Jones Puckett] had her child, and then I was with my friends. So, that made it easier for me. But, socially immature.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was determined after I came back the next time, that I was going to complete the process, and I did.
Speaker 1: How did it feel being back in Paris, after being away to Nashville [Tennessee]? I mean--
Speaker 2: It was, well, my friends were there. So, you know, I was able to have fun.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, you go back in '56 [1956]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And now, were there any special mentors or teachers at Tennessee State?
Speaker 2: Yeah, quite a few. You want their names or something?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Mrs. Wells was--I stayed in elementary education. Miss Peacock [Tee B. Peacock], Mrs. Wells, were two very special ones that I can remember, recall. I'm sure there were more than that, but, that's W-E-L-L-S and P-E-A-C-O-C-K. They became my advisors, and they were so special, that when Tennessee State honored me, they gave me the opportunity to bring one of the teachers back that was most influential. And Mrs. Wells--and they got her and brought her back.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So, now, did you participate in music at all at Tennessee State?
Speaker 2: No, elementary education.
Speaker 1: No music?
Speaker 2: No music.
Speaker 1: You didn't--
Speaker 2: We took a class--oh, no, when I was a student? No, no, just the music appreciation class (laughter). Yeah, music was not really a part of my study, in any way.
Speaker 1: Now this is surprising, because you--well, you must have really studied it at one point, because you know, when you--on your show ['Bobby Jones Gospel'], you often compare and contrast artists' styles (laughter). And you know, you're really like almost a musicologist.
Speaker 2: Those are things you learn (laughter); those are things you learn. So, I set out to learn something about it. You know, once I started with the gospel music genre, I had to find out what it was about. And I started by going, by going to a James Cleveland convention [Gospel Music Workshop of America, Inc.]. But that didn't happen in college, since we're talking about college.
Speaker 1: So, in college, what was your favorite music?
Speaker 2: Oh, any music, black music. I didn't particularly care for jazz and blues, but pop stars and the black musical presentations, those were the ones I really liked (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, I wondered about the blues, because I know rural Tennessee produced a lot of blues musicians.
Speaker 2: I didn't like the blues.
Speaker 1: Okay. Why not?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was too, at that time we called it colored. And I just didn't like the feel of it. And, the, you know, the messages were not for me. So--
Speaker 1: Yeah. I mean, there are some rough messages in some blues songs.
Speaker 2: I didn't, I didn't care for it. And jazz--
Speaker 1: But you associate it with the, with the drinking, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that too. Yeah, yeah. It's very country, the blues. But I liked the pop singers, you know, like Jackie Wilson and all those guys that were out during that period, yeah. But, no, no, no, no specific college training did I have.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would have been The Platters, Jackie Wilson, Sam Cooke, (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm. Yeah, Sam had just got started, seemingly to me, then got killed, you know. But, yeah, I knew all those, I mean, yeah. We used to dance a lot and, you know, I had fun.
Speaker 1: All right. So, what did you, you imagined you would be a teacher, a school teacher. Or would you, did, did you know (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, once I selected, once I selected the major, I went ahead and completed that. Elementary education--that was my major.
Story_ID: 652275
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduation, did you have a job lined up, or did you--?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah. My, my head teacher, Miss Peacock [Tee B. Peacock], had a job for me in St. Louis, Missouri upon graduation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I left with a pretty, pretty high average, you know. I had a lot of A's. And they would, those students who had accomplished that kind of, you know, grade percentages--the ones of us who would get jobs first. And so, when I finished Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], I had a job in St. Louis, Missouri teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, where did you teach?
Speaker 2: In St. Louis, Missouri at an elementary school called Farragut Elementary.
Speaker 1: Okay. There's a Farragut High School [Farragut Career Academy] in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Oh, it is?
Speaker 1: Yeah. That's where, what's her name, Kim Novak went to school. And also, Kevin Garnett.
Speaker 2: Oh, really, okay.
Speaker 1: But, so Farragut Elementary School, named for Admiral Farragut [David Farragut], I guess?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right. So, this is an all-black school, or--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Was, would it be possible for you as a black teacher to be assigned to an all-white school in--?
Speaker 2: In St. Louis (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) St. Louis.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in '59 [1959], you know. And St. Louis, you know, they don't consider themselves southerners, you know (laughter), like Kentuckians. You know, Kentuckians, they are, you know. But, I'm sure that you could, yeah. Because I eventually, after I think the first year or two, I went from Farragut over to Beaumont High School. And that's when they just took a part of the elementary school--because we didn't have room in the school where I was--and got the basement part of Beaumont High School. So, then I was teaching in a high school in St. Louis called Beaumont, and it was integrated.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right. But for the most part, were the schools segregated in St. Louis?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, pretty much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. You knew Vashon [Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri], you knew Soldan [Soldan High School; Soldan International Studies High School, St. Louis, Missouri]; you knew all those schools were black schools.
Speaker 1: Right, right. So, Sumner [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri]--
Speaker 2: You remember Sumner?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've interviewed so many people that went to Sumner.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: And Vashon.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Vashon, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Lived in The Ville [St. Louis, Missouri], and all that.
Speaker 2: Okay, and Beaumont, you know. Beaumont was an all-white school. And it eventually--slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, boom, black. And now they say it's horrible, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, now, all right, so you were in St. Louis teaching until 1965, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: I went there to teach when I was nineteen, when I started (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were nineteen years old, as an elementary school teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter). I turned twenty while I was, you know, that fall semester.
Speaker 1: I mean, considering that some people were seniors in high school at nineteen--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were teaching in elementary school at nineteen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very, very, young, and never had gone, never had been to a big city like St. Louis. I mean, St. Louis is big, you know. And we drove from Nashville [Tennessee] to St. Louis. And I bought me a little car. And I was in awe, to be honest with you. I couldn't believe it. Because it would take you maybe a half hour to get from one part of the (laughter), you know, from Midtown [St. Louis, Missouri], you know. It was, it was, it was a, it was an experience. But, and I hated it. I hated living there, I really wanted to get out of there. But I stayed six years and--
Speaker 1: So, was it, that it was such a big city?
Speaker 2: It was the environment. It was very negative--killings and conflicts and stuff that--you know, robberies and things like that, that I wasn't accustomed to.
Speaker 1: I know--
Speaker 2: And I became, you know, a subject in one of those situations several times, you know. And--
Speaker 1: So, yeah, now, the--historically they say that the St. Louis American newspaper was the number one paper for reporting crime, I mean in terms of--so, everything, if it bleeds, it was on the, in the St. Louis American. They were criticized by other black papers for being so lurid, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But the, but the crime was real?
Speaker 2: Yeah buddy, you better believe it.
Story_ID: 652276
Speaker 1: So, I worked my way back to Nashville [Tennessee] for a teaching job in '65 [1965], I believe it was. I found a job back here. And I was very, I was excited and delighted. But I came back to, what did I do? I came back to teach in an elementary situation.
Speaker 2: This is nineteen sixty--?
Speaker 1: Five [1965], '66 [1966], '65 [1965], '66 [1966], yeah.
Speaker 2: All right. So, this is back in Nashville?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh. But during the time I was in St. Louis [Missouri], I'd come back to Nashville in the summer, and that's when I completed my master's degree.
Speaker 2: Now, were you associated with a church in St. Louis?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, yeah. Yeah, I used to play the piano there. I taught myself how to play the piano when I was in college. My aunt had a piano, and that's how I got through college, playing for churches.
Speaker 2: Now, this is interesting. I asked you if you were involved in music, and you said--
Speaker 1: Well, but not really. This was, I was self taught. I mean, I couldn't read (laughter). You know, I played (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You're trying, you're just trying to make my job interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I played with three fingers, I mean, you know (laughter). And then finally learned how to go, C, G, and F, was the keys--B flat, you know.
Speaker 2: Now, but this remarkable. You taught yourself how to play.
Speaker 1: To play the piano.
Speaker 2: Did anybody get you started?
Speaker 1: My aunt, she didn't get me started. She played, I mean, you know, she could play by ear as well. And so, I'd sit and watch her, you know, and that's how I got by. It was, it was a miracle (laughter). I mean, it was truly a miracle.
Speaker 2: So, you not only learned how to play, but you were playing for money?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I think they paid me four dollars a Sunday (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: And that was, it was nice to get that four dollars, you know.
Speaker 2: And what was the name of the church in St. Louis?
Speaker 1: St. Louis was Bayton, B-A-T--Bayton, how would you spell that? No, it's Basden, B-A-S-D-E-N, Basden [sic.].
Speaker 2: Okay. Was it a C.M.E. church [Christian Methodist Episcopal] as well?
Speaker 1: It was Baptist.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Very small.
Speaker 2: So, you're playing the piano now?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah. But you know, I was, I had a job in St. Louis. It's in Nashville where I needed the money, and when I was playing for churches here, First Street Baptist Church [First Street Missionary Baptist Church] in Nashville.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was my first piano church job. And I did that for, all the way through, all the way through the first four years of college. And that's, that's where I met all these old women that took care of me, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now, now, you got a master's in education from Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee]. Did you go back when you returned to Nashville?
Speaker 1: Yeah, during the summer months when I'd come back from St. Louis. That's when I worked in the master's program.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And completed it.
Speaker 2: All right. So, what year did you complete your master's?
Speaker 1: I forgot (laughter).
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I think it was, let's see, when did I come back, in '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, somewhere along there.
Speaker 2: Okay. We're going to say '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right. And okay, so, you're teaching in a school here in Nashville?
Speaker 1: Yes. Did I start teaching here?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, I started teaching here.
Speaker 2: What was the name of your school here?
Speaker 1: The first one was called, was called Una [Una Elementary School, Nashville, Tennessee], U-N-A, which is right down the road here.
Speaker 2: It's an elementary school?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, elementary school. They were integrating, and I was the first black to go to that integrated situation. U-N-A, Una, and Longview [ph.]. And then I went to Fall-Hamilton [Fall-Hamilton Elementary School; Fall-Hamilton Enhanced Option School, Nashville, Tennessee].
Story_ID: 652277
Speaker 1: And then I went to Head, and that's where I was discovered by a consultant, reading consultant.
Speaker 2: This is at Head Elementary [Head Elementary School; Head Middle Magnet School, Nashville, Tennessee] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Head, Head Elementary.
Speaker 2: Okay. All right.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And an education consultant discovers you. Now, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I was, I was, I was, I was--for that school, I was the curriculum, director of curriculum, for that school. And he saw my processes of implementing various programs for the school system, and they hired me for McGraw-Hill [McGraw-Hill Education].
Speaker 2: Okay. Now, what was your title at McGraw-Hill?
Speaker 1: I was consultant, textbook consultant.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now, what year is this, this is?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, I don't remember what year it was.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, this is in the '70s [1970s], you'd say, or--
Speaker 1: It must have been.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, this is, when you describe (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'd say early, yeah, it was--yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, it says here, I have a note here. It says in '74 [1974], you started with McGraw-Hill, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was?
Speaker 2: Does that sound right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure it was.
Speaker 2: It was 1974.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, now, okay. Now, this is before you worked on your Ed.D.--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --at Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee], and before you--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --went to Paynes [Payne Theological Seminary, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Yeah. I did the textbook consulting--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and then when I came back to Nashville [Tennessee], yeah.
Speaker 2: So, did you travel a lot for McGraw-Hill?
Speaker 1: Oh, all over. In fact, that's all I did, wherever we had programs. I was working with a program in Phoenix [Arizona]. And that was, that was--you know, that's where I did my consulting, with teachers in those schools. And that's when I came to Dayton [Ohio] and worked with five of their schools there, elementary schools. And I used to go to the bowling alley, it started with an H.
Speaker 2: Hoover.
Speaker 1: Hoover (laughter).
Speaker 2: Hoover Lanes.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: They had a skating ring next door and everything, yeah.
Speaker 1: Exactly (laughter). So, they had a lot.
Speaker 2: Now, that's something. I may have seen you somewhere, and didn't even know it.
Speaker 1: And I stayed at the hotel downtown.
Speaker 2: It must have been the Biltmore [Dayton Biltmore Hotel, Dayton, Ohio] or the Dayton Inn [Dayton, Ohio], one of the two, probably.
Speaker 1: It was close to the expressway.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, was it across from city hall?
Speaker 1: I don't remember.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, they were all kind of close to the expressway. But anyway--
Speaker 1: Ramada.
Speaker 2: Ramada Inn [sic. Ramada Plaza Dayton, Dayton, Ohio], okay.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, Ramada.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, all right. You were a consulting and staying--you'd go to a town and stay for a week, or something?
Speaker 1: Yeah, depending on how much their needs were, all over the country. I think the most intriguing areas that I was in was the West, in South Dakota; it was very interesting. Spearfish, South Dakota, I used to teach there at the university [Black Hills State University]. And I was in Rapid City [South Dakota], okay.
Speaker 2: Now, that sounds like the Badlands [Badlands National Park], right, of South Dakota, you know?
Speaker 1: So to speak, yeah. It was interesting though--Indians [Native American], uh-huh. So, that's my sojourn after I came back to Nashville and finished my doctorate from Vanderbilt.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I had taught at Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  However, during this whole process time, for seventeen years, you know, all of that time. I started in seventy- when did you say I got my master's?
Speaker 2: The master's in, yeah, is--
Speaker 1: No, no, my Ed.D., when did I get that?
Speaker 2: Ed.D.? I don't know. We have a question mark behind that.
Speaker 1: I think it was '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm thinking. But I started at Tennessee State in 1972, teaching there, I believe, '72 [1972] or '74 [1974]. Seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably so, because you're working at McGraw-Hill at that time when you were doing that.
Speaker 1: When I got the job at Tennessee State?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um.
Speaker 2: No, you couldn't, because you were traveling a lot. So--
Speaker 1: Yeah. No, I had left McGraw-Hill. I think I worked for them for four years, and came back to Nashville to teach again. And then they hired me out of one of the elementary schools, if I can remember right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then that's when I was hired by Dr. Martin [Ruby Martin] at Tennessee State, to teach in the reading program there.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay. Now, now, when did you work on the theological degree?
Speaker 1: That was done by Dr. Jamie Williams [ph.]. That was, what do you call it when you get a degree for your work, but not directly in the school? Honorary.
Speaker 2: Oh, honorary, oh--
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that's an honorary degree.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 652278
Speaker 1: Now, during all this time you're playing the piano in church still, right?
Speaker 2: No, I had quit then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, after I started working with McGraw-Hill [McGraw-Hill Education] and all of that, I left that behind.
Speaker 1: Now, oh, wait a minute. Now, you got with, you started doing your show on BET [Black Entertainment Television] in 1980.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980], uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Right. Now, we're, we're skipping something.
Speaker 2: No, I was still teaching at Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, I didn't leave Tennessee State until '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right so you, all right. So, all the time that you're playing the piano in church and stuff like that, your reputation must be growing and growing. Or, you're doing something. Now, what leads to this show? What's leading to the show?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, oh yeah, yeah, man. After I came back from Nashville [Tennessee] from working with McGraw-Hill, I learned the system, of learning how to do things in the organizational system, when I was with McGraw-Hill. So, I brought that same system back with me to Nashville, and we started Black Expo [Nashville Black Expo and Music Fest] here in Nashville. I don't know whether you knew that or not?
Speaker 1: Right, that's in our, that is in our outline.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they have it like they didn't know what order it came in.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You started a Black Expo.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now this--at Black Expo--well, tell the viewers, whoever's going to watch this in the future--like, where Black Expo comes from--the concept and the idea.
Speaker 2: Well, there were some, there was three black guys here in Nashville that were students at Vanderbilt University. And they wanted to start an activity here so that more people in this community and surrounding areas would know about the contributions that blacks had made in this community. And they asked me to join them. So, we, and I became president of that committee to begin the Black Expo here in Nashville. And it meant to expose contributions that were made to this community and beyond. Who were they, where'd they go, how did they get there, and all of that? And so we were able to garner an historical perspective of who these people were and are, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at that time. And that was in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: And isn't it true that the concept of black expo came out of Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I think it did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Way back, with, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, some of that did.
Speaker 1: And then they kind of, other cities picked up on--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh--
Speaker 1: --the idea.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then we had one of the first major black expos. And then Indianapolis [Indiana] came down and studied our process and they took it back, and they still have it.
Speaker 1: Right, they certainly do. They have a big one every year.
Speaker 2: Every year, yeah. But we started it here, and it was a struggle.
Speaker 1: It doesn't exist here anymore?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, the expo was, was--explain what the concept, I mean, what the--
Speaker 2: What we did?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what you actually did.
Speaker 2: Well, we had three days, I think, of activities which highlighted, as I mentioned before, seminars and workshops on different topics relating to blacks in this area, and concerts in the evening. And on Sunday, we would bring in the churches. And we brought in Reverend Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], people like that, you know, of prominence, to the community, and had a Miss Black Expo pageant, and other things that were basically around the black culture of Nashville, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, that was the concept of how we got that started; and that gave me some visibility in the community, quite a bit, actually.
Story_ID: 652279
Speaker 1: Because we had one affair in my home where we had, we had a couple of celebrities here, and we were robbed in my home during one of my parties (laughter). (Unclear) was there.
Speaker 2: Now, this is, now--oh, I didn't, I didn't ask you about the St. Louis [Missouri]--about the robbery. Now, you were robbed in St. Louis, you said?
Speaker 1: I was, yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Was this like a street robbery, or what?
Speaker 1: Yeah. I was driving down the street, and stopped at the red light. And this guy jumped in my car and put a knife to my neck, and told me to drive. And I drove (laughter). And he says, "I want your money." And I said, "I don't have any." And I really didn't. And I'm thinking, while he's telling me to drive, "Go down this street," you know, and, "go back down towards--," it was going downtown. And we stopped at another light, and I saw a cop's car parked across the street. And I said, he's got a knife, and I don't know what he'll do to me when we get where we're going. I opened my car door, and out I jumped. And across the street I went running, "Police, police, police." (Laughter) And this guy jumped out of the car, you know, on the other side, and he fled. And the police saw him, and they ran after him. So, the police never did get a--because once he was gone, my car was still sitting in the middle of the street, and cars were passing. So, I ran and jumped in my car, and back to my apartment (laughter) I went. I'm laughing now, but it wasn't funny then, because I was going to get hurt, I'm pretty sure, because they were vicious.
Speaker 2: So, somebody actually came into your house during a party and robbed--?
Speaker 1: No, this was in Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Nashville, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Three, four, I think it was four guys that robbed us. All of the Black Expo committee [Nashville Black Expo and Music Fest] was there, with our guests, you know. And it was a very, very high social event, it wasn't ragged at all. And the kind of people that were there were leaders in the community. And it was by mistake they came. They were, I think they were looking for an after hour joint. But they saw all these cars. And one girl was going out, and they was asking, "Well, what, who's, who lives there? What's going on there?" "Oh, we're having a party," blah, blah, blah. "Having a party?" (Laughter) And they came and they--with their guns and things, and that's--
Speaker 2: So, they seized an opportunity to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know--
Speaker 1: To get some--
Speaker 2: --when they saw a lot of wealthy people--
Speaker 1: They thought, yeah.
Story_ID: 652280
Speaker 1: At this point, now was the gospel--where you, did you have a special interest in the gospel feature of the Black Expo [Nashville Black Expo and Music Fest]?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did. Many of the people on our, on our committees did not want to feature that, because they thought it was too black. They didn't use that--
Speaker 1: For the Black Expo?
Speaker 2: Yeah. There was another word that was used to describe it. I'll just tell you what the word was niggerish. "This is not what we want, we want more of a cultural type of presentation." I said, "No, let me do the gospel thing." You know, at this time I had played at these churches, and that's when I'd gotten acclimated to the music. And so, I invited all these churches. And I had them to have little banners as to the--this church would have the name of their church, and they would be here and there. And we filled the auditorium. And it became a very successful, you know, event that Sunday. And then the implementation of the organization skills that I was able to get while I was working at McGraw-Hill [McGraw-Hill Education] helped me to move through that process very easily. So, some of the guys who were working with me on the committee, they had some, they began to develop other ideas. One was a Communist, and they began to want to challenge the city for its lack of opportunities for blacks here in the city [Nashville, Tennessee]. And they were going more political. And I didn't think this was what we were set up to do, you know. Yeah, show what's going on, and this would, I thought, bring attention to the ones who run this city, rather than being demonstrate- demonstrative and all of that. So, I stayed with them a little while longer and it became a pretty known event. And then I resigned, and I let some more people take it on as a full time job, to manage it. But it never really went anywhere after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They really needed my skills (laughter) to make it happen. And so, then after a while it dissolved itself.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Sort of like it was competing ideas, in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --direction.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I didn't want to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I just left it.
Speaker 1: So, were you all working under the umbrella of Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] or anything at that point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was self contained.
Speaker 1: Just local?
Speaker 2: Yeah, locally done.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.
Speaker 2: And so, when I was doing it those first years, that's when the guy from Indianapolis [Indiana] came down to study the model. And man, he took it back to Indianapolis, and they just blew, blew up. Now, they're still doing black expos across the country. And I go in to host the gospel segments. I have been for the last (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you do the one in Indianapolis?
Speaker 2: --for the last four years. No, not the Indianapolis one. This is run by another gentlemen from I think North Carolina, somewhere like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, did you continue with the gospel idea from the Black Expo? I mean did you, you know, restage it in another way?
Speaker 2: Well, I just, I just moved it over to something that I could handle, and started some other little organizations around that had highlighted gospel music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 652281
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But from Black Expo [Nashville Black Expo and Music Fest] is, is where I, we were able to get a local television show, I mean, a station, to address--they had the affirmative action programs going, and they didn't have any blacks on TV here--one preacher, I think, early morning. So, we went to them and asked them if we could have a gospel show, because we got so much attention. There was a show called 'Jump Street' [ph.] that was run by a young lady here. And one of the girls that worked with her at that station, and one of the guys who worked the camera there, they also liked gospel music. So, we came together with one other fellow and with the station managers, and asked them if we could start a gospel show. And after a few conversations here and there, and then there, finally they acquiesced, and then they gave us one. "We'll give you a try out." So, they gave us a pilot, and we did the pilot and--the three of us together. Her name was Teresa Hannah; the guy's name was Tommie Lewis. That's T-E-R-E-S-A, I believe how she spells it, H-A-N-N-A-H. And the guy's name was Tommie Lewis. I don't think it was Thomas, I think it was Tommie, L-E-W-I-S, and myself. We became producers of the show. And it was called 'Nashville Gospel' ['Nashville Gospel Show']. And after the first pilot hit, it became--oh, the ratings went sky high. Then they told us, "Okay, come back in and do some more half hour shows."
Speaker 2: Now, this is WSM-TV [Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 1: WSM-TV before it was WSMV [WSMV-TV, Nashville, Tennessee], it was later changed, and it is now WSMV. So, I was working with some guys, some white guys, that were interested in what I was doing with that production. Because I also had another show on WDCN [WDCN-TV; WNPT-TV, Nashville, Tennessee], which was a public service television show here in Nashville. It was called 'Bobby Jones World.' And it was a potpourri of all kinds of activities, and people coming into town and whatever. You know, wine tasters, dancers, just everything--
Speaker 2: So, it wasn't just gospel?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it was not gospel at all, it was a community show. So, that's where I met these guys, there. And they liked the gospel shows. They said, "Well, they're having a--," where you bring all hour shows together in New Orleans [Louisiana]. And Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson] was there looking for programming, so they took a copy of my show.
Speaker 2: Was this the one they called the National Black Programming Consortium [Black Public Media]?
Speaker 1: It wasn't national, it wasn't black. It's where they brought all of the--I just can't think of the name of it--it's very popular. I do know what it is, I just can't think of it right now. So, anyway, that's where he saw the show, that half hour show that I was doing, and called and let those guys know that he was interested. And I told him yes.
Story_ID: 652282
Speaker 1: This is interesting, because I get the feeling--I mean, now, you appreciate gospel music, you played in churches. But you really didn't see yourself as a leader of gospel music in Nashville [Tennessee], did you?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, and I wasn't. (Laughter) Not only did I not see myself, I really wasn't, you know. I made a lot of noise here because, you know, it was, like, everything I did, God put his hands on it. And even playing without knowing how to really play, I developed a great choir at this little church that I was playing for. And it became very popular, you know. And it was called First Street Baptist Church [First Street Missionary Baptist Church, Nashville, Tennessee]. Then, out of that, some guys came and asked if I would sing in one of their groups. It was called The Royal Gospel Singers. And I, "Well, I can't sing." But, you know, "Yes, you can." I said, "No, I can't do that." But I acquiesced and I went on and I started singing with them. And they were good, they were great singers, you know. Some of them are preachers now. They still have the group. And, but they weren't as serious as I wanted it to be, if I was going to devote my time to it, you know. And so, after a while, I just left them and, you know, I didn't want to do that any longer with them. So, I continued, you know, going to the conventions, the gospel convention called, James Cleveland's convention [Gospel Music Workshop of America, Inc.]. It had been going on for a while, and I was mesmerized by the choirs that were--oh, man, they just blew my mind. And I thought he was the greatest ever. His name was James Cleveland, from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, James Cleveland.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: He had a famous album, 'The Football Game of Life' [sic.] or something or the other.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.
Speaker 2: He was very popular, very, very popular. So, I enjoyed going to his conventions. I had a friend named Al Hobbs who was a gospel singer as well. And so, the two groups, the two male groups, we knew each other well--the group that I was with here in Nashville. And that's how I met him, he's from Indianapolis [Indiana].
Speaker 1: What was the group that you were with? What was the name of the group?
Speaker 2: That I was with?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was called The Royal Gospel Singers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: R-O-Y-A-L. And the group that Al Hobbs--we became brother groups, you know. They were from Indianapolis, and so I became good friends with him. And when I would go to the workshop that's who would, like, usher me around and, you know. And I wasn't really into gospel at the time, not into it kind of. I was studying it, but not expecting anything as a result of it. But this television show, that's what brought it all about.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you, we ended the last segment with you talking about going to--now I guess this is, what is it, 1979 or something, when you go to the television confab and meet Robert Johnson [Robert L. Johnson]?
Speaker 2: No, Robert Johnson saw the show.
Speaker 1: He saw the show, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, while they were at this television convention that they have every year (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, so you weren't there, he just saw--
Speaker 2: No, he just saw--
Speaker 1: He just saw-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a recording of the show?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I had some means to organize an activity here in Nashville called the Love Train. I don't know whether that's in my bio or not. But that's when I began to start doing this show at Channel--1976 was when I started doing the show at Channel 4 [WSM-TV; WSMV-TV, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Yeah, the 'Nashville Gospel Show.'
Speaker 2: 'Nashville Gospel,' uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay. Then you had, you also had 'Bobby Jones World' on WDCN [WDCN-TV; WNPT-TV, Nashville, Tennessee]. And that's public television, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right. And that, that was the show that had, it wasn't just gospel, it was a lot of--
Speaker 2: It was not gospel at all. It was just some community activities and events and personalities, whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was a show like 'Say Brother' or, 'Like It Is' in New York [New York], or one of those--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --type shows.
Speaker 2: Yeah, PBS show [Public Broadcasting Service]. Okay, so that's where we were with that. And then starting at Channel 4--am I good?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, the Channel 4 led into everything, you know. And then Bob Johnson said--I broke away from the 'Nashville Gospel Show.' The PBS shows had, I won several awards for that. And I went to Italy to make a presentation. We wrote a black gospel opera called 'Make a Joyful Noise.' And we won the film festival award and the Gabriel Award for that.
Speaker 1: Now, this is during this period of time, 'Make a Joyful Noise,' I remember that film, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that black gospel opera. Yeah, it was--
Speaker 1: You were the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was one of the key people in it (laughter). Now, look, I'm teaching at the same time. I'm at the university [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], right? I started there in 1974, so I'm still teaching. I didn't leave until '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: I never knew you were--okay.
Speaker 2: You never knew I was what?
Speaker 1: Okay, involved in 'Make a Joyful Noise.' I've seen that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, the people who wrote the script for me for 'Make a Joyful Noise' were the ones that took my tape from Channel 4 to New Orleans [Louisiana] where Bob Johnson was scouting for black programming. You see that tie up, that's how that happened. So, had I not been at Channel 8 doing the PBS shows, they would have not known--I would not have known them, and they would not have known me, probably. Because they were, one of the guys that worked there at Channel 4 was one of my producers. And he's the one that put all of this stuff together. And, you know, he had me doing a potpourri of things while I was at Channel 8. He just believed in me, this, this little Jewish guy. And his name's Steve [ph.] (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was his last name?
Speaker 2: I can't remember--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) it's St- Steve.
Story_ID: 652283
Speaker 1: Here we are, I think 'Make a Joyful Noise' reminded me of other movies and shorts that were made by white people who discover a genre, like they discovered the blues, and then there would come blues films. And they made a film, 'Louie Bluie,' by a blues musician [HistoryMaker Howard Armstrong] in Chicago [Illinois], and some other films, you know. But music is largely segregated in the country.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And white people are just not going to know the gospel, I mean, and the black singers of many genres, except for the ones that reach the Top 40.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, gospel is being discovered here on some level, and these guys are the ones who introduced it to Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson].
Speaker 2: Yes, that's exactly how it happened. They took that show. Wyatt is his last name, W-Y-A-T-T. And they're in New York [New York] now, he and his wife. And she was good in producing this show, 'Make a Joyful Noise.' And so, they're the ones that met Bob Johnson, and that's how I got the Gabriel Award and all of that, with 'Make a Joyful Noise,' from the PPS show [Public Broadcasting Service]. Okay, and Joe [ph.], the guy who was really over that at this WDCN station [WDCN-TN; WNPT-TV, Nashville, Tennessee], hired me from Channel 4 [WSM-TV; WSMV-TV, Nashville, Tennessee] to also host the show over there at the PBS station. So, I had two things going. I had the show at PBS ['Bobby Jones World'], teaching at Tennessee State University [Nashville, Tennessee], and I had the Bobby Jones--'Nashville Gospel' at the time. And so, they wanted to go--I was, I just took over the producer's role at the 'Nashville Gospel Show.' And they thought I was too overbearing. They didn't, they didn't--you know, the input--their input was not the same level as mine was, because I had more experience than they did. And they didn't know how to produce, and I did, you know. So, while I was in Italy with this 'Make a Joyful Noise' thing, they met with the station managers. And they wanted to have a meeting with me when I came back, to discuss the fact that they should have the same role. And I said no, and my attorney said no. And so, then we end up splitting. So, they kept the name, 'Nashville Gospel.' By this time, then I called mine 'Bobby Jones Gospel' (laughter). And how they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They took your role--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they really kind of pushed me out, you know. And so, my energy in the city was strong enough where they couldn't get rid of me, you know. All the community leaders came to my defense, and went to Channel 4 and told them, "Oh, you need to keep him, you know. This is our," whatever and whatever. So, we, you know, we had a little fight about that. And so, so, I said, "Okay, I'm going to do my own show." And then I--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --and so, I thought about Johnny Carson and all these white guys that had TV shows with their names. I said, "Oh, I'm going to call it 'Bobby Jones.'" (Laughter) That's simply how it came about. And I asked my godmother, a little church lady, you know, who took care of me--and I said, "What do you think if I called it 'Bobby Jones,' like Johnny Carson and them do?" And she was like, "Okay." And that's where it came from. And so, I began to produce my own shows at Channel 4, and you could see clearly the distinction between the two. They kept their show; the same network had two shows, mine and theirs (laughter). And the regular community churches supported them, because they had a big newspaper article about I didn't want white people on, and I didn't want local people on--just stuff they made up, you know, to put on the show. And so, the community went with them, basically, but they knew the difference. So, then I began to really, really do it, you know, really do a good show. I brought in, you know, good talent and organized it, and was able to conduct it as a national show. And then that's what Bob Johnson saw, he saw one of those shows, after the breakup of me and the 'Nashville' people.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. All right, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. And then, then it started in 1980.
Story_ID: 652284
Speaker 1: Now in '80 [1980], well, before that, I guess in, in '79 [1979], you released an album, is this, is this true?
Speaker 2: What is it called?
Speaker 1: 'There is Hope for This World.'
Speaker 2: I did?
Speaker 1: Did you? It says--
Speaker 2: I have an album called, 'There is Hope for This World' (laughter).
Speaker 1: It just came out in '79 [1979].
Speaker 2: In '79 [1979], okay.
Speaker 1: Now, this is about the time, this is before Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson] called, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh. I was also doing--see, this TV show ['Bobby Jones Gospel'] here had given me a little substance. So, this record label was a big one, called Nashboro, Nashboro Records [sic. Creed Records]. They wanted to take a chance on doing something for me, and so they did. And in fact I did two, two albums with them, not CDs [compact disc], two albums.
Speaker 1: Now, you say you don't consider yourself really a performer so much. But--
Speaker 2: As a host, and not a real gospel singer, because I'm not, you know. But I can sing well enough to make it work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, you've seen the show (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, you're a passable singer. You're, you know--
Speaker 2: Passable, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, you sing. I mean it's not like a stretch, but I think that, you know, your fame is probably more as an impresario, a person bringing together all the talent--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I think so.
Speaker 1: --on the stage, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know that's what it is, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But I won a Grammy [Grammy Award] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know how it happened, I won a Dove [GMA Dove Awards] that same year with Barbara Mandrell.
Story_ID: 652285
Speaker 1: What did you think of the BET [Black Entertainment Television] o- offer, I mean when you first heard it? I mean, did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was excited (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you familiar with cable television at that point? Because it, it wasn't everywhere.
Speaker 2: It wasn't any cable hardly. Texas and Florida were the two biggest states. The South had cable long before the North did. I ran, oh, man, a good five--four, five, six years before it came to Chicago [Illinois] and Detroit [Michigan]. Chicago first, then Detroit, then Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], then New York [New York]. Then, you know, that's when it hit, and then that's when I hit. When them black people started seeing this, "Hey, turn on your TV. There's a black guy on there with a gospel show." (Laughter) And the advertisers on BET was able to sell it, you know, and it became very popular for the network. They never would pay me, but I was able to make money other ways.
Speaker 1: So, that was, that was the deal with Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson], you were saying, that you would do this show just for the exposure of having the show on television?
Speaker 2: Well, he gave me a little money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I say little, a little, you know. I think his philosophy was, "Okay, I'm going to give you this time. So, you can do what you want to." I mean he had no say so in my show at all, I could do whatever I wanted. And I had to become creative in order to make it where I could do it. And I had, I had, I watched TV a lot, so I had in my mind what I wanted to see from shows that I saw on TV. And I didn't want no blue wall with some artificial plants as my set. You know, I wanted a real show. So, I had to work on that. And I finally was able to get started with an outdoor show. I had been producing--in the first years, I was in every television station in Nashville [Tennessee]. They allowed me to come in and tape my shows in them. And then in 1989, Barbara Mandrell's sister [Louise Mandrell] wanted to a show outdoors with me and six of the nation's top gospel singers. So, there's an amphitheater here in Nashville [Starwood Amphitheatre], and that was my--and I was able to get a little company here to tape it, because I still had control of that show. And I mean they were really top artists--Shirley Caesar, the Thompson Community Singers, Clark Sisters [The Clark Sisters], you know, Mighty Clouds of Joy, and my group [New Life], and I hosted it. And that was my first outdoors show, because I wanted that. I didn't want the studio anymore, you know. So, then after that--
Speaker 1: You're moving real fast here. But I just want to go back and emphasize--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --a point, just to dwell on this a minute. The production values in your show are top notch. They're great productions, I mean, your shows looked good.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: They all looked good.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: So, this is something that--and BET had nothing to do with that at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did [HistoryMaker] Jefferi Lee, who is a programmer from BET, have any influence on the show?
Speaker 2: Not then.
Speaker 1: Okay. You know, because I know--well, from what we hear about Bob Johnson, he really--as stated by a lot of people--he was interested in making money. He wasn't interested in programming so much, himself. But, I guess he recognized a product that he thought would sell.
Speaker 2: Yeah, at no cost to him.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, 'Bobby Jones Gospel'--the videos that Jefferi Lee talked about--how the videos, you know, were--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: --on network television, and yet there were very few black videos until they started airing some of the big stars on BET.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then black artists started making more videos, because they had an outlet.
Speaker 2: Outlet for them, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then they became, they kicked off as a big--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: And then I started the video gospel show.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, 'Video Soul' with Donnie--
Speaker 2: Donnie Simpson.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Donnie Simpson and then 'Bobby Jones Gospel.' That's the--
Speaker 2: Well, 'Bobby Jones Gospel' was a gospel show, and then 'Video Gospel' was my other show; I had both shows.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 652286
Speaker 1: And then the United States Armed Forces came in and started purchasing my shows for the United States Armed Forces.
Speaker 2: Okay, to show to the forces overseas?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm, you know, all over the world, actually. So, they brought me a little extra money in. And while I was working at Channel 8 [WDCN-TV; WNPT-TV, Nashville, Tennessee] doing the PBS shows ['Bobby Jones World'], New Orleans [Louisiana] became a hot spot for me, for those shows. And they purchased them there, thus Bob [Robert L. Johnson] let me do whatever I wanted to do. Sell them. Because you know, he wasn't paying me any money. So, he let me make money other ways.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, if you produced the show--it was produced on--it was, it could be seen on BET [Black Entertainment Television] of course. But then again, you could send that same show to New Orleans?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Or some other--
Speaker 1: And that's what I did.
Speaker 2: --independent television station, and they would show it.
Speaker 1: That's what I did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I sold them to New Orleans for their PBS shows [Public Broadcasting Service]. And then we had some in a couple of other nations in Africa, in Nigeria, in the northern part of that country. This man was a good--Garfield [ph.] was his name, in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. He was a good person that handles your material.
Speaker 2: A distributor?
Speaker 1: Yeah, distributor thing. So, that distribution with him worked, worked pretty good for me. But at the same time, I was just making enough to make it work--you know, never really got big, big--just enough to make it work.
Speaker 2: And so, were you doing like a lot of personal appearances around the country, too, as a host of gospel music?
Speaker 1: Well, I was with my group more. I had a group of women called the New Life. And (laughter) we stayed on it, we worked a lot, you know. We didn't make no money, you know. Gospel singers were not making money then. You know, a thousand dollars here, two thousand here, and you split it up among five people. What you got? But that was the times; that was, that was the growing time for it.

Speaker 1: Now, how did you become so astute at assembling talent for the show? I mean, not that it's that difficult, there's so much talent out here, but, but you have become like sort of an im- an impresario, as I was saying, of black gospel talent, not only the established talent, but new talent.
Speaker 2: There was no plan for that, actually. It was observation and possibility, and it worked. The most prolific one that, I had that I really didn't have anything to do with it, it happened, was Kirk Franklin. His manager came and asked if I would show him. I was doing a show in Atlanta [Georgia] then, these are still my shows. And I said, "No, we don't have no more space, you know." And she convinced me, "I think you ought to do it." And I said, "Oh, okay, then." And we did it. And his presentation that night was so phenomenal. It was different than anything that the people had--and the auditorium was packed with your people (laughter). And they responded and supported it, and she took it from there. She took that exposure, and from--and that was--and then it aired on BET [Black Entertainment Television], of course, you know. So it wasn't--it was the people in the hall that supported it the way they did. And then when it hit BET, that was it. Then she was able to get him a record deal in the secular crossover.
Speaker 1: Was it the song, 'Stomp,' was that it?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: That's not?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, 'The Reason Why We Sing' [sic. 'Why We Sing'].
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right. That's the one that--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. And I think one of the good things that I like about two people that could--didn't necessarily have to do it--was Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson] and Kirk Franklin. And they both indicated in their speeches, or whatever they delivered, that 'Bobby Jones Gospel' built this network. And Kirk Franklin is, "I got my start with 'Bobby Jones.'" You know, a lot of people don't do that; they think they do everything themselves.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'That's the Reason Why I Sing' was tremendously popular, played on all the urban stations. Those that played secular music mostly always played that song.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. But no, he had a brilliant person behind him, he didn't do that. Vicki Mack Lataillade had GospoCentric Records. And she's the one that really was able to negotiate and make that happen. But you can't get on secular radio just because you got a good song. You know how radio is. So, you know, you got to know how to work it, who to go to, what to do when you go there. So, that's how that happened.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It wasn't his ability, that they said, "Ooh, who is this? I want to put it on." Oh, no.
Speaker 1: After it was on, I think it was so popular that they'd have to play it at noon--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the afternoon, you know, in the morning.
Speaker 2: It was strictly planning that did that; it was a business deal.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And so, my selecting and choosing talent to come on 'Bobby Jones Gospel' was the same way. I'd see them and invite them, if I thought they would be appealing to our audience. And it became a mainstream for those artists to be exposed, and to get out there. And they're still doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Still doing it to this day, and it's amazing. I had a call from Aretha [Aretha Franklin] yesterday. I had Patti LaBelle, [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick, Louis Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan].
Speaker 1: He's been on the show?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I did not realize that.
Speaker 2: He's a consummate violinist.
Speaker 1: That's right. Yeah, he was a calypso singer at one time, too.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: The Charmer, they called him.
Speaker 2: Who would ever thought that he would become--
Speaker 1: He was on 'Bobby Jones Gospel'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and become the leader of the Nation of Islam.
Speaker 1: And what did he perform, on your--?
Speaker 2: 'Amazing Grace.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And another classical piece. And we became good friends, and still are to this day. I talked to him about two months ago; we talk all the time. I respect him highly, and he does me as well. But those are the things that Bob Johnson paid me with, opportunity. And if you're wise enough to take advantage of those opportunities--if God blesses you with enough--you know, I think people like my personality. I'm a very open person, you know, and they see the good in me, and there it is.

Speaker 1: Your show starts on BET [Black Entertainment Television] in 1980?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: We're now in 2014.
Speaker 2: Going into my thirty-fourth year, the longest running show in the history of cable television. How does that happen, from Henry, Tennessee--knowing nothing about this industry--had no intent of becoming a part of it? And here it is. Education was my forte, teaching, and I still get to do it (laughter). Isn't that interesting, a combination of all of what I wanted to do, I'm doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there a, do your shows have themes, in terms of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just music.
Speaker 1: Just music, okay, all right. Is there, is there any style of gospel that you like better than another style, or--?
Speaker 2: No. I have to get accustomed to what we call the rap situation. I have to get kind of like, you know, even from the secular markets, I'm not too much sold on that yet.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw a clip of the show. It was--just before we started, when I was watching clips, you know, for the show. And I noticed there was a show where some fellows are doing rap, you know, raps for their--doing some kind of gospel rap. And I wondered, you know, what you thought.
Speaker 2: So, then I began to develop a mindset that, well, whatever is done or said that's going to lift the name of Jesus Christ, it doesn't matter what form it takes, just so it's there. Because there's somebody out there that's listening to that as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's where I am with it, you know.
Speaker 1: I know the title of the show is 'Bobby Jones Gospel.' But do you ever reach back to the Negro spirituals?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, we include that. We include all forms: quartets, spirituals, hymns, classical.
Speaker 1: Are there any major performers who have not been on your show?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's a lot of them that haven't been on my show. You mean in gospel?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No. All the gospel artist has, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I finally got [HistoryMaker] Donnie McClurkin on (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the only one that was holding out (laughter). And I never did get The Winans on when they were working. They thought they were above us, yeah. They didn't want to do black gospel with me, and they didn't. And they were never on as a group of presenters. One of their brothers that passed away, Ron Winans [Ronald Winans], had a choir, and he acquiesced. And Cece [Priscilla Winans Love] and BeBe [HistoryMaker BeBe Winans], they came on several times, naturally.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, but those are the only ones that became popular after the '90s [1990s], you know, that scope of kids that are in there now that are making tremendous contributions. But all of them come through there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw Rance Allen on.
Speaker 2: He's from old school.
Speaker 1: Okay. The Mighty Clouds of Joy.
Speaker 2: Old school (laughter).
Speaker 1: The Five Blind Boys [Five Blind Boys of Mississippi], The Soul Stirrers. Now, the Five Blind Boys, I didn't see a link for them. I didn't--
Speaker 2: No, no, you didn't--they weren't there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, they weren't on the show.
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Because I looked for them, I looked for them--
Speaker 2: Did you?
Speaker 1: --to see if they had been on.
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: The Soul Stirrers were on.
Speaker 2: The Soul Stirrers, yeah. I, I was a little--I worked Europe with the Five Blind Boys. That's when I developed an appreciation for them. The Europeans are becoming a really major marketplace. Africa now is getting--you know, some of our artists are working quite a bit in Africa now. But Europe is the most lucrative place for us, and I'm there quite often. So, they'll be over when--as of this taping, I'm getting ready to go the New Orleans Jazz Festival [New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival], after I leave you. And the people from Italy will be coming in. And they have used me in Italy for about twelve years now, just the same people, you know. So, those markets have been very good for us. I even went to one of the Muslim countries, Morocco, to do a--Fez, Morocco, to do the world sacred music conference [Fes Festival of World Sacred Music]. And we performed there, which is (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Now I've never heard of the world sacred music conference (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sacred music con- um-hm. They have sacred music from all over the world, and gospel from America. I, you know, did that.
Story_ID: 652289
Speaker 1: Let's go back to 1984. You won a Grammy Award, right, in 1984?
Speaker 2: In 1984, I won a Grammy with a lady named Barbara Mandrell. It was a song that was written by a gentleman from the jazz idiom. It was called "I'm So Glad I'm Standing Here Today." And there was a lot of controversy about it. First of all, because I was with Barbara Mandrell. Secondly, because they thought that song was really not a gospel song.
Speaker 1: Now, now Barbara Mandrell, now she was a big TV celebrity in the '80s [1980s]. I mean--
Speaker 2: Huge.
Speaker 1: --she was a country singer, primarily.
Speaker 2: Huge, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she was huge, she had a TV show ['Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters'] and, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes, she and her sisters [Louise Mandrell and Irlene Mandrell], the Mandrells.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: I just wanted to establish that before--so people know--
Speaker 2: Who Barbara Mandrell is, yeah. Barbara was big. Her weekly shows were at the top ratings, you know, for a long time. And I was able to hook up with her here in Nashville [Tennessee]. She was recording at the same studio that I was in, with that CD [compact disc], 'Caught Up' that I did with Nashboro Records [sic. Creed Records]. And she saw me in the hallway and introduced herself, and flattered me quite a bit, because she loved Andrae Crouch. And I said, "Well, would you like to do our show for gospel music ['Bobby Jones Gospel']?" She said, "Oh, I'd love it, would you please?" And then you know, I wanted that--you know, white and top of the charts, you know. And so, she did, she--and we became good friends. And the next thing I knew we were touring with her, and then she took us to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] for eight years. We did a Thanksgiving show there every year at the, at Bally's [sic. MGM Grand]. It's now MGM [sic. Bally's Las Vegas Hotel and Casino] in that spot. But we would do that with her, and she gave us marquee value. And we just, and we're still very, very good friends. And when I recorded this project, "I'm So Glad I'm Standing Here Today," and asked her if she would do that with me, she said yes, and they submitted it. And a combination of our names--and I think his name was Joe Cocker that wrote that, the jazz guy. And--
Speaker 1: Oh, a jazz musician? Now, this is who wrote the song, you were saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But it's Joe, not Joe Cocker, but he's a, you know, a rocker.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, not that one, no. There was a Joe (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is there a piano player named Joe?
Speaker 2: --Joe--
Speaker 1: Joe Sample?
Speaker 2: Joe Sample, Joe Sample, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Joe Sample. Yeah, thank you (laughter).
Speaker 1: You're welcome.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's the one who wrote that song. And so, okay, "[HistoryMaker] Bobby Jones, you're going to Los Angeles [California] to the Grammy Awards. You're nominated for a Grammy with Barbara Mandrell. "I'm So Glad I'm Standing Here Today" as a soul duet," okay. On that particular ballot were The Winans and The Clark Sisters and, I believe, Shirley Caesar. I'm not quite sure who all of the four was, but I think it was, she was one of the other ones. And so, when they came in the afternoon to read the winner, and it said, "Bobby Jones and Barbara Mandrell," I was there with one of my singers. And it was a moment to remember, a very joyous occasion. So, I don't even know what I said when they gave it to me (laughter). Of course, they didn't give it to you to take with you. They gave it to you on stage, and they'd take it back, you know. But it was a joyous occasion. So, we went back to the hotel for the reception that evening, and the rumor started going around, "Well, they shouldn't have won that. That's not a gospel song. The Winans should have won that." The Winans were there. And the guy that was leading the thing, he said, "Well, we're going to rebel, because this isn't right." I didn't know this at that time. I knew--I don't know what the attitude The Winans really had. I only accepted what I experienced from walking in where they were, and speaking, and the nonchalant attitudes, like, no speaking, or whatever. I experienced that.
Speaker 1: So, it was a chilly kind of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that was in my book ['Make a Joyful Noise: My 25 Years in Gospel Music,' Bobby Jones with Lesley Sussman]. And they were offended by that, their mother [Delores Ransom Winans] was. But that was the way that it was. Offended or not, that's the way it was. And not being totally over into the gospel music world of people at that time, that surprised me, because I thought we were all in love with each other, regardless, you know (laughter). However--
Speaker 1: What was the sentiment of the song that people thought was not quite--?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, because the words were kind of good. You know, "Some said that I was hopeless, my mind mangled in the night." Aren't they lovely lyrics? "My mind tangled in the night, but strong hearts just keep on going. I'm so glad that I'm standing here today." I mean, you know, "There were times I remember I had to fight just to hold my head up. Those were times when my friends said bad things about me, but I'm standing here today. Come together, raise up your voices. This song I sing of love and joy today." I mean, it didn't say Jesus, but the implications were that it was inspirational.
Story_ID: 652290
Speaker 1: This raises a question that I would have for you, and I guess for anyone else who produces sacred music. Is that, can you have an important, you know, spiritual message without mentioning a, mentioning a deity?
Speaker 2: I would think you could. Because you sing about his works, uh-huh. But, you know, some traditionalists are going to say differently, rightfully so, if that's what they want to say. But then there are others who won't say that, that's why we won the Grammy [Grammy Award].
Speaker 1: Okay. Well--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And then a Dove [GMA Dove Awards], which was the highest award for what Christian music was doing in--you know, that was the music that was prominent in America--Christian, different than gospel--Christian was white.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Now, there's a jazz tradition amongst jazz musicians like Pharoah Sanders, Leon Thomas, and Gary Bartz and all of this, [HistoryMaker] McCoy Tyner, where they play music that has a spiritual message without a specific deity being mentioned. Pharoah Sanders: "The creator has a master plan, peace and happiness for every man" ['The Creator Has a Master Plan']. You know, that sort of thing. John Coltrane, in some of his works, the same thing. Do you, are you, do you listen to any of that kind of music yourself?
Speaker 2: If it's, if I'm in that environment, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But I don't make a, I don't make an effort to do it. But if I'm in that environment, I will. I try to be broadminded, you know, accepting, whatever. So, as a result of that, they tried to--I think, the demeanor--they tried to bring us down because of that. And the guy who led the movement, I thought was a friend of mine. Now, all these things are going on without my knowledge. And it was pretty much a big uproar around that gospel community. I didn't know that. And a few months after that, he was killed in a car wreck. Interesting. So, that's, I don't know whether Barbara [Barbara Mandrell] ever knew that our Grammy had been contested. I don't know whether she ever knew that or not it.
Speaker 1: Now, are there--I mean, there was something that happened recently at the Grammys [sic. Video Music Awards] where there was a--well, there was a case of a rapper from Chicago [Illinois] who contested the Grammy on stage a couple of years ago. What's his name? Kanye West contested a--
Speaker 2: He didn't contest Grammys, did he? I thought it was that girl [Taylor Swift].
Speaker 1: Yeah, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He said that she shouldn't have won.
Speaker 1: Right, that's the idea.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: The person who won should not have won.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's the same kind of--
Speaker 2: Same kind of thing, yeah.
Speaker 1: --same thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, which is out of order.
Speaker 1: When someone suggests that, you know, "Hey, you shouldn't have won. I should have won it," or--I think it was recently--
Speaker 2: I thought, I thought it was Hudson should have won instead of him, the Hudson girl from Chicago.
Speaker 1: Oh, perhaps, maybe it was. I thought it was he was saying that he should have won it, but--
Speaker 2: Jennifer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jennifer Hudson [sic. Beyonce Knowles], yeah, right, right, right, right. So, yeah, you know, when people--that's happened in terms of Grammys, or any award.
Speaker 2: Yeah, basically (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Probably some, some--
Speaker 2: Now spe--
Speaker 1: --in some respect-
Speaker 2: Speaking of awards, when it relates to gospel music, I'm challenged with how I can accept that. I think personally that gospel music should not be judged. I have the same thoughts about that, and 'Sunday Best.' I think that those songs--if you're going to be religious--if you're going to proclaim this particular religion--it does not suggest that there can be competitiveness as to who's the best person that can say God, musically or any other way. And it's kind of like--it's probably good for the business, good for the record labels or whoever makes money from these people who may win the award or something--if their records sales increase. But I don't think anybody can say Jesus any better than me. I don't think Jesus would care. Does he judge how my vocals are, as opposed to somebody else's? So, I see a conflict with that, if you want to get technical about it. However, I would not publicly raise the issue, because I do understand why it is what it is. I understand that. But personally, I object to it--'Sunday Best' and the Stellar Awards [Stellar Gospel Music Awards], which are the two most prolific ones at this time--only because of that. I think it's great exposure, there are a lot of good features about it. But I don't know if those features, to me, align with what it is that we do as Christians, who go--who's out to spread the word. "I can spread the word better than you." "Oh, really?" "Well, who you talking about?" "Jesus" (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 652291
Speaker 1: "Jesus" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That kind of raises the question, what place does pride have, have in sacred music, you know?
Speaker 1: Hey (laughter), "Shoo ba doop," as [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou would say (laughter). One of the things that you were interested in, in some thoughts from me about, was some people who had influenced my life. And I just happened to think of Maya Angelou when I just mentioned her name, "Shoo ba doop ba doo," (laughter), a great character that is still in my life in a great way. I met her as an instructor at Tennessee State University [Nashville, Tennessee]. She came to deliver a lecture for us. I'm in the reading department, of course. And the head of my department wanted to bring a prolific lady like her in. And I had never heard, I had heard about 'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings' [Maya Angelou], but I had never really paid that much attention to it. So, you know how you hear things, and they're there. So, this evening that she brought her in, I sat kind of center front on the floor, and watched her intently. And obviously, she caught my eye to some degree. So, because I was in the department, and I was the only male in the department, I was asked to come up to the suite after it was over, and then I met her a little closer. And this evening, I wasn't expecting to develop a relationship with her, by no means. Anyway, the director of the department asked if I would take her to the airport the next morning. And I said, "Sure," and, "delighted to." And so, I brought--we had recorded my first album ['There is Hope for This World'] (laughter). So, I brought it and I gave it to her. I said, you know, "Take this," you know. And, "Would you please," you know. And she said, "Oh, I'd love to have it." So, she did. In about two weeks, I got this call from--, "[HistoryMaker] Bobby Jones, this is Dr. Maya Angelou." "Yes, ma'am, Dr. Angelou?" "Yes." "Oh." A small chat, and then she says, "I like your project, your album, CD [compact disc]." No, album at that time. I said, "Oh, really?" "Yeah, I wanted to see if you would like to come to California and sing for me. My aunt is having something, and I want to raise some money for her." I said, "Oh, my god, would I? Of course I would." So, I told my group [New Life], and we bussed up and went across country on a bus to Los Angeles [California]. And she had us in a nice theatre there with all the producers of several Paramount studios [Paramount Pictures Corporation], and all those people were there. And we made our little presentation and all. So, afterwards, she just kept staying in touch with me, and me with her. And it had, it developed into a really great relationship. I'm with her every Thanksgiving. We have, about a hundred of us all go to Raleigh, North Carolina and we're with Dr. Angelou. But the experiences of her coming to my home so many times staying with me, and me going to hers, and her talking to me about life--I have never seen such brilliance. It was, she was ultra amazing, and really helped me to develop--and kind of develop what I call refinement, if that word is appropriate. Because I do recognize I'm a little out of the mainstream black behavior, so to speak (laughter). Maybe not. But I appreciated her, and the same for Louis Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan]. And we didn't talk about religion, we talked about life. He knows so much about our Bible, the Christian Bible. And if he did make some parables of some sort--he would many times talk about, "Well, you know, Paul did this," or you know, he just makes up kinds of things about--and as we would talk about international problems, and conflicts and things, which I really like, because I love to be around intelligent people; I think you learn so much from them. And I always wanted to be in the company of people like him. And I became an admirer of all people, of Al Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton]. I saw something in him when he had long hair. And--
Speaker 2: So, what did you see? I mean--
Speaker 1: I saw brilliance.
Speaker 2: Okay. Did you see past the hair, or--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you have to go past that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You know, I don't like people who judge other people because of, you know, certain situations. And I'm not one to do that, you know. So, yeah. So, I've had an opportunity to meet many, many prominent minds in this country, and others that did influence my, my life.
Story_ID: 652292
Speaker 1: As far as gospel music is concerned, the first one that--really wasn't James Cleveland. It was actually Andrae Crouch and Edwin Hawkins and the family.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then James for other reasons, because he was--the way he could mesmerize an audience was just mind blowing. Then I appreciated the works of certain people who were female gospel singers, like the Albertina Walkers, The Caravans, and the Dorothy Love Coates. And all of the people from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], The Davis Sisters, and all those. I began to learn about their music. But, of course, the one that I pledge allegiance to the most would be Dr. Thomas Dorsey [Thomas A. Dorsey]. Because we claim him as the father of gospel music, the one who started it, the one who brought that sound in from the nightclubs. And that's the history of what I know. However, in the white marketplace, at the same time, they were proclaiming him not that. And so, we would have debated discussions about (laughter), about what gospel music is, you know. So, then what we had to do was divide it into categories. We just said, okay, Christian music, that's white; black gospel, that's another thing. You don't sing--we don't sing with you, you don't sing like us. You know, we say gospel comes from Willie Mae Ford Smith saying, "God's spell." "Oh, that music sounds--it was God's spell." And you know, put that together. So, so, you begin to look at that. And now I think we're trying to come a little closer to bringing it together, but we're not there. And they're honoring me again, which I appreciate so very much. They're calling it the Honors awards for GMA [GMA Honors], which is Gospel Music Association. And I'm, I was once a member of their organization until I saw that they weren't going to allow us to help them make any decisions, I mean the blacks, the few of us. Al Green, Edwin Hawkins and myself, were on their board of directors.
Speaker 2: So, this is the Gospel Music Association?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: This is a predominantly white organization?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But of course, blacks want to be a part. And so, I kept telling the black folk, "They don't want you. This is not, it has really nothing to do with--they just don't want--." You know, this is contemporary Christian. Just like we don't really welcome a lot of them. Well, maybe we do, if they could do it. But black gospel is black gospel, (laughter) you know. We scream and we, you know, have riffs and--
Story_ID: 652293
Speaker 1: When gospel music originated--well, the father of the style was Dorsey [Thomas A. Dorsey]. Was there any other kind of gospel other than black gospel (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, they say that their music started, they started singing it, you know, long before we did, or whatever, you know. And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know there's a country music tradition, a more casual kind of music other than the church hymns that, you know, that whites, you know, started singing. Did they call that gospel then?
Speaker 2: Southern gospel.
Speaker 1: Southern gospel?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And then the contemporary part of white gospel is contemporary Christian, is what they call it.
Speaker 1: Yeah. They're almost, like, stations now that play a mix of music that sounds like most Top 40 music, other than the words are different.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. You're right.
Speaker 1: Right, right. And then each station--so, if you drive through Indiana you'll hear the--you know, and probably from Tennessee too.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you can. And then the concern comes about those artists that are now collaborating with mainstream artists. And there are a number of us who are, and have, collaborated with mainstream artists to sing gospel, because they want to sing it. And a few comments about some of those mainstream artists come in on 'Bobby Jones Gospel,' the television side of it. You know, the ones that I've had that are extremely well known, and that I felt very good about having them, not mentioning them to you before. So, I'll see how that settles out, when the dust settles.
Speaker 1: Okay. I mean there's the Ray Charles movie ['Ray'], there was--I brought up a discussion, I can't remember the context of it. But I heard it on the radio about whether, you know, the blues of Ray Charles is, and the gospel, are the same. You know, they say all you do is you substitute baby with Jesus--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --and you really have the same, you know I mean, it's the same form, but for different purposes.
Speaker 2: That's what it is, that's what we--and when I do demonstrations, many times I show them the same patterns and form that the blues has that gospel has--you know, it's change in lyrical content. Yeah, and we show those examples and have a good time with it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, R and B and gospel are very much related. And a lot of, the biggest rhythm and blues stars or soul stars come out of the gospel experience, like Aretha Franklin and Sam Cooke, and you can go on and on.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, is it still--in the advent of the rap age, is that still, is that true? You know, I mean, I guess this is where it kind of diverges a little bit, because of the rap art- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What, the rap?
Speaker 1: Rap artists don't really come out of a church experience, do they, or--?
Speaker 2: I, they try to say that preachers rap all the time (laughter). So, that's second nature then that they say that. So, maybe there is some similarity there. I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah well, that's the oratory that pe- that people hear in the black community the most, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what they say (laughter). Interesting.

Speaker 1: Do you have a, or do you dare say that you have a favorite performer?
Speaker 2: No. Oh, performer in general. Well, I'm an Al Green fan (laughter). I'm an Aretha Franklin fan, you know. I'm a Patti LaBelle fan. But at the same time, I'm also a Tye Tribbett fan (laughter) and a Kirk Franklin fan.
Speaker 1: All three of those that you named at first, do, can play, they do gospel. They're closely associated with gospel music.
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, Al Green dropped secular music back in the '80s [1980s]. And then he picked it up for a little while and he went back to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he dropped it, and he went back. And now he's back and forth. He's still pastoring his church [Full Gospel Tabernacle, Memphis, Tennessee], though.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's interesting.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah. Any other favorites that you have?
Speaker 2: No, I've mentioned those.
Speaker 1: No other ones.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the beginning there was the Andrae Crouches and the Hawkins, you know. But the--they've ceased to be.
Story_ID: 652295
Speaker 1: You mentioned, now, you've got a book. One of your, you've got two books.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: One is 'Make a Joyful Noise' [sic. 'Touched by God: Black Gospel Greats Share Their Stories of Finding God,' Bobby Jones with Lesley Sussman]. Tell us about--there's a story behind that (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah. When the company called me about that, Les Sussman [Lesley Sussman] was the producer from New York [New York]--Simon and Schuster [Simon and Schuster, Inc.], I believe it was--Random House [sic.], one of those two companies, I get them mixed up--wanted me to get some expressions from gospel artists as to where they com- where they came from and what challenges they had in their lives, and give a little bit of their story. You know, it's almost like an autobiography of talking to them. And so, we developed about thirteen, I think, of those stories from prominent black females in the gospel music industry. So, that's what that book--and how they were touched by God.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, do gospel performers usually say they were touched by God, or--
Speaker 2: Usually they will (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) are called?
Speaker 2: Yes, usually they will--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --say that they were touched by God.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I make a complete thought there, in case you edit it, and you need to know where it came from (laughter).
Speaker 1: We will edit it (laughter). So, in the second book--
Speaker 2: 'Make a Joyful Noise: My 25 Years in Gospel Music' [Bobby Jones with Lesley Sussman]. It was supposed to have been just me telling my life story a little bit, up to that point. But it got out of hand when it got to the segment of me identifying people who I liked or disliked, and what unusual experiences I had had with them and around them. But just that segment of people, it did. Otherwise, it did really well for us. It did talk about my early childhood, the things that we talked about--how I grew from where I am, was, to where I am, and then my country lifestyle and all of that. And a lot of people were really touched by that. They didn't know that those were the experiences that I had growing up with my father [Jim Jones] and all the--like they were. So, that's what that book was about.
Speaker 1: Okay. People do make assumptions about a celebrity, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, Sir.
Speaker 1: Once you reach a status.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they do, and rightfully so. Don't we all? You know, I'm looking at reality shows wondering, what the heck is this? (Laughter) You know, I'm making some kind of judgment--I wouldn't necessarily say judgment, but it's some thoughts about the characters that I'm looking at and stuff. So, it's going to happen. If you're out there, you got to get ready for what you're up against. Because that's what going to happen. So, they make assumptions about us, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was, like I saw somewhere recently about a reality show featuring black preachers, or something, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Preachers of L.A.'
Speaker 1: Right, 'Preachers of L.A.' What do you think about something like that?
Speaker 2: I think it's good (laughter). I mean, why not? It indicated the type of lifestyles they had, and it did not take away from their--I think, what they do with God, and you know, their spiritual thing. I found that a lot of people tried to find things bad about it. But, you know, it's television.
Speaker 1: Come to think of it, Russell Simmons' brother, Reverend Run [Joseph Simmons], had a reality show ['Run's House'] about his--
Speaker 2: I never saw that.
Speaker 1: --ministry and, you know, and his life--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on one of the, it may have been on BET [sic. Music Television; MTV] or, I'm not sure which one--
Speaker 2: The interesting thing about what's happening in gospel music right now in television is the way gospel artists are now entering into the mainstream of television, like the reality shows and the competitive shows. Instead of the Grammys [Grammy Awards], now it's the Stellars [Stellar Gospel Music Awards]. And instead of just looking at some other kinds of reality shows, there's 'Mary Mary,' and the 'Preachers of L.A.' And what's this girl's name? The piano player and his family. Gee, why can I not--he's a good friend, he lives here in Nashville [Tennessee]. All of these reality shows are coming about, and then these movies now that are being created by a lot of the gospel artists. I didn't know whether you knew that or not, but gospel artists are creating movies. And Deitrick [Deitrick Haddon] has done one, Fred Hammond has done one. I think Vickie Winans' son [Mario Winans] and her--they, they've done one. And--
Speaker 1: You know, the Tyler Perry movies are--have a heavy religious message.
Speaker 2: Strong, don't they? Yeah, strong influences.
Speaker 1: Complete with gospel music.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, with gospel artists in them. He's given a lot of people a lot of work. Yeah, so, ju- it's just interesting to see how these things are evolving. And I think sooner or later, you're going to see a lot more.
Story_ID: 652296
Speaker 1: We have a history of asking all the pastors we interview pretty much what they think about the megachurch. So--
Speaker 2: I think megachurches, has a lot of influence on the communities that they're in. They're able to do a lot of the work that smaller churches cannot do, which is providing for those who are not able to live a comfortable lifestyle. I think they have different ministries that will take care of some psychological needs that our community people have. And all in all, they just provide great services for the communities that they're in, that smaller churches are not designed to do, or cannot do, or don't want to do. So, I'm very positive about megachurches. I'm not in one, but I think they have their places, too.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you think they fill a gap in service (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think they fill a need, yes.
Speaker 1: --to the community?
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And those pastors are very intelligent people. I mean, you can--when you can gather twenty-five to thirty thousand people together and, man, and do all this money raising that they do--you can't be dumb (laughter), you know, and do that. That requires some thinking. Even if it isn't all from him, he's got people around him that's, you know, supplementing that, and that intellect. And that's, that's a good thing.
Speaker 1: Are you concerned at all about the opulent lifestyles of some of the ministers today?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't be necessarily concerned about it. I think people, if that's what these members want to do, if they want to support them that way, then that's their business. You know, it's their money. So, it doesn't bother me that--you know, you decide whether you want to do it. If you don't want to do it, then don't do it. You know, why are you going to criticize them for doing it, you know? If that's what they believe, that it's going to help them reach the kingdom, and they want their pastors to live a good life here on earth, that's their business. You know, that's not what I'm into. But that's what they are into and, you know, I don't have no problem with that.
Story_ID: 652297
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I'm really concerned that we haven't been able to close the gap that I thought that we would have from the period of the Civil Rights Movement. I lived in the South, and I grew up with deseg- with segregation. And I saw the inequities that were happening simply because our money is used to do the same thing everybody else's money, tax money, that is, and everything. And I thought that our people would exhibit more of a togetherness than we have been able to do. It appears, maybe because of the signs of the times or something, that we have gotten further away from that than we should. And I'm concerned about the direction of some of the youth in this nation, and the habits that they have developed and are exhibiting. I'm concerned about that. I'd like to see not the killings, and not the language that separates people, and all the negative factors that happen with us. I'd like to see more togetherness among our people. And those are deep concerns of mine, and have been for a while, it's just not starting. And, and when I get an opportunity to talk about positiveness and positive people, I make sure that I do that.
Story_ID: 652298
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point in, in your life, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could go back and change it, or?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that, that answer--you learn from experience, but you've got to have the experiences to learn. So, I--you can say, yeah, I wish I had, or whatever. But I can't say that because, you know, my pattern was laid out for it, and the decisions I made brought me some good experiences, and it brought some experiences that I could learn from, challenges, I should say. If I went back to try to do it another kind of way, I may make another kind of mistake, if they were called that. I call them challenges. So, let it go, let it flow. Be grateful for where you are (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: No regrets.
Speaker 1: Okay. But at the same time, when you look--you said a number of times that just, you know, you marvel at where you've come from and what you've been able to do. But is there anything that you still want to do that's--I mean, what's the biggest thing that you still want to do, or want to do next?
Speaker 2: I've done basically what I've wanted to do. You can always dream. I think probably the two accomplishments that the Lord placed with me was becoming an ambassador of two nations, Dominica and the Bahamas. I don't know whether you were aware of that. Appointed by their governments, their cabinet. This is not to say I'm going to run around and tell everybody about this, but to promote tourism and economic development. They chose me because of my visibility, and because of my practicing Christianity. I say practicing, because I don't think we become fully Christian, because nobody's perfect. So, we're going to make mistakes along the way. So, that means we're practicing it, so we don't go back and make the same ones. So, I think those are the two primary reasons why they asked if I would become an ambassador for their nation. And I love the idea of being a first from the gospel music arena.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Yeah, we did see that, and we were wondering, you know (laughter)--
Speaker 2: How that came about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) what duties you would have to perform that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, those are the duties, and that's what I'm doing. I was able to get a tremendous number of ships to stop over in Dominica, a small island between Guadeloupe and Martinique. And they can use that money, you know. And I've carried, already I've taken the Impact television network [Impact Network] to the Bahamas. Now, the whole, all of the islands have Impact TV. That was the, my biggest contributions right now.
Story_ID: 652299
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you this: when you mentioned production just now, I was wondering, and I probably should have asked this. But how much does it cost to produce one of your shows ['Bobby Jones Gospel']?
Speaker 2: Oh, man, it depends on a whole lot of things--where you are, the companies that you use to bring in the technical equipment, you know--the time. When I was doing these shows in theaters and things, it would be anywhere from fifty to--fifty, sixty, sometimes a hundred thousand [dollars]. BET [Black Entertainment Television] spends over probably a couple of million to do what we do in six days in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], of just actual production. But other costs before that, you know, come into the picture. So, a good--
Speaker 1: They took over production--
Speaker 2: In 2001.
Speaker 1: Two thousand one [2001].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, so they spend a great deal of money doing that. They make it through advertising, though.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. That sounds consequential, I should have asked. Thank you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 652300
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back again at--over everything you've done in your career, wha- what would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: Presenting gospel music and artists to the world, a giver. That's what I hear (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay and--now, tell us about, now, did you ever get married or have children? Did you have--
Speaker 2: I don't have children. I have a stepchild, a stepdaughter [Sonnetta Joy].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I met a lady by the name of Ethel [Ethel Williams Jones], and we married, and we're happy.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you meet her?
Speaker 2: In 1995. Oh, I met her years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay. Before that, but you got married in '95 [1995]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we married each other.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you meet her in school?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, she was in the gospel world.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right. And she already had a daughter?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, did your parents get a chance to see you become, I mean to get your master's degree [from Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], or to, you know--?
Speaker 2: They both did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did they get a chance to see you on television?
Speaker 2: They both did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On 'Bobby Jones Gospel'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for a long time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Well, what do they think?
Speaker 2: They were very excited, yeah. My mother [Augusta Tharpe Jones] and father [Jim Jones] got back together after many years of being separated. And it was a long time before he understood what I was doing, or even, whether he even cared or not. But she was there from the beginning, understanding everything, and saw the development and was extremely proud.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, my life was basically devoted to her anyway. You know how we are about our mother's, you know. So, that was a good run. That's when the chapter in my life closed, when she left me. So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, my sister stands in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that place (laughter). And what's so unusual about her, it amazes, amuses, me--is when she--they call me Bob [HistoryMaker Bobby Jones], you know. And she'll look at me and she'll say, and she'll touch me, and she says, "Is this Bob? Bob, is this you?" I go, "What do you mean, is this me?" "I can't believe this is Bob." (Laughter) You know, she'll do that. And we have our private moment, and I tell her, "Lula [Lula Jones Puckett], of course, this is Bob. What do you mean?" You know, but she's just so strict, you know. She's, she just can't believe this happened to us, you know. So, it was with much admiration, and I appreciated that so much.
Story_ID: 652301
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before--
Speaker 2: Well, we were about to skip over the ambassadorships. So, I, I was able to get that. So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --pretty much.
Speaker 1: All right. So, well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sir, how, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would think that I will be remembered as a person that was loving and caring--who wouldn't--understanding, spiritual, intelligent, creative. Those are the attributes I can think about that describe my behavior. I'd like to be remembered like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
