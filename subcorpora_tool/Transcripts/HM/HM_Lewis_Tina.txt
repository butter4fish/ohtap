Story_ID: 652138
Speaker 1: So, I want to start out by having you talking about your family.  So can we start with your mother?  And can you give her name and when she was born; and about her background?
Speaker 2: First of all, I, I told you my name was Mary Leontine Lewis [HistoryMaker Tina Lewis].  I was born Mary Leontine Ricard.  And I was given the nickname Tina when I was a little girl because my mother's first name was Mary, and my [paternal] grandmother's name was Leontine [Leontine Ricard], and she lived next door.  So, to eliminate any confusion, I was given this nickname.  But my mother was born Mary Ann LeDuff [Mary LeDuff Ricard].  And she was born in Louisiana.  And my father's name, Charles Clifton Ricard [Charles Ricard, Sr.], and he was also born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: So were both of them born in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Both parents were born in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Now, was she born in Baton Rouge?
Speaker 2: She was born in New Roads, Louisiana, which is--they called it the country, so she was a little country girl.
Speaker 1: And did she talk at all about her growing up?  And do you know how far back, do you know, on that side of the family--
Speaker 2: Well, my mother really had a very difficult childhood because her mother [Leora Pierce LeDuff] died when she was twelve years old with eight siblings, and she was the oldest girl.  So basically, my mother raised her siblings.  And so she was a mother for a very long time before we came along.  She met and married my father at the age of eighteen.  She had to stop school, of course, because she had to raise her siblings.  She met and married my father at the age of eighteen.  My father was nineteen.  He was a carpenter.  In fact, he built our first home, which is still standing on Arizona Street in Baton Rouge, which was parceled out to him by my grandmother, who had owned the property.  So my father built this three room shotgun house that I grew up in, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in a segregated Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  So I get--I basically graduated--I mean I grew up in the segregated South.
Story_ID: 652139
Speaker 1: How would you describe--what about your father's background.  I mean, besi- what did he talk about growing up?
Speaker 2: My father [Charles Ricard, Sr.] went to the [U.S.] military.  I do know that.  I was privileged to live next door to my grandparents, so he didn't have to talk to me a whole lot about them because I knew them very well.  He didn't talk too much about the military because I don't think that was a very good experience.  My father was a very quiet person that kind of kept things inside of him.  He really didn't share a whole lot.  But we go to, to meet most of our relatives.  I got to meet my great-grandparents on both sides, which is, you know, I don't know if kids get to do that today.
Speaker 1: Do you know how, how--what their approximate age of--you know, I mean when they were born, you know, on either, you know, either--
Speaker 2: My grandfather [Alexander LeDuff] was born in the nineteen hun- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is on your father's side?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, my grandfather was born in the 1900s.  My grandfather lived to be ninety some years old, so did my grandmother [Leontine Ricard] on my father's side.  And they were bo- both born in the nine- early 1900s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: A, a hard worker, a person that sacrificed for his family.  I really have really come to appreciate my father when I read 'The Warmth of Other Suns' ['The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration'] because my father was one of those people that Isabel Wilkenson [sic. Isabel Wilkerson] talked about, who left Louisiana for a better life for his family.  My father left my mother [Mary LeDuff Ricard], this little fragile homemaker, with five of us to take care of while he came to Los Angeles [California] to find work in the industry.  He was a carpenter by trade, a builder.  And so he came to find work and then came back for us.  He came back for us.  We didn't sell our house.  We just gave it back to my grandmother, who had given him the property to begin with.  And we loaded everything up in a U-Haul that we owned from this little, tiny three bedroom home and our little red and white Chevy [Chevrolet] station wagon and drove to California, where, you know, that's where we began a new life.  And because of that move that my father made to give us the opportunity, we are, and I feel I am, who I am today.
Speaker 1: So your, you know, when you think about it, your mother was raising kids her whole life, because--
Speaker 2: My mother was raising kids her whole life.  And you know, the really frightening thing, and my mother stayed so calm, cool, and collective.  I don't know if you remember--I'm sure you do--the Bay of Pigs, that whole era when, you know, the Cuban Missile Crisis.  We were home alone with my mother, and my father was in Los Angeles when they were talking about evacuating us out of Louisiana.  Of course, none of that came to fruition, but there were, there was a huge possibility that we were gonna have to leave our home during that time.
Story_ID: 652140
Speaker 1: Now you talk also about being Creole.  And so, is Creole on both sides?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, how did that--'cause Creole, a lot of Creoles define themselves almost, I want to say as a separate race or separate culture.
Speaker 2: A lot of Creoles do define themselves as a separate race and a separate culture.  And I think those are the Creoles that have never left Louisiana, okay.  I left and came to California, came to Los Angeles, where I went to school and grew up, beca- and I knew right away I was black.  There's no question about it.  I define myself as being a mixture of Creole--African American, but my heritage is Creole.  All my relatives are Creole.  Most of them consider themselves Creole.  But I consider myself an African American.  My children [Jeremy Lewis, Jennifer Lewis and Jonathan Lewis] do also.  They know they have this heritage, but they're still African American.
Speaker 1: So can you tell us some about the heritage, and were you, did you--did any of that were you taught as a young person?
Speaker 2: My parents [Mary LeDuff Ricard and Charles Ricard, Sr.] didn't teach us to be racist.  And that is part of what Creole heritage is about.  It's, you know, to remain separate, to keep within our own culture.  My parents--I did go to Catholic school which was predominantly Creole.  My [paternal] grandfather [Joseph Ricard] actually founded St. Francis Xavier [St. Francis Xavier Catholic School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  He was one of the people that founded the little church and the little school that I attended in Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  Ricard is my maiden name, and that was a huge name there.  In fact, I think there's a, a Bishop Ricard [John Ricard] even in, in New Orleans [Louisiana].  But you know, I knew that I was somewhat different when I walked to school past, you know, the all-black school, the all-black schools that I passed and when I went to the, you know, Catholic elementary school.  But it really wasn't verbalized, you know, to the point where I wasn't allowed to associate, because I didn't because I went to school with all Creoles.
Story_ID: 652141
Speaker 1: Tell me how many children in your family.
Speaker 2: There are five of us.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.  You did say that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm the eldest.
Speaker 1: So you're the eldest.  I'm the eldest.  Okay, so you're bossy.  No (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, I am (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so can you give your siblings' names in, in order?
Speaker 2: My, my brother Charles [Charles Ricard, Jr.] resides in Canada, and he's lived there for almost thirty years now.  He came back from Vietnam and moved to Canada, married a Canadian, never returned.  My brother, Gregory [Gregory Ricard (ph.)], is the next in line.  Gerald [Gerald Ricard (ph.)] is the next one.  And then my mother [Mary LeDuff Ricard] lost a girl, Sheila [Sheila Ricard (ph.)]--there would have been six of us--at childbirth.  And then my sister, Connie [Connie Ricard (ph.)], is the youngest.
Speaker 1: So it's three girl- no.
Speaker 2: Three boys and two girls (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And two girls.  Okay.  So, oh, so Connie--so the oldest and the youngest are girls (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Are both girls.
Story_ID: 652142
Speaker 1: I'd like to ask you what your earliest memory of growing up is.
Speaker 2: My earliest memory and my fondest memories are always of Christmas, because we were, we were really poor.  I didn't know we were poor because my parents were very loving and nurturing, and I knew that I was loved, and I never really realized that I was deprived.  I mean, we didn't have a television set, oh gosh, for, for several years.  And it wasn't until I, you know, saw on television how people lived that I realized that there were certain things that I didn't have.  But at Christmas I would get a doll, and I might get one other toy, and that would be my Christmas.  But that would be my fondest memory, and of course, of my mother [Mary LeDuff Ricard], would bake.  At our birthdays she would bake a special birthday cake just for us.  And she would bake my favorite cake, which was a chocolate layer cake with bananas in, you know, a filling.  It was just wonderful.  And I loved my parents.  And of course, they're both deceased.  And so, Christmas is my favorite time, but it brings back a lot of memories, and I miss them dearly.
Speaker 1: So, how old were they when they passed?
Speaker 2: My father [Charles Ricard, Sr.] died of cancer at seventy-two.  My mother died at eighty-two pretty much of natural causes.  She had, you know, a lot of issues, but she died at eighty-two.
Speaker 1: Right.  And then what age were you when your family moved to California [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I was in--I was thirteen.
Story_ID: 652143
Speaker 1: I want to take you back to Baton Rouge [Louisiana], and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I want you to tell me what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: The smell of gumbo reminds me of growing up.  The sound--the smell of pralines, my mother [Mary LeDuff Ricard] in the k- kitchen making praline candy.  My father [Charles Ricard, Sr.] was also a hunter, so when I see deer heads mounted in different places that I might visit or even on television, that reminds me of my father because he was a huge hunter.  And he hunted deer and rabbits, and you know, of course we ate deer meat and rabbit meat.  He didn't just go out and kill for the sport. It was actually, it was consumed.  Everything that he hunted we also consumed.  And those would be the sights and, and the smells, yeah.
Speaker 1: Sounds?
Speaker 2: Sounds would be certain music, certain--'Oh, Danny Boy' ['Danny Boy'] for example, that song was one of my father's favorites, and he loved to hear that.  And when Luther Vandross sings 'Dance with My Father Again'--that's a hard song for me.
Story_ID: 652144
Speaker 1: You were a daddy's girl?
Speaker 2: Absolutely a daddy's girl.  He danced with me at my cotillion.  And--(pause) that's when my, my--I think my husband [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis], why my husband wanted to have a daughter, because he admired my admiration for my father [Charles Ricard, Sr.] so.
Speaker 1: That's--no, there's nothing like being a daddy's girl.  There's nothing--
Speaker 2: Nothing like it.  And when we got married, I'll never forget we bought this fixer upper.  And my father came over with his inspector's glasses on to check it, you know, 'cause he was a builder.  And you know, we mentioned that we, you know, we wanted to, you know, take out this wall and enlarge the bathroom.  And it was hysterical 'cause we were in bed one Saturday morning and my father showed up at the front door with all his equipment, and the next thing we knew, the wall was knocked out.  So whether we were ready to begin the--go under construction, he took care of it.  That's just the way he was.  He was just a, a doer, you know.  He, he just took care of thing.  He just, whatever I wanted, I had, because you know, if I just said, daddy, that's all it took.
Speaker 1: So, I mean, and that shows even with him getting up and finding a new home, you know, a place for the family.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  I don't know if he realized what he was doing at the time, but it really gave us a tremendous amount of opportunity.  I am who I am today because of what he did, no question about it.
Story_ID: 652145
Speaker 1: So can you describe the, the block that you grew up on, you know, or the, you know--was it a block or a street (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The street.
Speaker 1: Street.
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up on Arizona Street [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And it had (gesture) open ditch on both sides.  It was not a finished street.  And it was graveled for a long, long time before it was ever paved.  And there was a Baptist church right down the street from us.  And I have fond memories of that Baptist church, because whenever there was a funeral--I don't know if you've ever watched New Orleans--or Louisiana type funerals where they go marching down the street to the church with this very somber music.  And we all had to close our front doors and, and have respect for the funeral that was passing.  And then when the funeral ended, it would be a very uplifting song, like 'When the Saints Go Marching On' [sic. 'When the Saints Go Marching In'].  That would play, and it was very uplifting.  But I had a lot of respect for, for that Baptist church, even though I was Catholic, and the Catholic church [St. Francis Xavier Church, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] was, you know, miles away.  But our, we knew our neighbors.  The neighbors right next to us was Mr. and Mrs. Mate [ph.], and they raised chickens in their backyard.  And whenever he would go out to wring a chicken's neck, I would watch.  He would wring the chicken's neck before he would cut the neck off.  And he would ask my mom [Mary LeDuff Ricard] if she wanted a chicken.  So he would give my mom a chicken over the fence.  And my mom would take it in and clean the feathers and you know, prepare the chicken, so I watched all of that growing up.  I learned how to cook in the kitchen with my mother at a very young age, you know.  That's how I know how to cook today, because I was in the kitchen.
Speaker 1: So how, how young do you think you were?
Speaker 2: Seven.
Speaker 1: Seven, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Seven. So how were you as a child though?
Speaker 2: How was--I was very much in charge all the time (laughter).  Whenever my parents went out, you know, we didn't have money for a babysitter, so I was the, the chief cook and bottle washer (laughter) when--I took care of my brothers and sisters when my mother came home from the hospital with the, you know, with the newborn, I was her, I was her helper.  So I learned how to take care of children and babies at a very early age.  I know how to change diapers and heat the formula.  I knew how to do everything very young.  I was the babysitter, so I was always in charge.  I was bossy, and I've, I stayed that way.  And my, you know, when, when my, when, when my mother passed, you know, I think it was five years ago.  You know, my brothers said, "Well, mom," they looked at me, said, "Well, you're it, now."  So, my brothers have a lot of respect for me.
Story_ID: 652146
Speaker 1: I want to talk about the, well, what about religion?  Was--you said you went to Catholic school [St. Francis Xavier Catholic School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  Were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to Catholic school.
Speaker 1: --were, were you raised Catholic?
Speaker 2: Raised Catholic.  I am not today.  I'm a born again--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Christian.  One of the things that my parents [Mary LeDuff Ricard and Charles Ricard, Sr.] taught me at a very early age, and they didn't realize what they were saying when they told me this, but they always said, "A family that prays together stays together."  And so we had prayer time in our home where we would stop and everyone would kneel and pray, and we did that every day.  So I grew with that.  And they taught me a family that prays together stays together.  So when I met my husband [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis], and he was not Catholic--he was a Christian--I decided to become Christian, to join his faith, because I wanted us to be the family that prays together and stays together.  And so my, my parents had a very difficult time when I told them that I was baptized in the Pentecostal Church.  And, but they respect it, and especially when I told them what they taught me.  And they--what else could they do?  And you know, they, they respected it.
Story_ID: 652147
Speaker 1: So you had a very, it appears, wholesome growing up in many ways, very family sort of centric.  Your lar- hard work ethic it also, it appears.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about other aspects of family life.  You know, what was sort of an average day, you know, in your household?
Speaker 2: The average day in my, in my household was my mother [Mary LeDuff Ricard] actually did everything for my father [Charles Ricard, Sr.].  She took care of him, waited on him, because she was the homemaker.  He would go out and go to work.  When he would come home, she would have his bath ready; she would have his clothes laid out.  She, that's what she did for him.  Dinner would be ready.  The house would be in order, even if she didn't do it all, but the house would have order when he came home.  There would not be chaos.  That's what I learned.  You know, if there was laundry done, it was laundry was, fold, put away, so when dad came home, we would have order and family time.  So, for years we didn't have television, so we would play games.  You know, my cousins would come over.  We'd play outside.  We'd play hide and go seek, red light green light, dodge ball, all these games that kids could play outside on the, you know, in the front of the house or in the back of the house, which today kids can't play on the street.  But we were able to do those kinds of things because we didn't have abductions like we have today.  But I had a very great relationship with all my cousins because we would spend holidays together.  For example, on Christmas, we would get up and we would have our family time.  We'd open our gifts, and then we would take turns going to our relatives' homes, or they would come to us.  So it would be, it'd be, you know, just family time at holidays.
Speaker 1: And do you remember food served at holidays too?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  My mother would make fruitcake every Christmas, homemade fruitcake.  And I can remember her--you had to feed the fruitcake with this brandy.  And she would, she would cover it with cheesecloth and pour brandy on it.  I don't know if it was once a week or daily.  I, I can't remember.  But I can remember her taking her out--taking the fruitcake out and pouring the brandy of the fruitcake and covering it back up again so that when Christmas came, I guess it would be the way it needed to be served, which I didn't like to eat it that way because it had a lot of alcohol (laughter) in it.  But I guess it was an adult desert anyway.
Speaker 1: And, and what, what other things do you associate with the holidays, you know, that, 'cause Christmas being your favorite, but any of the holidays?  What, what, what other things come to mind?
Speaker 2: Of course, you know, the decoration, the Christmas tree.  We would go to Mass.  Sometimes we would go to midnight Mass, which was a very holy service and very long (laughter), and especially for a child it was a very long service.  But we would go to church every Christmas.  We would dress.  I would have new pair of shoes, patent leather shoes.  I would have a new outfit.  It was just a special time.
Story_ID: 652148
Speaker 1: Let's talk about school.  So, elementary school you go to--
Speaker 2: I went to Catholic school, which was taught by the nuns of the Holy Family [Sisters of the Holy Family].
Speaker 1: And so, the name of the--was St. Xav--
Speaker 2: St. Francis Xavier [St. Francis Xavier Catholic School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Xavier, okay.  And you went there from what age to what age?
Speaker 2: I went there until I moved to Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: I see.  So it was continual then.
Speaker 2: Right, it was continual.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any teachers there that influenced you or you know, that you can sort of describe the school experience?
Speaker 2: Well, the majority of the teachers were nuns.  They had a few lay teachers, but they were very strict.  So, in fact, I was taking piano lessons.  And I think I would have continued to learn how to play the piano if it wasn't for the fact that Sister Machialatti [ph.], if you missed a note, would slap you on the wrist with a ruler.  Well, who wants to continue playing the piano if every time you made a mistake your knuckles would be bruised?  So I stopped (laughter).  And henceforth--henceforth today, I don't play the piano.
Speaker 1: And do you--were there other things about school that sort of influenced you in any way, you know, or people or--what about discussions?  How are you aware of what is happening sort of outside, you know, in, in, in the world outside; or, or when do you become aware?  Is it more when you move to L.A.?
Speaker 2: It's more when I move to L.A.
Story_ID: 652149
Speaker 1: So let's talk about that move, 'cause your father's [Charles Ricard, Sr.] away.  Now, how long was he away before he brought, you know, brought the family?
Speaker 2: Oh, you're asking me to go so far back.  It might have been almost eight or nine months that he was gone.  I am not quite sure.  But he came back.  You know, I will tell you that we--I was aware of the Cuban Missile Crisis at the time because it was on the news.  We knew.  I knew my mother [Mary LeDuff Ricard] was concerned.  You know, we had weather issues.  We had a hurricane come through right before that, you know, where we had to, you know, buckle down and stay in.  And you know, we had issues with weather and things like that.  But there wasn't a whole lot of discussion of politics in our home.  I, I really, I--you know, when I was growing up, children were supposed to be seen and not heard.  So a lot of discussion I wasn't privy to because we were outside playing our games.  I wasn't in adult conversation.
Speaker 1: So when you--so what--just before I go to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], but what games do you associate with, with childhood?
Speaker 2: Dodge ball (laughter), Monopoly, bingo.  We played bingo a lot.  Pokeno, that was really big when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: So do you remember the, the trip out to, to, to Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: Can you describe it?
Speaker 2: Long.  It took us--I don't know--it might have been three or four days driving, with all of us in this little red and white Chevy [Chevrolet] station wagon.  But we stopped.  We stopped in, you know, motels and spent the night or a roadside inn.  When we came to California we went to Los--we moved to L.A., we rented a home until my father could afford to buy our first home.  And we rented a home, and I attended a junior high school, which was Washing- no, it was Horace Mann Junior High School [Horace Mann Middle School, Los Angeles, California].  I was only there for a very short period of time because we moved.  And when we moved, I think I was finishing up the ninth grade, which would have ended junior high school.  And then I went to L.A. High [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California].  First I went to Washington [George Washington Preparatory High School, Los Angeles, California], but that was for a very short period of time, might have been a semester.  I didn't get to make a whole lot of friends because I was there for a very short period of time, and then we moved to a different area of Los Angeles where I went to L.A. High.
Speaker 1: So Horace Mann, that's named after Horace--I mean Bond's--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond's--I--oh, you know what? Maybe I'm not--he was Horace Mann Bond.
Speaker 2: He was Horace Mann Bond.
Speaker 1: Horace Mann Bond, okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 652150
Speaker 1: So let's talk about so you went to L.A. High [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California]; and, and what, what is the significance of this school?
Speaker 2: The school was kind of segregated, to my surprise.  There was a huge Asian population.  And you know, they were in the quad over here, and then the, the black students were in another section of the school, and it was a very small African American population at that time.  But it was a lot of white and, and Asian population.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so how does this, how does it feel different to you then, you know, where you were (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Culturally, it was totally different for me, so I was the shy little girl there.  I mean, it was very difficult for me to make friends because I was just different.  I grew up in the South.  I did manage to make a few friends.  And I pretty kind of, pretty much kind of kept to myself.
Speaker 1: Well, it's, a, a move at that age can be really hard.  That's--
Speaker 2: It really was.
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: It was very difficult.  My father [Charles Ricard, Sr.] fussed at me a great deal because I was always calling my friends (laughter) back in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] on the telephone.  So we had a, you know, high phone bill, so that--and cell phones were not in existence back then.
Speaker 1: Now what year is that?
Speaker 2: That's 1962 when we moved.
Speaker 1: And so you--so, so are you gravitating to any subjects, or you're just--oh, that's hard though.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's hard.
Speaker 1: --the whole time--not the whole time was like that.  You, you fin- you met friends and things.
Speaker 2: I did meet a few friends.
Speaker 1: But you're not--you don't have family or anything 'cause you--all your--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --infrastructure had, had--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So what--
Speaker 2: No cousins, no--yeah.
Speaker 1: So what subjects are you gravitating to, or are you?
Speaker 2: I'm kind of--well, first of all, it's a total different structure than what I came from [at St. Francis Xavier Catholic School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], because the nuns taught.  You had one teacher for every subject.  And now, I'm going from classroom to classroom.  So, it was, it was, it was a very difficult time for me.  I struggled.  I wasn't a great student because things were hard for me.  My brother, on the other hand, everything was like, just came to him.  He was a straight A student, no issues, but I had to really work.  I was not a great student, but I was a C student, basically (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so with you--so, so with that, you're, you're sort of making your way through (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm making my way through.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 652151
Speaker 1: This is a, a time of a lot of activity in the Civil Rights Movement.  Are you aware of that?  And are you--
Speaker 2: I'm aware of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so what are you hearing your parents [Mary LeDuff Ricard and Charles Ricard, Sr.] say?
Speaker 2: We watched television a lot.  My parents didn't really talk a lot about it.  But you know, I'm in the classroom, which they didn't talk about a la- a lot either, because we didn't talk about us in school back then.  We didn't talk about our history, even though our history was e- evolving right then and there.  And interesting enough, we are having this conversation today on a very historical day.  November 22, 1963, I was in a typing class at, in school.  And I remember, you know, the teacher making the announcement that our president had been assassinated.  That's where I was that day.  I can remember going home and, I mean, we were all upset.  My parents were upset.  I mean, we felt as though Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was our president and that we had voted for him, and we had put him into office.  And that was a very, that was a very hurting experience.
Speaker 1: Right, 'cause a lot of people, I mean in the black community, felt that way, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --toward, towards him.  And that's true: we are on a historic day.  I need to be--I was talking to my office, and I sort of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --just momentarily (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A very historic day today and one that, you know, fifty years ago, young people don't remember, you know, but I remember.  I remember listening to Piers Morgan tell about his mother [Gabrielle Oliver Pughe-Morgan], who remembers, you know, so his experience is through his mother.  So you know, and I share with my children [Jeremy Lewis, Jennifer Lewis and Jonathan Lewis] my experience and where I was and what I felt like and what my parents felt like.  But you know, going back to being kind of lost at L.A. High [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California], unlike my husband [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis], who grew up in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  He was at L.A. High.
Speaker 1: Oh, is that where you met him?
Speaker 2: No.  He left (laughter); he left.  He might have been there the same year.  I can't remember when he left.  But he was there for a short period, and then he moved to Hawaii.  But you know, we have sort of the same background.  We kind of missed each other every--along the way.  And we met at a very--much later in life, but we have some of the same backgrounds.  His family was in construction.  Mine was in construction.  He pare- his family knew my family.  He went to L.A. High.  He--I left L.A. High and went to Los Angeles City College [Los Angeles, California].  See, I--my parents could not afford to send me to school, so I had to work.  My first job I was thirteen years old.  I got a job in a, a Miss Amber [Los Angeles, California] it was called.  It was a women's fashion.  I took the bus there, and I worked.  And that's how I went to school.  That was the only way I could go to school.  My parents could not afford to send me to school.  So I started off in junior college, and I, I went to Los Angeles City College.  And then from there--
Speaker 1: So you went, so you went to your--the city college in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your, your family though is--they, they want education then.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They're say- they're saying that.  So you go off to junior college.  That's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm living at home.
Speaker 1: You're living at home.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You've graduated.  You're living at home.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then, are you dating or things like that?  Are you, you--'cause--
Speaker 2: I am dating.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was very strict.  My father had to meet whoever I was dating before I could go out on a date.  And if he approved, they were welcomed in.  If he didn't approve, he would just close the door (laughter).  He was very strict.  I am not kidding, very strict.  But I was, I was very much a militant.
Story_ID: 652152
Speaker 1: So, where did this come?  Wait, all of a sudden--when did this militantism happen?
Speaker 2: I was very much a mili- first of all, I'm an el- I'm firstborn, okay, so I'm very much take charge.  And you know, even though when I started driving, my father [Charles Ricard, Sr.] said, "Don't drive the freeways." I drove the freeways.  My father would say, "Don't do this."  I would do it.  I was just rebellious.  I was al- I, and I wasn't as a very young person, but I--maybe that was part of my way of dealing with the fact that I was moved from my southern environment, my--this protected environment to now Los Angeles [California], which was very much, you know, not a very nurturing environment in school.  It's not like I knew Sister So and So who was teaching this class or you know, Mother So and So who was teaching that class.  It was totally different.  I was just a number.  I was just, you know, that's it.  I was just a number.  And, but when I got to L.A. High [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California], I was very much a militant.  I had the, one of the biggest, largest Afros on campus.  I was very much involved in the Black Student Union [at California State College at Los Angeles; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  I was--I knew Ron Karenga.  He gave me my Swahili name.
Speaker 1: What was your Swahili name?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, you're ask- Kimachu.  And I was very much a militant.  I would, I would be at parties with the--where the Black Panthers would come into the party.  And I, I was, I was okay with that.  I didn't have a problem with that, until one day one of them came in shot.  And I realized you can't do this anymore (laughter).  But I very involved in the black student unit and--union, and so, consequently, I never pledged a sorority, because to me that wasn't what I was about at that time.
Speaker 1: So this was a time really of a lot of tum- tum- tumultuous times.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Was [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis--'cause I know she told a story.  And she, she was talking about how they called the Black Panther Party there the Pink Panther Party, 'cause--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there were women, you know, involved in, in the party.
Speaker 2: Very much so.  Now I wasn't involved in the Black Panther Party.  I was just involved in the Black Student Union on--
Speaker 1: So what were--
Speaker 2: --campus.
Speaker 1: --what were you, what were advocating for as part of the Black Student Union?
Speaker 2: Well, equal rights, pretty much.  I mean, we had not received what we felt was equal rights.  I mean, we were still struggling for jobs, struggling for an education, struggling for scholarships.  So that's what, that really was what it was about.
Speaker 1: And this--[HistoryMaker] Maulana Karenga, he was coming into his own too, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Had he founded Kwanzaa at that point?  He hadn't started Kwanzaa.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think that came after.
Speaker 1: That came later, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right.  Were there other people's names that we might know who were active in that period that, you know, in the, in the community and things like that?
Speaker 2: You would have to call upon my memory, and I just--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --I'd have to go back and try and see if I could remember some of that.
Speaker 1: So now--
Speaker 2: That's a long time ago.
Story_ID: 652153
Speaker 1: You go and get your assoc- you know, junior (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --college [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then you go on to--
Speaker 2: I go on to, at that time it was called Cal State, L.A. [California State College at Los Angeles].  Now it's called California State University--
Speaker 1: University.
Speaker 2: --Los Angeles [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], but it was Cal State, L.A.  They called it C-A-L State at the time, so I attended Cal State.  I didn't finish because I just couldn't afford to finish.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And an opportunity came to me to become a flight attendant for United Airlines.
Speaker 1: Well, this was a big deal 'cause--
Speaker 2: That was a big deal.
Speaker 1: Huge--
Speaker 2: Huge deal.
Speaker 1: --because that's a different time period that we're talking about, and to be a flight attendant to had to have a certain look.  You had to--I mean, it, it had status.
Speaker 2: It had status.  At that time, they were interviewing thousands of people, and very few were selected.  I was interviewed.  I was selected.  I was very excited about it.  I was single.  I mean, why not?  I could see the world, maybe go back to school and finish my degree.  So I, I went to, to their school, which was in Chicago [Illinois], to the training and trained to be a flight attendant.  I became a flight attendant for United Airlines in 1972.
Speaker 1: So where are, where is your--where are you flying?  What is your route?
Speaker 2: At that time I was based in Chicago, and I was flying reserve.  And I was a junior flight attendant.  And as a junior flight attendant you flew reserve, so basically you were on call.  So they would call you X number of hours before the flight, and they would give you the schedule: "This is what you're doing."  Pack your bag, and you would go.  And you had certain days off, but the rest of the time you were on call.
Speaker 1: And so was--you know, 'cause now people bunk up in places.  Was that happening, that you--several people were sharing an apartment?
Speaker 2: Well, when we finished flight attendant training, we had a choice of several domiciles: Chicago, Newark [New Jersey], New York [New York], Washington, D.C.  It was really those four.  California wasn't open, Los Angeles, nothing on the West Coast.  So, I said to myself I'm already in Chicago for training.  I had a car that I had purchased myself.  My father [Charles Ricard, Sr.] helped me slightly.  But if I wanted a car, I had to buy it myself.  So my father helped me buy my first car.  So when I got the job with United, I drove my car.  Someone helped me.  Someone helped me drive from L.A. to Chicago so I could have my car.  So I decided that I was going to remain in Chicago 'cause I could have my car there, and because if I were in New York, my car payment would be as much as what I had to pay for parking (laughter) in New York or Newark or Washington, D.C., because the, the lifestyle was totally different.  I mean, the friends that have that lived in New York, there were five to a studio.  We were--we stayed in Chicago.  We lived in the suburbs.  They were three to a three bedroom apartment.  So, of course, we were--my salary was like $550 a month (laughter).  And I had two roommates.  But as soon as I could transfer back to California, I did.
Speaker 1: Oh, you did?
Speaker 2: I did, I transferred back to Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: So how long did that--if you start in 1972, when did you transfer?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Two--oh, so nine- by 1974 you're back?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And are you then perma- you know, 'cause they have this--so you, you moved up to (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --from, from--you got--you left being reserved--
Speaker 2: No.  I was even more reserve, because now I'm at a very senior domicile in Los Angeles.  I'm still on reserve.
Speaker 1: I see.  And how long did that last then, Tina [HistoryMaker Tina Lewis]?
Speaker 2: I quit when I was still on reserve.  I was five years and I was on reserve.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's interesting that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they would do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They--I mean there was no choice.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, because they had--they were filled up, okay.
Story_ID: 652154
Speaker 1: I don't really, really want to mention any name, but I was really dating a very prominent physician in Chicago [Illinois].  And he had not asked me to marry him.  And so I said, "Well, you know, I'm gonna go home."  And he didn't say, "Don't go home," so I did.  I transferred back to Los Angeles [California].  And after I moved back to Los Angeles, then he asked me to marry him.  So, I said yes, and we had planned a wedding.  And he started cheating on me, and I discovered that, and I called it off.  So, because you know, I don't--how do you, how do you remain a flight attendant and have a husband that you know had a, had a lifestyle of cheating on you before you were married?  Why would you continue that?  Just because he's a physician a lot of friends really could not understand me doing that, because you're--this is what you're giving up.  Well, it never was about the money for me.  So, I broke up with him and met someone who was much better for me.
Speaker 2: So you met Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] then.
Speaker 1: I met Harold.
Speaker 2: So how did you meet Harold then?
Speaker 1: I was actually--it's really interesting because I had actually met Harold bef- he had a party, a birthday party for himself.  And a girlfriend of mine was invited to his party.  And she said, "Why don't you come and go to this party with me?"  And I said, "Okay."  So I went to this party with her, and he opened the door.  It was at the Century Plaza Hotel [Los Angeles, California].  He opened the door.  I met him.  And I remember her saying to her--to him, "We're not gonna be able to stay long because we're meeting some people across the street at the Playboy Club."  So you know, I was with her.  So you know, we stayed a little while.  He asked me to dance.  He asked me for my telephone number, and he never called me.  A year later, a year later, I was standing in front of another girlfriend's house getting ready to get in my car, and he drove by.  And I said, "Oh, I know that guy," and I waved.  And he turned around and came back, and he asked me out.  And that was the beginning.
Speaker 2: And that was--and how long did you date?
Speaker 1: You, you really want to know that?  Three months.
Speaker 2: And you married?  Oh, that's, wow.
Speaker 1: We dated for three months, and we have been married thirty-nine years.
Speaker 2: That is wonderful; that's wonderful.  So, what, what appealed to you about him?
Speaker 1: His (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because wait.  Wasn't he working--
Speaker 1: What really appealed to me was the relationship with his mother [Betty Cabell Golder].  I really admired that.  And I've always, I, I, I say to my daughter [Jennifer Lewis], "Look at a man's relationship with his mother, and that tells you a lot about his character."  His father [Harold Lewis, Sr.] died when he was very young.  His father wa- I think Harold was six or seven, and his father was thirty-seven.  So his mother pretty much raised him as a single parent.  He had a very great relationship with his mother.
Speaker 2: So you, so you get married.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then your--now where is he working?
Speaker 1: United Airlines.
Speaker 2: That's what I thought.  That's--okay, so he's working--so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I told you we went to the same high school [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California]; we didn't meet.  We went to Los Angeles City College [Los Angeles, California]; we didn't meet.  We went to Cal State, L.A. [California State College at Los Angeles; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], and we didn't meet.  His family knew my family knew my family, and we didn't meet.  We work- he worked at United at the same time, hired the same year I was hired; we did not meet.  I met him at his birthday party.
Story_ID: 652155
Speaker 1: So you're both--but had you stopped working at United [United Airlines]--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --at that point?  So you're both working at United.
Speaker 2: We're both working at United.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you quit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We le- we were--okay, he was in management.  I was a flight attendant.  The mechanics go on strike.  So I'm on unemployment, and he's on half salary, guarding airplanes at night on the, on the, on the--
Speaker 1: Runway.
Speaker 2: --on the runway, exactly.  And we just said to each other, "We can't do this.  We can't have a mortgage and two car payments, and I have unemployment, and you're on half salary.  So you're in management, so I'm leaving."  So I decided I was gonna pursue a career in sales, outside sales.  And I wanted pharmaceutical sales is really what I wanted.  But they would not hire me because I didn't have a background in pharmaceutical sales.  Now I had a background in biology and the courses that I took in college, but that wasn't significant enough.  So I went to work in an industry that was terrible for me, but I needed to get the background.  I went to work for Brown and Williamson Tobacco [Brown and Williamson Tobacco Company], cigarettes.  So I worked for them for six months to get that background and to get that on my resume so I could go to work in a pharmaceutical company, and so I did.  I went to work for Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical [Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical Company].  That was the first one that I worked for.
Speaker 1: Now, pharmaceutical sales, I don't know the history of it, but there, there's a lot of activity.  Those were good jobs.
Speaker 2: Very good jobs, very good jobs for, for African American women especially.  I worked for them for a short period of time before I left, and I went to work for McNeil lab [McNeil-PPC Inc.], which is huge.  You know, they're Tylenol.  You know, they're the makers of Tylenol.
Speaker 1: So when you were doing those jobs, you're in your car.  You're doing--you, you're visiting--you're developing relationships with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) With physicians--
Speaker 1: --physicians.  Yeah, my sister was a, a pharmaceutical salesperson.  So this is 1974, '5 [1975] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we got married in '74 [1974], and I quit shortly after that.  I--let's see, '72 [1972], '3 [1973], '4 [1974], '5 [1975], '6 [1976], so '76 [1976] is when I left United; and I went to work for Warner-Lambert.
Story_ID: 652156
Speaker 1: There was a job that came up between McNeil [McNeil-PPC Inc.] that was offered to me.  We had our first child in 1977, Jeremy [Jeremy Lewis], three years after we were married.  Was he born?  Yeah, he was born in '77 [1977].  We were married in '74 [1974].  And I, I, I had a Long Beach, California, territory, so it was quite a drive for me to go into that territory.  And I had to have someone to ca- take care of Jeremy while I was at work.  So I got a call from a friend who, with Continental [Continental Airlines], who told me that Continental was looking for an instructor of flight attendants.  And I applied, and they hired me.  So I went to work for Continental as an instructor of flight attendants.  I wrote programming.  We did the videos that were shown on the, on the flights.  We taught classes, initial and recurrent.  And recurrent classes are the courses that flight attendants have to go back through every six months to stay current with FAA [Federal Aviation Administration].  We--Continental also owned Air Micronesia, so we had to go to Air Micronesia to train flight attendants there.  So we wrote programming; I wrote programming; did training; we did hijack training, how to handle hijackings, because that was happening at that time.  And then Continental got taken over by Texas International [Texas International Airlines], and everybody in the department got laid off but me.  There were five instructors.  I was the second most junior.  I never understood why they kept me, but they kept me.  I felt it was productivity.  I'd like to believe that it was productivity.  But I was retained with the manager of the department, so there are two of us in the training department now.  She decides she's gonna get married, and she's gonna leave.  Well, her job is gonna become available, right?  Who's left in the department?  Me.  Why shouldn't I have that position?  I interviewed.  I wasn't hired.  They brought in a white male and asked me to train him.  "We're counting on you to train him."  Lawsuit, big time, I didn't do it though.  Harold [Lewis' husband, HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] and I sat down and decided that we were just gonna take control of our own destiny.
Speaker 2: At that point in time you decide that was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We decided we weren't working for anyone anymore.  And so we started doing our research.  We--he was gonna leave United [United Airlines], and I, and I was gonna leave Continental.  So we started--
Speaker 2: This is 1977?
Speaker 1: This is--oh, god, what year did we start?  This is nineteen seventy--is it '9 [1979]?  Harold's gonna be better at telling you, '79 [1979], '80 [1980], 1980.  This is 1979, 1980, somewhere right there.
Story_ID: 652157
Speaker 1: Well, I have '82 [1982] that you--the Speedy--
Speaker 2: Sir Speedy printing [Sir Speedy, Inc.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the Speedy.
Speaker 2: But this is when we're having this dialogue.
Speaker 1: This, this, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So this is like 1980, 1981 we're gonna figure out where we're--what we're gonna do here.  So we started doing our research on franchises.  We looked at McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation].  We looked at, we looked at everything, couldn't afford it.  We couldn't afford McDonald's.  So we looked at a business called Sir Speedy printing, and we decided we were gonna do Sir Speedy printing.  And we applied for an SBA [U.S. Small Business Administration] loan.  Sixty thousand dollars is what we were--we had a home.  We had jobs.  Wait, I gotta back up here, because chronologically I'm off.  No, no, no, I was--I'd left Brown and Williamson [Brown and Williamson Tobacco Company].  I went to Continental [Continental Airlines].  I left Continental, and I went to McNeil labs [McNeil-PPC Inc.].
Speaker 1: Oh, I see, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I left Continental.  I, I left when they decided they were going to bring in--
Speaker 1: And then you went back into the pharmaceutical--
Speaker 2: I went into pharmaceutical--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with McNeil lab.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, but we had already started doing our research and our planning.  So we looked at Sir Speedy printing, and we decided we were gonna do Sir Speedy printing.  And--no, I'm off.  I'm real off.  What--I call what I have is chemo [chemotherapy] brain.  You know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --after you have chemo so many times, I, I get short circuited--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and some of my--in some of the order.  McNeil lab came after Sir Speedy printing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I left--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause you're still--you, you have to--'cause things take time to get together.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So we do Sir Speedy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you're smart because you didn't--right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So we leave Sir Speedy.  We, we o- we look at Sir Speedy printing, and we open up this business.
Speaker 1: And where do you open it at?
Speaker 2: Near the airport, LAX [Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California], right on Sepulveda [Boulevard].  Back then there was Braniff [Braniff Airways, Inc.] and Western [Western Airlines] and PSA [PSA Airlines] and Continental and all the rent-a-car businesses and all the airlines.  And where did we come from?  The airline industry, right?  So, and what kind of background did I have?  And it's sales, outside sales.  So we opened up this what could have been a mom and pop printing business, but we turned it into something different.  And we decided that we were going to build this business.  And not that we were gonna build it.  We didn't really have this long term goal of building it and doing something else, but that's what we ended up doing.  So, I did outside sales.  So I went out, and I--we were doing Western's printing.  We were doing Burlington Nor- [Burlington Northern Railroad] I went out and got all these contracts.  I would start at one building high rise, and I would cold call on every floor, and I would go to the next building.  And I would start at the top, and I would cold call on every building until we built that business.  And I even called on the Olympic Organizing Committee.  The Olympics [1984 Summer Olympics] were coming to California, to Los Angeles, in 1984, but they were organized at that time.  I would cold call on them every single day.  And one day I was sitting in the lobby waiting to ask if they had anything for me.  And someone came out and said, "Printing, right?"  And I said, "Yes."  And she said, "I have a job; can you do this?"  And I said, "Absolutely."  And I remember taking it back to Harold [Lewis' husband, HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] in the office and saying, "What in the hell do we do with this," because I knew we couldn't do it.  But I wasn't gonna tell them that.  We subcontracted the job out.  And we got an Olympic contract.  We were doing printing for the Olympic Organizing Committee before the Olympics, during the Olympics, after the Olympics, and conden- continued to do work for Peter Uer- Ueberroth [Peter Ueberroth] when he went to the baseball commission [Major League Baseball].  So it was a little mom and pop printing business that we turned into a business that we could sell.
Story_ID: 652158
Speaker 1: Five thousand dollars.  You know what (laughter)?  Now we're, you know, multimillion dollar business that we have.  But our goals were--you know, we, we kind of increased our goal as we accomplished one.  We just kind of grew with it.  And when we decided to go back and take another stab at McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation], we applied be- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because of ma- now let's go back to Sir Speedy [Sir Speedy, Inc.].  At that point in time, the entry into a franchise was how much?
Speaker 1: Remember I told you we applied for a SBA [U.S. Small Business Administration] loan for sixty thousand dollars?  They turned us down, okay.  Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] will have to tell you his story.  But Harold had a dear friend who was in the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] administration who used to work at United who he befriended at United Airlines.  And when we got turned down for this SBA loan, Harold called Mel [ph.], who worked for Reagan, and told him what had happened and how the SBA wouldn't even talk to us about this, this secured sixty thousand dollar loan.  So basically, el- Mel made a call to SBA, and they called us and approved the loan.  And we got the sixty thousand dollar loan to do this franchise.  And I don't remember how much it cost.  Harold, he might remember.  But we had some working capital.  And I did outside sales.  Harold did inside.  We had pressmen, but Harold also knew how to run the press.  He taught himself, because if anybody walked out that door and said they weren't gonna work for us, our business wasn't gonna die.  He knew what to do on the inside.  And I was always the front person.  They all knew me.  You know, the buyers knew me.  And he, Harold thought--he was a very smart businessman, because he said, "You know, Tina [HistoryMaker Tina Lewis], they're gonna remember you before they remember me," (laughter).  So even though he had sales in his background, I was the front person.  I mean, there are people that came--there were people that came in to, to, to bring checks in to pay, you know, their accounts receivable and give the check to him, and they would say, "Will you be sure Mrs. Lewis gets this?"  And he would say, "Yes."  In fact, there was one buyer who was attracted to me.  So one day Harold made a delivery to him, and the guy said, "That Tina Lewis is, is really nice looking."  And he said, "Yes."  He said, "Are you related?"  And Harold said, "Yeah," said, "Are you married to her?"  And he goes, "Yes." "Oh," (laughter).  So, you know, when you're in sales, the first thing you sell is yourself when you get through the front door.  That's what I was taught in all the selling courses that I was given when I was in pharmaceutical.  The first thing you sell is yourself you--when you walk in the door, you know, your, your character, you know, how you present yourself, you know, the, the rapport that you establish before you even get into, you know, you know, what your product will do for them.  So, that was Sir Speedy.
Speaker 2: And you had looked at a franchi- McDonald's you said at the beginning.
Speaker 1: We couldn't afford it.
Speaker 2: But it's, it's--what, a typical McDonald's franchise, what, a quarter of a million [dollars] at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Back then it was a quarter of a million (laughter).  It's not that anymore.  It's more like a half a million, upwards of a half a million (laughter).
Story_ID: 652159
Speaker 1: So at this point, it's nine- so 1982.  But you're still--you do s- you still--at some point, you still have your job, and then you decide you're going to--
Speaker 2: What happened was when we sold Sir Speedy [Sir Speedy, Inc.], we had to have an income source because the way Mc- we applied for McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation].  We were accepted, okay.  Harold [Lewis' husband, HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] was training full time.  And--
Speaker 1: 'Cause how long is their training program?
Speaker 2: Well, it varies.  Harold completed it in ten months.  He might have the record.  But McDonald's encourages you not to give up your jobs, not to quit your jobs because there's no guarantee.  There's no guarantee that you will be sold a franchise, even though you're training, even though you've been accepted.  They also tell you--at that time they told us to forget California.  We needed to select three ge- geographic areas of the country that we would be willing to relocate to other than Southern California, not, not--no opportunities.  So I, I don't remember.  We didn't want to go to any cold states.  I just remember that.  So, we were in training.  He's training full time.  I get a job with McNeil lab [McNeil-PPC Inc.], so we have an income stream.  I also get a job with the Sugar Ray Robinson Youth Foundation [Los Angeles, California] doing fundraising.  So I'm working two jobs so that we do not go through the money from the sale of our restaurant.  Also--
Speaker 1: You mean not restaurant, the--
Speaker 2: I mean the sale of our (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sir Speedy.
Speaker 2: --printing business.  Also, we were gonna have to sell our home.  So we needed that plus the sale of the, of the Sir Speedy to buy our first restaurant.  Harold is--has not given up his position at United [United Airlines].  He has taken--he has gone back to his last non-management job with United, was in reservations.  When United hired him, they hired him in reservations first.  Then they moved him to sales, because he had to come in an entry level.  But they hired him really for sales, but he had to go into res to be promoted inwards.  But when--he was in HR [human resources] when he went back to his last non-management position.  So he was working in reservations, training full time.  And I'm working two jobs, and we have a child [Jeremy Lewis], so that we could do McDonald's.  And you know, people look at us today and say, you know, "You really are lucky."  No, we're blessed.  And the harder we have worked, you know, the luckier, the more blessed we became.  But we paid a lot of dues to get in to McDonald's.
Speaker 1: See, 'cause people don't realize that a lot of times.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They think things come so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lot of sacrifice.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) so you, but you could see it--
Speaker 2: We could see it.
Speaker 1: You could see it.  And then I want to talk about also the time, because Bill Bradley, he's mayor, right?  Is he mayor?
Speaker 2: Not Bill Bradley, Tom Bradley.
Speaker 1: Tom Bradley, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tom Bradley (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tom Bradley's the mayor.
Speaker 1: Tom Bradley.
Speaker 2: I don't know him personally.  We weren't really in politics.
Speaker 1: Yes, at the--okay.
Speaker 2: I wasn't in, into any social organizations at the time, I wasn't in The Links [The Links, Incorporated].  I wasn't in, you know--
Speaker 1: You were working.
Speaker 2: I--exactly (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were working.
Speaker 2: I was working.
Story_ID: 652160
Speaker 1: How do you start learning--you know, the other question I have for you is, there--you know, there are different types of franchises.  So why had you looked at the other popular type of franchises--I don't know the buy in--are auto dealerships.  And I, you know, when I was doing your research, I was wondering did they ever look at an auto dealership, or is that way, way, way more expensive?  I don't know that.
Speaker 2: We have, we had a little bit of background in the industry, in auto industry, in that Harold's first cousin's husband had an auto industry, and he lost it.  I mean, that's a very difficult industry.  And you know, if you look at the economy, that the, the phase that we just went through where all the injured--all those dealerships closed, thank you, Jesus, we didn't do that, because you know, they were hit heavy, heavy, heavy.  But I will tell you that we looked--in the middle of being accepted into McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation], we had second thoughts about McDonald's because they didn't want Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] to train full time.  And that was a big thing with us because we could do it.  And so Harold said you know, "I'm gonna take a look at--let's take a look at Burger King."  So we both went; we went, interviewed with Burger King.  He had started some training at Burger King.  Burger King had offered us a restaurant in Los Angeles [California].  We wouldn't have to relocate, wouldn't have to move, didn't have to sell our home.  We were in the middle of that when we--Harold said to me, "Tina [HistoryMaker Tina Lewis], Burger King just does not feel right to me.  We--I don't, I, I don't like this.  But how are we gonna go back to McDonald's with our tails between our legs and say, you know, we, we have second thoughts?  We, we really want to, we really want to do McDonald's.  What do we do?"  We get a phone call from a friend who worked with Harold's mother [Betty Cabell Golder] at United [United Airlines] that knew us very, very well and knew our background.  Norman Lear wrote a lot of programming for television.  And they brought in a lot of consultants for programming.  And they were doing a pilot called 'Full House.'  The original 'Full House' that they wanted to do, this pilot, was a black family with--what's Whitfield's first name?
Speaker 1: Lynn?  No.  Lynn Whitfield.  No.
Speaker 2: No, the male Whitfield.
Speaker 1: Lynn--Norm?  I don't--
Speaker 2: Might be.  Norman Whitfield, exactly.  I think that's his name.  He played the father, and there were several other black actors involved in this pilot.  But the bottom line is, long story short, without going into who those characters were, the husband wa- worked for the airline, and the wife worked for the airline.  And they needed a husband and wife with airline background to consult on this pilot.  Guess who were the consultants?  Harold and I, so they bring us in.  I mean, this was big money too.  It was a hundred dollars an hour to consult on this pilot.  So we're down at--I don't know if it was Universal [Universal Television], where we were, consulting on this pilot.  They also brought in a black psychologist named Hiawatha Harris to consult.  And we're in the lun- in the mess hall at lunchtime, and he says to us, when he found out what we did, "Have you ever considered the fast food industry?"  We've never said anything to him about going to McDonald's, going to Burger King, having second thoughts, wanting to go back to McDonald's.
Story_ID: 652161
Speaker 1: This is the psychiatrist, Hiawatha [Hiawatha Harris] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, who says, "Have you ever thought of the fast food business?"  And this was after we told him what we were doing with the business, franchise, the printing business. But he didn't know anything else about us, right.  So Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] tells him our dilemma, and he says, "Well, as luck would have it, I have a friend of mine who is a very high executive in McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation].  He's going to be at my house Tuesday for dinner.  Why don't you guys come?"  So we said, "Okay."  So we go to his house on Tuesday for dinner, and who do we meet but this regional vice president, African American, [HistoryMaker] Reginald Webb.  So we have dinner with him.  We tell him our story, and guess what.  He made it happen.  So he set it up for us to go back to McDonald's.  We thought we were all ready.  Here we are ready to have our second interview.  And the guy says, Randy Vest says, "No, Mr. Webb says whatever you want.  You can train full time."  'Cause that's all we wanted.  We wanted to train full time, because if we trained part time, how long am I gonna have to work these two jobs?  And Harold's gonna have to train full time and work in res [reservations].  And you know, we could do it.  You know, we had the ability to do it, and train full time, and get through it so we can, you know, start.  So, our first offer from McDonald's was in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  We--at that time, I believe McDonald's was interviewing one out of a thousand applicants to bring into the program.  It was very difficult to get into McDonald's.  So we'd have these quarterly meetings of all the applicants that were training.  And after one of the meetings--and they would just keep us up to date and what was going on at McDonald's.  And you know, we would meet, you know, different people at different levels of McDonald's.  So the zone manager, the guy that basically determined your destiny franchising, he would actually offer you the deals.  He offered us--he said, "I want to see you and Tina [HistoryMaker Tina Lewis] after the meeting."  So I said, "Harold, he's gonna offer us a restaurant."  Sure enough, he offers us Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  'Cause he knew I was from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he thought I was trying to get back south.  So Harold says, he goes, "How do we turn this down being politically correct?"  'Cause we didn't want to go to Arkansas.  So Harold--there was no Googling at that time.  We didn't have laptops.  You know, you didn't have computers that you could go to and look up this and that.  So we went to the library and decided we were gonna do some research on Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  And when we looked at the map and we saw a colored--no, Black River and White River, we said, "You know what?  We know where the blacks folks are," (laughter), and we were joking amongst ourselves, of course.  But we--it was not a very good opportunity for growth.  And so that was going to be our reason that we were gonna turn it down, because you couldn't just say, you know, "Hell no, I don't want to go there," because you know, you're gonna get a red mark next to your name.  And you wouldn't get another opportunity, because this man is controlling your destiny.  And so he called us one day.  And we were gonna tell him exactly why this was not a good opportunity for us to raise our son [Jeremy Lewis] there when he said, "Forget that.  I want you to go to San Diego [California].  There's not an opportunity there, but Mr. Zardonic [ph.] wants to meet you."  So we're driving from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] to San Diego, and I tell Harold, I said, "Harold, it's a restaurant, and it's brand new."  He said, "No, Tina.  Randy said there's no store there.  There's no restaurant there."  I said, "Yes, there is."  So we get in the interview.  What it was, the regional manager wanted to decide who he wanted to give that restaurant to, not the zone manager, not the licensing manager.  He wanted to meet us, interview us, and make the decision if he was gonna offer it.  So we sat there.  We interviewed, which we thought we were having dialogue, but we were being interviewed.  So he off--he said, "There is a, a restaurant, and it's on the corner of Federal [Boulevard] and Euclid [Avenue].  It's a very high risk area.  We need you to go and look at it."  So we said, "Okay."  We drove to the corner of Federal and Euclid.  We sat on the curb and laughed hysterically, because my husband grew up in South Central (laughter) L.A. [South Central, Los Angeles, California].  I mean, that's rough area.  This was not rough area.  So, that was our first restaurant that we built from the ground up.
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful story.
Speaker 2: Sold everything we had to build (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To build--to--
Speaker 2: --build that first restaurant.
Speaker 1: So wait, did you--the restaurant wasn't built?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.  So, he--this was a new location--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, okay.
Story_ID: 652162
Speaker 1: I wanna ask a couple of things about that, but I want to go back to Reggie Webb [HistoryMaker Reginald Webb] because we actually interviewed him.  And at this point in time that you're talking to him, he actually is--was he--he had a position, right?  Was he--he wa- was he the chairman?  I don't know if he was chairman of the--
Speaker 2: NBMOA [National Black McDonald's Operators Association]?  No, not at the time.
Speaker 1: He wasn't.  So--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But at MOA--but at this--
Speaker 2: Because he worked for the corporation.  You couldn't be the chairman of the black owners association.
Speaker 1: I see.  But he, then he--what was his role then?  He worked--he was--how about the National Leadership Council?  No, he didn't play that role either?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, because he was, he would work for the corporation [McDonald's Corporation].
Speaker 1: I see.  And then later he went.
Speaker 2: He left and became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And became--
Speaker 2: --an owner-operator.
Speaker 1: I see.  That was--
Speaker 2: He became an owner-operator the year after--trying to think--before we were licensed (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I just--
Speaker 2: Might have been almost simultaneous.
Speaker 1: Right, because I'm telling you, he--you, you--oh, I see.  This is out of order, okay, okay, never mind.  Okay, you're right.
Speaker 2: It was pretty close to the same time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: We're dear friends.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 652163
Speaker 1: So tell me what McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] looked--what, what was the training you got?  And what do they look for in an owner-operator?  What were they looking for?  Because in many ways, you know, McDonald's, if you got there, you could make mon- I--the perception was that you could make money, right?
Speaker 2: We are the largest group of African American millionaires, the black owner-operators [National Black McDonald's Operators Association], the, of African American millionaires, long- largest group.  We, we didn't even think about that.  We had no knowledge of that (laughter) at the time, you know, when we were applying for McDonald's.  We were looking at an opportunity to grow and take care of our family.  That's what we were looking for.  Your question was though what did McDonald's look like at the time?
Speaker 1: No.  What do they look for?
Speaker 2: What do they look for?
Speaker 1: What do you they look for?  Then I want to go back to your first restaurant [in San Diego, California].
Speaker 2: Well, I--they might look for different things, depending on whether or not it's a single individual that's coming before them versus a couple.  I think what they looked at us that we'd owned and operated a business [Sir Speedy, Inc.] prior to McDonald's.  We work together as a team.  We had a concept of what giving back meant.  And I think that's very significant in McDonald's.  You know, McDonald's founder, Ray Kroc, feels that his philosophy is none of us is as good as, as all of us, and it's very important to give back to the communities that we serve.  And that's very much engraved in especially the African American owner-operators.  We give back to our communi- communities, probably more so than our white counterparts.
Story_ID: 652164
Speaker 1: So you get this chance.  So what is the ride back home like then?  Do you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The ride back, scary (laughter).  I mean, we were a little nervous about it.  And then I will tell you something that was really frightening.  But I, I'm always, I always see the glass as half full.  I'm that kind of person.  I'm very much an optimist, a very much a, an optimistic person.  Something happened to us during this transition.  Our house fell out of escrow.  And we needed, we needed the money from our house and from Sir Speedy [Sir Speedy, Inc.] to buy our restaurant, okay.  House falls out of escrow, so I'm saying to Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis], "It's okay, honey; it's gonna work out; it's going to work out."  So, sure enough, a doctor who had looked at our home went to Europe, came back, found out it was in escrow.  So our realtor, who was actually Harold's uncle, called him and said, "The Lewis' home has fallen out of escrow.  Are you still interested?"  "Yes."  So it went right back into escrow, house sold.  So Harold is actually gone--at HU, right.  He's coming back from Hamburger University [Oak Brook, Illinois].  I did not get to go through training at the same time he did because I'm working two jobs.  He's training and working one job.  So he's doing the McDonald's training.  McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] requires you to finish your Hamburger University training, which is accredited by New York, NYU [New York University, New York, New York], so it's college accredited training.  But his mother [Betty Cabell Golder] is dying of breast cancer at the same time, so it's bittersweet.  So he calls me.  He's finishing his training.  He calls me.  He's getting ready to come home.  I'm telling him, "Go straight to Indianapolis [Indiana].  Mom's not doing well.  Don't come home.  Go straight there."  So he goes to Indianapolis.  She is dying.  He stays a week.  He comes home.  I go back; I stay a week.  He goes back; he stays a week.  We're doing this (gesture), until we couldn't do that anymore because it was time for us to physically move to San Diego [California].  But his mother passes.  And so everything stops, of course, and we go back for the funeral.  And we have a service there.  We have a service in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] where she's buried in L.A.  We bury his mother one day; we are actually on the land where we're getting ready to build our restaurant, with a shovel, turning the dirt, the next day.  I kid you not.  The following day we're breaking ground.  So for him, for both of us, it was bittersweet.  You know, we, we had all this joy and excitement going at the same time his mother passes.
Speaker 1: And his mother had been significant in his--
Speaker 2: Very significant, 'cause remember, his father [Harold Lewis, Sr.] died when he was very young.  She didn't remarry until he was fifteen years old.  So, at the time, she, she had since divorced her second husband and had married a bishop in the Pentecostal church in Indianapolis, so--Bishop Golder.  She was married to Bishop Morris Golder.  And that was a, a very difficult time for us.  And you know, I'm sure he'll tell you, he tells me all the time, that, you know--I tell him he was my rock when I was going through my issues, but I was his rock, 'cause I kept telling him that we could get through it, you know.  His mother knew about the dream.  She knew about the restaurant because I had taken all the plans and the decor, 'cause I did all the decor and all the fabrics and the layout, and she got to see everything.  And when one of the times when I was there with her one on one, she said to me, "Tina [HistoryMaker Tina Lewis], you have to promise me that no matter what happens to me, that you don't let anything happen to what you guys have to do."  And she made me promise that I was gonna make sure that we carried through, and it was going to happen.  So, I think that is one of Harold's biggest drives, that.  And his biggest disappointments is that his mother really never got to see our success unlike my parents [Mary LeDuff Ricard and Charles Ricard, Sr.]; they did.  My parents lived to see--
Speaker 1: Your success (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the success.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because that means a lot--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, to, to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to do that.
Story_ID: 652165
Speaker 1: So how was the building of the first store?  How does that, how long does that take?  And I mean, you say you're breaking ground the next day, so how long does the, it take from the time that you--
Speaker 2: Let's see, we broke ground in September, and we opened in February.
Speaker 1: That's, that's quick.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So staffing, 'cause it's a thing when you have to manage staff.  You had not--
Speaker 2: We have to hire staff from ground up.  That's interview- viewing at a construction site, exactly.  That's running the ads, interviewing on site.  I got to select all the decor, you know, the, the colors, everything, the layout.  It's, it was very exciting, you know, to walk through and be--I was--we were on site every day.  I can remember McDonald's Corporation wanting us to fence in the property because it was such a bad area [in San Diego, California].  And we said no.  We're not sending that signal to this community.  We're gonna be a part of this community from, from day one.  And we're gonna have African American art on the walls of our restaurant.  And it's going to be the community's restaurant.  And remember, we're talking about a time when we had Crips and Bloods working in, you know, living in the same vicinity of our restaurant.  We had a restaurant in the heart of all that, that was protected.  That community were--they endeared us from the very beginni- beginning.  They embraced us.  We became very involved in that community from, from the very beginning.  You know, we went--we were invited to homes of different community leaders and introduced.  It was, it was exciting.  You know, they welcomed us and protected us.  And we had customers that told other customers if they were messing up, "You don't mess up in this restaurant," (laughter).  So, it was it, it--we had a lot of ownership.  That was our first baby.  Now that was difficult for us to--when we sold and relocated, that was hard to do.
Speaker 1: Because that was--that's how you guys (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we built--
Speaker 1: --started it.
Speaker 2: That's how we started.
Story_ID: 652166
Speaker 1: We have.  And you know, I'm sure you've spoken to people that have talked about the parity agreement.  You know, there was a group of us that, and I wasn't a part of that, but a group of owner-operators came together.  I think there was eighteen of them that came together and wanted equality, parity for African Americans.  So we wanted equality in terms of number of restaurants, number--amount of cash flow.  There was things on the table that we had to have equal to our counterparts, 'cause remember--well, not remember, but you wouldn't know this--but we, we didn't become owner, owner-operators until something like 1956 with Herman Petty.  He was the very first owner-operator.  And when they opened up his restaurant, they just kind of put him in there and left him there.  And what about in New York [New York], Lee Dunham [Robert Lee Dunham]?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Did you interview Lee?
Speaker 2: No, we haven't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, Linda [Linda Dunham] is still living--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --his wife.
Speaker 2: 'Cause we were--we really tried to do Herman Petty and didn't have luck.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I know that we're going to be doing Roland Jones.  You know, we've done Willie Wilson [HistoryMaker Willie L. Wilson].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But you know, Herman Petty we couldn't get.  And there was another I'll tell you in Chicago [Illinois], 'cause the early days, and I don't know--
Speaker 1: The early days, yeah.
Speaker 2: --of that, you know, involved people like Sherman Claypool.  We've done [HistoryMaker] Wayne Embry, but he has a lot of other things he did.  Wimp, Ed Wimp [Edward Wimp], we could not get him to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wow.
Speaker 2: --you know, to do it.  So those were, those are, these are the precursors to you--
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.
Speaker 2: --coming in, right.
Story_ID: 652167
Speaker 1: You build your--you know, you opened--do you remember opening day?
Speaker 2: Remember opening day.  We had my father-in-law Bishop Golder [Morris Golder] there.  We had the mayor there that did rib- ribbon cutting, city councilman.  We had a black city councilman at the time.  I mean, it was a great day.  We had, we had the band from Lincoln High School [Abraham Lincoln High School, San Diego, California], which is, you know, the neighboring black high school, predominantly black high school, you know, marching band.  It was a great day, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And what are you learning?  'Cause you grew up in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  How is the--'cause San Diego's a different community, so how is the community different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very small African American community versus, you know, Los Angeles.  Eight percent of the population pretty much was African American.  Of course, I didn't know that at the time I relocated there.  But you know, we came very much involved in the African American community there, loved them all.  They're all dear friends of ours.  That was the hardest part about leaving San Diego [California].  We're back all the time.  We were there last--weekend before last.
Speaker 1: And really, as a McDonald's owner-operator, you become--you have to become part of the community.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what, what are the challenges or experiences that first year?
Speaker 2: The first year was we didn't have a lot of challenges.  It took off, doing--exceeded the projections of McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation].
Speaker 1: And so you were meeting projections right on--
Speaker 2: Right off, yeah.  The challenge came when we built our res- second restaurant.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It didn't heat--hit projections.  I don't still--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I don't know if it's hit projections today.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: A lemon (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Let me, let me, let me before--I want to ask what were your roles when this store opens?  Who's doing--you know, I understand that he [Lewis' husband, HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] went to the university [Hamburger University, Oak Brook, Illinois].  At some point you go to the university.  You don't, you didn't explain that.  But what are your roles in operating the business?
Speaker 2: The roles didn't change much from Sir Speedy [Sir Speedy, Inc.].  He was always operational, and I was always out front.  So I was the person that was very much involved in the politics of the city, very much involved in--I, I--he became also.  I mean, we both served on the mayor's advisory board.  He served on the stadium board.  When the Super Bowl came, I was on the Super Bowl Host Committee.  So we're very much involved in the politics of San Diego.  We're very much involved in community organizations within San Diego.  We got involved in the National Medical Association.  I was involved in that first with their me- Mickey Leland scholarship program [Mickey Leland Scholarship Fund], gave a very large donation to, to the National Medical Association for the Mickey Leland scholarship program.  We were honored by them.  Also, I was very instrumental in starting Gospelfest [McDonald's GospelFest], which I did several years in San Diego, chaired it, and it was a huge success.
Speaker 1: Now when had Gospelfest started when you, when you--
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-two [1992].  I did it '92 [1992], '93 [1993], and '94 [1994].
Speaker 1: I see, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 652168
Speaker 1: The first year--so the--everything sort of takes off is what you're saying.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Then what happens?  When do you decide you're going to have your second restaurant?
Speaker 2: We don't decide anything.  The corporation [McDonald's Corporation] decides what they're gonna award you based on your business review, your expandability.  That's how it works.  So we're awarded this store, and we're all excited.  You know, we're gonna do this grandiose interior, and it fails.
Speaker 1: So where, where's the store [in San Diego, California]?  So, give the location for the first store, and then--
Speaker 2: The, the first store is at Federal [Boulevard] and Euclid [Avenue], and the second one is on Jamacha [Road] and--I can't remember what the cross street is.  But it was a disaster, and we tried everything.  Because I was the person that did all the in store activities.  Like I did silent auctions on the parking lot to raise money for sickle cell at Federal and Euclid.  I did a lot of thing to raise money for organizations within our community.  So when we got to Jamacha I continued those kinds of things.  So we had have breakfast with Santa [Santa Claus], have, you know, lunch with the Easter Bunny.  We had classic car shows.  I was doing all this marketing activities, and it wasn't raising the needle.  We just could not get that restaurant to increase the revenue.  What we didn't know at the time, and real estate failed tremens- tremendously, is that when they negotiated the contract for the site, they didn't know that a median was gonna run straight down the middle of the street.  So anybody that was coming to our restaurant heading in one direction, they had to pass us, make a U turn in front of Jack in the Box, and come back to us.  What are the chances of that happening if you're on your way to work, and you need that cup of coffee to wake up?  So that was, that was huge.
Speaker 1: So was that a new store, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a brand new store that we built from the ground up.
Speaker 1: I--
Speaker 2: And it failed tremendously.
Speaker 1: I--
Speaker 2: So it took--
Speaker 1: Well, that's a, that's a hard hit because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was a hard hit, and it was literally gonna take us out of the system because it was taking the money from our first restaurant to keep this one going.  And so it was a huge sacrifice on our, on our part.
Speaker 1: But you're, you wanted--it's not like you were in charge of that either, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So what--
Speaker 2: And it wasn't like we weren't trying everything we could to make it a success.
Speaker 1: Now, how far were the restaurants from each other distance wise (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was, it was a long distance.
Speaker 1: It was--okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't--they weren't close at all.
Story_ID: 652169
Speaker 1: Now children wise, do you have--?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) We, (laughter) well, six months after we opened our first restaurant [for the McDonald's Corporation], I found out I was pregnant with twins (pause).  Yes, twins, boy [Jonathan Lewis] and girl [Jennifer Lewis].  I didn't think I could have any more kids, and God blessed us with a boy and a girl.  So my, my husband [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] got that girl that he wanted to be the daddy's girl, so he got his wish.  But yes, so we have three kids.
Speaker 1: So you're doing all of that then--
Speaker 2: And running a business.
Speaker 1: --and, and running a business.  So--
Speaker 2: Twins, yeah.
Speaker 1: So who's--what support do you have?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time I could afford to have a live in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I could afford to have twins, you know, with all the things--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --that come with twins (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So the--
Story_ID: 652170
Speaker 1: When you say the business was taking off, 'cause usually, if you put in a quarter of a million dollars, are those stores supposed to in time generate a million?  Was that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Our projection might have been 1.5 for that restaurant, and we were exceeding that.  But it wasn't a--
Speaker 1: You were or were not?
Speaker 2: We were, but it was not significant enough to carry this, this store that was failing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So but you were able to get support because you were doing better than you had done career wise to that point.
Speaker 2: Not the kind of support we needed.  So we kept going back to McDonald's Corporation, and finally we had a meeting with Jerry Newman [Gerald Newman].  And when we presented him a, a book this thick of all the marketing and every program and everything that we tried to do to increase the sales at that restaurant, he looked at it and said, "Well, this is not your fault; you've done everything in--humanly possible."  And McDonald's bought that store back from us.
Speaker 1: So they--was this typical that they would do--so it became a McDonald's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They so--ended up--
Speaker 1: --problem.
Speaker 2: --selling it to someone else for a dollar, which you know, it's, it's kind of a bitter and sweet, 'cause they could have done that to, with us, but you know, they didn't.  They sold it to someone else.  But you know, I, I, I'm still looking at the glass, you know, half full, because we grew in spite of that.  We pa- had been passed up for many opportunities.
Speaker 1: So wait a minute.  So, what year we--the reason--when I was saying support, I mean that you were making money on the first store--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and so you were able to have--you're li- your, your revenues are increasing, and you're able to have a certain level of support and--I mean, you're moving (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But how long could we continue with that?
Speaker 1: No, no, you--
Speaker 2: That, that's--
Speaker 1: --couldn't have.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: No, you could not have.
Speaker 2: So it was imperative that that store--
Speaker 1: So, so what's the, the time period in between the, the two, the two stores?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I don't have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) what year did we open?
Speaker 1: Well, let's see--
Speaker 2: Did Harold [Lewis' husband, HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] give you anything on that?
Speaker 1: Well, I have--hold on; let me see if I have the first business.  Wait a minute; hold on.
Speaker 2: I can't remember what year we--okay, let's see, the twins [Jennifer Lewis and Jonathan Lewis] are born in '88 [1988]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --eighty-eight [1988].
Speaker 1: So I just have the first and then--oh no, 1991.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You've got it.
Speaker 1: --I have 1991 that you're expandable at that point.  And you're allowed to buy your second store, and it's at 40th Street and University Avenue.  And--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: --that's not right?  And then six months later they, their, they bought their third store in Hillcrest [San Diego, California].  That's what I have.  So, how does that sound?  'Cause you know--
Speaker 2: Where does Jamacha [Road] come in?
Speaker 1: 'Cause nine- but no.  What is Jam- is Jamacha--
Speaker 2: Jamacha.
Speaker 1: Jamacha is your second store?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Where do you see it?
Speaker 1: It doesn't, it, it--
Speaker 2: It's not in there, 'cause they bought it back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's probably why.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And so we grew to the Hillcrest and the University.  That was our real growth.
Speaker 1: So that's your third store.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But in between in this four year period--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --somewhere in between 1987 and 1991--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with the twist of--
Speaker 2: We had a failing restaurant that the company bought back.
Speaker 1: How long a period do you remember that be- that you sort of struggled?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: You don't remember?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It had to at least be two years.
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah.
Story_ID: 652171
Speaker 1: So you're, you're not--I mean, politic- is, who else is helping you, advise you?  Is Reggie Webb [HistoryMaker Reginald Webb], is he--can he advise or help?  Is there anyone (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There's only so much help that the NBMOA [National Black McDonald's Operators Association] could do.  You know, they could go and plead our case for us.  But it wasn't until we got in that meeting with Jerry Newman [Gerald Newman].  Jerry Newman was like the godfather.  That person and that persona, there's no individual that exists that like that within McDonald's Corporation anymore.  It doesn't exist.  There used to be called Newman deals.  They don't exist anymore.  He could forgive.  He could forget.  He could bless.  He was the godfather, truly.  And so we were at a convention.  And I can't remember; it might have been an M- NBMOA convention, and somebody, and it might have been Reggie, and, and more, more than likely it was Reggie, 'cause Reggie had a very close relationship with Jerry, and who said, "Jerry's gonna sit down with you guys right now."  And we went in this meeting, and they brought in our regional manager [David Rowe] who was wringing his hands, because you know, he could have taken care of this without even going to Jerry, but he just sat there and let it--let us struggle.
Speaker 1: For all that time.
Speaker 2: All that time.
Speaker 1: Were there other instances that you would hear of like that at the, the BMOA meetings?
Speaker 2: There are people that have left the system who left with nothing.  There, there are some operators that, there are some operators that came into the system that didn't manage money well.  You know, there's a lot of income coming in, and you have to be very smart and very frugal, you know.  You just cannot your first year of business go out and buy designer clothes and designer handbags and this and, and increase your lifestyle and all that.  When we built our first restaurant we rented a house, 'cause we sold our house.  We didn't come to San Diego [California] and buy a house.  We rented a house.  And at that time, we had an eighteen month time period in, in which to purchase before we were facing a capital gain.  So we had to buy something.  We were forced to buy something.  And the twins [Jennifer Lewis and Jonathan Lewis] were like three weeks old, and we were moving into a house.  But it's best that you, your business comes first.  You gotta make sure that you're solid in your business before you start spending money elsewhere.
Speaker 1: Now Tina [HistoryMaker Tina Lewis], why do you think you were conservative that way?  Is it because they told you, or did this come from you and Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis]?  Because a lot of African American- you know, or people new to wealth, especially when money is coming in.  They're gonna get the cars sometimes, you know, the--
Speaker 2: No.  We were conser- well, remember, I came from very humble beginnings.  I, you know, I grew up poor, so--Harold was--has a different story.  His father [Harold Lewis, Sr.] was like one of the first black contractors in Los Angeles [California].  You know, he was wearing custom made three piece suits and stuff when he was a kid.  So his background was totally different from mine.  But we were, we were frugal in our marriage.  You know, even though we bought a house, we were still, you know, trying to save money, trying to put money in the bank.  We've always wanted to, you know, save money.  That was a big deal for us.  And we were just--I don't know.  It was just part of our character I guess.
Story_ID: 652172
Speaker 1: And then there was also, I had read about a someone named Dave Rowe [David Rowe], who was regional vice president.
Speaker 2: (Pronunciation) Dave Rowe.
Speaker 1: Rowe, Rowe, okay, Rowe (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's who I'm talking about who sat there and watched us struggle.
Speaker 1: I see, because he's quoted as saying that ever since the store has--they have earned outstanding source [sic.] designation.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we have.
Speaker 1: And he said that's very unusual.
Speaker 2: Yes.  We received outstanding store awards every year that we've been in the system, every year.
Speaker 1: Is he still in the system?
Speaker 2: He's an owner-operator now, so he sings a different tune now 'cause he's on the other side.
Speaker 1: So, so how long did--what was his name, Nor- the one who blessed the deal?
Speaker 2: Jerry Newman [Gerald Newman].
Speaker 1: Jerry Newman.  How long did he stay--did that system exist?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, before I came along.
Speaker 1: Okay, but afterwards?
Speaker 2: He, 'til he died.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was, god--how long has Jerry been gone?  Fifteen, ten or fifteen years now, maybe--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --long time.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause Rowe is quoted with a lot of things: "It's uncharacteristic to grow as fast as they did," as--but he didn't want to characterize it as way ahead of the pack.  So--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Isn't that interesting that he watched us struggle?  And he sat in the meeting with Jerry Newman dumbfounded, like, you know, when we presented--I'm not kidding--it was a book this thick of things that we had tried, you know, promotions, and you know, nothing worked.  It was just not a not a good location, and it was a bad real estate deal.  They signed a bad deal.
Speaker 1: So you're--does that store exist today?
Speaker 2: It does.
Speaker 1: And so they sold it to another operator for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I don't know who owns it now, but I don't think it's still, still is not doing what it should do.  It's still there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But if they had sold it to you for a dollar (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A dollar.
Speaker 1: --then you could have--it wouldn't matter--
Speaker 2: But you know, the thing about it is, even though they bought the store back from us, we still carried the debt.  We still paid that debt off.
Speaker 1: That's the deal's work (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we still carried debt.
Speaker 1: I see.  You don't still today though?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But you ca-
Speaker 2: Oh no.
Speaker 1: But you carried debt--
Speaker 2: 'Cause we grew in spite of that.
Story_ID: 652173
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In fact, because of our relationship in San Diego [California], relationships on the various boards and with the city council [San Diego City Council] and the mayor, we were the operators of choice in the San Diego airport [San Diego International Airport, San Diego, California].  We had three restaurants in the airport.  And in fact--
Speaker 2: But this--well, let's go--so Hillcrest [San Diego, California] comes next, right?
Speaker 1: Hillcrest comes next and then City Heights [San Diego, California].  And at the--at that time, I guess the airport--the, the, the, the port commission [San Diego Unified Port District] was doing an RFP [request for proposals] to develop the San Dio airport.  And so we were approached as being part of the deal in the airport.  And in fact, there were three restaurants, one in each terminal, three terminals.  And we had an African American city councilman who told McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation], who was trying to give one of those restaurants to someone else, that if the Lewises [HistoryMaker Tina Lewis and HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] are not the owner-operators of the McDonald's in the airport, McDonald's would not be in the airport.  So we were the operators of choice.  We since sold those restaurants.  And we tried to sell those restaurants to an African American.  In fact, we tried to sell all of our ten restaurants at the time to an African American, but nobody could afford to buy them at the time.  So a Middle Eastern guy bought the airport stores.  And I think he bought two other restaurants of ours.  But he lost the contract in the airport, so McDonald's is no longer in the airport.  And everyone says to us every time we see them, "If the Lewises were still in San Diego that would have never happened."
Speaker 2: Wow.  So, who is, who is the, who's the mayor, and who's the city councilmen?  Who are the people that you--you know, can you tell, tell us at the time?  I don't know--
Speaker 1: At the time, Susan Golding was the mayor.  Before her was Maureen O'Connor.  I don't know what they're doing now, because you know, they just impeached the mayor [Bob Filner] recently for sexual harassment.  But the city councilman, William Jones, was one of the youngest at the time we came, and he was under Maureen O'Connor.  And then George [George Stevens], George, George, George, George, George--that's terrible I'm losing George's last name, and he passed.  He was the African American city councilman at the time we were going in the airport.
Speaker 2: So how many city councilmen were there at, you know--
Speaker 1: One at a time.  There's one now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But one African American--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --one at a time?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But how many in, on your city council total?  Do you (unclear), do you remember?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, yeah.  Do you know what is that--so this, this all happens--I mean, you--this happens in what, a ten year period?
Speaker 1: A ten year period.
Speaker 2: Ten year period, you have how many stores?
Speaker 1: We were there twenty years, so--
Speaker 2: So you had about--
Speaker 1: --within a--
Speaker 2: --four, maybe--no.  That would have been--
Speaker 1: In a ten year period--
Speaker 2: --three and three.  You would have had six.
Speaker 1: How long were we in the airport before we left?  We weren't in the airport ten years.
Speaker 2: Well, I know you had--let me put it--in 1993, according to press, before you have the airport, you're three, the three, the three (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What article are you reading?  What--
Speaker 2: I don't know what article.  This is--but the three fast food restaurants were generating 4.8 million [dollars]--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --in 1993.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, that's before the airport.
Speaker 1: That's before the airports, yeah.
Speaker 2: So this is--I mean, are you--so what is the--how--one, it's one thing to have, but you have different locations you have to check on and all of that.  You're saying--who is supporting your husband then on operations?  You're the--
Speaker 1: We have, we have a director of operations.  We have managers at every restaurant.  And we have shift managers.  So we've got a lot of employees.
Speaker 2: So with that, that takes a--you know, you're dealing with people, so that's a lot of work there.  You're--it's--
Speaker 1: Now, what you have to remember about me or what you need to know about me is that I was diagnosed three times with cancer in the middle of all of this.
Speaker 2: Wait, you're not diagnosed three times in 1993, no?
Speaker 1: No, not then.
Speaker 2: That's later.  Okay, we're gonna--
Speaker 1: That's later.
Speaker 2: --get to that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 652174
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is that, so your husband [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] though, he, he--does he have any ups and downs or things like that, 'cause you're dealing with people, and there's growth?  I mean, you have systems in place, but sometimes they say even when you have a child, one to two is okay, but two to three, you know, becomes difficult.
Speaker 2: Well, we were a team.  Even though I did--you know, I served on various boards, and I was the person that was kind of on the outside, and he was more operational, our office was actually housed in the basement of our Hillcrest restaurant [in San Diego, California], and I did the payroll.  So you know, I would come in in the morning, and I would work in the office.  And then when 3:00 came around, it was time for me to go and pick up the kids from school.  So I would pick up the kids from school, and they were coming home--I mean they were coming to the restaurant.  And they were running around the restaurant, cleaning tables, and playing in the lobby, and playing in the PlayPlace, and running up and down our desks.  But it was a juggle; it was really a juggle 'cause we're trying to juggle our family, then juggle our business at the same time, because my kids were never latchkey.  I never let them come home and stay home alone.  I always picked them up, and they came in.  So they always watched and observed us working, even in our printing business [with Sir Speedy, Inc.].  I would pick up my son [Jeremy Lewis], 'cause he was an only child then, and he would come to the printing business.  And he had his little desk right there in our office where he would do our homework, and he would watch his parents work.  So all of our kids have watched us work, and they've always been in a work environment with us.
Speaker 1: So what was--staffing wise was also critical to your success.  Was it difficult to find that operations person too that worked under (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  We, we lucked out.  We had someone that had worked for the corporation [McDonald's Corporation] that came to work for us.  And he was an African American male (laughter).  So we were very fortunate to have good staff and good people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So aside from the, the one lemon store, you know, and that experience with Rowe [David Rowe]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you really--the all--the rest is really positive.
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: It--it's like an American dream.  Is there anything else that comes along that is, is, you know, sort of difficult in that?  Because the, the airport then must have come, and I, you know, I can--it must have come, you know, after 1993.  And then that period of time, so about maybe ten years or so, you had the, you know, the--well, maybe it wasn't--but anyway, you had the airport stores.  So I'm told that like--airports are like licensed to print money.  That's what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) It depends on whether or not you're in a hub.  You know, like if you're in Denver [Colorado], which is a huge hub, or Atlanta [Georgia].  San Diego [San Diego International Airport, San Diego, California] is a relatively small airport.  It's not a really large airport.  But you know, it, it--they did very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did it matter which terminal you were in, like, you know, 'cause you're all--in all three.
Speaker 2: We're in all three.
Speaker 1: Did one terminal, did one terminal do better than the others?
Speaker 2: Of course.  The, the, the terminals with the, with the major carriers did best, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you find that it was different though running a McDonald's in--within an airport, even though you were in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --the airport industry?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean you--airline industry.
Speaker 2: Right.  The only thing different about the airports is you don't see your neighborhood customer that might come in on a regular basis, where you know their first name, and they ask about your children, or you ask about them, and they were always there.  We had, we had one customer, Mr. Bell [ph.], at one of our restaurants, he would be there breakfast, lunch, and dinner 'cause he didn't have any family, and so we know him pers- we knew him personally.  And at Hillcrest there was this one lady that came in all the time, and we knew her, and she knew us.  She knew all--she knew our kids.  So you know, because you're dealing with the traveling public it's quite different.
Story_ID: 652175
Speaker 1: McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] is always rolling out some initiatives, some well received by McDonald's, you know, owner-operators, some not well received.  In the--can you share, in the twenty years of, you know, of owning, which ones do, you know, were not well received by you or the, or, or the operators and which ones were?  Because it'd been different, you know, sometime, and I've heard over the years sometimes cutting, you know, cutting into the profits.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I just wanna--because you've been significant operators--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, during that time.
Speaker 2: Well, McLean was not well received because my husband [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] tells me that he only sold one, and it was to me (laughter).  So that was not well received.  Now, something that was well received was Mighty Wings.  Way back when we first started Mighty Wings came along.  In fact, when Mighty Wings came along, and we were doing, selling wings, I decided, me, coming from the South, that I wanted to introduce grits.  And in San Diego [California], I brought grits to San Diego.  And we had, we had been selling soup, Campbell's soup, in these big kettles.  So I taught my staff how to make grits in our soup kettle, and we were selling grits with our wings and pancakes for breakfast.  And one day, our local news station came in, and he looked up and he said, "Mrs. Lewis [HistoryMaker Tina Lewis], you're selling grits in here?"  And I said, "Yes."  "Are you the only sore--store west of the Mississippi [Mississippi River] that's selling grits?"  I said, "I think so."  CNN picked it up.  It went national.  I have a copy of it, of the coverage over there.  But we were selling grits, and I taught them how to make it.  That was so exciting for us.  So, I just wanted to share that with you.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, what I find inter- do you know what about year that was that you were on CNN doing that?
Speaker 2: No, but it'll be over there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Do--hm, okay--
Speaker 2: My memory is terrible--
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, that's--
Speaker 2: --by the way, with dates.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's okay.  Don't worry about that.  So, I'll just--so what, what I find--was that--I thought that you had to follow the, the, by, you know, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) By the book, law, in terms of menu.  Back then, no.  I got away with it.  But today, I couldn't do it.  And I had to, I had to stop doing it, so--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But I did get to do it, enjoyed it; the community loved it, and we had biscuits.  So it was just wonderful (laughter).
Speaker 1: So were--biscuits were already on--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the menu.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what you added were the grits.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because things have to be well tested in the kitchens back in the corporate office and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Everything has changed now, you know.  But back then I did it for a very short period of time.
Story_ID: 652176
Speaker 1: Can we talk about Gospelfest [McDonald's GospelFest]?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Because that happened.  I would like to talk about, you know, that; and then I want to talk about your, you know, your health.  But I would like to talk about--well, I don't want to talk about--I want to finish with the McDonald's part (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do that, and then you know I started AVAIL, an African American scholarship program.
Speaker 1: Right, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they, they benefited from Gospelfest.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So can we talk about both?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: How would you like to me to start?
Speaker 1: Well, can we talk about Gospelfest?  The only reason--yeah, because you're doing all of this in San Diego [California].  And that's why--so, how I would like to do it is let's do the, all the business things.  Then I want to come back to some personal (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --things, okay.
Speaker 2: Now, Gospelfest, I had attended Gospelfest in Los Angeles [California] for a number of years.  And, 'cause we, we opened in '87 [1987], and I started Gospelfest in '92 [1992].  So I've been going to Gospelfest in Los Angeles for a number of years.  And I thought, wouldn't it be great if we could do Gospelfest in San Diego?  So I started out by having a meeting with the, the--there's an alliance of ministers in San Diego.  So I met with them, and I presented it to them, and I told them the concept of Gospelfest.  And Gospelfest is really something that McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] does to raise money.  And in some cities the, the funds go to UNCF [United Negro College Fund], and in some cities it goes to different causes.  But I wanted to do Gospelfest and give, half of the proceeds would stay locally in a scholarship program that I called African American Visionary and Inspirational--Inspirational Leaders [African American Visionary and Inspirational Leaders Scholarship Program].  So some of the money would go--would stay locally for scholarships, and the rest of the money would go to UNCF.  And so I got the ministers to allow their churches to participate in it.  And so we would do these sing offs, so to speak.  There would be com- it, it was a competition so we'd do eliminations.  So all the choirs in the city could fill out an application and apply.  And then we'd have three sing offs where we would do eliminations down to five final choirs that would perform.  And so we started off at a very small venue.  We would sell tickets via Ticketmaster [Ticketmaster Corporation; Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.].  And we--the first year might have been a venue with twelve hundred.  We sold that out.  So we moved to a larger venue, symphony hall [Copley Symphony Hall, San Diego, California].  And I don't remember; that might have been twenty-nine hundred, and we sold that out.  We had--we honored--god, we honored so many people, Justin Hairston [sic. Jester Hairston]. Is it Justin who wrote 'Amen'?  Is that his name?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.  Okay.
Speaker 2: We honored a lot of different gospel artists.  We, bro- brought them in.  They performed.  Gospel Music Workshop [Gospel Music Workshop of America, Inc.] performed.  The choirs performed.  And they would get trophies.  But the money, the proceeds, would go to UNCF and to scholarships.  And we're very fortunate.  AVAIL has awarded over $650,000 in scholarships over the last twenty years.  I kept it going even after Gos- Gospelfest was--you know, it kind of stopped because what happened was the churches wanted to receive compensation.  And the whole idea was for the proceeds to go to UNCF and to scholarships and not to go back to the churches.  So, I wanted to keep it going.  I kept AVAIL going by just doing a corporate dinner where I got sponsorships, and I just kept it going that way.  And I kept AVAIL going for many years, until I came here actually, where we started two different scholarship programs.
Speaker 1: So you--who, who was, who were the people that are critical, you know, that you're interacting with, some of the names of the people in the community that you're interacting with?  And then, the other thing, be- before we get to that, to go back to the Gospelfest.  Are you producing the--you're producing the shows?
Speaker 2: Hired a producer, Adeline Hunter [ph.].  Yep, hired a producer.  I didn't know the first thing about producing a show.  So, but you know, if there's something you can't do, then you hire the person who's the professional.  So I hired an African American producer, and she produced the first Gospelfest.
Speaker 1: That's really--so, 'cause that was big, I mean, those venues for--
Speaker 2: They, they were big.  And I had no knowledge of producing anything.  But I chaired it, and then I hired people who knew how to listen to gospel and judge, the music teachers and music profession, professionals were the judges.  And I just brought people together, and it happened.  You know, mayor got involved.  The city council [San Diego City Council] got involved.  I got various people in the community to serve on the committee, you know, to be the working force, to look at scholarship applications and review them and select the recipients.  And it was, it was a lot of work (laughter), a lot--
Speaker 1: But you know--
Speaker 2: --of work.
Speaker 1: But this is also in a time when Gospelfest and gospel music, it's these types of things that have really brought it to its fore and acknowledgement--
Speaker 2: That's true (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, I mean--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: --over the years.
Speaker 2: And we held it in June, which is during Black Music Month [African American Music Appreciation Month], you know.  That was, that was, that huge.
Story_ID: 652177
Speaker 1: So you have the three restaurants.  Then you add the three in the, in the airport [San Diego International Airport, San Diego, California].  Where do the other four come from?
Speaker 2: There's one in Pacific Beach [San Diego, California].  And then we own the first restaurant on an Indian [Native American] reservation, which was in Viejas [Viejas Reservation].  And where else?  Where are we?  We're in Pacific Beach.  We're in Viejas.  We have City Heights [San Diego, California].  We have Hillcrest [San Diego, California].  We have Euclid [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Maybe it's Euc- it's Euclid, maybe.  I don't remember Euclid being--oh, Euclid was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Euclid was the first.
Speaker 1: --the first one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Euclid, Hillcrest, City Heights, Jamacha [Road], which they bought back, Pacific Beach, Viejas, and the three airports, so that's nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So how--what happens with, on the, you know, the, the Indian reservation then?  How is that one, well received?  And is that different (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That came to us.  They wanted us because they're, you know, they're a minority, basically; they're Indians.  And they wanted an, they wanted us.  We were (gesture) the African American owner-operators.  There were no other in San Diego [California].  We were the only ones, so they wanted us.  And we took an existing restaurant and converted.  And they actually ended up closing that, because when we were there at the time, there were very few choices of food venues.  But then they expanded, and they brought other venues in, and the sales started to so- slowly dwindle in that location.  And it was to--actually closed--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --after we left.
Speaker 1: So when do you move here to, to, to, to, to, to Las Vegas [Nevada]?
Speaker 2: When do we move here?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Six years ago in August, so what year is that?
Speaker 1: Okay, so six years is 2007, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, we move here.
Story_ID: 652178
Speaker 1: Up until that time now, are--let me--this is what I'm wanna, I wanna understand, is--okay.  Are there--are your revenues pretty much increasing every year, or are there down years, or up years?  I mean, how does that really sort of--
Speaker 2: They were, they're pretty much steady and increasing.  But what we did before the move here--now, we had a second home here in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] before we moved here full time.  And we sold I think it was three restaurants [with the McDonald's Corporation] at the time, so we had the remaining restaurants.  Because Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] was thinking we needed to slow down a little bit.  But then we started thinking that we wanted to live here, and so, glad--kind of glad we did that.  That was very insightful, because when we sold the first group of restaurants, we actually started a charitable remainder trust, and we started our own foundation.  So, in sheltering money, it actually allowed us to do a lot of things that we really wanted to do in the area of giving back.  So, that afford us an opportunity to, to establish our own foundation, which is the Lewis Family Foundation.  So, and then, when we had the opportunity to come here, it was much easier to sell the group of remaining restaurants than all of the restaurants.  So that, that was just foresight on my husband's part actually.
Speaker 1: So he had--so who advised on the, the, the, the, the trust that you, you know, as, as a shelter (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Our account, our accountant kind of gave us advice and directed us to an attorney who facilitated that.
Speaker 1: So what were some of the things that you were able to do?
Speaker 2: Many things.  Oh gosh, we funded so many things.  We, first of all, we started two scholarship programs.  We have one at the univers- at UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, California] in our daughter's name [Lewis Family Honors Scholarship].  And so that one has perpetuity, so they'll always be a Lewis scholar on the UNLV campus.  We started one at our church.  So we do a ten thousand dollar scholarship every year at our church, and so that's exciting.  So it's, it's just wonderful to be able to do that.  I've donated--oh gosh, I can't, I don't know what that amount is--to breast cancer awareness, 'cause I serve on the board of Susan G. Komen.  I serve on their national board.  I've been on there about six years now, and a myriad of things.  I can't even name them all, but we support a lot of different foundations.
Speaker 1: How did you decide that you wanted to run your foundation when you set it up?  Because a lot of times people--you know, 'cause you can sort--you can set really agendas by giving.
Speaker 2: Well, we set it up as the Lewis Family Foundation because event--we could have put it under Harold and [HistoryMaker] Tina Lewis.  But one day we will be gone, and we want our children to continue that legacy.  So the Lewis Family Foundation is something that our children will be able to continue.  And that's another reason why we started the scholarship in our daughter's name [Jennifer Lewis].  That's her al- alma mater; she graduated from UNLV.  So, she's actually in charge of overseeing her own scholarship.  So it's about giving back, and we had--that's something that we will continue to teach them to do.  And they, they will tell you.  If you interview them, they will tell you that they just want to continue what we started.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.  So the move here though was because--so wait--the first--the restaurants that you first sell, which ones are those?
Speaker 2: The first ones we sold were Pacific Beach [San Diego, California].  God, which one of the--the last--
Speaker 1: You sold three, and then you sold sev--
Speaker 2: We sold three, so it was National City [California].  National City was the one I forgot that rounded off the ten--National City, Pacific Beach, and I--might have been Viejas [Viejas Reservation].  So the remaining was--
Speaker 1: Everything else.
Speaker 2: Everything else, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what was the time period between those, those two sales?
Speaker 2: Gosh, I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: It was, it was, it was a few years.
Story_ID: 652179
Speaker 1: What is your role then with the McDonald's owner, ow- can you talk a little bit about how that group has supported, or you know, been--you've been an instrumental part of the group during the years?  Let me put it that way.
Speaker 2: Which group, the San Diego [California] operator group?
Speaker 1: San Diego and the national one.  Well, the black McDonald's owner-operators, you know, couldn't--
Speaker 2: No.  We're, we're, when we were in San Diego, we're a part of Southern Cal [Southern California].  So I'd be the Los Angeles [California] operators are our closest African American owner-operators.  So we're a part of that NBMOA [National Black McDonald's Operators Association].  We didn't have enough (laughter).  It was just the two of us actually.
Speaker 1: I see, I see, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I see, I see.  Now, is there anything you want to say about the black McDonald's owner-operators?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to say that I'm glad that they exist.  And they formed this organization because they really are a great support group for struggling operators, for just to bounce things off.  We always have someone to go to, if we're in trouble or we wanna, you know, if, is this a good deal, if you were questioning this.  We've always told registered applicants that have come into the system, brand new owner-operators--they're called registered applicants--if you're questioning a deal, come to one of us, come to us as a group or an individual, who has the experience, and bounce the deal off of them, because every deal is not a good deal.  And you might sign off on the dotted line and find out that this was not a good deal for you. And so, even when you were successful, did you find it still of the same use, I mean at that point--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --or did you turn more into mentors to other people?
Speaker 1: I would say both; we were both.  We were mentors and part of the, of the group, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, the leaders need support.  So you know, what good is it to have a leadership if you don't have a body that supports the leadership?
Story_ID: 652180
Speaker 1: You know, when we were off camera--well, let- let's talk about, let's talk about--well, no.  Let's talk about your relationship with now president, or CEO, of McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] and you know, how that relationship started.  Can we talk about that?
Speaker 2: Well, Don [Donald Thompson] and Liz Thompson [Elizabeth Thompson], when they first came to San Diego [California], Don was in a lower management position and was our neighbor.  And we attended the same church.  We basically had the same set of friends, and so we spent a lot, lot of time together.  You know, the kids were young.  I became Auntie Tina [HistoryMaker Tina Lewis].  Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] became Uncle Harold.  And consequently, he became Uncle Don, Auntie Liz to my kids [Jeremy Lewis, Jennifer Lewis and Jonathan Lewis].  And we've just became really good friends.  And then he left and went back to Oak Brook [Illinois] in another capacity.  And he stayed there a couple of years, and then we got a phone call that said he was coming back as a division president.  And so when he came back to division president, Liz was looking for a house.  And I said, "Well, Liz, we've moved, and we're now in this development.  You need to come and look."  And so, guess what?  We were neighbors again.  So you know, we've been really good friends and neighbors for, for many years, and they're a lovely couple.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause, I mean, for him to rise, it's a major promotion or ascend, ascension I would say.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  You know, it's really funny because before he was president, when he was lower management we started calling him Mr. President.  And he would always tell us, "Oh, quit."  And then when became president, we told him, I said, "CEO."  And he said, "Oh no, Tina."  I said, "CEO."  And he just never would acknowledge that that was possible, but it happened.  And you know, when we, when we knew that he was being considered--when NBMOA [National Black McDonald's Operators Association] knew that he was being considered, the leadership called Harold and said you know, they wanted to call and you know, talk to Skinner [James A. Skinner], who was, you know, the outgoing CEO, you know, about, you know, talking to, to, to him about Don.  Harold told him--told them, "No, don't interfere, do not call, do not make any comment," and they didn't.  They listened to Harold because they know about our relationship, and they respected that.  And he got the position, because Don was gonna get that position.  I mean, he was, he was the heir apparent, and we saw it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a pretty amazing success story, the, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: --the rise.  We haven't interviewed him yet, but--
Speaker 2: You haven't?
Speaker 1: Unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 2: Oh, wait.
Speaker 1: He had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He'll tell you how when he got, when he, as he told us, when he interviewed for McDonald's, he thought it was McDonnell Douglas [McDonnell Douglas Corporation] when he went, 'cause he's an engineer.  And they fast tracked him (laughter).
Speaker 1: No.  It's a--'cause he actually did an interview of John Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --is one of our Evening With ['An Evening With John Rogers, Jr.']--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we know John.
Speaker 1: John, yeah, John--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --has been very proud of that appointment.
Story_ID: 652181
Speaker 1: When you move here, you are, you know, you've, you've been vacationing.  And you had, you had arthritis, you were saying, and so you wanted to find another place, and you had--
Speaker 2: A drier climate.
Speaker 1: A drier climate.  So you decide to also, to--so how do you find your way into the McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation], the McD universe in Las Vegas [Nevada]?
Speaker 2: Well, we called Don [Donald Thompson] and--well, Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] called Don and told him that we'd like to take a look at Las Vegas and relocating and the reasons why, you know.  It's a better af- after being here, you know, for five years, I found that I wasn't suffering as much when I was here.  And so, Harold--I mean Don called the, the manager here and, and told him that he'd like, you know, to take a look at some opportunities for us.  And they made it happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you came in.  You were able to own--buy into--
Speaker 2: They offered us twelve.  We selected six of the twelve at the time (laughter).  More is not best.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So we selected the six that we felt we wanted, and we've grown from there.  We grew actually to ten, and just sold three.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how was that experience?  Was it exactly the same or--because, look at this.  I'm thinking about your story in, in, in San Diego [California].  And you literally (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We owned the city.
Speaker 1: You owned the city.  You came in and made it your business to, to--you know, you developed relationships.  You're older at this point, and you--this was a retirement community for you.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So how does--
Speaker 2: Every- all of our friends have said to us, "I thought you moved to Vegas to retire."  Well, after we got here--
Story_ID: 652182
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how old are your children when you come (unclear)?
Speaker 2: The twins are twenty-five, and our oldest is thirty-five, ten year gap, major (laughter).  You know, we moved here.  We knew a few people here, not a lot.  I belonged to The Links [The Links, Incorporated] in San Diego [California], so I transferred to The Links here.  But I still didn't know very many people here and so didn't know any of the owner--well, we knew a few, the black owner-operators here, Eva Martin and Ron [F. Ronald Smith] and Sharon Smith.  We knew them through our organization but not really knew them.  But, so we had a few friends here and this few friends that we had met through Trumpet that lived here.  And, but we immediately got--
Speaker 1: The Trumpet Awards.
Speaker 2: Trumpet Awards.  So, we immediately, you know, started getting involved in certain things here, one of which, soon as I got here, I got a call from Susan G. Komen, I would--to my surprise, through someone that I had met at the Trumpet Awards, Hattie Hill, had--we also had honored Nancy Brinker at Trumpet Awards.  And I got a call from the CEO of Susan G. Komen wanting to know if I would be interested in getting involved in Susan G. Komen on a national level.  I was in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] when I got that.  And so slowly but surely, we have gotten involved in, you know, some of the politics here.  We know the, all the politicians.  We've supported their causes.  We have, you know, black politicians here that we support.  And we've gotten involved in the university [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], and now I'm on the board of trustees for the university.  It might have something to do with that money (laughter) that we gave them, but I'd like to think that they would like my input.
Speaker 1: But I, what I want to know, your daughter [Jennifer Lewis] graduated from there, so she wasn't--how old was she when you moved here then?
Speaker 2: She was actually already at the university before we moved here.
Speaker 1: I--
Speaker 2: We had the home here.  We had the second home here, which allowed me to--for her to go to school as a resident of Nevada because we had the home here.  But she had finished her first year before we moved here.
Speaker 1: So what was her--what did--what was her--what is her major then?
Speaker 2: Hotel, restaurant management.
Speaker 1: I was gonna say, 'cause they have an excellent program.
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --number one in the country actually, under Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].
Speaker 1: And what about your son then?  What did, what did--
Speaker 2: He went to Laguna College of Art and Design [Laguna Beach, California].  He's an artist.  In fact, quite a few of the work that I show in my home is his work.  But he's in our business as well.  All the kids are in McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation].
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.  They all are?
Speaker 2: All are.
Speaker 1: And what roles do they play now?
Speaker 2: Our oldest son [Jeremy Lewis] owns and operates his own restaurant.  Our youngest [Jonathan Lewis] son owns and operates his own restaurant.  And our daughter is our director of operations [for HRL Group, LLC] and oversees everyone.
Speaker 1: So that, I mean, that is success, successive generations, you know, suc--
Speaker 2: You know, that was the other thing that we wanted to do.  A job and a career, you can't pass on.  You can't pass wealth down that way.  I mean you can pass wealth down, but you can't pass your career down to your kids.  This is something that we're able to pass down to our kids.  Whether or not they continue, it's up to them, you know, how they want to grow, what they want to do, how much they want to give back, how much they want to get involved.  But you know, my daughter started by overseeing her scholarship program [Lewis Family Honors Scholarship], so that, that's a start.
Story_ID: 652183
Speaker 1: --Talking to them about a show that we saw on 'Cosby' ['The Cosby Show'] years ago where Bill [Bill Cosby] sits down with Monopoly money with Theo [Theodore Huxtable].  And Theo wants to move out and get a job, and he's not going to go to school.  He's gonna have this money.  And I remember Bill sitting there saying, "Okay, so how much is your rent gonna cost?"  And he held this mop- Monopoly money, and he thinks Theo has all this, a lot of money right in front of me.  Okay, and he takes this pile of money for this.  And he goes, "And, and your groceries, you gotta eat."  And he takes this pile of money from him.  So basically, long story short, we kind of had that kind of conversation with our kids, directly or indirectly, that, yes, you know, you can go to work--for example, our daughter, who was looking at hotels, she was looking at the hotel industry, and pretty serious about it in fact.  But if you remember, our economy tanked--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: --big time, and that industry suffered greatly here in Las Vegas [Nevada].  Right about the time when she was in the middle, you know, of her degree, I mean, too late to really change, but she started looking at her degree as something that was highly usable in our business and started applying everything that she was learning to McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] and saw that this was the direction for her.  So basically, we taught our kids that yes, you can have a career; you can have a job, but we asked them to look at what McDonald's has afforded us and what we've been able to do and what we've been able to do for others.  I mean, our kids have met people that we've given scholarships that are adults now.  In fact, when (laughter) I was on the mayor advisory board, I met somebody who received one of my scholarships that worked for the mayor.  So you know, how do you impact other lives?  And that's the gratification I believe that I get, is that I really feel that I impact other lives.  You know, I had to work to go to college.  You know, my kids finished school without a student loan.  You know, that's big.  You know, the kids that went to school at UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] with my daughter, they worked.  We didn't want our kids to work while they went to school.  Focus on school.  They didn't have to.  The only thing we feel that we may have done differently and maybe we should have, maybe we should have had them work for somebody else first, because then they would know how good they (laughter) have it, you know.  Some operators have done that.  We just didn't do it.
Speaker 2: They would have them work for someone else and then come back.
Speaker 1: Yeah, not--
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: --in the same industry.
Speaker 2: Oh, in a different industry.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.  Okay--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I see.
Speaker 1: How many examples do you know of among the black McDonald's owner-operators of succession, successful succession?
Speaker 2: Here in Nevada we have Ron Smith [F. Ronald Smith], and he has two sons that are in the second generation program.  McDonald's has actually started a program for our children called NextGen.  That's what they're called.  So they have a program designed to get them through and train them so they are successful.  So Jeremy's [Jeremy Lewis] completed it, and he owns his own restaurant.  Jonathan [Jonathan Lewis] has finished everything except the final approval.  Jennifer [Jennifer Lewis], although she has finished--she graduated two year, two years ago, not all, almost a year and a half ago.  She is in the program now.  But she's running our organization because of her know how and her skillset from her degree.  So McDonald's sees that their future is wrapped up in this next generation.  Fran, Fran Jones [Frances R. Jones]--are you familiar with Fran Jones?  She's in Los Angeles [California].  Her son is next generation.  Reggie Webb's daughter, Kiana Webb [Kiana Webb Severloh], is an owner-operator.  His son, Kyle [Kyle Webb], is next generation.  He's, he hasn't been certified yet, daughter has, son hasn't.  His older son though is in Wingstop [Wingstop, Inc.], so he has a different franchise.  I would say quite a few of the African American owner-operators' children are next generation.
Speaker 1: So that's a success story too.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Huge.
Speaker 1: Huge, because you know, there are certain--I've been interviewing like, advertising agencies.  Black advertising agencies may be no more.  You know, they may--
Speaker 2: They're getting swallowed--
Speaker 1: They're been--
Speaker 2: --up.
Speaker 1: --they've been swallowed up.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So, and then Ford [Ford Motor Company] dealerships, that was a hard, you know, hit.
Speaker 2: They were hard hit.
Speaker 1: Hard hit.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So, so that, that's very impressive to know.
Story_ID: 652184
Speaker 1: I want to ask about your health challenges.  And the Susan G. Komer [sic. Susan G. Komen], did that come after your first scare?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you what--of course, we were in the, in the business of running our organization with our restaurants when I was deg- diagnosed in, in 2000 with colorectal cancer.  It was really a true blessing that I was diagnosed at the time I was diagnosed.  And I'll tell you how that came about.  My father [Charles Ricard, Sr.] died of cancer, and it was the first cancer that I've had, had experienced in my family, period.  And my father was diagnosed and was given six months to live, and he died in two months.  And I guess I started thinking about my own mortality.  And I had had a screening, but something compelled me to go and schedule a colonoscopy, even though I had been screened the year before.  And even when I went in, I had female doctor, and she said, "But, Tina [HistoryMaker Tina Lewis], we just did this.  But you've done all the prep.  Let's just do it."  And voila, she finds something.  And sure enough, I was diagnosed with colorectal cancer.  And it was very small.  It was so tiny, it was the size of a mole.  I mean, it was just a miracle that it was found.  But I had chemotherapy and radiation for it and sailed through that and thought I was home free.  And then in December I went and had a regular mammogram, which I was scheduled to do, and that came back normal.  And then the following June I did a self-exam and found a lump, and I was, was diagnosed with breast cancer.  So that was June of 2000--I mean June of 2000 colorectal and then June of 2001 I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  And I had no family history of breast cancer, but I somehow knew that I was--should be doing breast self-exams, and I was doing them, and I found a lump.  And I remember pointing it out to my husband [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis], and he wrote it off.  He said, "Oh, Tina, you know you have those lumps every month."  And I said, "No, but this sounds--this feels really different."  And I called my gynecologist and asked her for a referral for a breast specialist.  And I told her, 'cause I had, I had that kind of relationship with her, I said, "I want to go to who'd you go to."  And she sent me to a female breast specialist.  And they biopsied me in the office that day, and it was breast cancer.  And--
Speaker 1: Wasn't it also small?  Was it earl- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was second--it was stage two.  It was already in my lymph nodes. So, it had been there, and I think it had been there when I was going through the colorectal, even though they're un- they were unrelated.  It was two separate primary cancers.  And then when I finished chemo and radiation for that, yes, I lost all my hair.  I was bald.  I went through my pity party days.  It was rough.  There was no question about, but I'm a pretty strong woman.  You know, most black women say they're pretty strong, but I'm really a pretty strong woman.  I, I didn't tell my kids I had cancer when I had colorectal, 'cause I felt that they thought--they would think--they were so young that, that I thought they would think I would die like their grandfather, so I kept it from them.
Speaker 1: So how old were they at the time?
Speaker 2: They were eleven.  So when breast cancer came around, I had to tell them because they would see the evidence of breast cancer.  Because with the chemotherapy for colorectal, I didn't lose my hair.  I didn't have, I didn't have the appearance of cancer.  But I knew I would have the appearance of cancer, so I told them.  They were in the sixth grade.  They were twelve years old, and I told them.  The twins [Jennifer Lewis and Jonathan Lewis] were twelve, and my son [Jeremy Lewis] was in college, the oldest son.  And I told them that I was gonna be fine; you know, I was--I would be fine; I would get through it.  And I went to their middle school graduation.  And I'll never forget I had a--I called immediately and called a photographer to get my family portrait done.  That was one of the first things I did before I lost my hair, and not knowing if that would be the last family portrait that I ever take with my kids, but I wanted that done.  Those are the kind of things that I thought about.  And when you're diagnosed with breast cancer, they tell women to tell all the women in their family so they can go and get screened, because of the chance of family history.  And so everyone came back fine, although my mother [Mary LeDuff Ricard] was diagnosed six months after me with breast cancer.  So, what I like to tell people--well, my philosophy about cancer is cancer starts with can.  You can get it, but you can survive it.  But the other thing I say when I speak on cancer, on breast cancer, is: history can come in reverse.  I was diagnosed before my mother.  And since then there has been no other breast cancer in my family, but, and there are a lot of females, although my mother has one sis- one sibling that--she has two siblings that's still living, one female, and she had never been diagnosed, so.  But I did the, I did the genetic testing, and it's not genetic.
Story_ID: 652185
Speaker 1: It's not, so it's environmental.  They don't (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think if we knew we'd have a cure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.  So you're saying that--I won't--you're saying that in this whole time period, because the kids are young and you look at you now.  I mean, you look like--you're beautiful.  You look, I mean, just, you know.  So at that point in time, and I know you say you live your life as the glass half full, but that's almost like a near death experience.
Speaker 2: It is a near death experience, because--
Speaker 1: Three times.
Speaker 2: --you really don't know, you know.  You don't know what the outcome, even though I felt very fortunate that I had fantastic physicians.  I had a lot of confidence in my team.  When I was diagnosed the first time, I got referrals, but I was very confident.  And I did a lot of research, a lot of reading.  I asked a lot of questions.  And then when I got the second diagnosis, which was the breast cancer, I had the same oncologist, but I still went and got a second opinion.  And I got a second opinion from someone who had written a book on surviving breast cancer.  And I went to him, and he basically validated what my doctor said.  So I felt pretty confident in, you know, the, the protocol for my--for the treatment, and I, I felt pretty good.  But I armed myself with scripture.  I read scripture every day.  I listened to healing tapes.  I prayed.  And on those days when I felt like I just couldn't get through it--I can remember one day in particular I'd like to share with you because it was a true day when I was in a lot of pain.  And I was going through the house, and I will never forget it.  I was calling his name.  I was saying, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus," and the doorbell rang.  And it's amazing how Jesus came in the form of a UPS [United Parcel Service] dri- delivery guy.  But my cousin--it was actually my husband's cousin--sent me a book, 'Through the Fire, Through the Water' written by Price's wife ['Through the Fire and Through the Water: My Triumph Over Cancer,' Betty R. Price].  She wrote a book when she was going through cancer.  The title was 'Through the Fire and Through the Water.'  And I sat down, and I read that book cover to cover.  And it was almost like God had sent that to me right then and there to get me through that period.  And I'll never forget going to the phone and calling--it was actually my husband's cousin's husband that had sent the book to me--and thanking him for getting me through that day.  But I tell a lot of people--I refer that book to a lot of people, because it's so encouraging.  It's just full of scripture, and she talks about how scripture helped her get through it.  And I, you know, I just started to believe that if God could heal all the people that he did when, you know, when he was on this earth healing, that he could heal me.  And he did, 'cause look at me today.
Speaker 1: What else would you say that you learned about yourself and about life and, and about your views of--what changed?
Speaker 2: What changed in me is I started looking at things that were big and important, and little small things just didn't matter anymore.  So, so what if you didn't get something that you were bidding for on eBay (laughter), you know.  What's the big deal?  Let's think about what's really important.  And what's really important is family and your dearest friends and how to distinguish between who they really are, you know, who is there for you in--during those times and who isn't.  And I learned a lot about that too, because there were people who wrote me off.  There were people who said I was dying and never called me the whole time I was going through breast cancer, 'cause that was the biggest deal, was the breast cancer.  And I learned a great deal about that.  And I tell my family, and Thanksgiving is next week, and what I thank, what I'm most thankful for, is my children and my husband, my loving husband, because I wouldn't trade him for anything, but the fact that my children love each other and care about each other, because one day I won't be here; Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] will not be here.  And that is such a comfort to know that they have such great relationship; they really do, not just the twins, all three of them.  Even though they have that ten year gap between the ten--the, the ten year gap between the twins [Jennifer Lewis and Jonathan Lewis] and my oldest son [Jeremy Lewis], they're like triplets when it comes to their relationship.  It's wonderful.
Story_ID: 652186
Speaker 1: You got involved--so, you believe that your faith and God really brought you through (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That got me through.  And then, when I was finished my treatment, my breast specialist came to me.  And she said, "You know, Tina [HistoryMaker Tina Lewis], I would normally wait about a year before I would ask you to do this for me.  But because you are so positive, and you've been so positive, I would like to ask if you would mentor women that are being diagnosed."  And I said, "Okay," because that became the answer for the why me, you know.  It, it became why not me and became why not me because I could help somebody else get through this.  And so I really began mentoring women soon after I finished my treatment.  And we were called breast buddies out of the Scripps Memorial Hospital and the Scripps Breast Care Center [Scripps Polster Breast Care Center] in San Diego [California], and I was on her advisory board, and I was a mentor.  And you know, someone would call me, a nurse would call me, and they would give me the name of the woman and her number.  And I would call her, and I would meet with her.  And I would try and answer questions and questions that I--that she didn't ask me.  I would, you know, offer advice, you know, like when to go get a wig because you're gonna lose all your hair.  Don't wait 'til you lose it all, you know, things like that.  I mean, just, I hired a holistic nutritionist, and I shared her and her books and the, the drinks, the, the shakes.  And the immune stuff that she had given me I shared; the books I read I shared.  And in fact, I remember meeting a woman who was my age, and she had a son who was having his first child, grandbaby.  Her son had asked her to wait until after the baby was born to have her treatment.  And I looked at her, and I said, "That is just totally selfish on his part," because he was gonna have to help his mother get through this.  He was gonna have to help his mother get to treatment, to get to treatment, to get through radiation, to get to, you know, to get through this.  And he wanted her to put it on the backburner until after the, after the baby was born.  And I said, "You know, I can't tell you, you know, I can't make the decision for you, but if this were me, I would say to him, 'I would like to be alive to see my grandchild, to be here for my grandchild.  And in order for me to do that, I have to move forward on my treatment.'"  And, but I have mentored women whose husbands left them after they were diagnosed.  So, men don't handle breast cancer diagnosis well.  I had a friend that died when I was going through chemo [chemotherapy] of the same kind of breast cancer I had.  And I felt really bad because her mother had survived, and somehow she should have been caught earlier because of that history.  But she wasn't, and went to her funeral while I was going through treatment.  That was hard.  That was really hard to go through.  It was hard to mentor women.  I've mentored women here as well.  I mentor women at my church, because at church, if somebody goes up and whispers to pastor or first lady, guess who they call?  They, they signal me, usually right away, and I go in a back room and talk.  So I'm still mentoring.  I'm still involved.  I've raised a lot of money for breast cancer.  I've rate a--raised a lot of money for breast cancer in the Bahamas.  The Bahamas has the highest rate of breast cancer in the world, black women in the Bahamas.  It used to be in the (gesture) Jewish population, used to be the highest rate of breast cancer in the world.  It's no longer.  It's in the Bahamas.  That's a little known secret.  But Susan G. Komen has vest- invested a lot of money in research.  And we managed to get a state of the art mammogram machine over there.  I raised over $150,000 for breast cancer over there, and donated as well.
Story_ID: 652187
Speaker 1: In many way- so you've turned, you--what could have been victim, you've turned into advocate.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, I--how has cancer, in the time period that you know, we went through or even from the time that you had it you were, and to the, to today, how has cancer treatment changed, that you've seen it change?
Speaker 2: Well, thirteen years ago, just for an example, radiation, your entire chest wall would be radiated.  Today, they're able to remove the tumor and direct the radiation right to where the remove- the tumor's removed.  Not everybody is a candidate for that, but that's a lot of technology that will benefit a lot of women from a lot of issues that will come along later.  There's a lot of, of side effects from radiation and chemotherapy that exist today from the treatment that was done thirteen years ago.  Thirteen years ago they didn't test your heart, for example, to see if you were predisposed to any kind of heart disease or any issues with your heart that may come along later.  Now they're doing that.  Well, thirteen years ago I was given Adriamycin, which is a huge problem for women, for certain women, and they're able--they're actually devel- developing cardiovascular disease, related to Adriamycin, which is one of the chemotherapy drugs, and the fact that you're radiated on your left side also.  Even though they're trying to target to a- to avoid your heart, the fact is they are radiating your entire chest wall where your heart resides.  So, seven years ago I had a heart attack, a major heart attack.  It was called, it's called the widow maker.  Tim Russert, one of the major anchors on CNN died from that same heart attack.  I had it; fortunately, I survived it because my husband [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] insisted that, (laughter) that I go to the hospital or call my friend who was a cardiologist [Charles Athill].  But one of the first questions he asked me--he knew that I'd had breast cancer, being a personal friend--if I was radiated on the left side and was I given Adriamycin, the drug.  So, because I didn't have high blood pressure or high cholesterol, that's the only thing that we could attribute it to.
Story_ID: 652188
Speaker 1: So what happened when you had--where were you and--?
Speaker 2: Well, I was home.  I woke up at like five o'clock in the morning.  And the only symptom I had was I couldn't belch.  That was the only symptom.  And I kept trying to belch, and I kept thinking that I had eaten this spicy salmon the night before, I'm having heartburn and indige- indigestion.  So I get up; I take a Pepcid; I drink ginger ale.  It's not going away.  And I'm a pretty computer type individual, so I went to my computer and I Googled women--symptoms of women having heart attack.  I even read those and dismissed it.  So Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] wakes up.  And I'm walking, and he goes, "What's the matter?"  And I tell him.  He said, "Well, let's go to the hospital."  Well, when you've been through all the cancer and all the treatment and everything that I'd been through, the last thing you want to do is just go to the emergency room.  So, another thirty minutes go by, and I decided that I would call Charles [Charles Athill], my friend who was head of cardiology at Sharp [Sharp Memorial Hospital, San Diego, California], who just lived across the street, African American.  He and his wife was one of my Links [The Links, Incorporated] sisters, so I called him.  And he said, "Well, you know, Tina [HistoryMaker Tina Lewis], you really need to err on the side of caution.  So come on in.  I'll meet you there."  So he calls--I get the--my husband drives me.  I don't call 911.  I don't go in an ambulance.  Harold drives me because I'm fine.  I'm sitting up giving him--you know, you take that exit.  I'm well aware that I'm on my way to the emergency room.  And we get there, and he'd already called in the EKG [electrocardiogram].  And I have the EKG, and I'm sitting up.  Charles walks in.  He reads it.  He looks at me, and he says, "Tina, you're having a heart attack."  He said, "I've called my partner.  He's on his way."  And the next thing I know, Harold is looking at me with this panicked look on his face.  I could just see him looking at me.  And I just, oh, my god, I just didn't want him to have to go through anything else.  You know, his mother [Betty Cabell Golder] died of breast cancer.  I'd been through all of what I'd been through, and now I'm having a heart attack.  So he heads to the chapel.  And I said, "Just call the prayer warriors."  And he goes to the chapel.  And Charles is rolling me, not an orderly, my friend, the chief of cardiology is the one rolling me to procedure room, immediately.  So I'm going to the procedure room.  There's a box on the end of, of my feet.  And I go, "What's that?"  He goes, "Oh, don't worry about that, crash cart."  I didn't even know that.  I did not know how bad it was until after the fact, when he showed it to me.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have it, have it.
Speaker 2: I was having it.
Speaker 1: You were having it.
Speaker 2: I was having it.
Speaker 1: So did they have to put a stint in or--
Speaker 2: Yep, they put a stint in.  I was having it.  And the thing about this: Harold and I--it's all divine intervention.  It's all about God.  God has worked in my life, in my entire life.  We were actually supposed to go to Hawaii the next morning to receive an award from McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation].  My dog came up missing.  And we think the coyotes had got my dog.  The kids [Jeremy Lewis, Jennifer Lewis and Jonathan Lewis] are all away at school.  They were supposed to pick up the dog from boarding, and they were gonna be home for the weekend.  I told Harold, "You go to Hawaii.  I can't let them come home and tell them--it was their dog--that their dog was gone."  I was gonna stay.  He said, "No; I'm not going without you."  So, if Harold had gone to Hawaii to receive the award, I would have stayed in bed and had my full blown heart attack.  But because he didn't and he stayed and wanting me to go to the doctor, that he insisted, is the only reason why I called Charles, and I went.  So my kids get in.  He has to meet them, not tell them over the phone that mom's had a heart attack, and bring them to the hospital.  So, there's no, there's no way to explain my dog coming up missing, me not going to Hawaii to get our award for our twenty--whatever, whatever award it was.  I don't remember, some McDonald's award.  It was an anniversary award.  It's divine intervention.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: There's no question about it.  And never found my dog; took seven years for me to get another one.  My little puppy was my anniversary, the same breed.  He gave me the same color, same breed last year for our anniversary.  It took me seven years to be able to do it again.  But just, I'm supposed to be here talking to you.
Story_ID: 652189
Speaker 1: I want to ask about--you know, I, I can't end this interview without asking about the Trumpet Awards, because--
Speaker 2: Well, that's really Harold [Lewis' husband, HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] though.
Speaker 1: That's, okay, that's Harold.  Okay, I won't ask it, okay.  You know, I am--I can't help but be struck about the whole arc of your life, because you know, we think of the American dream, and in many ways you have personified the American dream.  So I want to ask you--because you've had during all this time period time to think, do a lot of sort of thinking.  And I know you talk about, about divine inspiration.  But I'd like to you cast when you think back about Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and the, the dirt road and your parents, eight--you know, being really eighteen or nineteen, can you talk about your life and your, and your kids [Jeremy Lewis, Jennifer Lewis and Jonathan Lewis], I mean that whole arc?  Can you talk about the, your life in that, in those terms?  And, and I know that the spiritual has played a role, but I want to talk about the other parts of, you know--
Speaker 2: You know, my father [Charles Ricard, Sr.]--a black man in the South got no respect, you know.  He had to walk on eggshells.  He had to say, "Yes, sir," "No, sir," "Yes, ma'am," "No, ma'am."  You know, in the South, people were lynched and killed when I was growing up.  People died because of the color of their skin.  I knew that I was different, as a Creole, because actually I was not liked.  I was not liked by darker color black people, and I was not liked by white people.  I knew this; I found this out when my mother [Mary LeDuff Ricard] took me to swimming lessons at Brooks Park [City-Brooks Community Park] in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], because we had a black swimming instructor.  And I'm yellow.  And I remember him saying, "We have a yella."  I was called a yella.  Well, you know, and then I'd have to walk past the predominantly--well, the all-black school.  McKinley High [McKinley Senior High School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] was an all-black school.  And we were not--we were disliked 'caused we were the little Catholic school girl--girls and boys that went to the little private Catholic school [St. Francis Xavier Catholic School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] right down the street, right next door actually.  In fact, my cousin taught over there at McKinley.  But you know, I was in the middle, you know.  Where do I fit in?  I'm not, I'm not black; I'm not white.  Where do I fit in?  It wasn't until, that I came to California that I really understood where I fit in.  And I fit in because I am black.  You know, even though my parents never said to me you are a black person, I, that was my identity.  And I think that is when I became who I became as a militant, because I knew who I was then.  And I knew that it--justice wasn't just; fair wasn't fair.  You know, I rode in the back of the bus with my mother, as she was pregnant, standing, to give up her seat to a white man.  And I know what the, the bus is like.  That was a rotating section.  So when you got on the bus you had this white section, and the more white people came on, that little sign moved until there was no place for blacks to stand or colored to stand.  I was a--first of all, I was colored back then.  And I remember my mother standing when we took the bus to go shopping downtown, and she's pregnant having giving up her seat to a white man.  So I saw that.  I saw what the colored water fountain looked like.  It was dirty and filthy.  And the white water fountain was cool and refrigerated; and the colored restroom and the white restroom.  I knew what I had to use versus what they used.
Story_ID: 652190
Speaker 1: So, when my twins were in the third grade, their white teacher--and they went to a predom- predominantly white school--was teaching the Civil Rights Movement.  And I saw the book opened on her desk, 'cause I volunteered in the classroom.  And I said to her, I said, "You're teaching the civil rights?"  She said, "Yes."  I said, "How would you like me to come in and speak?  I could--I can tell you a lot about it."  And she said, "Okay."  She wasn't prepared for me, because I went and did my homework.  I had photographs of the colored water fountain, the white water fountain, the colored restroom, the white restroom.  I had--but more than that, I had to explain to these kids in the third grade that were mostly white what it felt like to be discriminated against and put it into context that they could understand.  So, the only way I could do it, outside of these photographs, was to separate the kids into two groups, light eyes and dark eyes.  And of course, one of my children, who's (laughter), who's black, has light eyes, but he [Jonathan Lewis] had to go on that side, and his sister [Jennifer Lewis] was on the other side (laughter).  So the twins, they have different eye color.  So basically, I painted a picture in present day to them of what they would have over here and what they would be deprived of over here.  And that's the way I explained it to them.  But other than that, other than seeing that, as a child and knowing what that meant, I was still protected and sheltered and loved, and didn't know that I was poor and needy, because my father was very hardworking and provided what, what we needed, even though when it was freezing we didn't have central heat.  We had this little heater on the floor.  That's what, that's what we used.  That's all we had.  I didn't know anything about central heat.  But you know, I knew that my parents [Mary LeDuff Ricard and Charles Ricard, Sr.] loved me and provided for me.
Story_ID: 652191
Speaker 1: And for someone who's given so much back to the black community, what are your hopes and concerns as you--as we sit here today?
Speaker 2: Well, with every scholarship, for example, that we give, the criteria is that they, when they receive their degree and come back into whatever position and career, they have to give back.  So if nothing else, what we have done will triple, quadruple, et cetera.  So, it will keep giving; so whatever gift we've given will keep giving.
Speaker 1: And what do you feel the importance of philanthropy?
Speaker 2: The importance of?
Speaker 1: Philanthropy in the black community?
Speaker 2: If, if, if we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What--
Speaker 2: --don't, if we don't, who will?  You know, who supports the Little League teams?  You know, who--businesses, you know, the businesses in those community, you know, buys the uniforms and the, and, and you know, the Boys and Girls Clubs [Boys and Girls Clubs of America] and Jackie Robinson YMCA [Jackie Robinson Family YMCA, San Diego, California] and you know, those things, we, we, we do that.  When Harold [Lewis' husband, HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] and I were in San Diego [California], we were spons- we were responsible for giving the largest contribution to UNCF [United Negro College Fund] in the history of San Diego.  Hopefully, they've succeeded that since we've left.  And you know, we're still, we're still involved.  I'm being featured in the calendar, 2014, to raise money for HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], so that's exciting.  I'm, I'm happy to do that.
Story_ID: 652192
Speaker 1: What does it take to be an entrepreneur?  You didn't--I mean, 'cause--what does it take, as you sit here, you, you and your husband?
Speaker 2: You have to be willing to take the risk.  When we stepped out and did the pri- printing business [Sir Speedy, Inc.], we just kind of had an idea of what we wanted to do.  But we sat down and did an organizational chart like we were a big corporation.  That's what we did.  "Okay, Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis], you're gonna do this, and I'm gonna do this.  We're--this is the only way we're gonna work together," 'cause we're very much--I'm a very strong willed, independent woman, and so is he, not a woman, of course.  But you know, we were gonna bump heads, and we knew that.  So I had to have my area, and he had to have his, and we continued that into McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation].  So, you have to be willing to take the risk, put everything on the line.  So when we sold the house, we sold the printing business, to put everything in McDonald's, there was another option.  We could have come in on a different kind of plan, but we came in on a conventional plan where we paid our--for our restaurant up front.  The other one, I don't if it's even available, but it's a lease option.  And you come in and you buy the restaurant three years later.  Well, that's buying wholesale versus retail.  So we wanted to buy our restaurant wholesale versus having to pay for what that restaurant was doing in three years.  That's the difference.  So it was a lot of sacrifice in order to do it.  It meant living in that rental house longer than--you know, we had to sell our house and you know, smaller quarters, give up.  When we drove--when he drove his car from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] to San Diego [California], he had, it was a crank window.  He had to crank it up halfway, pull it up the rest of the way.  Today I drive a Rolls Royce that he gave me 'cause he wanted me to have it.  You know, my husband does so much for me because of what I've been through.  Most of the things he does he says he looks back at all the, everything that I've been through.  He just feels like I deserve, you know, and I, I appreciate that.
Speaker 1: So you've been partners in life, marriage, and business.  What do you attribute your success to that?
Speaker 2: We have a loving marriage.  We love each other.  You know, we love being together.  He doesn't even like to take business trips unless I'm with him.  So, he flew to Burbank [California].  He's back tomorrow, but he doesn't even like to go unless I'm with him.  He's--you know, we, we--when I finished my chemo [chemotherapy] for colorectal cancer, we had been married, it was our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.  It was right before I was diagnosed with breast cancer, the month before.  And we had a big twenty-fifth wedding anniversary and ninety people, sit down dinner, fabulous live entertainment.  Oh, it was fabulous.  And I told everyone he's my rock; he really is my rock.  He got me through everything I've been through.  And he'll probably tell you I'm his rock.

Speaker 1: What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: What do I want?
Speaker 1: Want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: You know, Harold [Lewis' husband, HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] al- he give a lot of speeches, and he always talks about the dash, you know, and you've heard that story.  It's what you do with the dash, you know, 1948 to 19--to 2025, whatever year that I'm gonna leave this earth, that dash.  I just, what I really want to be remembered, first and foremost is by my children [Jeremy Lewis, Jennifer Lewis and Jonathan Lewis].  You know, to me, no matter what I've done for anybody else, I want to be remembered by my children for what I've given them.  And, and what I mean by that is in their character, in their beliefs, in their morals.  That's foremost for me.  You know, we have our name down at the Smith Center [Smith Center for the Performing Arts, Las Vegas, Nevada] for, you know, what we've donated down there.  And I know that, you know, those recipients of all our scholarships, you know, will remember us.  But I want to be remembered as the little colored girl who grew up in Louisiana whose daddy [Charles Ricard, Sr.] had a vision for something better for her, and she used it.  I feel like he really did it for me.  I am more successful than my siblings, but I am firstborn.  And a lot of firstborns are more successful.  Not that they are struggling, you know, but they work; you know, they have jobs.  They're not entrepreneurs, but they, you know, they're doing well.  Their health is good.  They love me.  We, we have a great relationship, because I'm their other mother in a sense.  You know, I, I was the chief baby, babysitt- sitter when they were little, so.  My sister [Connie Ricard (ph.)] lives here.  She took care of my mother [Mary LeDuff Ricard] for fifteen years after my mother passed--after my father passed.  And she lived with us.  She lived in one of our properties.  She works.  She finally met someone after a terrible divorce, and she's happy.  And I knew when my mother passed she would, she would move here with me.  So, it's nice to have some family here.  But the rest of my brothers [Gregory Ricard (ph.) and Gerald Ricard (ph.)] are still in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], except the one that lives in Canada [Charles Ricard, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's it.  Thank you, thank you.  We ask--do, do you want me to ask you, 'cause we ask legacy, but I felt you had answered your legacy.  But if you want to, we ask--we always end with the legacy, but I felt like you did that so well.
Speaker 2: I did, I did that in my children, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The children are, are, they're my legacy--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --our legacy, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Oh, wonderful.  Okay, we're done.

Speaker 2: Okay, so go left to right.
Speaker 1: The year is 1997, and it's my parents' fiftieth wedding anniversary.  My sister, Connie [Connie Ricard (ph.)], is on the far left.  My brother, Charles, Jr. [Charles Ricard, Jr.], is next to her.  My brother, Gerald [Gerald Ricard (ph.)], is just behind my father, who's in that white jacket, and my mom, Mary Ann [Mary LeDuff Ricard] is next to him.  And there I am in the blue dress, much thinner then (laughter), and my brother, Gregory [Gregory Ricard (ph.)], is on my side.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, and your father's name?
Speaker 1: Charles Ricard [Charles Ricard, Sr.].  My mother is Mary Ann LeDuff Ricard.
Speaker 2: Can you spell those last--
Speaker 1: Ricard, R-I-C-A-R-D, LeDuff, L-E capital D-U-F-F.
Speaker 2: Wow, the year is 1999, and it's Christmas.  My dad was just diagnosed with cancer.  And it's me with my children and mom and dad at their place in Canyon Lake [California].  My sister is also in the picture, Connie, my--the twins, Jennifer [Jennifer Lewis] and Jonathan [Jonathan Lewis], Jeremy, mom and dad, and then myself.  I'm standing next to my dad.
Speaker 1: You know, I was thinking, you like the Js.
Speaker 2: All Js.
Speaker 1: Oh, my gosh, the twins (laughter).  This is Kwanzaa.  The twins are--let's see--this is probably 1994, 1995.  We were at a Kwanzaa celebration, all dressed up in our African attire, Jeremy on the left; I'm in the center, Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis]; and there are the twins, Jennifer and Jonathan, in their matching Kwanzaa outfits (laughter).  Lot of fun that day.
Speaker 2: December, 1974, December 21st, the day we were married.  There we are, nice and thin and young (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, it's Jonathan and Jennifer, the twins.  Gosh, how old are they?  Well, they're losing teeth (laughter).  God, what year was that?  Probably ninety--1992, '93 [1993], somewhere around there, and Jonathan looking just like one of my brothers (laughter).
Speaker 2: Wow, mom and dad dancing at their fiftieth wedding anniversary.  We had to make dad wear that tuxedo, force him.  He didn't want to wear it.  And it was a surprise.  They had no idea what we were doing.  They had a ball.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) My surprise sixtieth birthday party.  My daughter and my husband planned the whole thing.  In fact, he ended up in the hospital, he was stressed out the night before (laughter), trying to keep it a surprise from me.  But there's Jeremy, Jennifer, Harold, myself, and Jonathan, live band in the background.  We had a great time (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, Jeremy Lewis, oh, 1995, McDonald's All-American basketball.  That was his high school photograph, but he was a McDonald's All-American, Jeremy Lewis, my firstborn.
Speaker 1: Wow, what year is that?  I think that's before children, before marriage.  That's my husband and his mother, Betty Jane Golder [Betty Cabell Golder], taken in Indianapolis [Indiana] when we went back to visit.  We were actually engaged there, so I think that's 1974.
Speaker 2: Wow, what year is this?  Well, it's definitely B.C., and that's called before cancer, because I hadn't lost my hair yet.  So, or was it after?  They look older, wow.  We were on a cruise, and that was taken on the cruise ship.  And I can't remember what cruise it is.  But that's my, that's my family.  They're still in high school.  The twins are twill--still in high school.
Speaker 1: That's Jennifer and Jonathan's graduation picture from high school.  I insisted that they take pictures together and separate.  So that's 19--grad-  when did they graduate?  This is terrible when you don't remember years.  Can't remember what year they graduated.  I'd have to back up--so, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven--2007.

Speaker 1: That's a picture of us just two years ago at the Barrett-Jackson automobile auction.  We were the guest of Craig Jackson and his wife, Carolyn [Carolyn Mullany Jackson].  They're friends of ours.
Speaker 2: That's a photograph of me and my sister, Connie [Connie Ricard (ph.)].  I think I was still in college back then.  And as you can tell, I'm fifteen years her senior.  The, that was the beginning of my Afro.  I had to really work on that (laughter).
Speaker 1: And there I am, full blown Afro (laughter), my militant days, ungawa, black power.  I think I'm gonna frame that (laughter).
Speaker 2: You should.
Speaker 1: This picture was taken when I was in elementary school at St. France Xavier [sic. St. Francis Xavier Catholic School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  My dad [Charles Ricard, Sr.] may have taken that photograph.  In fact, we might have been in Mississippi, visiting Father Calamari [ph.], a friend of my family.  Think I was in uniform.  Yeah, that's a uniform blouse.
Speaker 2: Oh, my gosh (laughter), yes, I did modeling.  I modeled for several things.  This one was for Sylvia Stevens.  I think it was a, adep- a boutique that I did an ad for, before United Airlines, must have been--
Speaker 1: Nineteen.
Speaker 2: --nineteen, yep, nineteen years old.
Speaker 1: And here's one I did for Golden Bird fried chicken [Golden Bird, Inc.], not knowing that many years later I would meet Zelma Stennis [Zelma Miles Stennis], who was a friend of my husband [HistoryMaker Harold Lewis] and a friend of my mother-in-law [Betty Cabell Golder], who owned Golden Bird.  I did an ad for them.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's, that's adorable.
Speaker 1: Yep, I was nineteen.
Speaker 2: Wow, this is a photograph that was taken, wow, at the Trumpet Awards.  And we're with Don Thompson [Donald Thompson] and Liz Thompson [Elizabeth Thompson].  I think Don was receiving a Trumpet that year.  That was 2005, maybe.
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe.
Speaker 2: Oh, you didn't find that (laughter).  Well, in my little neighborhood where I grew up on Arizona Street [Baton Rouge, Louisiana], there was a man that would come around with this horse.  And we would take pictures on this horse.  I remember this day because there were only three of us at that time, three.  My, my parents only had three kids, myself, Charles [Charles Ricard, Jr.], and Gregory [Gregory Ricard (ph.)].  The, the others were not born yet.  So I must have been five, four or five years old.  And the horse came.  We all got on, took a picture with--on the horse.  But when my brother, Gregory, got on the horse, he didn't want to get off.  He said, "This is my horse."  He was just crying.  It was, it was a good, it's a good memory.  And I have a--my brothers had cow- had guns, and it was one of my brothers' guns I'm actually holding.
Speaker 1: Wow, oh, oh--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you mean play guns.
Speaker 2: Play guns, of course.
Speaker 1: Oh no, you didn't (laughter).  Yes, that's me, all, all a hundred and five pounds, in my United flight attendant uniform.  This was actually my graduation from, from United Airlines school to become a flight attendant.  That's the actual official photograph.
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know that part.
Speaker 1: You didn't (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Wow, this is a, actually, this is the walk of fame [Civil Rights Walk of Fame] at The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia].  And we're sitting her with our good friend Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young].  He's a great guy.
Speaker 1: He is.
Speaker 2: This is actually at the residence of the Bidens [Jill Biden and Joe Biden], which is on the naval academy there in Washington, D.C.  They host the, the evening prior to the national Race for the Cure for Susan G. Komen.  They host us every year with a, a party at their residence.  And this was taken I think two years ago at their home there on the naval base [United States Naval Observatory].
Speaker 1: Did we do this one?
Speaker 2: No.  This is mom [Mary LeDuff Ricard] and dad, might have been, and I think it was, might have been their thirty-fifth wedding anniversary, taken in the living room on Ogden Drive [Los Angeles, California].  I miss them.
