Speaker 1: So I'm Shawn.
Speaker 2: Shawn?
Speaker 1: Shawn, right, Wilson [Shawn Wilson], the interviewer and then this is Nick, Neculai Burghelea (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Good looking, Neculai (laughter).
Speaker 1: --the videographer, and I will have you state your name and spell it out for me.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm [HistoryMaker] James H. Gilliam, Sr.  Most of my friends either call me Jim or G, eh?
Speaker 1: G?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What's your date of birth, Mr. Gilliam?
Speaker 2: August the 6th, 1920.
Speaker 1: Your place of birth?
Speaker 2: Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: And today--
Speaker 2: At Johns Hopkins Hospital [The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland], which I could not--my mother [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam] couldn't give me birth there because the policy that the hospital at that time would--no people of color could use their maternal facilities.  I was born at home, 817 Rutland Avenue, on the east side of Baltimore.  And what would happen is that, to use the common vernacular or statement, is that when the water broke somebody from the neighborhood would run up to emergency at Johns Hopkins Hospital and one of the interns would come down and oversee the birth.  And that was true not only with me but my sister, who died from some illness, I think it was, I don't know, when she was six months of age.
Speaker 1: Are you good Neculai?  Good, okay today's date?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So, today's date?
Speaker 1: Say what?
Speaker 2: Today's date?
Speaker 1: Today's date is December the 18th I think.
Speaker 2: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) O'five [2005] (laughter).
Speaker 2: O'five [2005], thank you (laughter), and then the location of this interview?
Speaker 1: It's at a retirement community known as Cokesbury [Cokesbury Village, Hockessin, Delaware] in Wilmington, Delaware.
Speaker 2: And your occupation?
Speaker 1: I'm retired, yeah, but I also have a small consulting business and that's about it.
Story_ID: 314521
Speaker 1: I'm gonna start with five basic questions and you can (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: --just give me simple answers, and so Mr. Gilliam [HistoryMaker James H. Gilliam, Sr.], what's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I'm not a food person; I like very substantial foods like beef stew, chicken and dumplings very much.  Things, normal foods for people, hot dogs and beans, I love lima bean soup.  But, I'm really not a food person.
Speaker 1: What about your favorite time of year, what's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I would have, I would say the spring and the fall because I like the temperature then, and I don't particularly like extremes, either cold or heat, so that's it.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue (laughter).
Speaker 1: What about your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Desti- favorite vacation destination?  I would--whatever my interest is at that particular time, which would expand that.  As a military person I enjoyed my experiences in Europe and especially my experience during World War II [WWII] when I lived and spent most of my time in the Tuscany area of Italy.  And I had wanted very much to go back there, but I don't like all of the inconveniences that go with going through a commercial airport.  And, I guess in a way I'm spoiled a little bit because my son [James H. Gilliam, Jr.] had access to a private plane, and a couple of my consulting contracts the people that I contracted with, were very, very nice people and they, they had big fleets of planes, and every now and then I could, I could hustle a ride and that's the way to travel.
Speaker 1: It is the way to travel.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what, last question of these five, do you have a favorite phrase or favorite saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite what?
Speaker 1: Like a favorite phrase or favorite slogan, favorite (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not really.
Speaker 1: Nothing that your mother [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam] said, that used to say that sticks with you even today?
Speaker 2: --well, I always use as a kind of a marker for what I do, I recognize the fact that, that people in the whole process of living that there're problems you're gonna have to face up to and I can recall coming home and my mother would ask me, "How did things go today?"  And I would tell her some of these things in a kind of a complaining way, and conversation stopped and then I would get the question, "Well, what did you do about it?"  And I have a, I've, I kind of remember that, and I think that that's had a great deal to do with how I handle, quote, end of quote, problems.  Not just to let the, the problem fester--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: --but to, get on with it to try to do something about it.  And that, that has been the kind of bell ringing action I guess that I've taken in this whole--in all of my efforts to try to make this world a better place for people to live in and especially people of color.  And I'm not sure that I'll ever change.
Story_ID: 314522
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam] a little bit.  What was your mother's name, what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother?  My mother was born in a small community in Virginia, known as Jetersville, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: J-E-T-E-R-S-V-I-I-L-L-E, Virginia, down near Blackstone [Virginia] and Crewe [Virginia].  And Blackstone is where my father [James E. Gilliam] was born.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother right now--let's see, I'm eighty-five and my mother was nineteen years older than me so you can go from there.  Eighty, eighty-five, ninety-five, she would be--
Speaker 1: She was born in 1901--
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah, 1901, you got a young, young mind (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well that's an easy number there, 1901.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was born in 1901.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you--when you were a child did your mother ever talk to you about her childhood, about her own background, about what her life had been like, now was this a plantation she was born on?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was never--I cannot recall when either side, my mother or father, any conversations about slavery--
Speaker 1: And why, why was that, why do you think that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can't answer--
Speaker 1: --because it didn't exist or because they didn't wanna talk about it?
Speaker 2: I don't think it was intentional, I guess she just never thought about it.  The, some of the younger members of our family, right now, into the business of looking at family, genealogy I guess is the word, and to my surprise I've had--I can trace some of the ancestors that I have back to 1620 from England.  And eventually wound up being very, very significant land owners and in the process of checking the records I found that some of the members of my family were slave owners, and they were slave owners in the sense that slaves were property, and when they would talk about the fact that they owned five hundred acres of land someplace there, and they owned thirteen slaves and they would put a value on them, and so it was in the context of property that I discovered that, but me, within a generational thing that I know about it was no conversation about slavery.  Although I know that it was very much the case, and the thing that I think about a great deal now because there was a real kind of mixture, ethnic mixture in my family of blacks, Indians, whites, whatever, and I got into this because there was some conversation about our family getting together, and incidentally over the last five years or so, there had been a real move to bring together branches of our family we didn't even know about.  My father, [maternal] grandfather, Jacob, Jacob Lipscomb as I understa- I found out about three years ago had a brother, and with that brother a split occurred, in other words when a decision was made to tell the Indian [Native American] tribes, you go to the reservation or you're on your own and then a decision was made, which way do you want to go white or black, and a part of my mother's family went white and they were located down around Richmond [Virginia].  That brother moved to that area, and my mother's father made a decision he would stay here.  I think it's a kind of a dated kind of a recollection I have.  The interesting thing was and cause me to do a little bit of research is that the Indians, for whatever reason, had a real, real kind of close warm relationship with, with black folks back in those days.  Hence the fact that some of them stayed and married blacks so to speak.  And, but, for whatever reason I have a cousin who is very interested in family history, and she's the one that really has warmed up this relationship between the other family and--side of the family, and the one that I'm most familiar with.  When you see 'em you know there was some difference, right.
Story_ID: 314523
Speaker 1: So before we look for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You asked me her name, my mother's name, maiden name was Pocahontas Lipscomb, L-I-P-S-C-O-M-B, Pocahontas Lipscomb.
Speaker 1: So now was your mother--what did your mother look like?  Did she look Indian [Native American], did she look black?
Speaker 2: She could've been just about anything, and you'll see a picture of her, she's very, very fair.  And my father [James E. Gilliam] was medium brown.
Speaker 1: So to continue talking about your mother, did you, did you ever have the opportunity to meet your mother's parents, your grandparents (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh--
Speaker 1: --on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: --oh yeah.
Speaker 1: What were their names?
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: Where were they born, what do you remember about them?
Speaker 2: My maternal grandfather's name was Jacob, Jacob T. Lipscomb, and my mother's mother, her name was Lorelei [Lorelai Lipscomb (ph.)], and don't ask me how to--it was spelled.  But my grandfather also had several other children by a different mother.
Speaker 1: Now, Lipscomb what type of a name is that, is it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, you don't know.   But your--what did your grandfather look like, was he himself a black man or was he--
Speaker 2: No, no, he looked--
Speaker 1: --did he live under something else--
Speaker 2: --he was, he looked more Indian I--
Speaker 1: Indian--
Speaker 2: --would have to say.
Speaker 1: So he lived his life as an Indian?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: As a black man?
Speaker 2: That's right.  Actually, he didn't have much education either, he spent most of his time farming, very good craftsman, he would do cane work as far as chairs were concerned, and he was a good self-taught carpenter, shoe repair person.  He did that kind of work, never--very, very low income, and not very well educated.
Speaker 1: And your grandmother, what type of work did she do was she a domestic?
Speaker 2: I don't remember her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I've never met her, I've never met (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your mother's mother?
Speaker 2: My mother's mother--
Speaker 1: We're talking about, right.
Speaker 2: My father's--
Speaker 1: But we're talking about your mother's side just to keep them straight--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for the moment--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So you never met your mother's mother?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a reason?
Speaker 2: Well she, yeah, she was dead (laughter).
Speaker 1: She died before you were born.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 314524
Speaker 1: So do you have any early memories of your--what do you remember about your mother [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam], your mother as you were a child.  What type of a mother was she?
Speaker 2: Oh she was a--
Speaker 1: You said she was a domestic.
Speaker 2: She was a domestic but she had a style about her.  I didn't know much about it and we never talked a great deal about her early life and purely by coincidence I was talking to her, I was a grown person then, and I talked to her about, I think it was an institution known as Mary Potter [Mary Potter Academy, Oxford, North Carolina] in Virginia [sic.].  And I don't recall the lady who founded the institution, but I was in a conversation with somebody about that and my mother said, "Oh yeah, I used to go to Mary Potter a lot."  And I said, "Mama, I didn't--grandma, I didn't know that you knew anything about Mary Potter."  She said, "Oh yeah, the people I lived with."  And that's when I found out that she spent a lot of her time working for a Quaker family somewhere in Virginia and I don't know--I think it was either Virginia or North Carolina.  Well, she, she worked for these people, principally because my grandfather [Jacob Lipscomb] couldn't take care of her, and so she worked there and she would talk about this family having tea parties for the students at Mary Potter.  And these are things that I didn't know and, and I really think that that's a pretty important part of my life that I wish I could live over again because I learned a lot about her.  Interestingly enough, like my mother was the kind of person that liked hats, she would wear her hats, she'd have her gloves on, and she looked good, and she, she really was a classy lady in many respects.  I think this is it, she was on this business too of self-improvement, she didn't have time to go to school but what she used to do, she used to order these self-improvement books in English, and things of that sort.  She was a pretty good business person.  As I indicated during one of our side conversations, the fact that she bought this house, and she--and I can't for the life of me understand where she got the money from, but she did it.  She bought this house and one day I looked at her and I say, "Well how can you do this, how could you pay the rent?"  She said, "The other two apartments did."  It was a three apartment house, so she was very enterprising, and she was not a crybaby, she was also a very good seamstress, self-taught.  And did a lot of work for people with money.  In fact, when my wife [Louise Hayley Gilliam] and I first got married we lived with, in one of the apartments.  And she made me pay the rent, and she said that it's very, very important that you pay rent, and a little, a small amount, but she said, "It's very important, nothing comes free," and so I paid this rent, and then I had this son [James H. Gilliam, Jr.], this was after I got out of the [U.S.] Army--
Story_ID: 314525
Speaker 1: I wanna talk a little bit about your father [James E. Gilliam].  What was your father's name and where was your father born, you said he was born in Blacksmith, Virginia, or--?
Speaker 2: No, Blackstone [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Blackstone.
Speaker 2: Blackstone, Virginia.  He was about five years older than my mother [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam], now you go back to when my mother was born and that'll (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So your father roughly 1915--I mean your mother was 1901 so your father's probably like 1896?
Speaker 2: Something like that, and the--very personable, and I think that was part of his problem.  He didn't have much education either, but, he spent a lot of his time as a chauffeur and I can recall, I can recall my father in his chauffeur's uniform with his highly polished patees [ph.] and shoes.  And the object of affection with a lot of ladies, which didn't ride very well with mama, and so he was a real sport, and the two people personality wise and especially in terms of the future, they didn't mesh.  And, so he went packing with some assistance from her, and people who I talked to who remember said he was unquestionably a very, very personable, handsome dude, and that's it.
Speaker 1: And what about your siblings, did you have any--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You were an only (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had--
Speaker 1: --child--
Speaker 2: --no, I had a sister who died, and as we talk about it, I think she died from rheumatic fever.
Speaker 1: So she was your--
Speaker 2: Six months, six--
Speaker 1: Six months--
Speaker 2: --of age, yeah.
Speaker 1: So how old was she when she died?
Speaker 2: Six months.
Speaker 1: Six months old, so she only--so she was a baby--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --so you were raised as an only child?
Speaker 2: That's right, so I was really an only child, that is the correct thing.
Speaker 1: So once your mother and father divorced and your father went away, and your--is that when your mother purchased the home in Baltimore [Maryland], when you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how did she--and so when did you leave Virginia to come to Baltimore?
Speaker 2: Oh, who, me?
Speaker 1: No, your mother?
Speaker 2: Well, she met my father down there, and he worked initially at Bethlehem Steel [Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania], and he had about four brothers and they all settled on the east side of Baltimore.  And, and he came down looking after some of these pretty ladies, and my mama was one of them, and she often reminded me that she foolishly believed him and married him, and that's the only negative comment that I've ever heard her say about him was the fact that all he had was looks and no money (laughter).
Story_ID: 314526
Speaker 1: What else can you tell me about your ancestors before we move on, like, you said that you had a cousin who was doing some digging into your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --family's genealogy, what else can you--what else has been uncovered that you can--
Speaker 2: Well, the thing about the arrival of the first members of our family to this place--
Speaker 1: And who were they?  The--
Speaker 2: Well, well I can--I don't have--I don't recall correctly--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: There was a--one other name that circulates on the maternal side was the name Anderson and, and on the father's [James E. Gilliam] side was the Redd family, R-E-D-D, and I haven't met--I met a lot of the Andersons, many of whom settled up in New Jersey, as did my father's relatives, in Plainfield, New Jersey.  And, and the Lipscombe family in Plainfield was related to my mother's [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam] side, and incidentally they put an E on the Lipscombe, so we would say in a very jocular way, "That's the Lipscombe family with the E (laughter)."
Story_ID: 314527
Speaker 1: So what are your, some of your earliest memories of your own childhood?  What do you remember?  I'm asking you--maybe we'll start with the daily life or holidays, what do you remember?
Speaker 2: No, no, I had a--I think in spite of the lack of money, it was a good time.  I guess I had my share of youthful escapades, some of which brought me pretty close to going to reform school.  But out of respect for my mother [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam], I'm standing before the judge in juvenile court one day, and the judge was berating my mother for not being a good mother because of some incident I had gotten involved in, and I looked at her and I saw the tears streaming down her face and I said to myself, I said, "She'll never cry for me again."  And from that point, point on that was the kind of experience that I had that kind of kept me on track.  I can't ever recall her telling me what time to come in and what have you, because of the kind of work that she was in I was the one who had to get up and she had my breakfast ready for me and she had left, but it was for me to hit the door in time to go to school.  And that started in, I must have been about eight, seven or eight, it was up to me to get up, get dressed, get to school on time, never be late or I would hear about it, and when I came home because her work was kind of in the morning and in the afternoon, and when I would get home she would have me for lunch in those days they didn't have any cafeterias in school, so I had to leave school, go home for lunch and get back to school at one o'clock.  But what she did, she would have my lunch ready for me and so I would eat my lunch and I'd get on back to school.
Speaker 1: Can you describe for me the neighborhood that you lived in, in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Well, it was an all-black neighborhood.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the--did the neighborhood have a name or--
Speaker 2: Not then.
Speaker 1: What was it called?
Speaker 2: Not then.
Speaker 1: Not then?  What side of town was it on?
Speaker 2: Oh it was in northwest Baltimore.  I think they called it the midtown--I don't know what they called it.
Speaker 1: What street did you live on?
Speaker 2: On Madison Avenue, and interestingly enough it was borderline--border street to an area known as Bolton Hill [Baltimore, Maryland] which was all-white, all big houses.  And from what I can understand, Madison Avenue, at that time, big beautiful brownstone houses, and I don't know how much she paid for it but I understand now a house in the block there sold for around $450,000.
Story_ID: 312464
Speaker 1: In the neighborhood there, all black, no smattering of anything, all black, and it reminds me that this may well have been one of the reasons that we didn't get in more trouble, the guys and the ladies.  Because everybody knew your business, and everybody knew each other and it reminds me about this old, this statement that you hear often times with, well it's just a statement about it takes a village to raise a child, well we had a real village.  All of the professionals in the community lived in the neighborhood, for example up the street on the corner of the block is where Anne Wiggins Brown [HistoryMaker Anne Brown] of 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin].  That's where she grew up, Dr. Harry Brown's daughter, and it was Mamie [Mamie Brown], Harriet [Harriet Brown], Henrietta [Henrietta Brown], and Anne Wiggins Brown.  On the other corner was Dr. Williams [George Huntington Williams], who became the first health, black health commissioner in the City of Baltimore [Maryland].  And you had people like that and it was such an important experience there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: That was an important experience because--
Speaker 1: Growing up in that kind of thing--
Speaker 2: Right, but I want you to tell me why that was an important experience.
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it was just--I never gave it a lot of thought other than it--the people were class acts.  People who lived their aspirations, I mean it wasn't one of these things, it just happened.  And I think almost like a tidal wave, I think all of us who lived in that area we were just pulled along and it was a good experience.  The, the other thing too, I like to look upon it as being a PTA [Parent Teacher Association] type of experience, you didn't have to go to school for the teacher to get on your case.  When you was walking to church, and everybody went to church, usually the same church, and so say if I had a teacher, Miss Brown [ph.], and I had acted up in school when my mother [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam] and I would go to church, Miss Jones [ph.], or whatever you wanna call her, looked at my mother and said, "May I have a few moments to talk to you?"  Or, if I had a problem that my mother detected she would say, "Miss Jones, could we speak for a few minutes?"  And sometimes on the walks that you would take, and that was a good recreational thing for us, we'd see Miss Jones sitting on the stoop and she would look at my mother and say, "Mrs. Gilliam, can I have a word with you?"  And the next thing I knew when I got home I'd see a finger pointing at me, "Why did you do that?" (Laughter) She wouldn't berate me in the presence of Miss Jones, but I knew I was gonna catch plain hell when I got home.  So it was that kind of--it had its positives.
Story_ID: 312465
Speaker 1: What were holidays like in your house?
Speaker 2: Oh, we looked forward to them, looked forward to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Christmas for example, what was the traditional Christmas in the--
Speaker 2: A traditional--
Speaker 1: --Nineteen twenties [1920s] in a black house?
Speaker 2: Christmas was getting up, looking forward to Christmas dinner.  I knew I was gonna get a present without absolutely seeing it, but I knew that.  My mother [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam] would get up and go to wherever she was working, serve Christmas dinner, and sometimes that's--she would bring some of the stuff out of the kitchen.  I often laugh when I tell people I was eating loin lamb chops before I could even pay for 'em (laughter).  But it was, on balance it was a good experience, a good experience.  To make sure that I was doing pretty good, my mother oft times would get me a job washing pots and pans where she worked, and I guess that was her way of kind of monitoring my behavior and seeing that I stayed out of trouble (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So how would you say you were involved in your neighborhood [in Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How were you involved in your neighborhood?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Well, the guys would play step ball.
Speaker 1: What ball?
Speaker 2: Step ball.
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: We would throw, throw bo- find a wall and, or throw the ball up on the steps and it would bounce back, and you had to be pretty quick because you didn't oft times know where the ball was going, and of course we had, I had, we had at our place a very, very wide alley, and we would put peach baskets up on a garage door, and that's what we did.  Another good thing was boxing and wrestling and playing sandlot football.  Until the preacher would come and tell us, "Don't play on my grass."  But we would do this and, no, it--when I look at the experience it was a, generally a good experience.
Story_ID: 312466
Speaker 1: So before I move into your early school years I want to know if you remember any sort of racial tension happening to you or around you when you were a child.  Do you remember anything at all about race, now I remember you had the incident with the mayor, but you were a little older then?  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Had an incident what?
Speaker 1: Were--didn't you, you were playing marbles, is that you?  Maybe, maybe I'm getting my--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't--
Speaker 1: --stories mixed up, okay--
Speaker 2: I don't rememb--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but to answer your question, my mother [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam] never made a secret of the fact that we had a problem, and I remember an incident involving a five-and-dime store known as Tommy Tuckers in Baltimore [Maryland].  It, the owner was Jewish but as was the case, in many places at that time, all the employees there were white, and my mother was never very, very, happy about it and she boycotted the store.  She would never go there and then to, to her pleasure, a street corner preacher by the name of Costoni and we used to call him Prophet Costoni, discovered a vacant lot at the corner of McMechen [McMechen Street] and Pennsylvania Avenue and every spring and fall and during the summer, he would put a big tent up there and he would conduct his services there.  So after he had been there about, I guess about two times, he noticed this unfair employment practice with this Tommy Tuckers five-and-dime, and he organized a real boycott, and my mother was very much a part of that, and he fought the thing I think for one summer, but then Costoni, who was a very good rabble-rouser, got into the thing more actively, and Baltimore at that time had a very active NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and the leadership there by the Jackson family and they became a part of this, and then the organizing effort became much more formal, and how shall I say, product producing, and it finally got around to the point of the guy considering hiring people of color.  And he started out initially by putting an ad in the black paper, Afro-American [Baltimore Afro-American] newspaper, hiring clerks, but it'd have a one little line down there, "light skinned colored folks preferred."  And so that became another thing that people got into, when they said we gonna change it, and they did, they did.  So that was the first organized effort that--
Speaker 1: What year was that, do you remember?  How old were you--
Speaker 2: Maybe about 19--early '30s [1930s]--
Speaker 1: Okay so, early '30s [1930s] so they were--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: --boycotting in the early '30s [1930s], so that's pretty early on.
Speaker 2: And then also, in Baltimore, you had some restaurants, one at Pennsylvania Avenue and North Avenue known as Wilson's and what would happen that would become the lunch and dinner place for all the merchants, white, that worked in the area, and blacks couldn't go in there and so she--my mama said even when you could go in on a takeout basis, she said, "Not there, not there."  So we boycotted the place we would never go there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were very aware that there were issues of all--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: --revolving around race very early on?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to element--where did you go to school, elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well the two schools I remember them very well, one was School 103 [Henry Highland Garnet School, Baltimore, Maryland], we had numbers then, and the other was 120 [School 120, Baltimore, Maryland] and all black schools--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So let's start with the first one you went to, which was the first one you went to, 120 or--
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: --103?
Speaker 2: --I think it was 103.
Speaker 1: 103?
Speaker 2: I went to kindergarten there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was supposed to been one of the elitist schools for black folks, 103, and right around the corner was another school that I eventually landed in and it was 125 [School 125; Furman L. Templeton Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland].  And they used to call the kids that went to 103 the fancy kids, and used to come up there and we would have some real, real brawls on the street and I--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --would come home and I'd--and mother [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam], who knew about this, she said, "You have a good time in school today?"  I said, "It was a rough time."  And so we sat down in terms of what to do about it, and she looked at me and she said, "Son, this may be painful for you, but the next time one of those guys from School 125 comes up and roughs you up you ball your fist up and as hard as you can you try to smack him right in the mouth."  And she said, "And I promise you this that eventually he'll leave you alone and the others will get the hint too."  And true enough she was right, so, I learned to brawl pretty good.
Speaker 1: Now were these distinctions, these distinctions with the school have anything to do with skin tone or the lighter--did the lighter guys--colored kids go to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That, I would suppose that was a part of it but the truth of the matter is, is that who you are, and as I indicated the gap between school administrators and the community were virtually nil, so everybody knew who the troublemakers were, who was doing what.  Who the drunkards were, and everything so, that has an element of control over that.  But the thing--when we got into the business here in Wilmington [Delaware], of talking about the desegregation of schools, I often said this, is, "Sure the schools ought to be desegregated because it's not right, but I'm a product of segregated school system education--educational system and I got the best education in the world for the wrong reasons."  Because in Baltimore [Maryland] at that time black teachers couldn't teach in white schools and white schoolteachers couldn't teach in black schools if they wanted to.  So they--it was very, very good to go to school and see these proud black teachers, principals, et cetera walking around, you know.  For example, when I got up to the junior high school level, Booker T. Washington Junior High School [Booker T. Washington Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland], the principal there was a guy by the name of Anderson [ph.], very well groomed male, and proud, and we all respected him.  But also, I think it was either Booker T. or Douglass High School [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland], where we had exposure to Yolande Du Bois [Yolande Du Bois Williams] who was W.E.B. Du Bois' daughter, and a real attractive, great lady.  So these kinds of experiences were really good.  At Douglass High School it became pretty famous for having an activity known as the autumn follies where they would work all year, and all year they would rehearse their songs and their dances, and some of these people became very famous, very famous.  In that block too, where we lived, was the Fortune family and the Fortune family, Jack Fortune [John Fortune], was his name, who was a businessman in--he was married to Cab Calloway's--he was Cab Calloway's stepfather and incidentally, Cab Calloway's widow lives here, Nuffie Calloway [Zulme "Nuffie" MacNeal], so--but it's these kinds of good things that also told me, you gotta do better.
Story_ID: 312468
Speaker 1: When you think about your life, and school, your early school years, are there any teachers or mentors that--people that really helped you along the way that stands (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure--
Speaker 1: --out for you?
Speaker 2: --well absolutely.
Speaker 1: Who are they?
Speaker 2: Can I go into college?
Speaker 1: Well, we'll stay with school and then we'll go to college.
Speaker 2: Well then let me see--
Speaker 1: If there weren't any--
Speaker 2: Oh, there were, several--
Speaker 1: --any in the school--
Speaker 2: --there were several teachers who helped me a lot, but the thing that was--and maybe I can't pinpoint this as much because one other thing I got during the education process, my teachers were also caring people.  It wasn't one of those things when the bell would ring at 3:15 everybody would run out the door.  Those teachers in many cases knew more about our personal lives than we'd like to think about.  And as I say because of the closeness of the neighborhood, everybody knew each other, pretty much or knew somebody who knew everybody, and so your life was an open book, as was their life, as was their life.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--February 1938.
Speaker 1: Thirty-eight [1938]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 312469
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's go back then, 1936, the Olympics [1936 Summer Olympics, Berlin, Germany] when Jesse Jack--I mean when Jesse Owens--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --do you remember that year; do you remember that event when Jesse Owens went to the Olympics in Berlin [Germany]?
Speaker 2: Oh sure.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about it?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember the discriminatory actions on the part of Adolf Hitler.  But to answer your question more specifically, a daughter-in-law, Randilyn Woodruff [Randilyn Woodruff Gilliam] was her maiden name, and her father was John Woodruff, they used to call him Long John Woodruff, who ran the 800 meters during the Olympics, graduated the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] I think, and, so all of that, I didn't know John Woodruff then, but I, as a result of my son's [James H. Gilliam, Jr.] marriage, to his daughter, all of that was remembered very well.
Speaker 1: So you were like a teenager then in 1936?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were--
Speaker 2: Born in 1920.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, I'm counting now (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Sixteen, what do you remember about--I mean did you, what sort of pride did you feel in having a black athlete go and represent your country, and to do so well, were you connected to him in that sense, in some sort of--
Speaker 2: Well, to--
Speaker 1: --black pride?
Speaker 2: --answer your question, of course.  And I think that's the, and I think a sense of pride was really a--because it was a part of me, it was a part of Miss Pokie [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam], who was very race conscious, so I grew up with that experience, and I think it's something that has helped me tremendously.  I know one thing, it certainly helped me through my [U.S.] military career.  Because like most black soldiers, we had to fight two wars, we had to fight the war of civil rights in the military, and then they had to fight the war and it wasn't easy, it wasn't--and it was especially not easy with the 92nd division [92nd Infantry Division].
Speaker 1: Why, why?
Speaker 2: Well because most of the leadership was white and--
Speaker 1: What was the 92nd division?
Speaker 2: The Buffalo division, right.  And, so I went through that whole experience.
Speaker 1: What year did you join the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: I joined the Army in, I think it was 1942, it was '42 [1942].
Speaker 1: So this was even after--I mean in 1938 Joe Louis (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --represented the country--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Germany again--
Speaker 2: And they--
Speaker 1: --or in New York [New York], but--
Speaker 2: And I did join the Army, I was not drafted.  And I joined the Army during a fit of anger because of some discriminatory actions at my place of employment, which was Old-Age and Survivors Insurance [Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance], which is now Social Sec--part of Social Security [Social Security Administration].
Story_ID: 312470
Speaker 1: You graduated high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and then what did you do after high school?
Speaker 2: Well then--I went to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's--
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: You went to--
Speaker 2: Morgan State University [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], and then the draft started coming, and I knew I was classified as 1A, which meant I could be called out of [U.S.] military anytime.  Called out to become a member of the military at any time, but I decided, because of a policy that existed in most colleges at that time that if you were drafted you lost all the time and the credits that you had gotten at school at that time for that year.  And, they eventually changed it into this thing that said, if you were almost completed a semester they would just give you credit for it.  But I decided I wouldn't struggle with that, so I dropped out of school and got me job as a janitor down at Old-Age and Survivors Insurance [Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance].
Speaker 1: Where, what was the name of the insurance company?
Speaker 2: No, it's now Social Security [Social Security Administration].
Speaker 1: It's now Social Security?
Speaker 2: Right, and, located in the Candler Building, in downtown Baltimore [Maryland] and--
Speaker 1: So you were working as a janitor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, and--
Speaker 1: --and you were unhappy--
Speaker 2: --there was a reason for that.  Back in those days they had what I would call a process known as proportional representation, and with proportional representation what it meant was no federal agency in any community could hire more people than the percent of that population of that state compared with the federal government, and the other thing too was knowing somebody, I didn't, we didn't, my family didn't know any people of power like that who could help that process along.  So--but for the lower echelon jobs, like janitors and people like that, they could hire because the salary was so low, I made $960 a year, that's as much as you make a week now, but $960 a year, but the advantage that I had was that if you stayed in that job for six months, you could take an examination, and if you passed it you could become a regular employee, and that's what I did.  And that's how I became a regular employee at Social Security.
Speaker 1: So you worked for the Social Security Administration?
Speaker 2: It was then known as Old-Age and Survivors Insurance.  Yeah, and I, and I worked in the Candler operation in Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: And what did you do?
Speaker 2: I was a machine operator and back in those days--right now they probably don't have them there because of the computer thing but what would happen is that they had the cards, like two by eight cards and on that was all the personal data of an employee and they had to collate the stuff and that's what I did, I ran a collating machine.  And that made me mad too because IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] at that time, these were machines made by IBM and I used to watch all the mechanics who would fix the machines to keep them running, these guys walking around with white shirts and little black ties and white skin, and no black employees in all and that, that angered me a great deal.  But, I had to adjust to it, I was working, yeah, it wasn't easy though.
Story_ID: 312471
Speaker 1: So you said you became so frustrated with this process [at Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance; Social Security Administration] that you decided to join the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: No, well, in a--that was a part of the process, but the thing that really triggered this, my walking out at lunch time one day and saying, "The hell with it."  And I went right across the street to the recruiting station.
Speaker 1: What made you walk out at lunch time?
Speaker 2: No, that's what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In running that machine I became very good at repair work, doing it and then watching these IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] guys fixing it, and if they were shorthanded and I would--if a machine would break down out of pride to keep the union, I mean the unit's production rate high, I would fix the machines, I would fix the machine.  And I'll never forget a young white girl from West Virginia, when I was fixing a machine, not my own, and she said, "Why are you doing this and making this guy look good?"  He was a little white boy who they'd put in there to fill that vacancy.  She said, "You ought to have the vacancy, why are you doing this?"  And I said, "Are you--do I understand you correctly?"  She said, "Yeah."  And she said, "What you ought to do is don't fix the damn machine, just let it break down."  And I did that, and the next thing I knew the unit supervisor said, "Why didn't you fix the machine?"  I said, "It's not my job, I'm not gonna get promoted."  And he said, "You're not being very loyal."  I said, "Okay."  And I walked out the door and went to the recruiting station that afternoon, and they had a policy, they had a policy there at the recruiting station is that if you were there after five o'clock they had the responsibility of feeding you, so I was there after five o'clock and right down the street there was a restaurant, it was actually a cafeteria and I went in the cafeteria, and they wouldn't let me eat there.  I (sneezes)--excuse me--
Speaker 1: Bless you.
Speaker 2: --I had to eat in the kitchen and I'm joining the Army.  So I didn't--wasn't--that wasn't enough to raise a whole lot of hell about at that time because then I left and went to Fort Meade [Fort George G. Meade, Maryland], but I'm joining the Army to fight for this country and I had to eat in the kitchen, interesting (laughter).
Story_ID: 315682
Speaker 1: Before we get to Fort Meade [Fort George G. Meade, Maryland], you were talking about the experience in the rest--in the cafeteria or, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, on Baltimore Street [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: On Baltimore Street, where you went to the recruiting office they, they were supposed to feed you--
Speaker 2: After five o'clock--
Speaker 1: --after five but there was no place for you to sit so you had to eat in the kitchen.
Speaker 2: I had to eat in the kitchen, that's a correct statement.
Speaker 1: Now how did that make you feel because you were just leaving this place [Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance; Social Security Administration] where this white employee, this girl had told you, "Don't fix that machine because they're not gonna to promote you."  And you says, "Well, to heck with this place, I'm gonna leave."  And then you go out and you're gonna join the [U.S.] Army but still you're faced with the same problem because they won't even let you sit and eat where everybody else eats?
Speaker 2: I suppose the best response I can give you, you get used to this kind of thing.  I guess I wasn't conditioned to accept it, but you--that was life, that was life at that time.  And, I guess the only thing I could say is that my day is gonna come, my day is gonna come, and this is not gonna happen to me anymore and that's--if you could get any comfort out of that, that's the comfort level I got.  That talking about me I got to Fort Meade and I think I finally arrived down there about eleven o' clock at night, and because I subsequently found out that because of shipping orders that night they gave me, gave us our intelligence tests at twelve o'clock, at midnight.  And however it worked out I must've done pretty good, because the first assignment that I had was with the United States Army Air Corps in Jefferson Barracks, Missouri [Jefferson Barracks Military Post, St. Louis County, Missouri].  And, and after I arrive--and incidentally when I go to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, all of the non-commissioned officers that I had were white.  And this was a whole black unit that--group contingency that went out there, and it was after I got there that I found that this was going to be an experimental group with the United States Air Corps.  It was supposed to have been based on IQ tests that they selected a group of guys that came in there from D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and the Maryland area.  All of whom had some college training, now necessarily I wasn't a graduate but with some college training, and had a certain IQ, I think you had to have an IQ of more than about 126 to get in this unit and the purpose of this selection process, this was supposed to be the group that they would pull the first class of aircraft mechanics and controllers and other people in that kind of technical area based on the fact that we could learn pretty good.  So, I found myself in this elitist group and the thing that made all this worthwhile was the fact that I was in St. Louis [Missouri] where they--and with all this kind of elitists group folks arriving there, all of the army service clubs, a lot of the parents wouldn't let--allow their daughters to go there because this was a pretty elitist group of guys, was some beautiful, some beautiful St. Louis ladies we met.  And the families were very--welcoming us with open arms.  And some of the guys developed relationships even when they went into their regular units and went overseas they came back, and in many instances some of them didn't go home to their wives either, they went to St. Louis, Missouri.  But the--it was a good experience and I was very fortunate there in that I was promoted pretty quickly.
Speaker 1: What year did they send you overseas to Tuscany [Italy]?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, I didn't go overseas for some time, not with that unit, because I left there.  I worked my way up to becoming a staff sergeant; I did that in six months.
Speaker 1: So you joined the Army in what year, 19--
Speaker 2: Forty-two [1942].
Speaker 1: --forty-two [1942], okay, six months you work your way up to a staff sergeant?
Speaker 2: Six months I worked up--my way up to becoming a staff sergeant.
Story_ID: 315683
Speaker 1: I had put in an application to go to United States--to get a commission at the administrative office in United States Army Air Corps.  But then they discovered that I was colorblind, and therefore they didn't want a colorblind person flying one of their airplanes.  So that knocked me out of that, but then they offered me a chance to go to officers training [Officer Candidate School] at Fort Benning, Georgia as an infantry officer, and that's how I landed in the infantry.  I went down there as one of three black candidates in the class of about three hundred, and what happened is that when we arrived there, they put the three of us up in a room separated from everybody else in the barracks; you know what an army barracks looks like?  Well, we were up in the non-commissioned officers' quarters up on the second floor and even though--clearly segregation, they did us a favor because it put the three of us up there and we bonded, and we became good friends, and I think I'm the only one of the three left, it was a guy in there by the name of James Leonard from out in Ohio, a graduate of Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio]  and then there was a guy that I was especially close to but I can't remember his name now, he became president pro tem of the Buffalo, New York city council, Delmar Mitchell was his name.  And so the three of us stayed together and did well.  We finished, all three of us finished, half of the other class never made it, never made it.  And, so that was a good experience, and then when I finished there is where they sent me to Fort Huachuca, Arizona and that where the 92nd Division [92nd Infantry Division] was being pulled together.  And when I arrived there, white officers sat at one table, black officers sat at another and I said, "This isn't right."  So I just went over and sat at the white officers' table and began to break the whole thing up (laughter).  But it was interesting.
Speaker 2: What was the response when you sat at the white officers' table?
Speaker 1: One of the (laughter) you know, "Is--he's crazy, who in the hell is he?"  And it really, it really wasn't a bad transition once you got into it.  And they had a commanding general by the name of E.M. Almond, A-L-M-O-N-D [Edward M. Almond] who never created much of a image of being fair and willing to give black soldiers a chance, black officers a chance.  The whole thing was an element of segregation.  For example, when I graduated from officers training center, they put us in, was like a holding barracks, and I got in this holding barracks and stayed there for three months, two or three months after graduation, and this is without knowing anything factually, but it's a suspicion on my part that they kept us there because they had new outfits being formed all over the place like the 92nd, and I recall getting there and seeing some of my classmates who happened to be white in good positions of--not company command, but being next to that or holding some good staff positions.  So when we arrived there they were all gone, and I suspect that's maybe one of the reasons why they kept us there, to--for reasons of not obtaining seniority.  And with these white guys going out there being assigned to these units, they could do it pretty much because they were in the formation period.
Story_ID: 315684
Speaker 1: During these early days of you being in the [U.S.] Armed Forces were you, were you active out--were you active in the community as well?  Were you active outside of the army in the communities that you were living in?  Like were you aware of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, oh--
Speaker 1: --time?  Were you aware of--
Speaker 2: Well, Pokie [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam] again, but, (laughter) but the other part of it thought it was, it was a socially desirable thing to do.  It wasn't going to an activity like they used to have loads of social activities in various churches and also many sponsored by the NAACP in Baltimore [Maryland].  That was the place to be on Sunday afternoon.  That's when you had a chance to kind of relate to some of them pretty girls, and get some cookies and punch and so that was the place to be.  And as a result of it, yeah, you got involved, you--
Speaker 1: So in 19--December 1944 when--during--when--were you still in the service at the time of Pearl Harbor?
Speaker 2: When, in '44 [1944]?
Speaker 1: Forty-four [1944].
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I didn't get out until four--1946.
Speaker 1: Forty-six [1946], now was Pearl Harbor, I forget was it '44 [1944] or forty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Huh?
Speaker 1: Pearl Harbor, was that in 1944--
Speaker 2: No that was in--
Speaker 1: --forty-one [1941]?--
Speaker 2: --that was '41 [1941].
Speaker 1: Forty-one [1941], right.
Speaker 2: That was '41 [1941]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: I think.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  December 7th.
Speaker 2: December 7th, '41 [1941].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that, that I--then actually that was prior to you.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: That was prior to you joining the armed--
Speaker 1: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 2: --yeah, okay.  So, what--
Speaker 1: And incidentally, the--I did toy with the idea at one time of joining the [U.S.] Navy because I had a couple of buddies who lived in the block there, who I'd like to see 'em when they would come home on leave in their uniforms and they had some money, and they weren't making a lot of money but more than I was making.  And the Gilmore [ph.] family, and both of the brothers joined the Navy, but then as I got older that's the only, in fact that was the only way that you could get into the Navy was become a messman.  You had to join the mess department, that's how you did it.  You, you couldn't become a--involved in any other activity other than as a mess boy.
Speaker 2: Which meant you were a cook or a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Cook--
Speaker 2: --dishwasher--
Speaker 1: --cook or dishwasher or something like that and that was even true with the [U.S.] Marine Corps, which then was a, I don't know if it is now, but it was just a part of the Navy.  You, you knew that didn't you?
Story_ID: 315685
Speaker 1: I didn't get out of the [U.S.] Army then until 1946.  And the reason being you had to have a certain number of points to get out, and I didn't have enough points to get out, so I didn't get out until 1946.  And that was it.
Speaker 2: And after you left you decided to go back to Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 1: No, what happened, eventually, but what happened I had a, I was married [to Louise Hayley Gilliam] then and I had a son [James H. Gilliam, Jr.], and so I think during that intervening time with my getting out, and going back to college I had to make some money.  So what happened, I went back to Old Age and Survivors Insurance [Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance; Social Security Administration] and got me a job.  And it was while I--oh yeah, and then the--and the other reason that I got that job was because I could work shifts, I could do shift work.  So what would happen when I did go back to Morgan, I went to Morgan during the day and worked at night.  In other words, I'd, I would leave class at Morgan, come home, get my lunch, go out get on to work, and work until 11:30 at night.  So I had a pretty long day, and so I did that until I--I did that for about a year and then a person that I come to know, her name was Harriet Traylor [ph.], who was a well known person in the field of social work, talked to my professor in sociology, his name was Earl Moses, and Harriet at that time was working for the Maryland Tuberculosis Association [American Lung Association of Maryland], and the guy who was the president of the Maryland Tuberculosis Association was a doctor by the name of G. Canby Robinson [George Canby Robinson], who was the person I think responsible for all of the blood collection activities for the Red Cross [American Red Cross], and a staunch Quaker and he said to Harriet one day, he said, "See if you can't find another colored person to work with the Maryland Tuberculosis Association."  Harriet was a black lady, so that's when she talked to Earl Moses and Moses and I had known each other for a long time even before I--when I was at Morgan before that and, and he, he said to her, "Why don't you ask Jim Gilliam [HistoryMaker James H. Gilliam, Sr.]?"  She, she said, "Well, he's a--he's not, he hasn't finished college yet and we need somebody with a degree."  And he said, "Okay."  But she went ahead and talked to Canby Robinson and he said, "Okay."  And I still had one more year of college to go, to do and I needed a job, so he called me in for an interview and he said, "You wanna do it?"  I said, "Well I haven't finished college yet."  He said, "Well, we'll work, work that out."  I said, "But I gotta get to college in time, I got classes."  He said, "We'll take--we'll give you an agency car."  So here I was going back to Morgan with a car (laughter) and every damn thing.  So I did that and I finished, and when I finished college--
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty [1950].  And when I finished college an opportunity came for me to go to graduate school at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and Canby Robinson found out about this and, incidentally, Canby Robinson wrote a book entitled, 'The Patient as a Person[: A Study of the Social Aspects of Illness,' George Canby Robinson] which then was a must read book in the area of human service.  And, he found out that I had this offer to go to college, and Harriet Traylor was once again the person I think who was instrumental in my finding out about this, and, he, he said to me, "You wanna go, you can go."  And when he told his board about my going to Howard, I only had to go two days a week, so I could work at the agency three days and go to school for two days, and the board rejected to it.  They said, "Yeah but if he finishes school and he gets his advanced degree, we're gonna lose him to another agency."  And as I understand it that his response was, "Well at least we can say we got a, we put a qualified person out in the field."  And so he did it and not only did he do this, but he served as my advisor for two years, never missed an advisory meeting, never missed a--so he was--so there are a couple people there who were very influential.
Story_ID: 315686
Speaker 1: So after you finished Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in 19--what year was that you finished Howard?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-two [1952].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-two [1952]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What happened in your life after '52 [1952], 1952?  I mean--
Speaker 2: What happened (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Between '52 [1952] and '58 [1958] when you joined as the senior community organization advisor in Baltimore [Maryland]--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --between those six years--
Speaker 2: --that was it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that was a job that I went to with the housing authority [Housing Authority of Baltimore City].  The housing authority was very, very interested in bringing in what they called the most qualified people to work as a community relations advisor.  And so I did that, paid more money too.
Speaker 1: Now, I've been told that before they were called civil rights they were called community relations, do you have any knowledge about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they--
Speaker 1: --that?
Speaker 2: --were never called civil rights and they wouldn't let them be, be called social workers either.
Speaker 1: I mean I'm talking about the Civil Rights Movement itself.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Like before that movement took hold and people related to their rights as civil rights, people in the community referred to these rights as community relations--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: so that there were people--
Speaker 2: --no, no this, this title community relation advisors related not to the Civil Rights Movement but it related to a belief in the whole housing field that it had to be more housing related as opposed to the social work or human relations kind of thing.  So they held fast to that for whatever they thought the reason for that was right.
Speaker 1: So as the, as the advisor, as a senior community relations advisor, your job was to do what?
Speaker 2: No, it was to bring the community together around projects, and so I started out that way, and then eventually I became the agency community relations person.  And then after that I became an operational chief [for the Baltimore Urban Renewal and Housing Agency].  I had a whole urban renewal area and all the people in there working for me.
Speaker 1: So having--being at the head of this organization and having people work for you, what was your mission?  What were you setting out to do as far as housing in the community?
Speaker 2: I had an important mission and that mission was to get people of color more involved in things.  In addition to carrying out my primary mission of upgrading and changing the community.  And so that's what that was about.  It was, it--and I still do that.  I had to kind of develop maybe even more so than at that time a holistic approach to this business of helping people of color, minority people.  And I feel you can't separate out housing from education and from economic advancement.  All these things become part and parcel of the process, if it's gonna work.  And now to add on thing two, this is, it's not just black folks and reason is, is that you gotta broaden your definition of people of color to include, certainly the Hispanic community.
Speaker 1: Of course, yeah.
Speaker 2: And the Asiatic community, and then that even broadens too, because as a person who likes to think he was a fighter in the trenches as far as black and whites are concerned you also become a little bit of a strategist.  And I know that people have a tendency to affiliate with those things and those people, those factions, call it what you will, that will benefit them the most.  So I decided a whole long time ago when I founded the Urban League [Metropolitan Wilmington Urban League, Wilmington, Delaware] here that I'd rather have them on my team rather than to have another group I got to fight.  And to me that was nothing more than common sense.  And that still has to be done better, because I see things happening, people will either a), affiliate with those people that can help them bet- most or they get strong enough where they can help themselves, and then they become a force in and of themselves.  And my experience is people who usually get the short end of the stick, it's a complexion thing and it, as long as I'm living I'm not going to let that happen.
Speaker 1: Meaning the darker the skin the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, of course--
Speaker 1: --tougher the--
Speaker 2: That's a part of the war that's going on right now in the Hispanic community.  When people started coming in there from Panama, and what have you, and they were dark-complexioned Hispanic speaking people, that's when they--you could see some ruptures occurring in the Hispanic community generally.  And that's a fact.
Story_ID: 315687
Speaker 1: So you said to me earlier that when you--before you actually you left Boston [Massachusetts]--I mean you left Baltimore [Maryland] to come here to Delaware (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --in 1964?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: To take a job?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that you were instrumental in the desegregation of the schools here in Delaware?
Speaker 2: I wasn't instrumental, I was a part of the process, and we're still fighting that war.  That war is still--
Speaker 1: What part of the process were you involved in?
Speaker 2: The whole business of community mobilization.
Speaker 1: How did it come to your--how did the problem come to your table as an issue that you would take on and be a part of helping to rectify?
Speaker 2: Miss Pokie [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam] again.  It was because what was happening was wrong and I had to be a part of making it right.  So that, that's the whole thing.  And I was just one of many.
Speaker 1: But I just want to--you were one of many, but I don't wanna dilute your role.  What role did you play?
Speaker 2: Well as a community mobilizer, as a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well how did you mobilize the community?
Speaker 2: By going out and making speeches and getting into the business of helping people to understand the relationship of a good education and a good education in part has to be overall.  It can't be in this corner and it can't be in this corner it's got to be together.  These people don't have--didn't have the fortunate experience that I had as a black person growing up in an all-black environment because as I say, I had the best teachers in the world from some of the finest schools.  For example the principal of I think it was school one--no, principal of Douglass High School [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland] where I went to was the first Ph.D. graduate at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And that was a kind of experience that these--many of these kids don't get today.
Story_ID: 314534
Speaker 1: Desegregation was only one issue, that there were other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the desegregation of the schools, which incidentally I felt was one of the byproducts of housing segregation, one of the byproducts of housing segregation.  And so you couldn't really do one with working on the other.  And then the other thing too is that going to school and having an opportunity to go to school costs money, so you have to get into the whole business of economic development, the housing situation, education, you name it, and Old MacDonald had a farm (laughter).  So you had to do the whole damn thing, so it's not a little piece over here and a piece over there.  The, for example, locally one thing that we had to get into was that one of our state legislators introduced a thing on neighborhood schools, and as a result of that that once again this whole business reared its head again of the potential for resegregating the schools.  But see all of this once again related to the way the housing was, the way that the communities were, the whole ballgame and so, you just can't work on one without working on all of it.  And that was my work, was and is my work.
Speaker 1: So you saw yourself as a housing czar, let's say, you saw yourself as someone who should--you saw yourself as a person who could help black people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) By virtue--
Speaker 1: --buy homes--
Speaker 2: --of position.  In other words, I was in, I was positioned pretty good to work on these things.  For example, in the county [New Castle County, Delaware], when I was the head of the Department of Community Development and Housing, and those two tie in together, so I was in a position to maybe influence the thinking and help to produce the results--I mean the, not the results--well yeah, the results, but I could also help to provide some of the resources needed to do all of this.  And I'm still active and if the question was posed to me, "Why am I still doing this?"  I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do.  It, and that's easy for me to accept, doing the right thing.  The consequences, I'm not even, I'm not even thinking about that.
Speaker 1: What, what, what would be the consequences?
Speaker 2: Well, if I was working I could get fired.  But guess what, can't nobody fire me now, huh?  So I can say as I've always done, say anything I need to say to whomever needs to hear it, and Miss Pokie [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam], is very much there again because she was like that without the resources that I have at my disposal.
Story_ID: 314535
Speaker 1: And then I got a great, I got a great support arm here in my family.
Speaker 2: What year did you marry?  Nineteen--
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-four [1944].
Speaker 2: And what year did you have your first child?
Speaker 1: Forty-five [1945], yeah, Jim [James H. Gilliam, Jr.] my son was born when I was overseas.  And then my daughter [Patrice Gilliam-Johnson] was born when I was--well had just came out of the [U.S.] Army for the second time during the Korean War, and both of them were fine, fine, fine young people.
Speaker 2: So, what year did you go back to the Army for the Korean War?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Speaker 2: And what--how did you serve the Army in 1950 during the Korean War?
Speaker 1: I commanded a transportation company and I was a member of the National Guard [National Guard of the United States], went with the National Guard because I needed some money to take care of my family while I was going to school.  So I would, I worked at the TB Association [Maryland Tuberculosis Association; American Lung Association of Maryland] and I had a company in the National Guard and occasionally I'd wait tables on weekends because I'm happier when I got some bucks in my pocket.  So, but wasn't nobody gonna give 'em to me and so that's what I did.  And, it was a good experience.
Story_ID: 314536
Speaker 1: So, I wanna go through some of the dates and some of the positions you've held.  And I'll just start, like in '58 [sic.] I know you--we talked about this already that here in Delaware, you were the senior community advisor for the Baltimore Urban Renewal and Housing Agency.
Speaker 2: That's in Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: That's in Baltimore--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: And in that position you, that, this was your first--was this the first time that you were involved in housing to whereas you got a sense of what, what the needs were and what roles you could play (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I, well that goes all the way back to when--I don't think the first, maybe the first job I got was community relations.  That was really my entry point, that was my entry point in terms of doing something.  When I worked for the Maryland Tuberculosis Association [American Lung Association of Maryland] people saw the relationship of poor housing conditions as being related to tuberculosis.  So, so I was involved in some housing opportunities as a result of that job.  I was involved when I was with the Tuberculosis Association too with the fair housing movement in Baltimore.  So that's what I did, and in fact, when I was in school, School of Social Work [Howard University School of Social Work, Washington, D.C.], I was doing some work then for the housing authority.
Speaker 1: What was the fair housing movement in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: Where was it?
Speaker 1: What was it?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was this whole business of opening up housing opportunities for people irrespective of race, color, gender, creed, to open it up.
Speaker 1: So there were several fronts to fight on as far as civil rights?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And you were fighting on the housing front?
Speaker 2: That's--that was civil rights too.  It was at one point in federal housing programs you couldn't get an FHA [Federal Housing Administration] mortgage if you, as a black person, wanted to move to a predominantly white community, because they used to have in their guidelines that this mortgage insurance would only be available to--or wouldn't be available if you weren't, how shall I say, compatible with the majority population of the unit of the community of which you wanted to move.  Oh no, it was very much a part of it.  Either it was a part of it--in any case, it was in the head of the administration.  And then the other thing that happened to the whole business of the moving out of the city, when they built all of these superhighways to take people out of the city and take them to communities which happened to be all white or economically inaccessible to people.  This place I'm living in right now, I don't know the--there're only three families of color here, and one of the reasons I'm sure is economics, accessibility.  And I'm working along with the administration to kind of modify that so, right here.
Speaker 1: So you spent most of your career in housing, what do you see as having have been the challenges for black people in the housing arena?
Speaker 2: I think that from a pure factual point of view a lot of it's economics.  I think to a lesser degree it's attitudinal.
Speaker 1: And by that you mean?
Speaker 2: On both sides of the aisle.  In other words, we--I'm sure you got a lot of white folks still that don't in spite of the elimination of the taboo against accepting black folks, attitude can have a lot to do with the atmosphere.  Here I find it to be very good, but a part of it could also relate to the kind of person that I am and my family is.  It doesn't bother me, it bothers me but not to the degree of immobilizing me, let's put it that way.
Story_ID: 314537
Speaker 1: When these challenges were put forth, like the challenges with housing and African Americans what sort of plans did you put forth to tackle the challenges, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well first, well first off I had to fight the law.  I had to fight the law and the point is, is that--
Speaker 1: How did you fight the law?
Speaker 2: By fighting the law, in other words, by showing that it's wrong.
Speaker 1: Give me--can you--I just want some concrete examples of how the law (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay--
Speaker 1: --was discriminating against black people in housing.
Speaker 2: Well you just can't do it.  There were laws out there that permitted you to do it.  And so there're ways right now working to check on it, the policies that would give an operation, and if the policy of that operation don't accept black folks, and it could be written or unwritten, it was still a policy.  So the thing to do was to see that legislation was passed making that wrong, that said you can't do it.  And if you do do it, you gonna be penalized.  You then get into the whole business of reward and punishment, that's right.
Speaker 1: So you fought on a legal front (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --what other fronts did you fight on as far as housing and--
Speaker 2: Well it--
Speaker 1: --developing housing for African Americans?
Speaker 2: --the economics part--
Speaker 1: So on the economics front, so what were the challenges economically?  Were being discriminated against by banks, mortgage lenders--
Speaker 2: Yes, to answer your questions, yes, and these things evolved with banks number one through the Community Reinvestment Act [1977], have to show we're a part of the money that comes into the institution, and they make money for, with money that they're gonna have to show a viable track record.  If they don't do it they can get in trouble, they can get in real trouble, so it's these things that's ongoing.
Speaker 1: So you said you fought on a legal front, on an economics front--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you also talked about the attitudes of black people, how did you fight against the attitudes of, "We can't do it," to show people that we can do it?
Speaker 2: By getting some success stories out there, getting some success stories and help- having people to understand that the best way to develop a very positive economic posture is to own something, is to own something.  And therefore the advantages that go with owning something, and especially a house.  Capital ownership is still extremely important, and it's ongoing, it's an ongoing battle.  But people are beginning to really get the point now, I'm a member of the New Castle [New Castle County, Delaware] United Methodist Homes Foundation, and they own four communities, and they're vitally interested in this whole question of getting more diverse populations here.  Because in the process of doing this, you're also doing a tremendous community service, the benefits of which you don't see immediately, but you can see them.  And it's gotta be done, and when I say attitudinally, this business of trying to get people to understand that.  For example, there's some real thought now about the whole business of segregation still in schools, and the potential for resegregation, well you got many, many good examples right now, is that income is important as it is, it's not the only demerit against having a segregated school situation.  If you got the resources to overcome all of these problems you can do it, you can look at some of these schools that are located in--what's the school in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Is it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's the black lady here, it's a private school?
Speaker 1: The name escapes me--
Speaker 2: Where the achievements are very good.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And like here on the east side of Wilmington [Delaware] in a--located in a housing project, the kids there do better than any other place, better or as well as they do in any community here, because they got good dedicated caring teachers, small classroom size, and these things they do without having all of the kind of capital advantages that other schools have.  And, but they can do it, and the key thing, are good strong, dedicated, committed teachers, and they're out here.  But get 'em there and make it worth their while to come to these communities.
Story_ID: 314538
Speaker 1: So as you look back over your career, and you've accomplished a lot in housing, what stands out for you as some of your greatest achievements?
Speaker 2: Providing the resources for my kids [James E. Gilliam, Jr. and Patrice Gilliam-Johnson] to get a great education, and I--well they had two, two more soldiers and my wife [Louise Hayley Gilliam] is back there like Miss Pokie [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam].  So these people have encouraged me to do some pretty--not only encouraged me but have helped me, and my grandchildren and the whole shooting match.  We're all into this thing, and why are we doing it?  Cause it's the right thing to do.
Story_ID: 314539
Speaker 1: I was trying to just get a sense of what your life was like, during like the voters registration and, you know, all of the problems that ensued like the free--during the Freedom Summers in Mississippi, like in the '60s [1960s] when the country was very turbulent?
Speaker 2: Let me see if I can answer you this way, I--my whole life has been involved in one way or the other in trying to effectuate change.  And, it just looks like it's been a continuum--and I still haven't--I still got a long way to go, I still got a lot to do.  And, so, it's such a--to do this thing that's right, I don't think we will ever arrive at a point where we don't have problems.  And that can happen even in the best of families.  The point is, it's how you deal with them and how committed are you to bring about that change.  And I'd like to think I am.
Speaker 1: So in 1990 when you were presented with the opportunity to open an Urban League affiliate [Metropolitan Wilmington Urban League] here in Delaware, who helped make that come about and what role did you play in making (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, a lot of--
Speaker 1: --it come about?
Speaker 2: --well a lot of people, lot of people, black and white, I think that it's one of these things that you--any organizer is--a kind of atmosphere just to function and I think it was right because everybody felt a need for this, and--
Speaker 1: Why did they feel the need for it?
Speaker 2: Because I think they were becoming more acclimated to the fact that some things that were going on were wrong and needed to be changed, and, as is often the case, it's not just one person that does it usually takes a team, and as luck would have it, I was able to be a part of an important team and maybe as far as its development is concerned.  And it's still functioning pretty good, do I have a--feel an ownership in its progress, of course I do.  So much so that I'm not gonna let it go down the tube either, some people may not like that, but that's the way it's gonna be.  It's gonna be, and I want it just stay alive and viable and I want it to be a change agent.  And I don't expect it to be what I want it to be--I expect it to be an agency that is able and willing to effectuate meaningful change.
Speaker 1: What type of change are you looking to implement with Urban League?
Speaker 2: Well the other thing is still education, it's getting people to school because I'm a firm believer that of all the components that you're into, if you don't understand what it is and what it's about and how to do it, and that's another way to say education, it's not gonna get done.  So education is one, health is certainly one, and the health situation it seems--is going--is becoming much more, much worse for people of color, and then we've got this increasing minority population coming about all of which--all of whom, let's put it this way, don't have the resources to provide themselves with the kind of healthcare that's needed.  And then we go through this business of joblessness which is another way of saying no money, no benefits and these things are, just keep coming and coming and coming, and it's gotta be changed, it's gotta be changed.  Not just--this guy I was just talking to, Sam Latham, here's a person thinks the way that I think, and I know that when we get there we're gonna come out of that maybe with four or five different things that we can work on jointly together, and we'll do it.
Story_ID: 314540
Speaker 1: So in 2001 you were also given the honor of having the Morgan State [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] concert hall [James H. and Louise Hayley Gilliam Concert Hall, Baltimore, Maryland] named after you?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah that was, that's a great experience.  I was just reading the paper today with this, reading the paper today about this conflicted I guess is the way it is, to say what exists now in Delaware State [Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware] in the alumni, and one of the things that they're talking about is self-help.  And Earl Richardson [HistoryMaker Earl S. Richardson], who's the president of Morgan, made a decision several years ago that only self-help--there's gotta be greater participation by people who also live in the community that Morgan lives in, and people who have benefited from Morgan, talking about the alumni, and the fact is that he launched a fundraising campaign and raised $25 million.  And guess who, and guess who chaired that committee?  My son [James H. Gilliam, Jr.] and his wife, Dr. Linda Johnson [Dr. Linda J. Gilliam], and they did it and did it in two years.  Raised $25 million and Jim personally, with this performing arts center, have you seen it?
Speaker 1: I've seen pictures of it, haven't seen it.
Speaker 2: Well there's one of them right around the corner, and he gave a million, the two of them gave a million and a half dollars.  And, and he was pleased to do that.
Story_ID: 314541
Speaker 1: So your son [James H. Gilliam, Jr.] passed away at a very young age?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Your son passed away at a relatively young age?
Speaker 2: Passed away August the 20th of '03 [2003].
Speaker 1: He was in his--only in his fifties.
Speaker 2: Well, he was born in '45 [1945], that's right, so he was a fine young man.  He was very, very fortunate in, you know, when you start thinking about the four fundamental wishes of, security, love and affection, having the opportunity to have new experiences and the fourth thing is to leave a legacy, and he left such a hell of a legacy he's got me working overtime (laughter).  But it's gonna get done, his wife [Dr. Linda J. Gilliam] is, his wife, his widow now is working doubly hard.  She's on the board of trustees at Morgan [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] now.
Speaker 1: What is your son's legacy?
Speaker 2: The legacy I think that he's left is that if you arrive, reach back and pull somebody else along, and that's the way he felt about things.  If the good Lord giveth, then don't let the good Lord taketh it away (laughter) do something with it and help somebody else, and that's what he's done, good man.
Speaker 1: So do you have any grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I, right now I've got four gran- I got the two oldest ones, Leslie [Leslie Gilliam] and Alexis [Alexis Gilliam-Lerner], and my daughter's [Patrice Gilliam-Johnson] son, Micah [Micah Johnson], and my son's widow's daughter, Morgan [ph.], all in school, all doing well.
Story_ID: 314542
Speaker 1: So, just some wrap up questions, before we do your photographs, if I were to go in--out into the community and ask about you, what are some of the things you hear people saying about you?
Speaker 2: Depends on who you talk to (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But realistically I think generally it would be okay, whatever they wanna say is fine.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no but I--
Speaker 2: That's not what drives me.
Speaker 1: I know that's not what drives you, but what I'm trying to get a sense of is how are you in the--I mean, not how are you, but in the community you wore so many different hats--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and I'm just interested as into--as what some of those hats are, what people will say, "Oh well, I know Mr. Gilliam [HistoryMaker James H. Gilliam, Sr.] as a--I know Mr. Gilliam as a"--
Speaker 2: Well one thing they can say, well, "He tried, he tried to make life better for all of us."  And I feel that I have done that and to say it another way, I feel very, very, comfortable with myself, feel very, very comfortable, even when I'm in situations that may not be as pleasant as I would like them to be, but I feel very good, I feel good about myself.
Story_ID: 314543
Speaker 1: What are your hopes for the black community as we move forward?
Speaker 2: That it measures up to the challenges.  That it pulls together the tools that are needed to make things go.  And incidentally, the Urban League got some real support from the people of color community, and in particular the black community, and I see that community becoming more and more sophisticated, and more and more involved in what's going on.  And, I think in time, it's gonna take a while but we're gonna be fine.
Story_ID: 314544
Speaker 1: What would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I tried, that I tried and with some success.  But that I tried and I'm gonna still keep on trying.  Someone asked me the other day, "Jim [HistoryMaker James H. Gilliam, Sr.], you're getting old, and your clock is running out."  I said, "That might be true."  And I said that to a friend of mine, and I said, "I wish the good Lord would tell me what I'm supposed to do."  And the guy said, "He--you're not gonna hear that."  But he said, "I'm gonna tell you one other thing."  He said, "The good Lord doesn't want you up in heaven yet, God doesn't want you up in heaven he doesn't need any more, any more troublemakers." (Laughter) He said, "So you gonna be around here a long time."
Story_ID: 314545
Speaker 1: This is my wife, Louise Hayley Gilliam, and this was taken when she was about three years of age, this would be October the 21st, 1922.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of Pocahontas Lipscomb Tyler Gilliam, this is really the driving force in my life.  Most people who are old enough to know me would refer to her as Pokie, Pocahontas, and a truly great lady and really one of the guiding forces in my life.  Somebody might think something's wrong with me 'cause most of the dominant figures in my life have been women, and I don't know if that's due to the fact that I, that I'm docile or good looking (laughter) I don't know which way.
Speaker 1: Pontiac, this is a picture of James H. Gilliam, Jr. at age six.  Unfortunately, Jim passed away, passed away August the 20th of '03 [2003], and--
Speaker 2: Was it a shock, was it a surprise?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, he died of a heart attack and I got word today that, well American Heart Association, they come up with a James H. Gilliam Jr. Scholarship [James H. Gilliam Jr. Memorial Award], and it's moving along pretty good but he--they just changed the name of a scholarship from the Hodsons Scholarship, and made it the Hodson-Gilliam Scholarship [Hodson-Gilliam Success Scholarship] at Johns Hopkins University [Baltimore, Maryland].  And it was a real distinct honor to the whole family to see that occur, great guy.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother-in-law, the mother of my wife Louise, and her name was Alice Hayley, H-A-Y-L-E-Y.  Who, in my opinion, was a truly great influence in the lives of the family.  She raised seven children, all of which are college-trained; she did a magnificent job as a mother.
Speaker 1: Here we have a picture of two of my wife's brothers, the one on the left is Walter Hayley [Walter Hayley, Jr.], who incidentally is a graduate of Morgan State [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and on the right there is, we call him, Boots, no Boots is the one on the left, and Harold, that's Harold Hayley on the right, he's the next to the youngest of the children.  Both of these are deceased, in fact, my wife is the only survivor of her immediate family.  Her mother's passed and I think she would be older than my mother now.  She's passed, all of the brothers have passed and she--that's it.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of, of my son, Jim Jr., and his widow now, Dr. Linda G. Johnson [Dr. Linda J. Gilliam].  Both, obviously I've spoken about them, are great people, but Linda is really a jewel, and is a wonderful addition to our family and she looks good, okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my grandson, Micah Johnson, and Micah's M-I-C-A-H, named after the biblical prophet, Micah, M-I-C-A-H.  A good kid and he's, I think he's in--Micah's twelve and I think he's in the sixth grade--fifth or sixth grade, I don't remember which.

Speaker 1: This is a picture of my mother and father, Pocahontas [Pocahontas Lipscomb Gilliam] and James Edward Gilliam [James E. Gilliam], known as Dapper Jim, truly a great person.  But the matriarch and the leader of this, my leader is the little lady on the left, Pocahontas, also known as Pokie (laugher) all right.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my grandmother and grandfather, Lorelai [Lorelai Lipscomb (ph.)] and Jacob [Jacob Lipscomb].  I don't recall the point in history when this was taken, but this was my mother's parents.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of Dr. Patrice Gilliam-Johnson, our daughter, and I think Patti at that time was about two.  She was a sweetheart then and she's a sweetheart now (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my wife's older sister, she's now deceased and the little lady to her right is her niece, Mercedes Rankin, who lives in Baltimore [Maryland] now and is really a great lady and a strong supporter of the family.  And that's Mercedes [Mercedes Hayley Rankin] on the right, Mercedes Sr. on the right.
Speaker 1: Now this is a picture of James H. Gilliam, Jr., I think--I know this picture was taken when Jim was a student at Columbia Law School [New York, New York] and I guess this was about twenty years ago, and Jim was about forty something, in his early forties, as I indicated before, he was very sorely missed.
Speaker 2: Now this is a picture of, of course, it's old fatso in the middle and to my right is Louise [Louise Hayley Gilliam] and our daughter Patrice.  This picture was taken the afternoon of an event in which New Castle County [Delaware] named a building after me.  It was a nice affair and came as a complete surprise, but a good affair.
Speaker 1: I think that when you look at this based on my comments before from some of the earlier pictures that's Louise Hayley Gilliam and her subordinate, [HistoryMaker] James H. Gilliam, Sr. (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is a picture of Jimmy, he was about, I guess about seven at that time.  And, when this picture was taken, I was in the [U.S.] military again, and this, you'll see three of us, Louise, Jim and myself, living at the first home we bought in Baltimore City, in front of that.  Picture on the right is a picture of me, Louise and Jim which was taken during a leave of mine when I was in the [U.S.] Army for the Korean War.  The keynote part of this is that this picture was taken in front of the first house that we owned in Baltimore, Maryland, '51 [1951].
