Speaker 2: My mother's side?  Let's see.  I knew her mother [Callie Browne] and I never knew her father [Joseph Browne].  That's about as far as it really goes.  I just knew her mother, one generation.
Speaker 1: Well, do they have any stories about the end of slavery or Reconstruction or any of that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: My father's mother talked about slavery.  She was a child slave and she had stripes on her back where she was beaten as a child, and she used to tell us about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your father's name?
Speaker 2: George Elihu Washington.

Speaker 2: Okay.  Were times rough for him after the Civil War--I mean, after growing up right after the Civil War sort of?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Were times hard for your father when he was growing up?

Story_ID: 631715
Speaker 1: Your father [George Elihu Washington] had a chance to go to school, right?
Speaker 2: I know what he did tell me, when he went to school, they had a tablet with a multiplication table on one side and an alphabet on the other, and he said he sat on the porch one afternoon and mastered all of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.

Speaker 2: Yes.  He was a person who had a lot of degrees.  There were several small black institutions in Nashville and he got in a degree from every one.
Speaker 1: Can you name some of those schools for us?
Speaker 2: Walden [Walden University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  That's about all I can remember.
Speaker 1: So, he had degrees from Walden, Meharry and Fisk, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Mother [Daisy Turner Washington] used to say she had a--oh, I told you that.  I had a pillowcase full of diplomas.

Speaker 1: Right.  That's like a teachers school, right?  A school for teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.  What were her parents' names?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I know her mother was Callie Browne, but I don't know what her father [Joseph Browne] was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she came--did she grow up in Mount Sterling [Kentucky]?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did she grow up in Mount Sterling, Kentucky?
Speaker 2: She--yes, until she was raised to go to college and then she came to Nashville.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know.  He was a principal and she was a student.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That probably explains (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, is there a story about how they got married?
Speaker 2: No, just that they did.  No stories.  I don't--she didn't have a wedding.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Let's see.  Tell us about your parents and what kind of personalities did they have?
Speaker 2: My mother was a very sweet, intelligent person.  Very patient and very good to us.  She's told us wonderful stories and kept us entertained because we didn't have anybody to play with and didn't have many toys.  And my father was full of fun.  He liked to tell jokes and to tease and to ask me sums like two and four and I wouldn't know what it was and he thought it was so funny.  Um-hm.  That's all I remember about him.
Speaker 1: Well, who do you think you take after the most of your two parents?
Speaker 2: Probably my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was your father real tall or was he short?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was a big man and rather heavy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother, she was a frail, very frail person.
Story_ID: 631716
Speaker 1: Do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had one older brother, Alvin [Henry A. Washington], and two sisters, Marguerite [Marguerite Washington] and Joe [Joe Washington Jones].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are you--where do you fall in the order?  Are you the--?
Speaker 2: I'm between Marguerite and Alvin.  I'm the second child.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Have what?
Speaker 1: An earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, maybe waiting for Santa Claus.  That's about the first thing I remember.
Speaker 1: About how old were you then?
Speaker 2: Maybe five or six.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds and smells?  Well, I--we lived in a neighborhood [in Nashville, Tennessee] that was white and we didn't have any neighbors and we just were confined to our own yard.  Well, the neighbor on one side was black, but that was all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, why did your mother [Daisy Turner Washington] confine you to the yard?
Speaker 2: Because it wasn't safe for black children to walk out by themselves.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: No.  We had one playmate who was white and came from a wealthy family, but his family was Catholic and none of the people in the community would have anything to do with him.  So, his mother used to call up and tell my mother to send us over to play with him because they didn't have any playmates.  And he was our only playmate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sonny boy was what we called him.
Story_ID: 631717
Speaker 1: Your father [George Elihu Washington] was then--he was teaching at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], then?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Your father was teaching at Fisk University then?
Speaker 2: No.  He taught at a high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pearl High School [Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Pearl High School.  All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of house did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: What kind of house did you grow up in?  What did your house look like?
Speaker 2: What was the whole house like?
Speaker 1: No.  What was your house like, yeah.
Speaker 2: It was just a plain frame house.  Two-story.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see here.  And what--did you have any other memories of the neighborhood of what it was like?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You just kind of stayed on in the house, around the house?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We stayed in the yard.  We never went anywhere.
Speaker 1: Did you ever go over to Fisk or to--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did you ever go to the other colleges around there or to--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  If there was a concert or a program at Fisk, they would take us, but not, that wasn't too frequent.
Speaker 1: So, what did you do for recreation when you were at home?
Speaker 2: We just played in the yard with balls and sticks.
Speaker 1: Now, I read that you liked to read when you were little.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.  Both of us liked to read, and the only thing we ever fought over was a book.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: That's you and your brother [Henry A. Washington]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, is it your brother that became a doctor?  Is it--what did your brother--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  Right.  I think I saw his picture over there.  Right.  Okay.  So, what were your favorite books?
Speaker 2: Ooh, (laughter) my goodness.  It's hard to say.  I have so many.  Just--do you mean children stories?
Speaker 1: Well, anything that you were reading then.  Anything that you liked to read.
Speaker 2: Oh, Louisa May Alcott and Rudyard Kipling, I should think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, how would you describe yourself as a little girl?  What kind of little girl were you?
Speaker 2: Well, just a plain child with pigtails and a lot of curiosity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your curiosity ever get you into trouble?
Speaker 2: I can't remember any time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's good.
Story_ID: 631718
Speaker 1: What school did you go to?
Speaker 2: We went to the neighborhood school which was Meigs [Meigs School; Meigs Academic Magnet School, Nashville, Tennessee], M-E-I-G-S, and it just went to the eighth grade.  And I had to walk quite a distance, and it was customary for the children to line up outside the school until the teachers told us they could go in, and it was quite an honor to lead the line, to be the first one and occasionally I got--I got there in time to be there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I liked school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: No, I liked most of everything.
Speaker 1: What about teachers?  Did--
Speaker 2: The teachers?
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you have a favorite?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I liked different teachers.  Mrs. Shaw [ph.] was a music teacher and I can't remember my first grade teacher, but I was very fond of her.  I can't remember her name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you get involved in sports and that sort of thing when you were in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I take part in sports.  No, we didn't have any sports until I got in high school [Pearl High School; Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee] and then we had basketball, which I played.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see, grade school.  Was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of music in your home when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have a piano.  We had a Victrola and nobody sang or it was not--it was not very usual.  Not much music in the home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a radio?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I guess I was in high school.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, because they started doing radio broadcasts I guess when you were--you must have been what, twelve, I guess, when they--yeah, they didn't really have radios out until you were about twelve, I guess, right?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying they didn't have radios out commercially until you were about twelve years old, I guess.  Yeah.  I'm thinking in 1920.  What about church?  Did you attend church?
Speaker 2: We went to my grandmother [Julia Washington]--my father's mother's church, which was A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], I think.  We went to Sunday school.  We didn't go to church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you only went to Sunday school.  You didn't go to regular church.  Did your parents go to church?
Speaker 2: Not much.  Mother's [Daisy Turner Washington] church was across town.  It was too far.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember how your family winded up living on the outskirts of the white community like that and--?
Speaker 2: How they what?
Speaker 1: Why they didn't live inside the black community and why they ended up where they were?
Speaker 2: Because I think my father [George Elihu Washington] thought it was an advantage to be in the white community.  The advantages were, they were near transportation and near stores, but as far as association with people, it was nothing.  And he didn't have any friends.  He went--he would walk several blocks to the fire station where we had one black fire station and he would go down there and play cards with them.  And as far as mother was concerned, she could only have friends when they could come over to see her from across town, and that wasn't often.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we were very much alone.
Speaker 1: Did you feel kind of lonely when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  Not too much.  We just enjoyed each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So the school you went to was all black, right?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: The--Meigs School was a black school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, the schools were all segregated then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was there a school closer to you than Meigs?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Was there a white school closer to where you lived?
Speaker 2: Was there a white school near me?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes.  There were white schools, but we couldn't go to them.
Story_ID: 631719
Speaker 1: Now, what high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Pearl High School [Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the school that my father [George Elihu Washington] was the principal of.
Speaker 1: Now, is Pearl High School named for anyone in particular?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I don't know why it was called Pearl.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he died while I was a freshman, I think.  He died before I finished high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that must have caused some financial situations for the family, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was because mother [Daisy Turner Washington] wasn't prepared to work.  She finally got work teaching, which I remember one time it took all of her check to buy three pairs of stockings for me and my sisters [Marguerite Washington and Joe Washington Jones].  So, she didn't make much money.
Speaker 1: So things were pretty tough, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: After he died.
Speaker 2: My grandmother [Julia Washington] had money and she helped.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is the mother that had been born in slavery?  This is your--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --this is your father's mother?
Speaker 2: That was born in slavery.
Speaker 1: And that's the one that helped?
Speaker 2: My mother's mother [Callie Browne] was born in Kentucky, and she said she didn't know much about slavery.  I don't know whether that was true or not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could be.  Who knows, you know.  Yeah.  Well.  Okay.  So, you went to Pearl High School.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: And then to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about Pearl High School.  What, what did you do in high school?  You said you played basketball and what else?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You said you liked Pearl High School?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Well, they had just the curriculum, languages and mathematics and science and I don't think we had any dances that I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there wasn't much of a social life there?
Speaker 2: No, there wasn't much.
Speaker 1: Why?  Why not?
Speaker 2: Well, we lived so far from other black people.  There was no life to associate with unless mama could take us way across town, and finally when we were old enough to go to colleges, we went to Fisk and we had something of a life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  Twenty-nine [1929], I think.
Story_ID: 631720
Speaker 1: And so you started Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] in 1929 too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, what did you major in at Fisk?
Speaker 2: English.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your social life like at Fisk?  You said it was a little bit better, right?
Speaker 2: It was very pleasant.  It was nice.  There were--you know enough people to be comfortable with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: Grace Goins [Grace Price Goins], Marissa Ellard [ph.], and that's about all I can remember but I know I had others.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any teachers that you remember?
Speaker 2: Yes, several teachers.  I said my father [George Elihu Washington] was the principal [of Pearl High School; Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee] and I had a man teacher.  I can't remember his name, but he was very good in grade school.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject at Fisk?  A favorite--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I eventually majored in history, but I had started out in English.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you study--did they study black history at Fisk in those days?
Speaker 2: No, not as such.  The books that we had were from white history and the teachers had to tell us what they knew about black history.  We didn't have books about it.
Speaker 1: Did the teachers try to give you like some kind of guidance as to what you should do as black students in--?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.  They were very concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kinds of advice did they give you?
Speaker 2: Well, just to be careful of what you do and to study hard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see.  So, anything else about Fisk?  Did you run for class office or anything, or did you--?
Speaker 2: Well, I joined a sorority.  That was something different.
Speaker 1: Which one did you join?
Speaker 2: Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, how were--how were female students treated?  Were they treated as--?
Speaker 2: At Fisk?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They were treated well.  There wasn't any difference because there were many female teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't have, and if you could, could you compare like college life in 1929 to college life now?  I mean, is it--is it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was very different.  It was very restricted and we didn't live on the campus, you know.  And the city's children had a room where they could take their lunch, but they were sort of ostracized.  They weren't really a part of the community--of the college.  It was run by the people who lived in the dormitories.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you remember Charles Johnson [Charles S. Johnson]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was head of his--of social science.  My husband [Horace Mann Bond] worked under him, and I think I did some work in the office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's Charles Spurgeon Johnson (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I knew him very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was involved with his wife [Marie Antoinette Burgette Johnson] and his children.
Speaker 1: So what about, was--?
Speaker 2: Sterling Brown--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was my English teacher.  I was very fond of him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, he's a great poet.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense in those days that he was a great poet?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense in those days that he was such a great poet?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, we knew.  He used to read his poetry to us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite Sterling Brown poem?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite poem of Sterling Brown's?
Speaker 2: I don't think of any.  Probably if I looked in a book, I could find one.
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.  What about Arna Bontemps, was he there then?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Arna Bontemps?
Speaker 2: He came later.  I, he never taught me and I don't think he was ever on the faculty.  He came when I was grown.
Story_ID: 631721
Speaker 1: Are there any other teachers that you remember at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: At Fisk?  Let's see.  Miss Scribner [Dora A. Scribner] I said, and there must be others, but I can't think of any now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, what about the--did they still have the singing group at Fisk then?  The Jubilee Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers]?
Speaker 2: The Jubilee Singers?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Do you remember them?
Speaker 2: Oh, they, they were traveling then.  They'd come occasionally and give a recital at Fisk, but they weren't on the campus all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 631722
Speaker 1: Now you met your husband [Horace Mann Bond] at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], right, when you were a senior?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what--tell us what happened.
Speaker 2: Nothing.  We heard that he was coming and my mother [Daisy Turner Washington] and grandmother were very impressed because they had known his mother [Jane Browne Bond] and thought very highly of her.  So they were very receptive to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he from Kentucky, too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was he from Mount Sterling [Kentucky]?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Was he from Mount Sterling, too?
Speaker 2: No.  He was from Louisville [Kentucky], I think.
Speaker 1: Louisville, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I heard that some of the girls tried to get in his class so they could talk to him (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what--but you didn't do that, right?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  He--they knew that he was coming and we would--and several had a young black teacher, and they were all trying to be in his class, but I decided I wouldn't rush into it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how did you become acquainted?  Did he--what happened?
Speaker 2: I don't remember how we first met.  I guess somehow on the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you like him?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did you like him when you met him?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Uh-huh.  And my parents liked him because they knew his mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how long--so I guess you--did you date him when you were a senior?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did you go out with him when you were a senior?  Did he--?
Speaker 2: Go out with him?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did he court you or, you know?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was dating like in those days?  I mean, how--did you?
Speaker 2: It was very supervised, very curtailed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did one--did your mother have to be around when he was there or your father [George Elihu Washington] have to be present or something or--?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Did someone have to be there when he was--?
Speaker 2: Yes, most of the time.  Very close if not in the room.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Story_ID: 631723
Speaker 1: You graduated from Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then what did you do?
Speaker 2: I went--my grandmother sent me to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now that's a big deal, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: University of Chicago is one of the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --top schools in the country.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you must have had good grades?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You must have had good grades, huh?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was a good student.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think I finished with honors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, so you were admitted to the University of Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did you come up by yourself?
Speaker 2: Yes--oh, no.  I had a roommate, Melissa [ph.].  We roomed together.  The two of us went to Chicago [Illinois] together.
Speaker 1: Do you remember where you lived?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Do you remember where you lived in Chicago?
Speaker 2: On Evans [Avenue] but I don't know exactly where.  It was on the South Side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: It was within walking distance of the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you lived across Cottage Grove [Avenue], right?  You were on the other side of Cottage Grove from the campus?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Right.  Right.  Did--was that still--in those days, was that the dividing line between the black and the white community?
Speaker 2: I think it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's my impression.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, how did you like the University of Chicago?
Speaker 2: I liked it very much.  It was very interesting and inspiring.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers there?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can't remember their names, but they had written books.  I can't remember their names now.  They were men.  I don't remember a female teacher.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have Sterling North, by any chance?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Sterling North?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do you know who he is?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Do you know who he is?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm just asking.
Speaker 2: Not too well.  I know the name, but I don't know much about him.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, were you an English major there?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did you major in English there, too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, did you stay all the way and finish your degree?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I came home and I got married and I didn't finish.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your husband, now, Horace Mann Bond, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He actually went to Chicago I heard, right?  Did he come to Chicago to where you were?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was a student, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was a student at the University of Chicago as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you got married in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about it.  What happened?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Tell us what happened.
Speaker 2: Well, we got married but we didn't tell anybody, but the people I lived with saw the notice in the paper.  (Laughter) So that wasn't a secret anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now what was he doing there?  What was he trying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was going to school.  He was getting his degree and he was working, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was trying to--was he working on a Ph.D. then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right.  And what was he--what kind of Ph.D. was he trying to get?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: What degree was he trying to get?
Speaker 2: I think it was a Ph.D.
Speaker 1: But was it in education, or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  It was in education (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right, okay.
Story_ID: 631724
Speaker 1: You came back to Nashville [Tennessee] and got married [to Horace Mann Bond] again?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: Yes.  We got married again in Nashville.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me about the wedding.  What kind of wedding did you have?
Speaker 2: Say what?
Speaker 1: What kind of wedding did you have?
Speaker 2: It wasn't a wedding really, it was just my family and the minister because mother [Daisy Turner Washington] says if I didn't get married, people wouldn't believe we were married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So then you went back to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Afterwards.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I read that you stopped going to school [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] at a certain point and just, you know, stayed home.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Why?  Why?
Speaker 2: I guess we couldn't afford tuition for two people.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when did he finish his degree?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: I don't remember the year.  I don't remember the year, but he did finish.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you do after he finished?
Speaker 2: He taught at various schools.  I can't remember in what order or what succession.
Speaker 1: Colleges?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: In colleges?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He taught at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was life like on--did you have to--well you were at Fisk and several other schools, you said, too?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You were at several schools, right, with him?
Speaker 2: There was what?
Speaker 1: You lived in--on several different campuses?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let's see.  Did you have any children right away?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have children for a long time.  I think we were married nine years before we had children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when did he become the president of Fort Valley State [Fort Valley State College; Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia] and when--or?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I would have to look it up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where is Fort Valley State at?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Where is Fort Valley State?
Speaker 2: It's in Georgia.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, how did you like being the wife of a president?
Speaker 2: Well, it was okay (laughter).  Not too pleasant all the time but it was a job.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you have to do?
Speaker 2: Well, in those days the school had no guest houses, and whenever someone came to speak, they had to stay with us and I had to provide their meals.
Story_ID: 631725
Speaker 1: All right.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember once Dr. Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] came and I was going somewhere and he was at the station, and I spoke to him and he was very haughty because he didn't know me (laughter) and he thought I was just pushing myself on him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yet, do you have any other stories about Dr. Du Bois?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Do you have any other stories about him?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  We were sitting down before the fire and he was reading the newspaper and I was taking care of my children, and somebody said, "Some students are coming over to see Dr. Du Bois," and he got up and went upstairs right away (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, he wasn't the most friendly person, I guess?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: He was not very friendly, I guess?
Speaker 2: No, he was all right once you knew him, but it was--he was hard to know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you like him?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you like about him?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked to listen to him talk and people would of course ask him many, many questions.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he as smart as people say now?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: We always hear about how bright he was, how intelligent he was.
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: Was that true?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did his wife [Nina Gomer Du Bois] ever come with him when he traveled?
Speaker 2: No.  She was busy at the Du Bois' chasing dirt.  (Laughter) She was a good housekeeper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who else do you remember that came by?
Speaker 2: Who taught?
Speaker 1: No, that stayed with you.  Who stayed at your house in those years?  Who else stayed at your house?
Speaker 2: Who else--
Speaker 1: Stayed at your house when--during those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, anybody who spoke at the school [Fort Valley State College; Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia] and they would have various speakers during the year.  Let's see, Franklin Frazier [E. Franklin Frazier].  I can't think of anybody else.  Maybe Langston Hughes.
Speaker 1: What about E. Franklin Frazier?  What--tell us about him.  Do you have any stories about him?
Speaker 2: He was a neighbor and he was a friend.  He was full of fun and jokes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about Langston Hughes?  Do you have a story about him?
Speaker 2: I know he took Julian [HistoryMaker Julian Bond] and Jay [James Bond] to eat at Paschal's [Paschal's Motor Hotel and Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia] for lunch and--
Speaker 1: (JAMES BOND):  That's here in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Jay was kind of critical of Julian and he defended Julian.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  But that's here in Atlanta [Georgia], right?  That's--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: That's here in Atlanta (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Atlanta, yes.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 631726
Speaker 1: How long were you at Fort Valley State [Fort Valley State College; Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's probably a bad question.
Speaker 2: Less than ten years, I'm sure.  About seven maybe.  Six--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (JAMES BOND):  I was born there in 1944.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: (JAMES BOND):  And then they moved about a year later to Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Fort Valley until 1945, right?  Then you went to--you went to Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] next, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now how did you like Lincoln?
Speaker 2: I liked it.  It was a nice place for the children to grow up.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about Lincoln?
Speaker 2: I can't think of any, but I probably do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did--all right.  Were--was it a bigger school than Fort Valley State?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see.  Now when did you come to Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I don't know the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That probably was a bad question too.
Speaker 2: I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Well, I think--I think from what I've read you came here in '56 [1956], '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: Maybe so.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Does that sound about right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Fifty-six [1956] or '57 [1957].  And Atlanta U was even bigger then, huh?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Atlanta University was larger than Lincoln I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you like Atlanta University?
Speaker 2: I liked it.  We had more association than we'd had in Lincoln, 'cause at Lincoln most of the faculty was white.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that's something that most of us didn't know.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: I mean, that's something I wouldn't know, you know.  That's good to know.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So most of the faculty at Lincoln was white back in the--?
Speaker 2: At Lincoln, yes.
Speaker 1: In the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Because originally, they were all white and reluctantly they admitted a black person to teach, but by the time we came there, there were several black professors.
Speaker 1: Now that's interesting because I think a lot of black people would assume that the black colleges [HBCUs] had black teachers.
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: But that's not true.
Speaker 2: No, it's not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, it's not.  They used to have white teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So most of the teachers at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] would have been white, too?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's what made your husband [Horace Mann Bond] special (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In my time--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: After my time, it may have been different.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I understand.  Now at Atlanta U were most of the teachers black here, at Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Were most of the teachers black at Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you, you had the City of Atlanta [Georgia], too, here with a lot of black people, right?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: There were a lot of black people in the city, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So you, you had more associations with some people?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was pleasant.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us--do, do you have stories about Atlanta here?  About some of the people here?
Speaker 2: No, I don't--can't tell.  I can't think of any.  I probably do, but I just can't think of any.
Speaker 1: What about Benjamin Mays?  Can you talk about him?
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know him personally, but I knew of him and I heard him speak occasionally.
Speaker 1: What about--?  Let's see.  So your children went to school here?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At the, what, the lab school [Atlanta University Laboratory School, Atlanta, Georgia] on campus?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And by that time, were all your children born by the time you--?
Speaker 2: James [James Bond] was born in Fort Valley [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was born in '45 [1945] and--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: He was born in '40 [1940], '44 [1944], '45 [1945]?  Whenever.  The--so well, what was life like here at Atlanta U?
Speaker 2: What was it like in Atlanta?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: It was pleasant.  Of course it was segregated, but it was very pleasant because you had a lot of like-minded people as friends.
Story_ID: 631727
Speaker 1: Now when the Civil Rights Movement came along--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --did you know Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and his family?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We lived next door to them.  But I don't think Dr. King was there then.  He must have been away at school, and I didn't know them.  I knew them just to speak to, I didn't know them very intimately.
Speaker 1: Did you know Jesse Hill?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We knew him very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was he doing?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What was he doing?
Speaker 2: Jesse Hill?  He--well, he was a professional in the insurance company, but he had a voice in everything that had happened in Atlanta [Georgia]
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your sons became involved in the student movement, right, in the 19--?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Your sons, James [James Bond] and Julian [HistoryMaker Julian Bond] got--were involved in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you feel about that when they first got involved?
Speaker 2: Well, didn't much like it but he was so enthusiastic, we didn't--we didn't discourage him.
Speaker 1: How'd your husband feel about it?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but, I remember once Horace [Horace Mann Bond] came home and I met him at the door and burst into tears and said, "Julian got arrested."  But I think that the children were very proud of being arrested.
Speaker 1: What did he get arrested for?
Speaker 2: For sitting in at a lunch counter, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let's see.  Did you ever meet the mayor of Atlanta?  In those days was that Ivan Allen [Ivan Allen, Jr.], I think (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I don't think so.  I knew who, who he was but I don't think I ever met him.
Speaker 1: So he didn't have much association with the campus [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any white people in the community that were against segregation that you knew?
Speaker 2: Well, they always had white teachers and, you know, there were a number on the campus.
Speaker 1: Were they against segregation?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How did they feel about segregation?
Speaker 2: Well, they didn't like it, you know, but they lived there and, and it wasn't--it was--I think it was illegal for them to live among Negroes, but they weren't bothered.
Speaker 1: Okay now.  So, do--is there any particular memory about those days that stands out, you know, that?
Speaker 2: No, I can't think of any.  Maybe if I tried, I could (laughter).
Story_ID: 631728
Speaker 1: Now, when did you go back to school to--well, tell us about becoming a librarian.  How did you do that?
Speaker 2: Oh, when we came to the campus at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], that was the first time I had ever been on a campus with a graduate school and I said, I think I'll study something.  And I picked library science, but didn't intend to become a librarian, but little by little, I took enough courses to qualify.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I guess--let me see--think I might--what, did you start working in a library by 1960?  Is that it?
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm thinking.  And you worked until 2000, right?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You were a librarian until the year 2000.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The turn of the century?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: The turn of the century?  The beginning of the 21st century?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, that's a long time!
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, that's a--you know, you were a librarian for what, forty years!
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  So, you retired in 19--in 2004 was it?
Speaker 2: I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, no, no, 2000.  I'm sorry, 2000.  And you were--you, you were ninety-two when you retired, right?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You were ninety-two years old when you retired?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you work so long?
Speaker 2: I just liked it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, what did you like about it?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked--you know, having the books and finding information for people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you a member of the American Library Association?
Speaker 2: I think I was, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any particular part of the job that you liked the most?  Is there any special part of the job that you liked the most?
Speaker 2: Special part of what?
Speaker 1: Of being a librarian that you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's just working with books.  I like books.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what--.  Is there--is there any one particular thing that you can attribute to living such a long time?
Speaker 2: Living such a long life?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: No.  It's just in my family, they're long livers.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's hard to say, but I hope they will improve.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Improve in what way?
Speaker 2: Well, be more educated and more, more people will go to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back at your own life, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you had, had to do it again?
Speaker 2: No, I can't think of anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Today, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: It be what?
Speaker 1: What would you consider your legacy to be today?
Speaker 2: Concern?
Speaker 1: Your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  I hope people will remember me as someone who loved books.

Speaker 2: My children?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: The oldest child is Jane [HistoryMaker Jane Bond Moore].  She's a--I don't know exactly what she does, but she's very intelligent.  And Julian [HistoryMaker Julian Bond], of course, worked for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC] and then I think he worked on a newspaper.  And James [James Bond] came to live with me when my husband's [Horace Mann Bond] health failed and he stayed and took care of him.
Speaker 1: Right.  Your husband died in 1973, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And you had just built this house, right?  The house that we're in?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: The house that we're in right now, you built it yourself, right?  Right here?
Speaker 2: This house?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: He built it.  My husband built it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is there anything that you want to say before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I can't think of anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is similar to the legacy question, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'd like to be remembered as someone who loved books, who loved children and loved learning.
