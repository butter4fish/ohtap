Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, do you remember any stories that your grandfather told, the stories about him?
Speaker 2: At that time, you know what, I was only, I was probably, I probably wasn't even five years old, you know.   And, and my memories of him are very, are very vague.  I remember, some of the things I remember are, you know, they would make ice cream out of snow, you know.  And, I remember being in his church [Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church, Nashville, Tennessee].  I remember playing his, playing his piano in his house.  That's how I kind of, you know, got, that was the, the kick starter for me to, to fall in love with music.  But, I have, I've met him and I've known him.

My grandparents, her parents divorced.  My grandfather had been married more than once.  And, you know, he was a, you know, my mother talks about (laughter)--see I don't know if I even wanna put this out there, you know.  My, my grandfather was preacher, man.  He was a, you know, he was, he was a lady man, a ladies man, you know.  He was a--she talked about how he was always well dressed, you know, you know, very stylish.  She talked about my, my, how my grandmother always had a job, you know, she was always working.  She--my grandmother wouldn't stay--and she, she moved a lot.  You know, she was, she didn't, she didn't stay in one place a long time.  She was always on the road until she was, you know, when she passed away probably maybe a few years ago, up until, you know, she had had a series of, a series of strokes.  But, up until then, I mean, she died, you know, she was driving.  She would drive from, from Tennessee to Texas to visit her kids.  Drive, you know, drive up here to visit us.

You know, we all, we always joke, if my grandmother doesn't get into heaven ain't nobody getting in, you know, she's extremely religious, extremely faithful.  There's also a, a strong entrepreneurial spirit, you know, that, that runs through our family.  You know, my, my grandfather was the, you know, was probably the catalyst for that.  You know, his church, he started Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church in Nashville [Tennessee].  And, you know, the church was debt free, you know.  Brought air conditioning into the church which was a, which was a big deal.

Story_ID: 630341
Speaker 1: My biological father and my mother [Elizabeth Hardy] (laughter), met when my mother was in high school.  He was her teacher.  She got pregnant with me when she was seventeen years old by him, which you know.

Speaker 1: He'd still be in jail (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, it had to be against the rules, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was big, you know, I mean, and then you know, and at that time, you know, I mean this is, you know, you're talking, this is the, the '60s [1960s], you know, sixty- '66 [1966], '65 [1965], '66 [1966].  And, so, you know, and being from a really religious family and, and all the stigma and then you know, and being pregnant out of wedlock, not to mention, you know, under those circumstances, you know.  My mom, my mom is a trooper, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, she--
Speaker 1: And, she had plans, and she went, and she went to school, you know.  And, she, you know, she went to school and, and it was important for her to get her, to get her degree.  And, and, she met my, my stepdad [Erick Hardy], and then we moved to, to Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of, a lot of stress in that situation, I can, I can--
Speaker 1: Unbelievable amount of stress.
Speaker 2: But, he was never, your fath- you're biological father was never--did he ever contribute to your, you know, upbringing in any way?
Speaker 1: No.  No, I've never, I've never met him.  Actually, I didn't, I didn't become aware of, of him until I was probably twelve or thirteen years old.  And, then we didn't talk about it.  And, I found out because I was, I was snooping and, and found my, my birth certificate and, and didn't recognize the name that was on the certificate.  And, we would not have a conversation about that until much later in my life.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Now, what about your stepfather?  Well, well, for the record, what's your biological father's name?
Speaker 1: My biological father's name is Jesse Nance, Jr.
Speaker 2: And, do you know his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: I do not know.

Speaker 1: But, I think they were, and, I mean, but he has, he has roots in Gates, Tennessee.  And, there are a lot of them too; the Nances.  They're a lot of them that's out there.  And, I, and I know them, and am in contact with, with his side of the family as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Well, before we leave him, are there any, I guess descriptions of him in terms of what he was like, what his personality was like?
Speaker 1: He was very intelligent.  He was a, a professor.  And, I don't know, I don't know the school.  I feel ill equipped (laughter) for this interview, you know.  I don't know the school.  But, he was a professor of bio--
Speaker 2: In--
Speaker 1: Biology.

Speaker 1: Taught high school, and he also taught, taught college.  He was musically inclined.  He was, he was in the church.  His father [Jesse Nance, Sr.] was a, his father was a, was a minister as well.  In fact, they, they--I was told that my biological father's dad, and my [maternal] grandfather knew each other.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So, but, okay, but he never made any, you know, he never made an appearance in your life?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, he's passed now?
Speaker 1: He's passed away, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think he died in, I wanna say in the, in the mid-'90s [1990s], '95 [1995], '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 630342

Speaker 1: And, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't, I don't know.  His place of birth would be in, in West Palm Beach, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And, okay, so, he grew--
Speaker 2: His birthday is September 6th.  The year he was born, I don't know.  My mother's birthday is April 3rd.
Speaker 1: So, they, were they born around the same time? Were they in school (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's probably, he's a little, yeah, probably the same period.  He's probably maybe five, four or five years older than my mother [Elizabeth Hardy].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, around the mid-'40s [1940s] then, or early '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, now what did he major in in school?
Speaker 2: He's an engineer.  I don't know what his degree would be in.  Is it bachelor of science maybe?  But, he's an engineer.  Or, was an engineer before he retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, that's, so he had pretty good income as an engineer I would imagine.
Speaker 2: I would imagine that he probably, you know, he, he did okay.  Yeah, he did okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would imagine.  I mean, that's probably a question for him.  You know, as a kid, we never felt poor, you know.  He had three kids, you know, and a wife and very frugal and conservative.  And, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He did okay.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I guess we would've been considered to be, you know, middle class.  He was one of the first black engineers to, to be at Rockwell International where he, where he worked outside of, outside of college and that's in, or was in Troy [Michigan].  It's another company now.  Yeah, he did, you know, he did okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have to, you know, I have to ask my dad how much money he made.  I guess, I'm old enough to do that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: He's doing, he's doing fairly well as an engineer.  I'm just thinking that, you know, of the different professions you could have.  He's probably, that's probably, you know, a pretty decent job.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, were you close to your stepfather?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We spent, we spent a lot of time, we spent a lot of time together, you know.  Our, our, our, you know, relationship had its peaks and valleys.  But, we were, you know, he made an honest effort to, you know, as an adult.  As a child we don't understand, but as an adult, you know, looking back, you know, my, my, my dad was, my, my, my dad was, was a hell of a man, you know.  Because when he met, he met my, my mother and, and, and married her and took her--and wanted to build a life with her even though she had, she had me, you know, in tow.  And, and, he wanted to, and he's told me that, you know, he wanted to, you know, to keep that intact.  He wanted to, you know, take my mother and me as, as the full package.  So, he, you know, you know, he showed--he did the best that he could.  And, I know that his history with his, with his father and his family dynamic was very, you know, was dysfunctional and not without challenge and, you know, his relationship with his dad was not good.  So, my father's, his, his, his sense of family and wanted to, wanting to, to keep that intact, wanting to build and family and have his own family and, and be the head of the family, and take care of his family, you know, that's really, that's really what he was all about, you know.  He, he talks about, you know, the positions that he turned down and the opportunities that he, that he, that he could've had, that he didn't take.  Because, you know, he didn't wanna move his family, or have his family traveling across the country or you know, have us be, have our life be, you know, disturbed to a degree.  He wanted to, you know, to keep that intact.  It was important to him.  And, and, I have a lot of respect and appreciation for that, you know.  You know, I, in that regard, I aspire to be, you know, as much of man as he is.
Story_ID: 630343
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, and I'm talking about everybody, all three, I guess, as much as you know about your father [KEM's biological father, Jesse Nance, Jr.], though you never met him--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Their talents, what they look like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: There are, there are, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm a confluence of all of them, you know.  You know, my entrepreneurial spirit probably comes from my mother [Elizabeth Hardy].  You know, my, my spiritual influence probably, you know, leans towards my mom's side.  My creativity is, is, is from my mom's side.  The music probably from my biological dad even though we never met, you know.  I, you know, (laughter) I got a lot of his stuff.  I got everybody's stuff.  I got all their stuff, man.  And, you know, I think the way that I, that I try to, that I try to process things, you know, from a, from a intellectual standpoint is probably from my, from my biological dad, you know.  You know, actually, having manhood modeled for you, you know, both the good and the bad, you know, are, are probably from my dad [KEM's stepfather, Erick Hardy].  And, I, you know, and I embrace all of it.
Story_ID: 630344
Speaker 1: Well now, tell us about, now, you have two siblings?
Speaker 2: I have three siblings.
Speaker 1: Three siblings.
Speaker 2: Well, I have, I have, I have four sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, three that I grew up with and one that is also, when I, when I did finally establish a relationship with, with my biological father's side of the family, with Jesse's [Jesse Nance, Jr.] side of the family, I found that I had another sister.  And, I found that out probably in 2003, 2004.  Her name is Sonya Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and at that time, she was living in, she was living in Chicago [Illinois].  We're not, we're not close but we, you know, but we know each other, and correspond from time to time.  And, I have three sisters that I grew up with here in, in, in Michigan.  One of which, Erica [ph.], Erica, Erica, Karen [Karen Hardy], and, and Karmen [Karmen Hardy].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is Sonja Johnson involved in music at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about Erica, Karen, and Karmen, are they--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --musically inclined?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What do they do for a living?
Speaker 2: My youngest sister, Karmen, works for a, a virtual office company.  She graduated from Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan].  My middle, my, well, she's the youngest and then before that there's Karen.  Karen works in the, in the medical field.  And, and Erica does, what do call it, she's a, do I wanna say, I wanna say cosmetologist, she does hair.  I'm trying to give it (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Beautician (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She does hair and nails.  Beautician, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, when you were growing up it was you and your three sisters in the household, you know, I guess as they were born and added on to the family.  You being the oldest. And, so, so, your parents [Elizabeth Hardy and KEM's stepfather, Erick Hardy] like moved to Detroit [Michigan] when you were young?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I got here, we--I started kindergarten.  So, we left Nashville [Tennessee], you know, pulling a trailer behind, pulling a U-Haul trailer behind a Volkswagen Beetle.  And, and, and we moved to Pontiac [Michigan].  We were in Pontiac first.
Speaker 1: So, this was around 1975 or so, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would say.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay, Pontiac, Michigan.  And, so, were you following your father's career as an engineer?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Basically?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 630345
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory.  (Pause) My earliest childhood memories would probably be at, at my [maternal] grandmother's house over on Bate Avenue.  And, you know, at that time, it was probably the biggest house that I've ever seen, you know.  And, and I guess, you know, from a child's perspective, you know.  And, there were plum trees in the back, and, and a tire swing, you know, outside.  You know, and I lived, and I lived with her for probably the first six months, the first six months of my life, I was living with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: This is in Nashville [Tennessee], right?
Speaker 2: In Nashville.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: So, so, what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sights and smells growing up.
Speaker 1: Sounds, too (laughter).
Speaker 2: The sounds.  You know, I think we, we, we moved to a place called, called Ridgemont [Ridgemont Drive].  It's on North Perry [Street].  And, that's where we moved, that was, that's where we moved to out when we left Nashville [Tennessee].  It's the first place, our first Michigan residence as a family.  And, lots of kids.  Everybody was, you know, I mean, this was the auto, automobile capital of the world, you know.  So, everybody worked, you know, Gen- General--GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company], one of the GM plants or the Pontiac [Michigan] GM plants, or one of them was, you know, probably not even, you know, a mile away from the house.  And, everybody who lived in the complex, their parents most likely worked, worked at the plant or, you know, or at a supplier.  So, lots of kids.  It was diverse, you know, you know, whites and blacks, and a Latino community.  We were all, you know, doing the same thing.  (Pause) I don't remember what it smelled like, though (laughter).
Speaker 1: That might be good.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: I can't tell you what it smelled like, you know.
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of music in the home, when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: The sounds.  The sounds would be, you know, Stevie Wonder, 'Songs in the Key of Life,' Grover Washington [Grover Washington, Jr.], Hiroshima, Weather Report, Bill Cosby records, you know.  Listen to, I listened to those records, man, "The Chicken Heart that Ate New York City" ["Chicken Heart"].  And, Flip Wilson, Red Foxx, you know, I listened to those records a lot, you know.  In another life, I may have been, you know, trying to exercise some comedy chops.  And, I would play the records through the screen, you know, to my friends.  You know, and, you know, I couldn't--my parents [Elizabeth Hardy and KEM's stepfather, Erick Hardy] would be gone.  I have to stay in the house, and I'd play, I'd play those records, and we would all, you know, laugh together.  Those were, those were good times.  It was, you know, it was--I remember being, it was hot.  It was always hot, man, summertime, man, it was just, I don't know it seem like it was, it was just, it was just always hot, man, being outside in the summer.
Story_ID: 630347
Speaker 1: So, this like a suburban type, you know, setup where you lived in--this is like (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, today it's a, today I drive by, it's a project, you know.  I mean, and I mean, and it's really in, in disrepair.  It's, you know, that's not how I remember it as a, as a kid, you know, as a kid, you know.  And, it was probably newer then.  I mean, and everybody, you know, the economy was different, and you know, people were working.  And, I don't think that anybody was, you know, you know, and behind us, you know, there were people who had houses.  And, we thought the people who had houses may have been just a, you know, just a little better than us.  But, we never felt like we were, you know, denied.  And, we were all, you know, kind of, kind of doing the same thing.
Speaker 1: These are in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, it was--
Speaker 1: The Detroit [Michigan] area?
Speaker 2: No, this is Pontiac [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Oh, in Pontiac.  Well--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, well, you know, but to me it's all the same, you know what I mean.  But, it's not.  But, I mean, but it's all, you know, I mean, I say Detroit, you know what I mean, you know, so.  Yeah, so, I, I, I don't know that I would, you know--and when we left there and moved to, you know--so, I, I guess we wouldn't considered, we wouldn't have not, we would not have considered that to be the suburb.  'Cause when we moved, we moved to Southfield [Michigan] and, and we were looked at as moving to the suburb.  You know, George [George Jefferson] and Weezie [Louise Jefferson], that type of thing (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: So, what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: McCarroll [Sarah McCarroll Elementary School; McCarroll Center, Pontiac, Michigan], it was McCarroll.
Speaker 1: McCarroll, okay.
Speaker 2: In kindergarten, and then I went to WHRC [Whitmer Human Resources Center, Pontiac, Michigan] first through fourth grade.  And, then my parents [Elizabeth Hardy and KEM's step father, Erick Hardy] sent us to, for my junior high years, fifth through eighth grade, I went to a school in Detroit [Michigan] called Michigan Institute for Child Development.  And, it was a, it was a private school.  It was on Greenfield [Road] and Seven Mile [Road], and it was run by a lady named Roslyn Murray.  I think there were, and there may have been at that time there may have been three, three campuses.  The one I was at--there was one on Seven Mile and Lahser [Road].
Speaker 1: This like a charter school?
Speaker 2: I can't tell you.  I don't know.  I guess today, I guess today it would be considered to, you know, it may be considered a charter school.
Speaker 1: I know Michigan is kind of like a pioneer in the charter school movement.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I know there were charter school here and in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] before there were in De- in Chicago [Illinois], actually.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they was being debated in Chicago before it got there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Whether it was working in Detroit or not working, you know, that type of thing.  So, let's go back to, let's go do kindergarten.  And, now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: I've been told (laughter), that I used to, in kindergarten I used to cry if couldn't go to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know who that person was (laughter), you know.  I was social as a kid though, you know.  I was, you know, I was social as a kid, man.  And, you know, even before we left Nashville [Tennessee], man.  It was like I'd bring, you know, I'd be bringing strangers home in the house, you know, with who I met, you know.  You know, and at that time, you know, when we were growing up, you know, it was a different day, man.  It's like, although, you know, I mean, we would leave the house and be gone, you know what I mean.  It was like, "Stay in the front yard so I can see where you are."  It was like, no.  We would leave the house and we would be gone, like all day.  And, I can be anywhere, you know what I mean.  I could be, you know, right around the block, or I could be, you know, ten to fifteen miles away doing something, and just be back at a certain time or, you know what I mean.  So, you know, you can't, you can't do that today.  But, I was always social even in, you know, up, you know, to a point.  And, so, I, I, I liked, I liked, I liked being, I would say I liked being in school as a, you know, from probably kindergarten up until, up until, up until middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now during this time period, was church important?
Speaker 2: We actually didn't, you know, my, you know, as religious as, as my grandparents were on both sides of my family, we went to church very few times.  You know, it was even--you know, I remember going once on Easter.  We may have gone on, on, on Easter a couple of times.  But, growing up, we didn't, we didn't spend a lot of time in the church away from, away from Nashville.

Speaker 1: Now did you have, so was--the big move to Southfield [Michigan], happened when you were how old?
Speaker 2: I was in, I was starting my sophomore year of high school [Southfield High School; Southfield High School for the Arts and Technology, Southfield, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Of high school.  Okay.  So, you actually grew up in Pontiac [Michigan].
Speaker 2: I grew up in, I mean, yeah, so, I spent most of my years in, in Pontiac, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, during your grade school days, what did you gravitate towards?  What were you interested in, not just in school, but in period?
Speaker 2: In grade, during my grade school days, you know, we were--I was just, you know, I was just being a kid, you know, doing the things that kids do.  I've al- I was always, I think my entrepreneurial spirit, you know, it reared its head early on 'cause I was always trying to make money, you know.  So, I had, I used to work at a DAV hall or I think that's, does that--Disabled American Veterans, or something?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know, they play bingo and I would be getting them their snacks, you know, and, and you know, and saving my money and, and then spent it on all my friends, you know, and doing things that kids do.  But, I was al- I was always, you know, a hustler at heart, you know.  And, sometimes in a good way, and sometimes not in a bad way, you know.  I had a proclivity to, to relieve others of their merchandise too, (laughter) as, as a kid, you know.  I was liberating their merchandise.  I was setting it free.
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean actually taking 'em, or talking 'em out of stuff or what?
Speaker 2: Taking it--both, probably.  You know, I'm sure there are those who would accuse me of both, you know.  And, you know, so I was, you know, as a kid I was a, I was a thief, man, and, but I was also a worker, you know.  And, it took, it took some time, some time and some, and some, and some harsh lessons to, to grow out of, to grow out of (laughter), to leave that behind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm trying to think about the time, I'm a little off on the time period.  So, you're in school from eight--okay, six is what year?  When are you six?
Speaker 2: Six is first grade.
Speaker 1: I mean, in what year though?
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Between six and--?
Speaker 2: Oh, what year was I, was I, oh, oh, oh--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, that's, that's, you know, that is ten and eleven you know.  Ten and eleven.  Ten, eleven, twelve, you know, probably pre- you know, just about pre-teen.
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking about the actual year.  Nineteen seventy [1970] what?
Speaker 2: Oh, then I, yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: So, you were born in?
Speaker 2: I was born in '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967].  Okay.
Speaker 2: So, if I'm ten, that's '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Yeah, '77 [1977], okay.  All right.  So, that gets us in the ballpark here on what's going on in popular culture in those days.
Story_ID: 630350
Speaker 1: This is, '77 [1977] is one of the big breakout years for Michael Jackson.  I mean, he was already a star.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, he became like a star, becoming a superstar.
Speaker 2: 'Off the Wall.'  It's like I remember 'Off the Wall.' 'Thriller.'
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's right.
Speaker 2: It wasn't the--but, they, I mean, The Jack- The Jacksons [Jackson 5] were, The Jacksons were, you know, they were, you know, '77 [sic. 1979] is, is, you know, that's 'Off the Wall,' that's stardom.  But, he didn't become like, like the guy until 'Thriller,' you know what I mean.  'Thriller' was like a whole 'nother thing, you know.  But, I mean, but that was the, that, that would've been The Jacksons.  That would've been the early--I remember, you know, 'Off The Wall' and hearing "Rock with You," you know, in, in middle school [Michigan Institute for Child Development, Detroit, Michigan].  I was in, I was in middle school when "Rock with You," was out and those records.  And, "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough."  And, so, it was like the tail end, the tail end of The Jacksons and then the, you know, and then him starting.  And, you know, 'The Wiz' had just, you know, all that stuff was, you know, around in the, in the, in the same time, you know, for me in my memory, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that's the, and then towards the end of the '70s [1970s] when music videos really start.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, end of the '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s], MTV [Music Television; MTV].  'Cause when we moved Southfield [Michigan] and we got cable, but MTV was only playing like, you know, they only had like three videos playing, you know.  I remember seeing David Bowie all the time.   And, there weren't any, you know, there weren't any, I don't think there were any African Americans on, on MTV at that time, but yeah.
Speaker 1: I know that we had conversations with executive at BET [Black Entertainment Television] that talked about how BET filled a void for black artist being on, in music videos--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause MTV didn't put 'em on--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that much, you know.  And, so, BET kicks in and, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so, you know, and Casey Kasem who just passed away, was doing, you know, we'd get up and I'd get up and watch the, the countdown on TV, I remember that.  And, seeing, you know, Mick Jagger in the video, yeah, right, right, right, right.  So, yeah, and what was on, what was on TV?  You know, 'Good Times,' and 'The Jefferson,' and 'All in the Family.'  And, I remember a little bit of 'Flip Wilson Show' ['The Flip Wilson Show'].  Who, Flip Wilson was a, was a very funny cat, you know, very, you know, he was, you know, I, you know, I--there's a, somebody needs to tell that--someone needs to tell that guy's story, man.  He's very, very intelligent, very, very sophisticated, his comedy was good, you know, and they, they air his shows right now.  I'm getting off topic.  But, yeah, I remember, I remember those shows.
Speaker 1: As the popular culture, you were--in '77 [1977] 'Star Wars' ['Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope'] came out.
Speaker 2: 'Star Wars,' right.
Speaker 1: And, I was trying to think of what was happening (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember going to see 'Star Wars' in middle school.  We went to go see 'Star Wars,' at the Americana [Americana Theatre, Southfield, Michigan] over on, on Greenfield [Road], and just north of, just north of the Nine Mile [Road].
Story_ID: 630351
Speaker 1: Did your musical expression have any outlet, in those days?
Speaker 2: You know, I had neighbors who had, who had pianos in their homes.  Or, I'd find the piano in the school.  I was always, you know, I was always seeking that out, you know.  Seeking out a place where I could, where I could play the piano.  'Cause I, you know, I fell in love with the piano before I left Nashville [Tennessee].  And, we didn't have one in the house.  So, and we, I'd have babysitters, I had a babysitter, Mona Webb [ph.].  The Webbs used to keep our, you know, their whole family used to babysit us, man.  And, and they had a piano in the house and Mona taught me some things on, on the piano.  I think she taught me 'Colour My World,' which I couldn't play today if you ask me to, to save my life.  But, but, you know, there wasn't, there wasn't support for music in the house.  And, I don't know that it was, I don't know if that was deliberate or intentional or if it was just not, you know, they didn't that that, you know what I mean, it's like they weren't aware that that was, you now, that was, that was something that I was, I was, I was gravitating towards.  I don't know that they knew.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know if my parents [Elizabeth Hardy and KEM's step father, Erick Hardy] knew that.
Speaker 1: That's an odd kind of thing, you know, to have a talent, a hidden talent that your people in your household don't even know about.  'Cause most kids that can draw or do something, their parents know that they can do it.
Speaker 2: And, but, and, you know, but then, you know, but then also in that I think that, you know, my dad was, you know, an intellectual, you know.  And, he's, you know, you know, they're like, and when it was fine, when, when, when they did realize that that was an interest of mine, you know, your parents wanna lead you towards, you know, something that's gonna be more secure.  Or, something that is going to, you know, if you're gonna provide for a family, you know, or, you're gonna, you know, you know, get a job, you know what I mean.  They came up trying to get something, you know.  They came from a generation that didn't have anything, you know.  And, you know, being the, you know, the first of, of their families to go to school and, and not have to, you know, do a domestic job or, or work out in the--you know, they were trying to, they were trying to elevate.  And, and, you know, so, the sensible thing, the sensible thing, the intellectual thing to do would be, you know, to go to college and get a degree.  And, and get a job that, you know, that you can sustain yourself with, and you know, and become a, you know, a upstanding, you know, participant in, in your community, you know, and become a man, you know what I mean.  And do those things, you know.  And, and I don't, I don't fault them for that, you know.  And, there a lot things, and I get, you know, and I look at my life and, you know, there're a lot of things that, you know, from a different perspective, we would view as being negative, you know, addition runs in my family.  You know, there's all, there's all types of dysfunctional that goes, that runs in my family.  And, and I wouldn't go back, you know, I wouldn't change anything, you know.  I wouldn't change anything, man, because, because I have, because of where I've, I've arrived at.  I think that all of those things, all those things work together, you know, for the good to make us who we are today, you know, so.  So, I'm, I'm grateful for that.
Story_ID: 630352
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Elizabeth Hardy] establish a business?  Now you said, she finished Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] in business.  Did she--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she worked for, well she worked for, she worked in the, in the bank, in the banks when she was working.  She took time off when, she wasn't working at a certain period when we were growing up--I don't exactly when that was.  My dad [KEM's step father, Erick Hardy] was holding it down and all the kids were at home.  And, then she would go on to, she became a Mary Kay consultant [Mary Kay Inc.], you know, and moved up to directorship in Mary Kay.  And, she's working on, on her own line of products [Unforced Rhythms] right now.
Speaker 1: I just wanted to follow up on that to find out what she actually did with business, as an entrepreneurial type.  And, then your father was an engineer of course.  Now, did, how did you do in STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] courses, you know, like math and science courses?
Speaker 2: I was a horrible student.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was a horrible student.  You know, I had, I think at that time I had, you know, maybe a little ADD [attention deficit disorder] going on, ADHD [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder], you know those things.  Those things that we (laughter), you know, we didn't, we didn't know what to do with then, you know what I mean.  And, or, there wasn't a, there wasn't a label for it.  Or, childhood depression and, you know, it really, really insecure.  And, I really didn't understand, you know, I couldn't, I couldn't focus.  I couldn't, I didn't understand what it was all about, you know.  And, then on, you know, what was going on internally and then having to process what was going on externally, you know, it was overwhelming, you know.  My childhood was, was you know, a lot of fun at certain times, a lot of great experiences.  But, a lot were very overwhelming and, and confusing at other times.  And, which laid the groundwork for not being, not being a good student.  I, well, you know, but then, I was at Michigan [Michigan Institute for Child Development] as a student, I was double promoted.  I don't think, I didn't go to the, I didn't go to the sixth grade, you know.  I could always, you know, I've won spelling bees.  I mean, you know, there was, there was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was--so math, math and science was not, (unclear) you know, it just wasn't my thing, you know.  But, then later on, like in high school [Southfield High School; Southfield High School for the Arts and Technology, Southfield, Michigan], you know, they, you know, it just, you know, it just really, just, just fell apart.  You know, my addition started, you know, and I, you know, it just fell apart.  So, I didn't even graduate from high school with my, with my class.  I wouldn't go, I wouldn't go back to graduate from high school until I was probably, I wouldn't graduate from high school until I was probably--I got sober in 1990.  And, I was twenty-three.  So, I probably didn't graduate--I went back to school when I was probably twenty-three, twenty-four years old, I went back to school to get my diploma.
Speaker 1: To public high school?
Speaker 2: To a public adult education program.
Speaker 1: GED [General Educational Development].  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  GED, no.  I went back, I actually went back to take some classes.  I didn't go, no, I didn't go back to it.  But, it was a facility where I could go and take the classes that I need to take.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As opposed to taking the GED.  'Cause a GED, you know, it was like, I just need a, you know, a few credits.  GED was, you know, they wanted (laughter), they didn't even teach the stuff in high school that they wanted you to learn for GED, you know.  It was like, dude, I just need to go take these classes, you know, and I did that when I was, when I was probably twenty-three, twenty-four years old.
Story_ID: 630353
Speaker 1: So, when you were growing up would you say that you didn't have like much of an outlet for your creativity?  I mean, you know, aside from, 'cause I was reading that in high school [Southfield High School; Southfield High School for the Arts and Technology, Southfield, Michigan] you'd spend your lunch hour doing music.
Speaker 2: I would skip classes to do music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I would not go to class and I would be in the music room.  And, I don't know that, I mean, there was, you know, there was an outlet for it but it was also a, you know, 'cause I was in choir in, in high school.   There--it wasn't in my house but I mean I, you know, I was, I was trying to write songs.  I was, I was, you know, have, not having, not having it in, in the home was not a, was not a deterrent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause you had, you had friends that you could (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, I had, I had friends that were into music or, you know, I mean, you know, yeah, so we, we got it done.
Speaker 1: Now, were there any, any teachers in high school, or any adult figures, aside from your parents [Elizabeth Hardy and KEM's step father, Erick Hardy] of course, that were like a role model for you, or mentors?
Speaker 2: In middle, in middle school [Michigan Institute for Child Development, Detroit, Michigan] there was a, there was a teacher named Greg Smith.  And, I wish I knew where he was today.  And, he sat me down and, 'cause in middle school, I started singing, a ver- my version of George Benson's 'Broadway' ['On Broadway'] in front of my class, acapella.  And, and they dug it, you know.  And, and it was the first time that I had gotten, it was, it was the first time in middle school, you know, the thing for, the thing in middle school that I was, that I was, I was known for that I got positive feedback for, positive attention from doing.  And, and Greg Smith recognized that, and, and he sat me down and, and helped me start writing a song.  Well, we were, we were actually, we were actually reassembling a song that already existed.  Like, it may have been from The Temptations or the, The Manhattans or somebody.  And, he was, you know, coaching me through the process of, of writing a song.  And, he would get me, he would do things to, or say things that would get me to, you know--he may write a line down and then he would get me to write the line.  And, we were actually recreating a song that was already, you know, in, in existence.  And, I can't remember what the song was.  And, at the time, you know, I didn't know how important that was at the time, you know.  I didn't know, you know, what that was.  And, but, some of my most positive musical experiences happened in middle school, and I didn't really think about that until today.
Speaker 1: Now, did you play any instrument?
Speaker 2: I mean, I play piano, I mean, you know, I played piano.  I don't know if there was--I don't think there was a piano in school.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Now, you're like a self taught piano player, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  'Cause I don't play, I mean, I'm not a virtuoso by any means, you know what I mean.  I don't even--I can't even--I don't even read music, you know.  And, and I only play my own songs, you know.  And, you know, I've tried to study it but I just--I'm not, I mean, you know what, I mean, you know what, I mean, go figure, man.  I'm not acclimated to that aspect of, of music.  I just, you know, I've never, you know, I've sat in classes and I've taken, you know, I been choir where, you know, it was all laid out, you know, I've, you know, and I've just never been able to get it, you know.  And, you know, I think it's the, I think it's the, you know, the math thing, the numbers thing.  I've never been, you know, it's just not my thing.  I can count money though, so, if I'm supposed to get paid, we gonna, we gonna, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right--
Story_ID: 630354
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to sing solos in high school [Southfield High School; Southfield High School for the Arts and Technology, Southfield, Michigan], or middle school [Michigan Institute for Child Development, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I did, I, I was in the choir.  I never sang solo.  I was the guy who, I was the guy who was least likely to succeed, you know.  And, you know, there were people in high school, man, who could play, play and write and sing circles around me, you know.  And, I had au- I had auditioned for things that I never, that I never got.  I tried to--I did have a so- I did have, we did, we did 'We are the World.' That was another thing that was happening in the, in the culture when I was growing up.  We did, we did 'We are the World' for our high school commencements.  And, like, I walked across the stage but I didn't get a diploma.  And, and I sang, I sang Tina Turner's part in, in 'We are the World,' you know.  And, I mean, it was, you know, and it was good.  I saw a video or heard it, you know, it was, you know, it was all right, you know.
Speaker 1: How did her part go (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, (singing) "We're all a part of God's great big family, and the truth is," someday something, something, something, something, you know, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, that's the 'We are the World' days.  Now, this is, this is '85 [1985] or?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  That was, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, that's when Michael, and Michael was, was really big then.  You know, he was, that's, that's on the heels of, or in the throes of 'Thriller' and that whole, that, you know, there was whole, all that stuff went together.  But, yeah, so.
Speaker 1: These are big days for music especially with the music videos.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Being so popular.  I mean, I know there are households that played MTV [Music Television; MTV] or BET [Black Entertainment Television] twenty-four hours a day in our community.  I mean, I know it.  So, you hear lots and lots of music and people can see the musicians for the first time, you know.  Where in the past, you might know what they look like from looking at the album cover or going to the concert.  But, there was a period where you didn't know what they look like.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, it made everything more accessible, man.  Yeah, and then, you know, and then Michael came and like just revolutionized, you know, the whole thing, you know.  And, I mean, you know, 'til this day, you know, when that whole, you know, the guy's in the front and everybody's in the back dancing, doing the same move, you know, that's Michael Jackson, you know.  That's, you know, he was a, you know, a huge, a huge influence on, on me.
Speaker 1: Now, were you into movement in those days?  I mean, could you dance like Michael Jackson?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, dude, you couldn't've told me I wasn't Michael Jackson.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I had the coat, you know.  We all had S-Curls.  You know, we were trying to figure out what kind of curl he had, you know.  We were all, you know, yeah, you know, Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson and Prince, you know.  And, Prince more from the, from the, from the musician standpoint, the musical standpoint.  And, they're both great entertainers.  But, Michael, you know, Michael, you know, Michael was, and you know--and, when he died [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy, Berry Gordy, I heard Berry Gordy say that he was the, he was the greatest entertainer that ever lived, you know.  I mean, for real, you know.  And, so he's a, he's a major influence on me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of people say that.
Story_ID: 630355
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a sense of the legacy of Motown [Motown Records], you know, when you were growing up here in Detroit [Michigan]?  I mean, you know.
Speaker 2: You know, I think, the, you know, the Motown sound, The Temptations, and Marvin Gaye, and The Supremes, were a little, they were a little ahead of my, you know, my, my ability to know what that was.  As I got older, I'm a huge, you know, I, you know, Michael's [Michael Jackson], one of his breakout performances was 'Motown 25' ['Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever'].  And, where he, where he performed 'Billy Jean' and did the, you know, the moonwalk.  And, you know, and hours later we were sitting in front of the TV, man, with my parents [Elizabeth Hardy and KEM's step father, Erick Hardy], my parents was, you know, my mom was like blown away by it, you know.  And, so, I, I started to develop sensibilities around what, what Motown was.  And, a huge Diana Ross fan.  Went to school, you know, to high school with her nephew, Stephen Lee, and you know, sat next to him in algebra.  And, would bug him about, you know, getting a picture, man.  "Can you bring me a picture?"  Can you, you know, I was a huge Diana Ross fan.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you get one?
Speaker 2: I did.  You know, he gave me one of her and her sister [HistoryMaker Barbara Ross-Lee] standing out in front of her, in front of her house in, in Connecticut, you know.  I, you know, a huge Diana Ross fan.  And, so, I have, but, but because we're in Detroit and because Detroit is a, is a musical city, you know, and throughout my career I have, I don't think you can escape, you know, what, what that was, you know, and what that is.  And, I've worked with a lot of, a lot of those musicians, you know, playing on my records.  Who sat in on the, who sat in on those sessions and played with those artist, you know.  Ed Gooch [Edward Gooch], Paul Riser does, you know, who did string arrangements for 'Just My Imagination,' 'Rocket Love,' you know what I mean, you know, the world class, world renown string arranger, he works on my records.  You know, I just, you know, I just did a session with him a couple of weeks ago.  So, I think anybody whose making music, you know, in, in Detroit has to, you know, recognizes that, that, this is, that that Motown thing is in you, you know.  And, and, I'm glad about that.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were friends with Brian O'Neal--
Speaker 2: Brian O'Neal, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in high school [Southfield High School; Southfield High School for the Arts and Technology, Southfield, Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: Brian O'Neal was another guy who, who was a musical mentor of sorts, you know.  He taught me how to play a song on the piano.  But, which is probably the only cover tune that I can play.  'Do Me, Baby' by Prince.  You know, he's probably--Brian is the person who musically who I knew who I could, who I could, who I could reach out and touch.  And, probably still this day, man, he's like probably, you know, he's, he's an incredible musician.  And, it's incredible, you know.  And, just to listen to him play.  And, live, and kind of live vicariously through him, you know, musically.  Because, you know, he plays in a way that I've always inspired to play.  But, but, you know, I've made peace with the fact that I can't because I'm, you know, I've rec- I've learn to recognize where my giftings are and where my limitations are, and how to acclimate myself to make--to take advantage of, of the whole thing.  And, you know, he's--so, he taught me how to play a song.  I followed him around.  I followed him around in, in bands, and watched him gig.  And, you know, he's seen me at, at the, at the peaks of my life, and he's seen me in my darkest moments, you know.  He was there, you know, at the tail end of my addiction, you know.  He visited me when I was in treatment, you know.  So, but, you know, and musically, you know, he, you know, you know.  Yeah, he's, he's the cat, you know, and he adds a tremendous value to, to what I do today.  And, has really, you know, has really helped me.  We wrote a lot of songs together.  We started recording together.  We--you know, my first demo records were done with Brian.  The first group [Wild Pair (ph.)] I was in, you know, Brian was in, you know.  So, I, I, you know, I, I owe a lot to the, to what he's brought to my life musically, professionally, yeah.
Story_ID: 630357
Speaker 1: So, I was asking you off camera, if were you in any, any musical group or a band or anything in high school [Southfield High School; Southfield High School for the Arts and Technology, Southfield, Michigan]?  And, you were saying no.
Speaker 2: Nah.
Speaker 1: Not really.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have, no I wasn't in a band.  I didn't get into a--after high school I did a stint with a band as their front man which I was ill-equipped for.  And, we probably, we rehearsed, you know, singing the music of that day, in that era, would've been the Minneapolis [Minnesota] sound.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, Prince and, and The Time.
Speaker 1: And, Jimmy Jam [HistoryMaker James "Jimmy Jam" Harris, III] (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Morris Day, Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis, you know, Alexander O'Neal, you know, it was, it was that sound.  You know, Janet, they were, you know, Janet, Janet Jackson.  There may have been, right, when I was in the band there was probably was, there was more the Minneapolis thing and then Terry and Jimmy didn't start until maybe a couple of years later, you know.  I mean, well, they had started with The S.O.S. Band, and, and Cherrelle.  And, they had--they had done some things, but then that 'Control' album with, with Janet Jackson, you know was really when, when I was on, when they were on my radar.  But, I was in a band.  And, then I was a member of, of two bands.  One was called Wild Pair [ph.].  That was with, with Brian O'Neal and another one of our friends, Sam Donahue [ph.].
Speaker 1: Now, this is right out of high school?
Speaker 2: This was, this was probably, this was, you know, I wanna say (pause) '87 [1987], '88 [1988], you know.  So, probably a couple of years out of high school (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 630358
Speaker 1: Before we get there, I just wanna ask, now, what, what happened in high school [Southfield High School; Southfield High School for the Arts and Technology, Southfield, Michigan] where you just, I mean, you didn't, you didn't graduate, right?  And, you were just (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Didn't graduate.
Speaker 1: And, so, what wall did you hit at that point?  It had to be a lot of pressure on you--
Speaker 2: Oh, there's all kind, I mean, yeah, 'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for not, you know, finishing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we, you know, we moved from, you know, I just, you know, I really, I really think that, you know, that, that ADHD [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder], depression, you know, 'cause I really, you know, I didn't know what any of that stuff was about, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I could not--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I just could not get with, you know, I couldn't get with the program.  So--
Speaker 1: So, nobody, no counselor, nobody, your parents, nobody could figure out what was really wrong?
Speaker 2: And, I couldn't, and I didn't know how to, and I didn't know how to, you know, to reach out and try to get, you know, and I, and I don't know how much of that is a, is a child's responsibility.  But, you know, people, you know, I, you know, and I can't, I can't speak for parents.  I, I mean, you would you have to, you know, they, you would have to ask them, you know, what their perspective on it was.  You know, but there was definitely something more going on than me just, than, you know, when a child is not doing well or not, or not adjusting to their environment there's, you know, there's something going on, you know.  And, and it's not just because they don't wanna do well, you know, or they're, you know, or we're just, you know, slacking off.  There was something going on.  And, my parents, for whatever reason, didn't know and, and because of that didn't address what that was.  And, I didn't know how to address it and didn't know what it was, and you know.  And, and, I'm not, and I wasn't, and I didn't feel that I had, and I didn't feel that I had an outlet to, to voice what was wrong, if I knew what was wrong, you know.  All, you know, all I knew that I was, all I know was that I wasn't, I wasn't living up to the, living up to the task.  And, I was, and I was having a hard time which made, which really made the ground fertile, you know, to start using alcohol and drugs.
Speaker 1: So, how did they handle you know finishing high school?  I mean, or not--?
Speaker 2: Oh, it wasn't, it wasn't pretty, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can imagine.
Speaker 2: You know, James Evans [James Evans, Sr.] (laughter), you know.  Yeah, it was pretty, you know.  I mean, we kept, we didn't, you know, my family, we didn't communicate in my house, you know.  I didn't communicate with my parents.  Not on a, not on a real level, you know, not at, not at that time.  You know, I never felt that it was, you know, in any area of my life, you know, at that time, I never felt that it was, it was safe to do that.  I never felt safe, a safe place to be able to do that, you know.  And--
Speaker 1: Did they believe in corporal punishment?
Speaker 2: Oh, for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.  And, I wouldn't say that I was, yeah, yeah, I mean, yes, so that's probably, you know, that's part of it too, I think.  But, I wouldn't, you know, I wasn't, I wouldn't say that I was abused in that regard, I mean, you know, we got whoopings when we was kids, you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Like a lot of families.
Speaker 2: Like a lot of families do.
Speaker 1: Well, most black families.
Speaker 2: I don't think, I don't think that in my case it wasn't excessive.  So--
Speaker 1: What was the deal when you stopped going to school?  What did they say?
Speaker 2: So, right, so I mean, but I was, but see, you know, but then, and then there's me and my part of it is, you know, I'm not gonna tell you that I'm, that I'm failing the class or that I'm not doing well in school.  I make my report cards.  You know, I, I hide, you know, I hide things.  You know, I, you know, kept things from my parents until the last possible minute, you know.  And, then, you know, and then there was, you know, so I didn't--so, I walked across the stage.  My mom [Elizabeth Hardy] knew that I wasn't graduating.  My mother knew that, you know.  My, my, my father [KEM's step father, Erick Hardy] did not know that.  And, you know, which speaks to the whole communication, you know, dynamic that was doing on, you know, in our house.  And, and I had started using at that time, and, you know, my dad was, "Either, you know, you're either gonna, you're either gonna, you know, finish school or you're going to, or you're gonna get a job," you know.  And, and, I left, I ended up leaving the house when I was, when I was nineteen.  You know, I left the house when I was nineteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're like a year pass graduation?
Speaker 2: Couple years.  Couple years pass graduation I was gone.
Speaker 1: Now, did you, were you able to get a job anywhere?
Speaker 2: Nah.  I was in addiction.  I mean, so, I've, I had jobs.  I worked, you know, in some retail places.  I worked as a telemarketer in some places, you know, restaurants.  But, yeah, after I left the house, after I left home, I was, I was in, I was in addiction.
Story_ID: 630359
Speaker 1: What were you, I mean, who introduced you to, to whatever?  Now, what were you addicted to, and who introduced you to it?
Speaker 2: I'm addicted to everything (laughter), you know.  I'm, I'm, you know, I'm addicted to, you know, if I start using anything, you know, I'm all in.  So, my, I would say that my drug of choice was, you know, I liked 'em all actually.  But, you know, the, the, at that time, alcohol was the most, you know, accessible.  Even though I wasn't old enough to buy, you know, we found ways to, you know, to get access to it.  And, you know, I come from a generation where, you know, your, you know, your uncle or, you know, or your cousin, you know, you're taking a sip out of your dad's can, or, you know, out of your dad's beer can.  Or, sneaking a couple of beers now and then.  And, you know, I remember mixing a drink when I was in Florida, you know, making a screwdriver with some orange juice and some vodka in it.  And, and I brought it to a relative's attention and their response to me was that it was too strong, you know.  I mean, you know, so, I don't know that anybody, you know, nobody turned me out, you know.  I was, I was, I was, you know, I was seeking it, you know.  And, I walked to school with an older cat in high school at Pontiac Northern [Pontiac Northern High School, Pontiac, Michigan] and we got high on the way to school, you know. He smoked, and that was the first time that I'd ever smoked a joint, you know, we got high on the way to school.  And, you know, and (laughter), I can't imagine that anybody in school didn't know that I was high, 'cause I was like, you know, I was high, man.  It was like, you know, the highest I've ever been in my life.  And, you know, so, I, you know, I experimented, you know, I was smoking, smoking cigarettes and I have a picture of, when my dad [KEM's step father, Erick Hardy] caught me smoking.  He made me smoke a pack of Kools sitting at the kitchen table.  He'd go to jail for that today (laughter), they'd throw him in jail.  He'd be locked up, you know.  'Cause that's what his dad said that he was gonna do, you know, if he ever caught him smoking, you know.  And, you know, it didn't, you--it didn't deter either of us, you know.  I would go on smoking and go beyond that.  So, you know, the ground was fertile, man, for, for me to experience, experiment with, with different kind of drugs.  I think the, I haven't done any intro--I hadn't done any, or haven't done any intravenous drugs but everything else was on the table.  And, actually, that would've been on the table too, I just never got around to it, you know, yeah.  Thank god (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 630360
Speaker 1: So, a couple of years you were still at home and then finally, now, what precipitated your leaving home?  Was there something (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because I wasn't, because I wasn't working.  I wasn't in school.  I was, I was getting high.  I had left the house.  The incident that partic- the incident that proceeded it was, I was gone for a couple of days, you know.  I didn't, I just didn't come home, you know, for two days, you know, in two or three days.  And, when I did come home, you know, my parents [Elizabeth Hardy and KEM's step father, Erick Hardy] were, you know, of the mindset that I need to be living that lifestyle someplace else, you know, and I left that day.
Speaker 1: So, where did you go?
Speaker 2: For a while I flopped around in the neighborhood, you know, with friends, sleeping in their basement.  Sam Donahue [ph.] who lived around the corner, I would, I would sleep in his basement.  And, and then after that, it was on to shelters, SOS shelter [South Oakland Shelter] out in Royal Oak [Michigan], which, and today I sit on their board.  I got a board meeting today with them, and the Rescue Mission, Detroit Rescue Mission [Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, Detroit, Michigan] was one of my stops.  Salvation Army was one of my stops, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, this seems like a pretty--
Speaker 2: And, you asked me about jobs that I had.  And, I know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm off, I'm off the thing--
Speaker 1: Nah, go ahead.
Speaker 2: I used to deliver papers.  I used to deliver the newspapers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to deliver, I used to deliver The Detroit News, and the, the Detroit Free Press in high school.  I would deliver the Free Press in the morning before I went to school.  And, I would deliver the, The Detroit News when I came home in the afternoon.  My dad would drive me.  And, we would get up early in the morning and he would drive me around and throw papers on people's porches.  And, then I, I also delivered The Wall Street Journal for a stint too, you know.  Probably, when I got, when I, before I left home I was delivering The Wall Street Journal.  The neighborhood we, the neighborhood we moved into in Southfield [Michigan] was a predominately Jewish neighborhood.  Which was, you know, which was, but then, you know, there was a lot of value in that, in that for me, man.  'Cause it gave me a different perspective, you know, than, than--it gave me, you know, it gave me a different perspective than a lot of the people that I was, that I was growing up with.  And, 'cause I didn't grow up in, my childhood experiences were not, you know, were not, you know, what I would think are the typical African American experiences, you know.  You know, I didn't grow up in the, you know, you know, the, my surroundings were always diverse.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know Brian O'Neal at, back in Pontiac [Michigan], or--
Speaker 2: Brian O'Neal in Southfield High [Southfield High School; Southfield high school for the Arts and Technology, Southfield, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Southfield?
Speaker 2: Southfield.
Speaker 1: Southfield High, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: So, that was huge--and that, and that, and that was, and that was part of the thing in high school too, 'cause it was huge culture shock, you know, to leave Pontiac and then, and then be, you know, in Southfield in this entirely different, you know, environment.  And, trying to be, and going through, you know, the, the things that you're going through at that age just anyway, compiled by being in a new environment and all that other stuff going on.  So, so, that's what, you know, made for a lot of, you know, that stuff laid the ground, I think all that stuff combined laid, laid the groundwork for addiction.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, you're out on the, so, you're in a couple of groups even through this, right?  And, different jobs, but they're not like big jobs?  They're like--
Speaker 2: Nah, they're not big jobs.  I didn't, I wasn't, I didn't have a career, you know.  I mean, I was just, you know, trying to put, you know, a couple dollars together.  But, music was always a mainstay.  You know, I was always writing songs.  Even in my addiction, I was writing songs in treatment.  And, you know what I mean, I was, you know, music was, music has, has been in many ways, a refuge for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I heard like, I mean, from what I read here, things got kind of worse and worse until you reached a major crisis.  How long did it take for, you said, 1990 when you finally--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I quit drinking in 1990.  So, from, you know, my addiction probably lasted--
Speaker 1: About four or five years?
Speaker 2: Probably about six, probably about six years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Six years, seven on the outside.  I mean, if you count the very first time that, I mean, you know, I don't know that I would count the first time that, that I used.  But, you know, at least from high school.
Speaker 1: How many times did you attempt to, or can you remember how many times you attempted to stop?
Speaker 2: I may have tried to stop once.  I mean, I tried to stop once and I actually, and my body, I actually tried to stop drinking once, and I stopped for a couple of weeks, and you know, and my body reacted to it and I ended up in the hospital.  Yeah, yeah.  And, I, and then, you know, and I got out of the hospital, started drinking again.  You know, a lot of stories like that, you know.  I've been hospitalized a couple of times for, from my addiction, you know.  And, you know, yeah, you know.  Drunk driving, and you know, been locked up--
Story_ID: 630361
Speaker 1: Through this experience, I mean, can, are there any mentors or heroes that come out through this experience that you met along the way, you know, from high school [Southfield High School; Southfield High School for the Arts and Technology, Southfield, Michigan] through 1990?
Speaker 2: You know, I think on the onset, you know, Brian O'Neal was somebody that, you know, we, we, we were dreamers.  We were dreamers, you know, getting the, getting the proverbial record deal and, and making it in the music business.  That was something that, that I always, that was something that, that I was always looking forward to.  That was like this light that was like keeping me going, you know.  And, and, for that to him I am, I am, I am grateful.  You know, and there are a lot people that I met along the way who, whose names, you know, I don't even know, you know, who may have, who may have said something to me.  Or, you know, I started hanging out with, with some people who knew how to, who knew how to deal with, with addiction.  And, you know, I, you know, I'm very grateful to all of those folks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were at various shelters around the city, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In the Detroit [Michigan] metro area, I guess.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, in, so what actually happened in 1990 to get you away from, you know, alcohol and drugs?
Speaker 2: I was sleeping outside on the, on the banks of the Detroit River.  On the eve of my birthday my last drink, I had my last drink or drug was on July 23rd of 1990.  Which is actually, which is also my, my biological birthday.   And, I was, you know, in my early twenties and, and as we say in recovery circles, you know, I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.  And, the people who, who were--all of my, my peers, you know, and Brian probably included and just others who were, you know--and I was down, I was like out, out in the streets, you know, Greektown [Detroit, Michigan], or being downtown and seeing other people who were my age, you know, who were living their lives, out on dates, going to the movies, you know, in school.  You know, thinking about their careers, you know, starting families, or whatever they were doing.  I was not doing any of that.  You know, I was, you know, living, you know, a life that, that I had not imagined for myself but had not done anything to avoid.  And, and I had just been, prior to sleeping outside on, on the riverbank of the Detroit River, I had just been kicked out of a treatment center for, for drinking.  They caught me using while I was in the facility and they had kicked me out.  And, I had to be, I had to, and they were letting, you know, if you, if you got caught using while you were in the facility, you had to leave the facility for a certain amount of time.  And, and I had to leave, I had to leave for a week.  I was out for a week.  And, I had to wait for them to have a bed for me to get back in.  So, I would go back every day and check to see if I could get back in.  And, during that last week while I was out, it was probably, you know, nothing, you know, it was probably the first time that I had actually slept outside, you know.  And, definitely slept outside for, you know, more than, you know, more than a day, you know.  And, and I was, and I was, and I was tired, you know.  It was, it was--I was bankrupted, you know, spiritually, emotionally, and physically.  And, I, and it was, it was in that moment that I became, I became willing to, to do something different.  And, I didn't know what it was.  But, I was willing to, you know what, you know, I need to, you know, whatever, you know, if I get back into this place, I'm gonna do whatever, whatever they tell me to do.  And, I'ma sit down and stop trying to figure things out, and stopping leaning on, I'm gonna stop leaning on my own understanding, and really ask for, and not even asking for help, you know.  Asking for help is part of it, but receiving, receiving the help is the other part of it, you know.  Receiving and being willing to do, you know, when you ask for help and when people show up, you know, be willing to do whatever they tell you to do in order to, in order to deal with your situation.  And, and for the first time in my life, you know, I was, I was in that place.  And, and, I haven't looked back.  I haven't looked back.
Story_ID: 630362
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I know you, at a certain point, I have a note here that you were part of the Renaissance Unity church [Warren, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Renaissance Unity, yes.
Speaker 1: Did the church help you at all?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Nah, that's like, that's, that's, you know, almost, you know, that's 1990, that's probably seven or eight years later, you know.  After I got sober I, you know, I left that facility and I, you know, had odd jobs and, and was trying to get the music things back, you know, trying to, still trying to get that going.
Speaker 1: So, what you're saying is your only internal strength that really brought you out of that hole, I mean, you had to resolve yourself to do it, and then you did it.  Is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: You know, you know, I, you know, God, God gets the, the credit, you know.  God gets the glory, you know, in my life for pulling me up.  And, without, without looking in that direction, without seeking a spiritual solution, you know, and, you know, that, you know, I can only do so much, you know.  I can do, I can only do so much, man, and you know.  Somebody said, you ask God, you ask God to move a mountain, you better bring a shovel, you know.  So, it's, you know, it's, it's, you know, I did my, I, I became willing for him to let him work through me, you know, and work through other people in my life.  Work through other people that, that, you know, I believe that he brought into my life, you know, to help me, to help me get it together.
Speaker 1: So, but, once you got it together you didn't go back, you didn't falter any or have any setbacks?
Speaker 2: No.  No, no, I haven't, you know, I haven't used, I haven't used since, you know, July 23rd of 1990, yeah, you know.  And, there're thing--you know, and I mean, and I have to, there's certain things that I have to do in order maintain my recovery, you know, which have become a part of my life.  And, you know, and I do those things, and, and I keep pushing.
Speaker 1: What are those things?  What kind of routine to you have?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, you know, I live by principles that I believe that we all should live by, you know.  And, that really is, you know, still being willing to ask for help when I need it.  Taking the, taking stock of where I'm at, at any given point, you know, of the day.  You know, bouncing my thinking off of, off of, off of another individual; not leaning onto my own understanding; being prayerful; being mindful that, that God has a plan for my life; and, I can't do it without his help.  I can't do it without the help of other people.  And, admitting when I'm wrong, you know.  You know, and trying to, and trying to help others, you know.  And, staying in contact with those things.  It's real simple stuff, man.  And, any, any, any religion that, you know, those--the tenants of all religions have those things, you know.  And, I do well when I live by those things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not a saint.  Not perfect, you know, but I mean, that's, you know, what I'm trying to, you know, get to the good stuff of my life that's, that's, that's how it's done.
Story_ID: 630363
Speaker 1: I read here that you were hired by The Ritz-Carlton [The Ritz-Carlton Dearborn; The Henry, Autograph Collection, Dearborn, Michigan]?  You served as a waiter?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did you do this very long, or?
Speaker 2: I waited tables for, four, five, six; four, five, six years, yeah.  I waited table.  Somebody told me that I would be a good waiter, you know.  So, I went and applied for a job at--Ritz-Carlton wasn't, wasn't the first place I waited tables.  I waited tables at a place, at a seafood restaurant in Farmington Hills [Michigan], and--called D. Dennison's [D. Dennison's Seafood Tavern].  Terrified, scared to death, man.  Go up to a table and, you know, taking people's orders and getting it wrong.  And, you know, first time I had to open a bottle of wine at the table, I thought I was gonna die (laughter).  You know, I'm sitting out there, I'm trying to, you know, trying to figure it out, you know.  The bot-- he wine that I drank would had--you know, had a twist cap on it, you know.  So, I'm out there trying to do this thing, and I'm totally out of my environment.  And, you know, but I was always, you know, my shirts were always pressed.  I always, you know, looked professional and, and I became good at it.  And, and some--one of the cooks that was working with me at this restaurant said, "You know, I work at The Ritz-Carlton, you know, and they're hiring."  And, their waiters, you know, it was a whole 'nother level of, of service and environment.  And, and, so I started working for The Ritz-Carlton and, and that was a very, very, very valuable experience for me.  It exposed me to, to things that I nev- that I would not have been exposed to otherwise from a service standpoint.  You know, seeking out excellence, you know, making a, making a, trying to make a way out of no way, you know bending over backwards for our, for our guests, you know.  Customer service, I mean, it's just, you know, I don't know that there was any greater place to, to learn those skills.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  Now, where were you musically, I guess, in 1990?  I mean--
Speaker 2: In 1990?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I was, I mean, you know, I had done some demos.  I had recorded a lot of things with Brian [Brian O'Neal].  And, and he was continuing to work on, on music.  He was continue to play in a top 40 band.  And, we had another friend John Penn [John Penn II] who was also--who had started a production company and he was, he was, you know, he was, you know getting his bearings with a band.  And, would later sign a group called U.N.V. that, that got signed to Warner Brothers [Warner Bros. Records; Warner Music Group Corp.].  And, and I released a project up under, up under their, up under his, his label, Undercurrent Records.  You know, so, I was still trying to get it, you know, musically.  In a nutshell, in 1990, I was still trying to get it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 630364
Speaker 1: You're still, you know, you're working at your music avocationally, and I guess, do your hours kind of facilitate you, you know, being involved in music when you were a waiter?
Speaker 2: When I was a waiter?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, you know, if you say that, you know, in the same way that someone has a hobby that they do in the, in the, in the, you know, when they're not working.  I mean, you know, we had to, you know, try to pay the bills.  I was never of the mindset to be a starving musician, you know.  Out there, and just, you know, and go out there and, you know, I like to eat (laughter), you know.  And, so, yeah.  So, I had, but, but you know, you talked about the Renaissance Unity [Warren, Michigan]. The Renaissance Unity was my first gig.  When I first started, it was my first foray outside of, outside, of waiting, waiting tables.  It was my first step into, into making a regular income from music.  And, and, it was a great platform for me.  I learned a lot of things there and learned, and met a lot of great and talented musician.  Some of whom I still, I still work with today.  And, and, then from there, you know, I met somebody who knew somebody who, who, who had a wedding band.  So, I started singing in the, I was singing the choir and I was singing in the wedding band.  And, I was able to--and, through that I ended up, and some other things I ended up, that, that was my beginning from transitioning from, from waiting tables into, into music full time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you have a family by this time?
Speaker 2: I did have a daughter.  My oldest daughter, Troi [Troi Owens], was born in 1995.  So, I did have a daughter, and yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, so, we're just, kind of tell us about the progression of your career.  You know, you're doing like weddings (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Doing weddings, singing in the church on Sunday.  Always, always writing songs, working on songs.  I, you know, I was, I was a, I was a Mary Kay [Mary Kay Inc.] consultant up under my mom [Elizabeth Hardy].  And, I was working at, and I also worked at, so I was working at The Ritz [The Ritz-Carlton Dearborn; The Henry, Autograph Collection, Dearborn, Michigan] and I was working at a place called American Blinds and Wallpaper Factory [Plymouth, Michigan].  And, I was customer service.  You know, got on the phone and helping people with their, with their orders, and speaking with, you know, I was the go between, between the customer and the manufacturer.  So, I was doing that.  I was waiting tables, working two jobs, and I stopped doing that.  And, I forget, what was your, what was your--?
Speaker 1: I was just asking about the trajectory of your career (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Right, so I was doing that, and then, and then I left.  I started singing at the church.  I transitioned from, from waiting tables to singing the church.  And, then I was singing in a wedding band.  I was always, I was still recording music.  And, and, oh my mom, Mary Kay consultant, right.  So, (laughter), my mom, I was selling it, the reason I went to the blind factory because I was the, I was selling the Mary Kay to the women that I worked with in the, in the customer service department of this company.  And, and, I wasn't trying to get a pink Cadillac, it was just a hustle, you know what I mean.  It was just a way to make some money.  And, my mom had a relationship with, well, not had a relationship, but she knew a guy that worked at a bank and she knew that he, you know, I could go up there, she talked me into going up there and getting a loan from this guy.  Under the, under the, auspices of I would use this loan to buy more product to expand, you know, my Mary Kay thing.  And, I used the money.  So, the guy gave me a two thousand dollar loans which did two things.  It helped me, it help me establish credit.  And, it also allowed me, to my mother's chagrin, to buy a keyboard (laughter).  So, I didn't buy the Mary Kay, you know--
Speaker 1: So, so what year--?
Speaker 2: --I bought a keyboard.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: This was--
Speaker 1: What, the mid-'90s [1990s], or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this had to be ninety--this had to be like ninety- '96 [1996], '96 [1996], '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or, was this before, was this before Troi?  This might be before Troi.  This might be even earlier than that, actually.  Yeah, this might be '94 [1994], '94 [1994] or '95 [1995].  And, I bought a keyboard.  And, I started sequencing.  I sequence 'Love Calls,' on the, on the keyboard that I bought with that money, you know.  And, I still have that, that keyboard is in the basement of my house.  I carried that keyboard (laughter), in a big, in a coffin case to go sit down and play for, for Motown [Motown Records] when I got the deal.  I had to, you know, to play for Kedar Massenburg, and you know, I carried that case with me, you know, on a plane.  I looked like a fool walking down Broadway Avenue, man, with this you know, but going to get it.
Story_ID: 630365
Speaker 1: So, you're still like, now, your friend Brian [Brian O'Neal] was, he was actually now working with a big name artist, by this time, right?
Speaker 2: No.  Brian wasn't with, at that time Brian had left.  I mean, we're, after, after like, after about, after I got on, Brian had moved to Atlanta [Georgia].  So, he was, you know, Brian's things was, he was, you know, his job, his day job was a computer programmer.  So, he, he had moved and went to--everybody moved, the label [Undercurrent Records] I was signed to went, moved to Atlanta.  And, Brian moved to Atlanta, you know.  And, I had spent my life, like kind of like, you know, following these guys, or trying to be in relationship with these people who were doing music, and they all left.  Which was the best thing that could ever happen, you know, for me.  You know, man, I mean, it was, it was, you know.  Because it made me, you know, I became, I became a man, you know.  You know, when your friends, you know, when you stop chasing those other cats and leaning on these other people, you know, and, and, you know, I had to, I had to come into, I had to come into my own.  And, and I was actually in the mindset that I would follow this group of people that moved from Detroit to Michigan [sic.], that I would follow them.  And, then my daughter [Troi Owens] was born in like, you know--I had plans to go to Atlanta, and I, well I'll come back, you know, every couple of weeks and like see my daughter if I live down there.  And, but, that never materialized.  And, I'm glad that that didn't happen, you know.  I'm, I'm, you know, I'm really glad that that didn't happen for a number of reasons.  So, he wasn't in- he wasn't involved in that process.  I would not, we prob- we still communicated and I saw him, and I may have gone to Atlanta to record a couple of things.  But, you know, I would, I would not working with him again until he, he moved back here and then started working with me under, under, you know, under what I'm doing now.  So, from waiting tables, to the church [Renaissance Unity, Warren, Michigan], to the wedding band, to recording my first CD [compact disc].  Which was really done--the first time we did it, we recorded the 'Kemistry' CD in a coffee house.  I couldn't, I didn't have the money to go into a studio to record.  So, I figured the best way and most economical way to do it would be just to record live.  Record it in front of a, in front of a live audience and record a CD.  And, in my opinion, it was terrible.  And, and, it got put on the, you know, it just got put on the shelf and I continued to, to work at the, you know, do whatever I was doing, you know, waiting tables.
Story_ID: 630366
Speaker 1: Well, I'm just was gonna ask like who was in your, in your group?  Now, you had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My band.
Speaker 1: (Unclear). And like what was your--?
Speaker 2: My band was made up of--I don't even know how I met these people (laughter).  I don't even know how I met these guys, man.  That is a great question.  I don't even know how I met, you know, there was a guy Zapp, Andre Driscoll is his name.  Fred Robinson [Fred "Rodriguez" Robinson], Quentin Baxter on guitar.  "Wild Bill" Murray [sic. Marlon "Wild Bill" Curry] who still plays with me today.  I don't know how I even met these guys, man.  And, we used to do--as a matter fact, when I leave here, I'm gonna call Zapp and ask him how did, how did we end up meeting.  And, he was, and he was really--and Zapp would call me, I don't know what we ended up doing together that connected us.  We may have done a show.  My now, my now manager, Toya Hankins, used to, you know, work at the Museum of African American History [Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, Detroit, Michigan] and she was, you know, would get us, get me gigs there.  And, I would play at these different festivals or events in the city.  And, but, when I wasn't working, when I, there was a time, there was a period of time where I wasn't doing, where I wasn't really focused on music.  At least not, I wasn't playing anywhere, you know.  I kind of like, my daughter [Troi Owens] was born and I was, and I had gotten, you know, I was trying to, you know, position myself and get ground--I didn't have a license until my daughter was born.  I didn't have a valid driver's license, you know.  My, my daughter was born and I started to talk differently (laughter).  And, my mother [Elizabeth Hardy] told me I started to talk, "I never heard you talk like this."  I was talking about getting a job and thinking about, you know, trying to get situated, you know, to--'cause I was gonna be a dad, you know.  And, and, it req- it was gonna require me to, me to show up in ways that I would not show up for my, I would not show up for myself but I would show up for my daughter.  And, so, I stopped doing music for a while, and, and this guy, Zapp, whose real name is Andre Driscoll, would call me.  There were few people who would call me every once and a while and ask me what I was doing, musically, you know.  They would ask me like, "Dude, why aren't you--?" You know, they would, they would always--you know, there's another guy, Jeremy Langley [ph.], he's a federal agent.  And, and he would call me and ask me, "Man, what are you doing?  You know, why aren't you, you know, why aren't you recording?  Why aren't you doing anything?"  You know.  And, these guys are the ones who recorded, who recorded that original CD ['Kemistry'] that was done in the coffee house.  And, then after the coffee house, I wasn't doing anything.
Story_ID: 630367
Speaker 1: So, the songs that are on the Motown [Motown Records] 'Kemistry' CD were the same songs that are on the first one you did (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The fr- most of those songs are, all of those songs are on that record, right.  And, the thing is, is that people, even though we never released it, people got the CD [compact disc].  People would get, people had access to it, or had found it, or somebody gave it to 'em, and they were playing it.  And, people were digging it.  You know, unbeknownst to me, you know, people were digging it.  And, by the time I started doing shows, doing that music, there were, you know, a small group of people we would perform at Half Past 3 [Detroit, Michigan], which was a club that was over on Grand River [Grand River Avenue].  And, people were sitting in the audience, man, and they would be singing this stuff.  They would be singing this stuff off of that CD that I couldn't stand, you know.  And, I, and I went back into the studio.  I got a business line of credit, and keyboard thing, you know, and it all works together, you know.  It's all good.  All of those things work together, you know, everything works together.  The keyboard thing helped me, you know, not spending that money on the Mary Kay [Mary Kay Inc.].  Which my mother [Elizabeth Hardy] hated me for at the time (laughter), in which she's probably now looking back knows that--you know, she's grateful for it, you know what I mean, about the keyboard.  Established credit and then later one down the line, I was able to get a business line of credit from American Express [American Express Company].  Which I had financed my first CD on.  Now, American Express didn't know that's what I was gonna do with the money.  But, that's what I did.  And, I, and when I got, when American Express gave me a seventeen thousand dollars business line of credit, and I quit my job.  Do not do this at home (laughter).  Do not try this at home, you know.  I quit my job.  I quit my day--no, I didn't quit my job.  I quit working at the hotel, working at The Ritz [The Ritz-Carlton Dearborn; The Henry, Autograph Collection, Dearborn, Michigan].  But, I was still singing in the choir [at Renaissance Unity, Warren, Michigan] and doing the, doing the wedding band thing.  But, I, you know, I was like you know what, you know, and went and I recorded the 'Kemistry' CD, you know, in the studio.  I still, we heading up with these same guys, didn't know what I was doing, you know.  And, kind of like stumbled and fumbled, you know, our way into making the 'Kemistry' CD, you know.  And, and the rest is history.
Speaker 1: So, so the way this, you finance your own CD, and it, how does it come to the attention of the Motown label?
Speaker 2: Because I set the, you know, I put a barcode on the CD, I put a barcode on the CD so that when--and the CD was on, I had it in retail outlets which are, you know, are not, you now, I mean, the mom and pop stores, man.  And, you know, all the, all the record shops in town had my CD, and I put 'em in there on consignment.  So, every time somebody bought a CD, you know, if they bought Luther [Luther Vandross] CD it blipped somewhere.  If they bought my CD, you got the, you got a blip too.  I mean, I was in the, I was in the system like that.  And, and, we were, you know, and, you know, the best market in the world was giving the CD away and putting it in people's hands, you know, and having them like it, you know.  Best, you know, have something that people like and put it in their hands, you know.  And, and we started to build momentum.  So, the record label, you know, people are watching and the industry are watching that, you know, this guy in Detroit [Michigan] is selling records, and he's, he doesn't have a label.  And, we're getting, we started to air play in different, in different cities, as well as Detroit.  And, it had a momentum of its own, you know.  So, you know, it made us, it made us ripe for, for a label to come and, and wanna partner with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you, you marketed the CD in beauty salons and black restaurants, and gave a lot 'em away.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 630368
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well tell us about when you heard from Motown [Motown Records] for the first time.
Speaker 2: You know, it was exciting stuff.  We, we heard from Motown.  Somebody had, Shante Paige was, I don't know if she's was administrative assistant at the label to a guy name Avery Lipman, and she heard it at a barbeque or something, you know, in somebody's backyard, you know.  And, and, we got a call stating that they were interested.  And, we went out to, we went out, when I was telling you, you know, took the keyboard out and I played a few songs for 'em.  And, they wanted to know that, you know, that I was the, you know, the guy that was on the record and that it was the real deal, see what I was, you know, what I was all about.  And, through some other relationships that Toya [KEM's manager, Toya Hankins] had I found a business attorney, Denise Brown.  And, she met us in New York [New York] for that, that initial meeting and audition and, you know, and the rest, and the rest is history.
Story_ID: 630369
Speaker 1: I'm thinking, now, well, the--couple of things.  First of all, the name, your name changes, I guess from Kim [Kim Owens], K-I-M, to [HistoryMaker] KEM, K-E-M.  When I first saw it, I said, "Oh, he's, he's been reading ancient African history," (laughter), he reading Kemetic history, or something.  But, you know, that's not it, is it?
Speaker 2: Now, you have to school me on that.  'Cause that's the first time I've even heard that.
Speaker 1: Really?  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, what happened was, the, one of the earlier, the earlier labels, or the earlier label [Undercurrent Records] that I was signed to--I had always been trying to get away from K-I-M, you know.  And, K-E-M was one of the way that I, that I, that I did that.  And, so, this producer at this, at this label I was signed to, saw that, and we started to use that as, as my stage name.  And, we had a project that wasn't successful.  Well, you know, everything works together for good.  It was successful in regard that we did get some air play here in Detroit [Michigan].  And, some people, and the few people that did know me, knew me by K-E-M.  So, once I re-emerged it was like, "Well, we wanna keep," you know, whatever we've, whatever we garnered from using this name.  Whatever familiarity that, that I have from this name, I need to keep that, you know.  And, and so, I've been using it ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, it's probably the best way that I've ever explained that (laughter).
Speaker 1: I know Toya [KEM's manager, Toya Hankins] was telling, I mean, Toya was telling us that it was a deliberate decision to do that.  'Cause I'd read, we had a piece that said it was some kind of an accident or something.  Somebody misspelled your name and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, and all that, but, you know.  But, it's better to hear it's somebody's actual deliberate idea.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 630370
Speaker 1: How would you describe your music as it emerged in 2001 with the album 'Kemistry,' you know, spelled K-E-M-I-S-T-R-Y?  What kind of music were you playing and who, and I guess, you know, what's your musical philosophy, who were your major influences in your--these are all these questions.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I just, I just like good music, you know.  I'm--melody is king.  I'm a songwriter first.  And, I've listened to a lot of great music, man.  My biggest inspirations are probably Prince and Michael Jackson.  And, and, you know, those are my favorite artists.  But, there are, there are many songs that have been sung by, by a lot of people that, or written by a lot of people that have resonated with me over the years.  And, I try to create music that, that makes, that makes a listener feel something.  And, I think that, that first album, the 'Kemistry' album was a compilations of what I wanted to be musically.  As far as like, you know, the, the whole jazz thing and being able to play in those chords.  And that remind you of, you know, you know, you know, Sarah Vaughan, and Al Jarreau, and Tania Maria, and, you know, those things that I was listening to, and, on the radio, on WJZZ [WJZZ Radio, Detroit, Michigan], you know.  So, there's the--and that probably explains why we're able to, to walk the line of jazz.  But, also have, you know, an R--the R and B edge as well.  And, I think, the, the first, you know, and I lived with those songs on the first album for a long time.  And, you know, they were, they were very personal songs.  I think that they, they spoke to, to, you know--well, the first, the 'Kemistry' album was a, was an album that expressed all of the things that, all of the things that I wasn't in my life.  You know, it, it expressed everything.  And, it wasn't verbatim.  It wasn't all factual, but it expressed everything.  It expressed me fully musically, you know.  You know, it was my life on, on, on wax, as they say, you know.  So, I, you know, you ask me what my music is.  I think that it's soulful.  I think that it's smooth.  And, you know, I really just try to write songs that, I try to write songs that I wanna hear, you know, that I would like to hear.  Write music that, that makes me feel the way I feel when I hear great music on the radio.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  That's seems strange with someone with, with such a strong lead voice only gets recognized when he's like in his thirties, you know.  I mean, or, I mean, I guess you're recognized before on some level but, you know.
Speaker 2: That is, you know, and that's what I'm saying, man.  It's divinity, you know what I mean.  I got a record deal when I was thirty-five years old, you know.  I couldn't've got a record deal at any other time in my life.  If I had gotten a record deal when I was nineteen, when I was with Brian [Brian O'Neal] and out of high school [Southfield High School; Southfield High School for the Arts and Technology, Southfield, Michigan], I'd be dead, you know what I mean.  I mean, I would be, you know, I was not, I was in no shape or form prepared, you know, to, to do what I'm doing today, you know.  It would, it would've, you know, I can't, I can't even imagine what that would've been like, you know.  So, I'm grateful, you know, that I didn't get a record deal until, that I didn't, that I didn't get recognized until I was thirty-five.  I got recognized when I was supposed to, when it was, when it was time, you know.  You know, and that's a good thing.  It speaks volumes, you know, to, to the divinity in my life.
Story_ID: 630371
Speaker 1: Now, the big hit on 'Kemistry' was "Love Call" [sic.].  That's the song that I, I, when I saw it on the--I said, "Oh, yeah."  That's, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I don't pay as much attention to popular music as I used to.  And, certain things hit me, and I don't associate names with the, 'cause, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.  I get it.
Speaker 1: --even the music sometimes.  But, when I saw that, I said, "Oh, I know actually what that is."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you do a, on that you kind of do some scatting, you know.  That's reminiscent of Al Green, or you said, Ella Fitzgerald and some other people.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, and, the interesting thing is that you're not rapping, you know.  You know, I mean, it's not, you know, it's a whole generation (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  You know, well, you know, on the new record ['Promise to Love'] we got some, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We got some, we got some, you know, we have some fair for everybody on the new record.  But--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know.  I mean, I've gone from, you know when we started out, when I started out, I was, we were trying to emulate the sound of those who we were, you know, inspired by and we admired.  We were trying to do the Minneapolis [Minnesota] sound and be like Prince, or be like Michael [Michael Jackson], or be like whatever group was happening then.  That's what I was doing in public, in the group.  But, at home, I was writing songs like "Love Calls."  I was writing these ballads.  I was doing these things that weren't popular with, with my, the people who I was working with musically.  So, I was always, you know, I was living, you know, on two sides of the street, you know.  And, and it's interesting that I would become recognized for being true to, you know, being true to my thing, you know, being true to what I do, you know, specifically what I do, and not trying to chase, you know, not trying to chase a sound, you know.  I have a sound, you know.  Nobody, you know, a producer didn't come in and say, the label didn't come in and say, "We gonna make you this."  Or, "This how we see you.  This is how we see your music."  I have a sound.  All that is established.  All of that is, you know, you know, all of that is already in the package.  Yeah, I deliver, we delivered the label a package that all they had to do is take, you know, take and work out in the streets.  And, you know, so, you know, it's been, it's been, it's been a good run.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, this is like a cross for a lot of musicians that are trying to establish themselves.  Whether they try to sound like somebody else, they sound like themselves, and, or want to discover what they actually sound like, you know.  There's a lot of artist have a great gift of voice or rhythm or something.  But, they can't, they are, there's a friction point I guess has to be reach when they actually sound like who they are, I mean, they reach something unique.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, we all, everybody sounds like somebody, you know.  You start, you start someplace, you know.  There, there are, you know, yeah, you hear Al Jarreau, you know.  It doesn't mean that I, I, you know--I have affection of Al Jarreau and love him dearly.  And, we, every time we speak to each other, he's very, he's very gracious to me and we always talk about working together.  I was actually talking to Marcus Miller the other day about, you know, we need to do a, figure out a way to do a tribute for Al Jarreau, you know, because he's worthy.  And, then, you know, and let's do it while he's, you know, while he's here, and while he can appreciate it.  But, I haven't studied Al Jarreau, you know.  But, I may have heard a record, I hear the record and be like, you know, "Okay, you know, this is valid," you know.  I've heard a couple of song that have, that have, that he's done that have transformed my thinking about, about, about what can be done vocally.  You hear Prince in what I do.  I mean, everybody sounds like somebody, you know.  So, it was trying to figure out how, and that is, you say, that, and that is the lesson that, that as an artist that you have to learn.  How do you, you know, you have to be--but, I think the only way to really be successfully is, and have success that is hopefully, you know, has, has longevity is to be true to what, be true to what, to what you are, you know.   And, I've never been good at doing anything else so, you know, yeah.
Story_ID: 630372
Speaker 1: Now, you're concerned about the message your music gives.  I mean, what message are you trying, are you trying to deliver and why?
Speaker 2: You know, I, my music bas- basically focuses on, what it has focused on all of my, all of my career.  All of my, all of my songs have been about, have been about relationship.  They've been, they've been about love, you know.  They've been about--and, then on this side of my life and as I moved through, you know, addiction there's a, there's a very strong spiritual and faith, faith message that is woven into, woven into the music as well.  Recovery is woven in to the music as well.  And, you know, and, but it's also sexy, you know.  We, you know, it's sensual, you know, without being, you know, without being overt, you know.  And, without being, you know, you know, with a little, you know with a little class, a little sheen on it, you know.  You know, it's music for lovers.  It's music for people who are, who are healing, you know.  Yeah, so, I'm concerned about what I say, you know.  But, I'm capable of saying anything.  But, I am concerned about (laughter) what I say (laughter).  Let the church say--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Amen.
Speaker 2: Amen (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you, somebody described your music as the quiet storm type, you know.  Where did you get that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There is that.
Speaker 1: You agree with that?
Speaker 2: I, I, there is that element to it for sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Motown [Motown Records], so when they re-released 'Kemistry,' they just, you know, the same songs they done in the studio--
Speaker 2: Same songs, yeah.
Speaker 1: They basically just was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Right.  When we went to them we were selling, I was selling CDs [compact discs] when I went to them, you know.  So, you know, we, we had shown that there was, that there was a market for it.
Story_ID: 630373
Speaker 1: Also, on 'Love Calls' [sic. 'Kemistry'] is a song called "Brotha Man."
Speaker 2: "Brotha Man."
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: "Brotha Man" was a, if you wanna say that, that--you know, the record needed, the album needed some up tempo affair.  You know, if you call "Brotha Man" up tempo.  Every groove that I think is fast really just falls back into the same tempo, really, you know, that's where I'm comfortable at, you know.  And, but, it was, it was a, "Brotha Man" was a, you know, if, you know, it's almost spoken word type of, you know, rap type of thing, you know.  That's, that's what I was going for.  And, an inspiration, inspirational tune.  You know, I wanted to create music that, that uplifts people, you know.  That speaks to people being able to overcome whatever they're dealing with in their lives, you know.  And, I think that, you know, in speaking to the, speaking to the fellas, speaking to my brothers you know, I mean, I mean, we, you know, we need that, we need that from each other.
Story_ID: 630374
Speaker 1: On the second album, 'Album II' produced in 2005, now this is a, was a three year gap between, you know, the Motown [Motown Records] re-release and then 'Album II' in 2005.  So, do you work, you just kind of take your time with your work, or was this like--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that, you know, there was three years between that one, and then for--between the, between the second on and third one, it was five years.  And, you know, there's no, there was no template that I was aware of, you know, to when a record should be, you know, produced.  And, and, you know, once you get into the, to the machine of the industry, you know, there was no, there was no template.  And, I had come from a place, and I would have to fact check, you know.  And, I really, I say this all the time in interviews and I never really fact checked it, you know.  But, when I was growing up, man, you know, you didn't get, you know, a Michael Jackson, you know, how many years was it between 'Off the Wall,' and 'Thriller,' you know.  In between 'Thriller,' and you know, Michael's next record ['Bad'].  I mean, there was a period of time where like, somebody released an album and you knew about it.  It was everywhere that the record was coming about--coming out.  There was anticipation about it, and then they would work the album and then they would disappear, you know what I mean.  And, then when they came back, you knew that the record was coming out and you were excited about it.  And, there's anticipation about it, and you go and you start doing that thing.  You start on the--so, the album cycle, I think has really, I'm in the old school album cycle.  The new cycle is, you know, I don't know what it is.  Put, put it what, put a record out every year, or every, you know, within, you know, and the 'Kemistry' CD [compact disc], you know, when we started working it on our own, our reach was limited, you know.  And, performance wise we weren't performing.  We weren't performing, we were performing but we weren't like, we didn't do a really a bona fide tour.  So, it took a long time for this, for the 'Kemistry' album to reach, you know, my constituency.  We had been working it for eight months, then the label started to work it, and then, you know, the record's really kind of like working itself.  So, there's a, there's a question about how much do we really need to invest when it's already doing its own thing, you know. And, we were able to work off of that record because we hadn't been out on the road.  I was able to tour on that record and do some, and do things and be visible from the touring aspect for, you know, we're able, we worked that record for years.  I was working that record for years, you know.  And, by the time it came to record the second record I had, I had, I had estab- I knew what the songs were gonna be on the second album, you know, before, you know, before we started recording.  So, we had work to do.  That album cycle was longer.  And, I think it was longer because, because we started out as an independent.
Speaker 1: Was it tough to get acclimated to going on the road and performing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely (laughter).  Absolutely, you know.  I mean, yeah, it's, you know, it's, it takes a lot, you know.  Which speaks to, you know, not, you know, being grateful that I was able to do this at a time in my life where, you know, I had more, I had a little more stability.  And, where, you know, I had a, you know, my bearings about, about, about who I was and like what I was doing, you know, I had some of that.  I had a foundation that was, you know, 'cause, you know, had I'd been nineteen, there's no telling what this would've looked like.
Story_ID: 630375
Speaker 1: Now, the hit song on 'Album II' is, "I Can't Stop Loving You," right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, that hit number one on the charts.  And, what, what's your process for writing a song?  I know everybody has a different one.
Speaker 2: Sit down at the--the biggest part of me, the hardest part for me about writing a song is actually sitting down to do it, you know.  It's really just showing up and putting myself in a place to do it.  Most of my song writing is done at home.  All, all of my song writing is done, is done at home.  And, I, it all starts on, it starts with the keyboard.  It starts with the, with the piano.  And, I just, I noodle, I noodle around until I find something that I like, and, and then, and then I build upon that, you know.  The melody comes first and the words comes, the melody, then usually the hook will come, and then, and the, and then the lyrics, the full body of the song develops after.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Now, on that album you got a little help from Stevie Wonder, who plays the harmonica on "You Might Win," right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Incredible.  Stevie is--I met him at a function where he was being honored.  And, and we established, you know, we exchanged numbers and, and I eventually asked him to participate on my record, and, and he did, you know.  Been to the studio, been out to dinner with him, and you know.  So, one of the, one of the, one of the greatest highlights of my career.
Story_ID: 630376
Speaker 1: Twenty ten [2010], you released 'Intimacy' ['Intimacy: Album III'], right?  That's your third album?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, how was this one different from the others?
Speaker 2: How is 'Intimacy' different?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Or, was it any different?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was different.  It took a long, it took, it was--'Intimacy' was a hard record to make, you know.  And, you know, it was the first time that, that I've, that I've actually on my, under my Motown [Motown Records] deal, it was the first time that I actually worked with another producer, Rex Rideout.  I met him doing, we were doing a tribute album to, well, I participated in a tribute album ['Silky Soul Music: An All-Star Tribute to Maze'] that he was producing on Frankie Beverly and Maze.  And, I met him there and we established a relationship and he came in and, and, helped me on the 'Intimacy' record.  Yeah, so, you know, I think what happened between the second album ['Album II'] and the third album is that I bought a Steinway [Steinway and Sons].  And, it changed the, the way that I, that I wrote, and the way that I, I recorded.  I was approaching song from a different aspect.  I'd always played the piano, but most of my songs on the other records were written on, they were written on a keyboard, you know.  And, with a road sound, or you know, you know, well, you know, but, the acoustic thing, it like it, it kind of like, it opened some things up.  And, I had to learn the process of, of writing and writing with that instrument, you know.  And, and the, 'cause the stuff that I used to, the things, the process for making the first two albums, none of that stuff was working on the 'Intimacy' record, you know.  So, I had to learn a whole 'nother, a whole 'nother way to, to get it done.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And, now, what was the biggest hit off of 'Intimacy'?
Speaker 2: "Why Would You Stay" was the first single that went to number one.  And, you know, "Share My Life" is, is one that still being pla- we had four singles off of that.  We had four singles.  "Why Would You Stay," "Share My Life," "You're On My Mind," and "If It's Love."  "If It's Love" the version that features Chrisette Michele.  Yes, we have four single off of that record.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are you ever surprised by, you know, which single, you know, takes off as the most popular one?  Or, do you--?
Speaker 2: No, we usually, I usually have a pretty good idea of what, what the single is gonna be.  But, while I, you know, I know what the, you know, I know what's gonna be, I know what's for radio, and I know what's not for radio, you know.  There's songs that I know are gonna work on, on radio, and songs that just meant to be on the, on the album.  Which are stellar songs, they're just not radio songs.  Every song is, you know, there's lot of great songs, there's lot of great music that you'll never hear on the radio.  So, we usually, I usually have a, I usually have an idea of what it's gonna be, yeah.
Speaker 1: What's the longest song you've ever written?
Speaker 2: It would probably be one of those, you know, there all, it would probably be like, off the second album [sic.], it would probably be like "Human Touch," or "Can You Feel It," which are just grooves, you know.  Which are just, you know, there's versus and lyrics, but then there just grooves and the, and the vamp just, just last, you know.  'Cause it's very musical, you know what I mean.  So, it's like, you know.  You know, it's like "Summer Madness" by, you know, who was that?  Who did that, Kool and the Gang?  Was the Kool and the Gang, "Summer Madness?"  You know those songs that just, you know, it's an experi- you know, listening to it is an experience, you know.  I like to listen to music when I'm driving, you know, having that experience.  So, you know, the longest something, the longer, the longer a groove last, the better, the better it is.  Not for radio but, but for the record it think it's, I think it's a good thing.
Story_ID: 630377
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what are you working on now?
Speaker 2: Working on wrapping up the, the next studio album, which is called 'Promise to Love.'  I, that's, that's, you know, that's where my life is.  We're putting the finishing touches on it.  I got one more song to complete, to finish writing and sing, and then, you know, clean it up, shape it up so I can send it off to, to be mixed.  That's, that's what we're doing right now.
Speaker 1: And, you're leaving, when you leave here today, you're on your way to, to work on that, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I gotta go, I gotta go make it happen, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  Now, when you look back at your career and everything you've been able to accomplish to this point, is there anything major you would do differently if you would do it over?
Speaker 2: If I could do it over, is there anything I would do differently?  That's, I don't know, 'cause it's not over yet, you know.  It's not over yet.  So, I don't know if there's anything.  If I go back and if I change something I may, you know, I don't know what's, what's, I'm expecting the best to come, you know.  And, I think that, you know, the, the mistakes, the mistakes that we make or the missteps that we take, I think that they're all crucial, you know, to, to our development and for us ending up where, ending up where we should be, you know.  So, my hope is just to, is just to, is just to be open and to, and to learn and in that way, I can, I can trust that whatever's happening is gonna be good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 630378
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, and in your case, you really support a lot of people that are down in terms of your, you know, who are homeless and that sort of thing, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But, we always ask like what are your hopes and concerns about the black community today?  But--
Speaker 2: My hopes and concerns are that, I would say that, you know, you know, that, that we come to each, that we come together.  That we come together, man, and that we, you know, reconcile with ourselves, you know.  That we reconcile with ourselves, you know, that we, you know, I mean, and we, we obviously, you know, we've come a long way.  That we, but that we learn how to, how to just be better to one another.  That we learn how to be good to each other, you know.  You know, that we learn how to be, you know, that we learn how to be good to each other, you know.  We can talk about, you know, you know, civil rights and the struggle and all of those things are important but I mean, just, you know, but just be good each other, you know what I mean.  Like when I see you at, you know, at the store, you know, at the gas station, you know, just be good to each other when we're one on one, you know.  All the big stuff, if we do that, the other stuff will take care of itself, you know.  If we do that, if we're there, if we're there for each other, the other stuff will take care of itself, you know.  And I want our brothers should stopped killing each other, you know, over, you know, over stuff that's not important, you know.  Yeah, so, yeah, you know, that's the long and short of it.  It's a different day and age, man, you know.
Story_ID: 630379
Speaker 1: Well once again, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: My professional legacy.  I don't know, man.  I just hope that, that I would be remembered for, professionally, you know, musically, you know, just for creating great music, you know, just for creating quality music and, and, and having my music be, you know, the soundtrack to people's lives.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about your family.  You're, are you married now?
Speaker 2: No.  Not married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not married, two kids, you know.  And, my daughters are, you know, the light of my life and you know, I try to keep it simple (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  You got one four [Laylah Owens] and one nineteen [Troi Owens]?
Speaker 2: One, one will be four on July 4th.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, the other one is nineteen.  She just finished her first year of college, getting ready to start the next.  And, you know, I'm just glad that I'm, you know, that I'm, that I'm a part of their lives, you know.  And, that, and that they're able, you know, they're able to see me sober, that I'm able to participate in their lives, and, you know.  It's been a good run.
Story_ID: 630380
Speaker 1: Now is there anything we should talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Nah, I'm good, if you're good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think we're all right.  But, well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I would like to be remembered as someone who made a difference in other people's lives.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: It was a pleasure.
Speaker 1: All right.
