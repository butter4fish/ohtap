Story_ID: 568914
Speaker 1: But I wanna start out by asking you about your mother's family and her background.  If you could give her name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was, until she married, was Laura Mason [Laura Mason Coleman].  She was born in Baltimore [Maryland].  She finished high school and then she went to normal school [Colored High School; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland] there.  Then she taught German for about two years.  And, then she married my father [William T. Coleman, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Can you tell about her background though?  Because she had a, you have a, she had a family background going back.
Speaker 2: Oh, right, an exciting background because on the, I guess on her mother's side, the--no, on the father's side, the father's side, the great-grandfather was an Episcopal minister out of St. Louis [Missouri] and he operated the Underground Railroad; moving people up north.  And, her father taught--I mean, was a--worked in the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  And, one thing I knew about it, and when Wilson [President Thomas Woodrow Wilson] got elected president of the United States, he fired all the post people.  Not for political--not for racial reasons but because of political reason because that's when they were civil service.  And, I'd been told that Grandma Mason took her five children and sat in, and he was the only one that he fired (laughter).  So, I knew (unclear) about the family.
Speaker 1: So, he was actually postmaster?
Speaker 2: Well, he was--if he wasn't postmaster, he was almost postmaster.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was in 1950.  He'd been appointment by Taft [President William Howard Taft], the, the Masons were awfully bright people, very able people.  And, you know, most of 'em at that time taught school or had a--my mother's older sister married a gentleman whose last name is Cook [ph.] and he was professor at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And, the brothers, both of 'em worked in the post office.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about any of her growing up?  Did she--do you remember any stories about her growing up or family that she told you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, she talked about it and she certainly talked about various things that her mother told her in terms of when the Underground Railroad had been operated.  Also, they talked about, you know, Baltimore.  I think, take for example, I know that the house next door is where Thurgood Marshall was born.  So, obviously when he became famous, she talked about that.  And, she was also a very good friend of the Murphy family that owned the Afro-American [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers].  So, they did a lot of talking about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're saying the house next door to your, your mo- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my, my mother, where my mother was--lived is the house that's next door to the house where Thurgood Marshall was born in Baltimore.
Story_ID: 568915
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk about your, your father and his, you know, his name, and--
Speaker 2: His name is William Thaddeus Coleman [William T. Coleman, Sr.] 'cause I'm the junior.  And, he's born in Baltimore [Maryland].  He was about two years older than my mother [Laura Mason Coleman].  He went to school in Baltimore until the tenth grade when he, walking home one day, he said, "Chick, chick, Chinaman," and the Chinaman threw an iron at him, and he threw it back.  He didn't hit the Chinaman, but he broke the window.  I was told by my Grandmother Coleman that that meant that every policeman in Baltimore was looking for my father.  And, my father's mother, who's a very resourceful woman, call the person who was then the president of Hampton Institution [Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and said, "You gotta take my son to college."  So, that the president said, you know, "Best that you send him down."  So, he shows up the next day but only had been in the tenth grade.  So, he certainly couldn't go to college yet.  But, fortunately, Hampton had a trade school [Armstrong-Slater Trade School, Hampton, Virginia] and so he went in the trade school, learned how to be a carpenter.  And, then when he finished that, he then went to Hampton, graduated, taught a year in some school in North Carolina.  And, he was only getting seventy-five dollars a month and he asked for a raise and the white superintendent said, "Well, you don't get a raise, but from here on out, Bill, we will call you professor."  That didn't satisfy him.  So, he then came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and became the executive of the Wissahickon Boys Club, which was an organization created by the Quakers in Philadelphia.  Thereafter, they had a summer camp, Camp Emlen [Norwood, Pennsylvania], and that's where he worked for about thirty-five years.  In fact, he also was the first black director of the Boys Clubs of America [Boys and Girls Clubs of America].  So, he was active in doing that.  So, he had three jobs all the time he worked.
Speaker 1: Now, what, did your father share any stories about him growing up, though?  And, and it was in Baltimore, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Baltimore (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, he, yeah, well, other than the fact that, you know, Baltimore was probably a very exciting place.  The schools were good.  And, you know, there were a lot of people that did well there, after, and he talked about them.  But, by the time I was born, he'd been working at the boys club.  And, he spent more time talking about the boys club and people there than he did about what he did in Baltimore.  Although, we used to go to Baltimore a lot 'cause my, both my grandmothers still live there and we'd go visit her.
Story_ID: 568916
Speaker 1: How did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: Well, they, they both were, lived in Baltimore [Maryland].  And, my mother [Laura Mason Coleman] lived on Druid Hill Ave [Druid Hill Avenue], my father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] lived on Division Street.  So, I'm pretty sure they met.  He was about two years older than she was.  And, after he start working at the boys clubs [Wissahickon Boys Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and year later, they married.  And, so, they spent their life being married.
Speaker 1: So, him going--
Speaker 2: Here's my mother right over there; that picture over there.
Speaker 1: Right.  Him going to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], that was because of what did you say?
Speaker 2: Well, he just had an opportunity there.  The Quakers had a, you know, decided to have a boys club and they asked him to be the superintendent.  So, he went there and he had a very exciting career there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you're--so, your parents didn't necessarily tell you how they met.  They didn't, you don't, except they knew--
Speaker 2: No.  I pretty--well, they met socially, you know, sure, sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In the same circles, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 568917
Speaker 1: Let's talk, you're the middle child?
Speaker 2: No, I'm, I'm--yeah, I'm the middle child.
Speaker 1: Right.  Thaddeus, where did that, where, do you know the origin of (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, obviously, Thaddeus is, was named after Thaddeus Stevens, who was a great Republican congressman who, from Pennsylvania, who had a lot to do with the Reconstruction Act [Reconstruction Acts of 1867] and acted after the Civil War.  And, also, had a lot to do with passing the Fourteenth Amendment (background noise).  And, was a very active Republican and apparently also, one congressman that really wanted to help black people, 'cause he also wanted to make sure the Republicans kept up with the election.  And, I'm pretty sure my, my Grandmother and Grandfather Coleman named their son [William T. Coleman, Sr.] after that 'cause my grandfather's name was Louie [ph.].  And, so, that had--and, of course, my mother [Laura Mason Coleman] who always wanted to be an Epis- Epis [Episcopal] minister claims that one of the twelve disciples is named Thaddeus.  But, I've never checked that so I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Now, when you, let's go back to your sister's name is?  You're the--
Speaker 2: Emma, Emma Louise Coleman [Emma Coleman Dooley].  She's four years older than I am.
Speaker 1: And, then your brother?
Speaker 2: Robert Van Tyle Coleman; he was seven years younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, there was this range really in many ways?  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, four years older and then seven years--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --younger.
Story_ID: 568918
Speaker 1: Can you talk about what your earliest memory of growing up is in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, well we lived in Germantown.  And, I, you know, and the boys club [Wissahickon Boys Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was only about a block and a half away.  And, I remember going to the boys club when, when I was earl--went in an early age.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The street that you grew up on was, was it Coulter [Street]?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I grew up on Earlham Terrace.
Speaker 1: Oh, Okay.
Speaker 2: The Coulter Street was, the boys club was located at Coulter and Pulaski Avenue, which is--was just about, oh, about a five minute walk away.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, can you describe the block though, that you grew up on?
Speaker 2: Was a very interesting block in the sense that, it, it was a block and there were very little traffic on it, so you could play basketball or you could run in the street.  Also, to the north was much bigger houses occupied by white.  The three hundred block was occupied by white.  And, on the other side of Coulter Street was where this small ghetto of, of German--Germantown would be there, there was a bigger ghetto in East Germantown [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  But, it was very, very nice--a twin house.  And, you know, I, we knew everybody who lived in the block when I lived there.  I would say about half of the families there were black, the other half were white.  By the time I left there, you know, the whole block was black.
Story_ID: 568919
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, if you take yourself back to that block, and you know, and of those early years, do you, can you tell me what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't, it was a nice, it was a very pleasant and we had a backyard that had grass.  And, a nice porch and I'd tell there were no, no smells and we used to, you know, play.  And, because the house, houses on the other side of the street [Earlham Terrace, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which we saw their backyard, they were occupied with white.  Sometimes we play with white kid.  In the three hundred block of Rittenhouse Terrace was all white and we played with the kids.  Although, there were times when, you know, you start playing and the mothers in the three hundred block might ask the kid to do something at an odd time, just to get him or her back in the house, but I remember that.
Story_ID: 568920
Speaker 1: Tell me about family life though.  What was your family life like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a very, very good life.  Number one, at the, at the boys club [Wissahickon Boys Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] my father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] thought that the boys club should be opened at any time when kids were not in school.  Which meant that it started about 3:00 in the afternoon, 2:30 in the afternoon and went until 10:00 at night.  On the other hand, we did have dinner between 5:30 and 6:30, and, we, you know, at that time we went to church every Sunday.  We often had people visiting who, you know, come and talk like a person who was, I think the head of the Urban League would come sometime.  And, person lived next door owned the Philadelphia Tribune so we'd talk with them.  And, so there was a lot of talking obviously in those week where, you know, the boys at the boys club had done something exciting; that would be a lot of the conversation, you know.  Like a guy named Bill Cosby, you know, Bill Cosby; he was a club boy.  And, in fact, the first skit he ever wrote is about playing basketball at the boys club.  And, there were other, Herb Adderley who went on to be a great football player.  Others who went on to be doctors and everything.  So, there was a lot of conversation about that.  But, we also, you know, talked a lot about, you know, what was happening in the country, what was happening in the world.  The family lived about three doors from us, the Websters [ph.] who most of the daughters was so light they could pass for white.  And, one of 'em got a job downtown and we were told that if you ever, you know, saw her downtown, you'd, you'd call her Miss Webster.  You could call her Anna [ph.] if you're in the neighborhood.  And, I thought that was irritating and those things.  But, you know, it was that time of life.  On the other hand, we went to--from kindergarten through the six grade, we went to segregated schools above the sixth grade.  I went to junior high and high school in integrated schools.
Speaker 1: Now, you're--what was the name of the segregated school, your, your elementary school?  Do you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, was it the Joseph Meehan School [sic. Thomas Meehan School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], who--which was about three blocks away.
Speaker 1: Did you take to school, you know, immediately?  You mother [Laura Mason Coleman], she taught German, right?
Speaker 2: Well she taught--but, she didn't after, after she got married.  I almost said he didn't work.  But, when people said that, she'd be mad as hell because, you know, being married, a good marriage, take care of home is a lot of work.  So, but, she always worked at home.  And, she was also very helpful to my father, you know.  And, she did some things at the boys club, like teaching a class or something like that.
Speaker 1: Now, the boys club, how far away was it from--?
Speaker 2: The boys club was--couldn't've been more than three hundred yards away.  'Cause we were in Earlham Terrace and you turn left on Pulaski Avenue, you turn right Coulter Street and that's where the boys club was.
Speaker 1: And, so, it was really sort of the center for the community, in many ways?
Speaker 2: Well, the boys club (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The boys club?
Speaker 2: Was the cen- the boys club was really the center of the community, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so, your father had a great deal of--must've had a great deal of respect within the community because--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, he was, he was very--and people knew him.  And, I mean, years later I was walking through a different part of the community and somebody tried to rob me.  And, the kids said, "Well, that's Mr. Coleman's boy, we wouldn't rob him," so (laughter) I didn't get rob but, you know.  But, it was an interesting life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, there was, you know, some interesting people who lived there that--
Speaker 1: In the community?
Speaker 2: In the community.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Like whom?
Speaker 2: Well, like Herb Adderley lived there.  Bill Cosby lived there.  And, I could name like, the Childs [ph.] people lived there, and they were pretty interesting people (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 568921
Speaker 1: Tell me what you were like as a young, young boy.
Speaker 2: Well, it was--I doubt seriously if more than a week or ten days would go by which I didn't get at least one whipping, so, I mean I was a pretty bad boy.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, I, you know, I enjoyed life and, you know, my mother [Laura Mason Coleman] was a very active and I thought they both thought they had an obligation to teach us well.  I know they went out of their way to indicate that there were people in the world of color who had been, you know, very famous, like, like the Dubois, the brothers, the father and son of a French writers.  Other people I knew about Alexander Pushkin, who most people don't know this--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: You know, family on one side was black.  And, not only that, but he had a great-grandfather who became an outstanding general.  And, it's a reason why the Russians won the war for tsardom.  So, I--and that, that was a conscientious and they would, you know, talk about it.  And, I--we knew what was happening at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  We knew what was happening at Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] and we generally were well aware of what was going on.
Story_ID: 568922
Speaker 1: Were there family traditions that you had, you know, like special holidays or things that were, you know, traditions that your family did?
Speaker 2: Well, there were, there were, there were traditions of, of, you know Christmas and that sort of thing.  The other tradition was, which was that there was a great commitment at least three kids were gonna go to college.  And, there were many of times when I'd ask for a bicycle or something and be told I couldn't get the bike even though the kids next door had it.  'Cause they save money to go to college, so I, you know, I, so those were the traditions.  And, but, we had a, but we had a good time because, you know, it was the boys club [Wissahickon Boys Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and then in the summer, the camp [Camp Emlen, Norwood, Pennsylvania].  After about five years, the Emlens bought a thirty acre camp, 'bout thirty miles outside of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And, about two years later, they built a cottage for my mother [Laura Mason Coleman] and father [William T. Coleman, Sr.].  And, my sister [Emma Coleman Dooley] stayed there, and my brother [Robert Van Tyle Coleman]; they were younger.  I was in camp at that time.  So, ten months, ten weeks in the summer we went to camp.  Well, also by that time my father, maybe about a month a year would be traveling throughout the country as far as Chicago [Illinois], South Atlanta [Atlanta, Georgia] and you know, during board--trying to set up other boys club.  So, when he would come home and, you know, it was a special time.  And, he sometime take us to the movies things like that.  So, you know, I had a, I thought I had a pretty, pretty good life.
Speaker 1: So, are you saying that during summers after a certain period of time, you spent ten weeks out at the camp called Emmawa [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wanted--Camp Emlen, yeah--
Speaker 1: Emlen.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I then, by the time it started I was, you know, six years old, and so I went to camp.  But, my mother and sister and brother had a nice cottage right on the, right on the camp grounds, but away.  And, we'd spend, actually, they'd go up there oh, for ten weeks during the summer we'd be, we'd be there.
Story_ID: 568923
Speaker 1: What subjects, like in, let's say, let's go to elementary school [Thomas Meehan School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Were there any teachers that were influencing you that you remember particularly in elementary school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, I remember.  I thought the kindergarten teacher was very good, a Miss Adams.  The second grade teacher was, was Miss Wool [ph.].  I thought she, she was very good.  I got skipped from the, let's see, I got skipped from the 1B to the 2B.  So, I, I got skipped a grade.  I also remember once where I was probably very difficult and I was raising cane and all of the kids were laughing.  And, all of a sudden they got quiet because my father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] showed up.  And, obviously I got kind of disciplined for that.  So, that, but, they were, they were, no they were very good.  I mean, they--I, I thought between kindergarten and the fourth grade, I got taught well.  And, I thought I got taught well.  And, then I went to another school, the Joseph E. Hill School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which from the fifth and sixth grade which was also all black.  And, then after that I went to, to Roosevelt Junior High School [Theodore Roosevelt Junior High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which was, just had about eight blacks in it, and Germantown High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which was the same way.
Speaker 1: Now, how did that happened?  'Cause I, you know, there were, there were black, there was a black junior high school, rig- ?  I mean junior high and high school?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, the answer is yes, and no.  Because my sister [Emma Coleman Dooley] did go to Gillespie [Elizabeth Duane Gillespie Junior High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which was a junior high school in Gratz [Simon Gratz High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  But, that was only because the school district willfully, was sending all the black kids to that.  And, by the time I got ready to go, my parents were alert to that and said, "No, we want him to go to Roosevelt."  So, I ended up going to Roosevelt even though Roosevelt is a little further walk and same with junior high school.
Story_ID: 568924
Speaker 1: Now, would you, were there any subjects that you were gravitating to at the time?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I could always count.  So, like with math.  But, also I, I had a, well, they thought I had a speech defect.  And, so, we, they sent me to the Fitler School [Edwin Fitler Academics Plus School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for two afternoons a week, which was a white school.  But, nobody could ever correct my defect.  It turned out much later that my defect is, I have no sense of phonetics and I can't visualize a word unless I can recall having heard somebody else saying it.  And, then I know how to do it.  It's the same habit that, same difficulty that Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] had.  That's why when he spoke other than from a text--and, I also think it's the same difficulty that President Bush [President George Walker Bush] has because, you know, he's not the best speaker in the world and I think he has it.  And, I can tell because, one symbol is, you have no sense of rhythm.  And, I don't think the president can dance, so that's--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure that, I think, you know.
Speaker 1: So, let me ask, why did they think it was a speech defect?  That's what I'm just--
Speaker 2: Well, because I just couldn't pronounce words.  You know, I, certain words I just couldn't say and, and it turned out that I could say those words only if I could recall somebody having said the word.  And, it's, you know, it's lived with me all my life.  I mean, and sometimes if you're arguing a case in [U.S.] Supreme Court and you know that the eighth word is a word that you just know you can't pronounce, you have to shift the sentence.  And, so, it's kinda awkward and so, it's something you learn how to life with, right.  So, I learned how to live with it.
Speaker 1: Do you, now you got diagnosed, what is the name of the, do you know what the name of the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know what it is.  Well, I, I just, I have no sense of phonetics.  I mean, that's all I know.  And, I don't think it really got picked-up until maybe after I was in college [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and people realized it wasn't (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  But, now you said, so you were good with, you know, numbers--
Speaker 2: Math, yeah.  And, I also liked history very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I, my, my penmanship was terrible; still is.  But, I think that I, you know, could say things very well.  And, and my mother [Laura Mason Coleman] would sit up until one o'clock in the morning helping me rewrite things that I don't think I ever got rejected on that ground.
Speaker 1: Did you, in history was there a particular subject that you, I mean, a period of time that you, you liked or took to?
Speaker 2: Well, I, you know, I, I liked--was exposed then to a lot of British history, which I liked.  And, certainly, I learned something about, you know, American history.  But, a lot of things, you know, I didn't learn because they weren't teaching them then.  You know, I certainly, in terms of, of if it were a black situation you just talk in terms about these people came over as slaves and that's what they were.  And, then some white boys from the North went south and freed 'em.  And, which wasn't happened, 'cause I, you know, at the end of the Civil War, 20 percent of the northern troops were black.  And, I'd been reading material which some of the white, you know, generals have said, "That's why we won the war, because the guys are good at--knew what to do."  So, I, you know, I just--and it's true.  Just the other day I was trying to figure out whether any blacks was with Columbus [Christopher Columbus] when he came over there.  And, several scholars said, "No."  But, I finally found out that the chief navigator was black guy, you know, so.  So, that's something that you just didn't pick up in, in school then, because people didn't expose you to that.  Or, you know I, I'd, I'd heard about George Washington Carver.  But, I never knew that--but for him the South probably would've gone down long ago what he discovered.  And, later on I, you know, like Charles Drew [Charles R. Drew], who did the blood plasma.  And, so, I, and my parents would, you know, really do everything they could to, to let me know that.  And, I knew about Dr. Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] long before most people did.  So, that was something I could--and the teachers both in, at Meehan [Thomas Meehan School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and the Hill School [Joseph E. Hill School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] tried to do that, too.
Story_ID: 568925
Speaker 1: Now, you, one thing that I had read was, speaking of sort of family history, that your family neither side there doesn't appear to be slave history within the family structure?
Speaker 2: Well, gee, what have, what have you been reading?
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You work with--
Speaker 1: Is that wrong?
Speaker 2: You what--no, that's right.  I mean--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I know, I know the Masons were, I mean, the Mason side, I know they weren't.  They--and, they, they came from someplace near France where Charlemagne used to be at the time, 'cause my mother [Laura Mason Coleman] would talk about that.  And, my father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] says that there were no slaves on that side either.  And, although I, my great-grandmother, by the time I was born, she owned a big farm in, in Culpeper, Virginia which they claim that, you know, they'd owned for years, so, but, thought that was--
Story_ID: 568926
Speaker 1: So you grew up in this family where there was, it was sort of a close knit community, right?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  I mean, you know, they were all, it was not close knit because I would spend a lot of my afternoon with the boys at the boys club [Wissahickon Boys Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, they were kids, you know, out of a housing projects, and poor kids.  Most of 'em were on welfare.  So, I mean, I certainly couldn't say that I grew up there.  On the other hand, the church I went to Episcopal church, you know, most of the people who went there were college educated, or kids were gonna be doctors or something like that.  But, no I, I grew up, you know, I understood both side of the issue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I underst- okay, and the church that you, you were raised in, do you remember the--?
Speaker 2: Well, St. Barnabas, yeah, Church [St. Barnabas' Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Do you remember who the, who the minister was at the time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His name was Father Thomas [E. Sydnor Thomas], I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 568927
Speaker 1: I also read that you knew very early that you wanted to be a lawyer and you would, you know, sneak into courtrooms.  Is that--what age was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, well, what it, what it was, or maybe about in the 1st of December they'd be two or three evening conversations between my mother [Laura Mason Coleman] and father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] as how much they could spend for Christmas.  And, they finally would agree upon a certain amount and then my mother would say, "Well, tomorrow why don't you all meet me in town?"  You know, we have to go in town to shop.  And, my sister [Emma Coleman Dooley], when we got downtown would say, "Well, why don't you shop for me first?  Because I could then take the trolley, go home and get dinner for you."  And, I certainly didn't wanna stay around watching girls try on clothes and things like that.  So, I'd go outside.  But, it's cold as hell outside in '47 [1947].  So, and the city hall [Philadelphia City Hall, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was right across the street.  And, I went in there and I went up to the fourth floor.  And, they were arguing the case of Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.  Well, I went down the courtroom and I saw that.  And, I said, when I went home I said, "People get paid just for talking (laughter)," and so that gave me some interest.  And, then I also had heard about, by that time, Charlie Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston], and Bill Hastie [William H. Hastie] and I knew Raymond Pace Alexander, and I thought that's clear.  I also thought maybe I should be a doctor.  But, when I was sixteen or seventeen and the doctor at the camp [Camp Emlen, Norwood, Pennsylvania] took me to see an operation on cancer of the guts so I figured that wasn't for me.  So, I, so I, therefore, became a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Now, what, what age were you though, when you went over and, you know, went into your first courtroom?  Do you remember what--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I couldn't've been, I'm probably about twelve or thirteen years of age, yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you just describe what, what that courtroom sort of felt, you know, like--?
Speaker 2: When I saw it, there was, what nine or seven people sitting on the bench.  And, I remember one case, may not have been the first day, where the judge or the justice asked the lawyer about a certain case and he said, "Oh, judge, I don't know about that case we just decided it about a month ago."  And, so, thereafter it really developed me to have it whenever I go into court.  I always read the late, the late cases because I don't want anybody to, you know, tell me.  But, it was, you know, we had a good time.  I mean, I just--I enjoyed being a kid and we got exposed to a lot of thing.  And, there was a, you know, a lot happening in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 568928
Speaker 1: Or, you know, you'd hear about Walter White [sic. Lester Blackwell Granger] and--who was the first head of the Urban League [National Urban League] I can't remember his name?  But, you know, these people would come or, and I had an Aunt Emma [Emma Mason Groves] who lived in Boston [Massachusetts].  Which she would go to Washington [D.C.] a couple times, or four times a year then she'd stop pass the house on the way back.  And, she knew what was happening at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and she, you know, she knew what was happening other places.  So, we had a pretty good idea of what was going on.  And, some of the challenges even then which had to do the finally--
Speaker 2: But, what were some of the challenges that you would hear about being discussed by the adults?
Speaker 1: Well, you knew that, you knew that less than what, sixty miles away was the Mason-Dixie Line.  I mean, everything south of that was segregated.  But, you also knew that in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] there was a lot of segregation and a lot of discrimination.  And, you knew that if you looked at housing projects, you saw more black face than you saw white faces.  And, you generally, you know, saw kids who weren't doing as well as other kids and you knew that.  We--another thing, my father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] did--we were in the 14th police district and during the thirty-five years he was at the boys club [Wissahickon Boys Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], no boy was ever arrested.  But, that means, you gotta define arrest.  Not only that you've been grabbed by the police but you finally got booked.  Because he had an arrangement with the 14th District, any kid that was picked up instead of booking him, he called my father.  And, my father would get the parents together and they'd work it out.  So, we were, you know, very sensitive.  And, then on the other hand, we knew that there were kids that didn't get opportunity.  I remember the one guy name Charlie [ph.]; I forget Charlie's last name.  But, his, his mother worked for a lady who was on the board at the club.  But, also was on the board of Germantown Friends School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which was a private school.  And, also her husband owned a big company.  And, it broke her heart that she couldn't induce Germantown Friends to take her, her, you know, maid's son into Germantown Friends.  So, we, we were very much aware of the tensions that went on but those were the types of things we knew we had to overcome.
Story_ID: 568929
Speaker 1: Now, the Quakers did that, the Quaker philosophy did it, were you raised with the combination of Quaker philosophy and Episcopalian?  I mean, was it, was it sort of a joint thing? And--
Speaker 2: No, I was raised Episcopalian.  When I got married, my wife [Lovida Hardin Coleman] who was Catholic, so for a year I became a Catholic.  We both got out of that (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, then by that time our kids were going to Germantown Friends [Germantown Friends School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and so we used to go to Quaker meetings.  So, I would say now, I think I'm still an Episcopalian.  I think my wife is a Quaker.  And, I think the three kids are Quakers.
Speaker 1: What is, what is the Quaker sort of philosophy?  How do you think, you know, did it influence your father [William T. Coleman, Sr.], you think?
Speaker 2: Well, my father, no, my father is Episcopalian.  He worked with the Quakers (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Quakers.
Speaker 2: But, he never went--
Speaker 1: But, the Germantown [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: To the Quaker meet--
Speaker 1: But the Boys and Girl [Boys and Girls Clubs of America], well, it wasn't Quaker influence?  It was just--
Speaker 2: Well, there's Quaker influence in that they certainly felt that you ought to be able to get out of controversy without having a fight.  And, there were other things and later on I think they--well, actually, the boys club got started, I just read that the other day, because the Quakers lived right around this community.  And, one day they decided to invite all the young black kids to Sunday meeting.  And, they had a good time.  In the course of it they said, "Well, what do you do during the rest of the week?"  And, the kids said, "After school we do nothing.  We just stand on the corner.  We get in trouble.  We have nothing to do."  And, then that's what caused them to create the Wissahickon Boys Club [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] 'cause at that time it was segregated, and it was a white's boys club; the Germantown Boys Club [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And, I know my father and the--tried very much to integrate the two, which never happened during his tenure in office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, how do you spell Wit--?
Speaker 2: I knew you were-it's W-I-S-S-A-H-I-C-K-O-N.  It's named after--because the Wissahickon Creek is the creek that runs through Germantown.  So that's how, that's how it got its name.
Speaker 1: And, it was called Germantown because there were a predominance of Germans there.  Was that, do you think--?
Speaker 2: Well, I take it--well, they were Germantown.  It was a, there was a great--during the Revolutionary War, there's a great battle because the British Troops occupied Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at one Christmas.  And, the, the Americans were outside and they'd come down Germantown and tried to get in; they never got in.  That's when they were pushed back to Valley Forge [Pennsylvania] and they spent the horrible winter in Valley Forge.  And, at that time actually one of the people, officers leading the revolutionary troops was John Marshall who then be--later on became the fourth chief justice of the United States.  So, you know, that was a very, you know, so they were proactive.  And, you know, Philadelphia was very active in the Revolutionary War, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 568930
Speaker 1: In high school [Germantown High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] you're becoming, you know, yourself, you know, as young men, you know, sort of mature now.  I'd also read about you were swimming.  You were part--
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to swim (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You had wanted to swim.  That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, they abolished the--?
Speaker 2: They abolished the swim team and, and what bothered me more, even more than abolishing it was, the day I graduated they had the big sign up that they opened it up again.  That really blanked me off.  But, I, oh yeah, that happened and that--but, on the other hand, the guy who was the coach, Professor Schwartz, was one of my best teachers.  And, then he--when I got into Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I think he wrote the best letter for me.  And, he always said after, 'cause I used to, when I stopped practicing I'd go back to high school sometimes, you know, for events and everything.  And, he kept on telling me, you know, the reason why we couldn't let you on the swimming team 'cause we practiced at the YMC [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)], and I'm saying CA, meaning the YM Christian, the Christian they would, they had Christians that was keeping us out rather than the Jews, 'cause he was Jewish see.  But, that's--so those, but those were things that happened, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, so, what, what acti- what things were you active with in high school, that are few?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I--
Speaker 1: If they abolished the swim team?
Speaker 2: Well, I ran in a quarter and a half mile.  And I also, was a cross country runner.  I tried to play football, but I wasn't quite as good as the other people so I didn't play football.  But, I did run the quarter and a half mile.
Speaker 1: Were there any other clubs and things that you were part of?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did debating club, the scientific club and other things, yeah.
Story_ID: 568931
Speaker 1: And at this time, is there anyone else, you know, besides your parents [Laura Mason Coleman and William T. Coleman, Sr.] that are sort of influencing you in high school [Germantown High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or you know, who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: Well, my best friends, a guy named Bob Tresfield [ph.] who was the first husband of Carl Rowan's wife.  And, he was a guy born in Georgia.  His father was the head of the music corps at Fort Benning [Georgia].  And, about tenth grade they decided that he should come north to school because he wanted to go to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York].  So, Bob was a very handsome, very able guy; went to, he was in the, well, we went to the eleventh and twelfth grade together.  He then went to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] for a year.  Then he got to West Point became a second lieutenant.  Unfortunately, he got killed fighting over in the Mediterranean but he was a wonderful guy; great tennis player.  I remember where we would go up to the Chestnut Hill Country Club, which was the white country club.  And, we'd have to--well, he--I didn't play tennis that well, but he did.  He'd have to dress someplace else because he couldn't dress in the locker there.  But, once he got on the court he could beat everybody.  He was very good and, and, you know, so we had that experience.  And, he was a pole-vaulter, a pretty good pole-vaulter but he was a much better tennis player.  But, really a bright, bright able guy.  And, he was by far my best friend in high school.  There was several people on the track team that I was very friendly with and, you know, people I knew.
Speaker 1: Would you guys ever talk about what you wanted to do when you grow up, or, I mean, was there any of those discussions (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I'm pretty sure there were, yeah, yeah.  Well, Bob clearly wanna be a [U.S.] military officer and he became a fighter pilot.  And, I certainly think that, well, I'm pretty sure by the time I finished high school I figured I was gonna be a lawyer because I had political science and government in high school.
Story_ID: 568932
Speaker 1: And had done other things that I thought that would--and, I, you know, I'd heard a lot about Charlie Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston] and Bill Hastie [William H. Hastie], and other people (unclear).
Speaker 2: Had you heard about them or had you met them at that point?  Was it really sort of lore that these were, you know, great people to aspire to be?  Or, did you--?
Speaker 1: Well, I, I had, I had by, you know, I'm still just seventeen now.  I had certainly heard about them and I'm pretty sure that sometime if they spoke in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] I'd probably went to hear them speak.  I had met Raymond Pace Alexander so I knew him very well.  And, I had met the guy, what, Granger [Lester Blackwell Granger] who's head of the Urban League [National Urban League].  I knew Granger because he used to come talk to my father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] sometime 'cause of the Urban League and boys club [Boys Clubs of America; Boys and Girls Clubs of America] had a lot to do, and so, you know I'd read about him, seen about him, very interested in him.
Speaker 2: What did you hear about Charlie Houston?
Speaker 1: He was bright as hell (laughter).  He was very, very good.  And, by that time, he'd finished, well, he finished Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and (background noise) I don't, I don't think he was dean of the law school at Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] yet.  But, he was certainly active there and he certainly would begun to already start the strategy that would make, make, make a difference in what we were trying to do.  So, no, I was very much aware of him.
Speaker 2: How about Raymond Pace Alexander?  What were, what would you--'cause he was local.
Speaker 1: He was local.  Very tall.  By far the best trial lawyer in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I mean, he was really bright, very good lawyer.  And, Sadie Alexander [Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander] was probably by one of the best offense court lawyers.  She's done estate work and network and she--they're both were very, very, very good people.  And, I would hear about them and they would, you know, I, I remember that at that time Chestnut Street, which is one of the big streets in Philadelphia right near the courthouse.  You couldn't eat lunch on that street, you know.  And, then Raymond Pace Alexander would do it in the middle of the day, breaking for court, would go into the restaurant and says, "You can either feed me and give me a check; I'll pay for it.  Or, you can take this subpoena and be in court tomorrow morning."  So, that opened it up, all right.  So that opened it up already--no, but, he was really a thrilling, great lawyer and you know, one of the real great trail lawyers in town.  And, I'd knew about him from what they were doing.  And, of course, this was the time when the Republican Party still controlled Philadelphia.  But, Raymond Pace Alexander and Austin Norris [J. Austin Norris] who was also a lawyer and several other black lawyers were beginning to reach out the Democratic Party trying--I think that was the message on making a change would say, did certainly by 1946 they did, yeah.
Story_ID: 568933
Speaker 1: Now, in, okay, '46 [1946].  But, '46 [1946] you're in law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], right?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd just finished law school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Finishing law school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, let's go, let's go to your decision to go to University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  How did that, was that always assumed or did you look at other schools?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, I looked at one, no, I, I, when, when I was at camp [Camp Emlen, Norwood, Pennsylvania] and--
Speaker 1: Summer camp?  With the bo--?
Speaker 2: Summer camp.  And, by the time I was in my last year of high school [Germantown High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I was working as a counselor there.  And, there were people, most of the other counselors were a little bit older and they'd gone to Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], or Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], or Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], places like that, and we had a lot of debate as to whether it made more sense to go to one of the great black colleges or universities [HBCUs]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or, whether to go to the Ivy League schools and everything.  So, that debate was going back and forth.  And, I, you know, resolved that I'd, or take a crack at going to Penn and I, I got in.  I started in February and I got in February and then, so I went to Penn.
Speaker 1: Now, why, I would like to know about, 'cause those debates still continue, you know, today, so what were the, what were the pros and cons?  What were people saying?
Speaker 2: Well, obviously, people, you know, when you went to these schools, they were integrated but not completed unsegregated.  Like my sister [Emma Coleman Dooley], you know, she, four years earlier and she wanted to be a home economics teacher, and she really wanted to go to Temple.  But, she was told that in her junior year, she would have a problem because in your junior year if you took the home economics course, you were supposed to live in the dormitory.  Well, you couldn't live in the dormitory at Temple and perhaps you could then go to Cheyney [Cheyney Training School for Teachers; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania] which was a black segregated school, not quite as good.  And, she said, "The hell with that.  I'll go where my father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] went."  So, that's how she ended up at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  So, you know, there were all those tensions, and, and, and, you know, they, they, they--Howard had tremendous reputation.  You know, Lincoln had tremendous reputation.  Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] had, and Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], you know, they were good colleges and we knew that there were a lot of well-trained blacks who had finished the Ivy League schools.  But, they, the only place they could teach, and they were teaching.  And, my mother's [Laura Mason Coleman] older sister had married a person who taught at Howard, you know, he was, thought he was a very good teacher.
Speaker 1: Was that Aunt Emma [Emma Mason Groves]?  No.
Speaker 2: No.  Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your mother's oldest--
Speaker 2: No.  Well, no, Coretta [Coretta Mason], Coretta, she died fairly young.  But Coretta was, she was the oldest sister.  And, so, it was just, it was just really, you know, really tension.  And, certainly some of the professors who taught at those schools if they came speak at the church or something they were, you know, very good.  So, it was big discussion as to where do you wanna go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, was that a decision you made on own or in consultation with your parents?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm pretty sure, they put the money up so, I'm (laughter) we made it together (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 568934
Speaker 1: Was there from the high school perspective, were your, did any one of the teachers try to dissuade you?  I know you said, Professor Schwartz wrote a recommendation, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, I really--other than the Germantown High [Germantown High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], other than the swimming incident, I had a great time there.  And, and I did extremely well.  And, so, you know, by that time people at least knew I could talk and write so (laughter), I did fairly well.
Speaker 1: When you say you did extremely well, well how well is well?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I'd probably got an A average from the, from the high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, when you, tell me so, you go to University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], had you been on the campus before you--?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd been there to see a football game for something, but I had not been there visit--no, I, you know, I finished high school say on the 30th of January and I was there the 2nd of February.  And, I just went and, you had to take an exam.  And, as you went up there, you had to--tuition was four hundred bucks [dollars] then, and you had the money in your hand.  But, if you hadn't passed the exam, they'd push the money back.  If it (laughter) (unclear), they took my money so I knew I was in.  And, so, that's where I, so, so I started there.  And, I finished at three in a half years.
Speaker 1: Now, was that intentional, you finishing in three and half years?  Why--?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, I never liked the fact that I'd skipped a half grade and everything happened.  I never did it when other people did it.  And, also, when I was at Penn, after like about the second year, I guess the second year, and my father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] was downtown one day and sitting next to a lawyer and said, "You know if your son really wants to go to law school, he ought to learn something about business."  And, I found out that at Penn even though I was in the college, I could take half my courses in the Wharton School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] so, I used to be in the Wharton School a lot and take my courses and I finished in three in a half years.
Story_ID: 568935
Speaker 1: Tell me about that experience.  How did it differ, you know, 'cause college is a, a time of sort of maturing and finding yourself, you know, as a person.  I mean, what, what was different about, you know, the college experience for you?
Speaker 2: Well, it was very good experience.  There were very few blacks.  I doubt if there were eight blacks in the, in the whole school.  I mean, you know--
Speaker 1: How large was the school at that time?  Do you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Penn was pretty large.  But, there were eight, there were one in the medical school [University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I don't know, they'd probably none in the law school [University of Pennsylvania Law School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  But, there were about just about two in my class and--
Speaker 1: You're saying in the whole (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the university.
Speaker 1: I mean, undergraduate and graduate?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they were, they were very few.
Speaker 1: There were eight, you think, maybe (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, maybe fifteen, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, 'cause we used have lunch a lot in the place, and I did.  And, my only difficulty at Penn was that in my junior year and senior year, they didn't give me Phi Beta Kappa [Phi Beta Kappa Society] key because they, it turned out later that, 'cause later on they gave it to me retroactive to, to the year I graduated, so.
Speaker 1: Didn't you graduate sum--
Speaker 2: I graduated summa cum laude (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Summa cum laude?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, they, they did not--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I understand.
Speaker 2: Give me key but, well, they'd given one to another black guy; first one ever, a year before, who went on to be a great doctor.  And, they felt that they just went (unclear).  And, also Sadie Alexander [Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander] had the same problem.  So, you know, you, you all come from a younger time, you know--
Speaker 1: That's right.  No, I--
Speaker 2: Life was tough (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's fine.  You said it was tough back then.
Speaker 2: No, really.  No, really.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay. No, I understand.  But, let me, who was the, who was the, who had gotten the, the key the year before?  Do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: Oh, he's a, oh gee, he's a famous family.  His father is a doctor.  I'll get you--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Leroy Barn, Leroy Barnes [Leroy T. Barnes], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 568936
Speaker 1: So in your class was there another black person?  'Cause a lot of times there were two sometimes to a class.
Speaker 2: No, I don't think there were any black in my class.  Though, there was a person that, in the class after me.  But, we took a lot of class together.  A guy name Jack Chisum [Melvin J. "Jack" Chisum], who went on and became a great doctor and his wife became a great scientist or something.  I mean, she, she was the one that developed the knowledge as to what was the different effect of [U.S.] Navy pilots flying at nighttime.  And, she finally worked, she was a psychologist.  She finally worked that out, and she's also at, and she's, I guess she no longer, she was on the board of trustees of Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Gloria Chisum [Gloria Twine Chisum], very bright indi- but, Jack was as smart hell.  He wanted to be a lawyer too.  But, he, when he got drafted, the day he got drafted, never any training, they needed one more black guy in the division.  And, so, he got put on a boat, went to the Pacific and all he did was pass papers around.  And, the said he'd never be a lawyer because he didn't wanna pass papers around, came back and went to Penn medical school [University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], did extremely well.  A very able guy.  I kid him now 'cause he probably has to deal with more papers than I do, 'cause doctors have to fill out all those forms.  But, he, really he's--I know I'm talking too much but these were very exciting people.  And, they were very good, and Jack Chisum was very bright.  And, another guy there was Beverly Grays [ph.] who married Carolyn Johnson, daughter to the president of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] who had also went to Penn and then he went to Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] afterwards.
Speaker 1: Why do you feel you're talking too much?  Mr. Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.], you're not talking too much (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, really--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I really (laughter).
Speaker 1: You're, you're just responding to my questions.
Speaker 2: No, because life is different.  I hope life is different now.  But, you know, those days were--
Speaker 1: Well, sometimes things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --stay the same when they change.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 568937
Speaker 1: There may be more numbers now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: But, were you, with the black students, would you, you know, get together, the small--?
Speaker 2: Oh, we had in Houston Hall, we had a place where we would usually join each other for lunch, and so, we, that's how we would meet, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, then, then I, in my junior year I was, you know, made a member of Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] so I, you know.  And, we did have fraternity at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and so, very few people in it.  But, so, I, so that's how I got to know them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You had an actual fraternity?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah--
Speaker 1: I mean, you had a chapter (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, they had a chapter.  There's--
Speaker 1: How many people in this?
Speaker 2: I think it's--I don't know, I can't remember.  But, you know what, side chap--it could've been both Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and, Temple and Penn.  I think it was both, both of 'em, yeah.  So, they would have enough people if we had a chapter.
Speaker 1: And, why did you join that, that fraternity?  Was that the one that was there, or?
Speaker 2: Always sought the best (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Started in Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], a very, very good fraternity, yeah.  And, there was a guy, oh, I forget somebody I knew who famous from there; very good (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Anything else that you think was important in your growth and development at Penn, at University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] during the studies?  You, you majored in (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, and I really, really good and I, I finished summa cum--no, I really, really felt I knew what I was doing.  I, I also felt that-a very interesting thing 'cause I, you know, I'd lived at home.  And, I'd take the trolley in the subway, but then I'll come over to South Street.  And, you could see all the poverty, and you know, poor people getting on, on the car, on the subway--on the street car.  And, some of 'em didn't have the eight cents you had to pay, you know, getting kicked off and everything.  And, then you'd come to 28th Street and, you know, see the colors and all these kids and then, you know, like on a Saturday, you'd be going to a football game.  And, you'd dress for a football, and these people would still be working.  So, you, you know, you got a feeling that you had a lot of things you had to do in this country to change it around.  So, I remember that very much.  But, I also, I did in my freshman year, I was on the track team at Penn.  But, I--a guy named Johnnie Woodruff from Pittsburgh [University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and some other guys from Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], they could outrun me.  I figured I wasn't gonna be sensational at that.  Also, when the Olympics came along, I figured that--the war [World War II, WWII] came along they'd be no Olympics so I figured I'd better do something else.  So, that's when I started studying.  But, I had a good time at Penn.
Speaker 1: And, what other, were there any other things that was influencing you then at that, at you know, during that time?  Or, people who like anyone who mentored you at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd, I'd known Raymond Pace Alexander and he certainly mentored (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He, so he was com- becoming--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah--
Speaker 1: More active in your--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, but by also Austin Norris [J. Austin Norris] who was also a very good doctor there.  I mean, very good lawyer there.  And, my mother [Laura Mason Coleman] and father [William T. Coleman, Sr.].  I mean, they really, you know, they really spent a lot of time talking to us as what, you know, you could do in life and what you, you ought to do and I, you know, the doctor I had was, you know, and people seem to have more interest and concern to see the people, you know, had opportunities knew the various things that could happen.
Story_ID: 568939
Speaker 1: What I was asking was, you said that there were, you, well--I'm not gonna phrase it right.  You were saying that you were, you, what were you thinking that you wanted to be?  I mean, you said there were a lot of discussions going on about, you know, what to do for the race.  You, and I was just wondering where you fit on that discussion?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to be a lawyer.  But, I never thought that, well, that meant that you become a lawyer, you then you have an office in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and your clients would be all black, you know.  'Cause I knew that meant that you were gonna do negligence work or you were gonna do small criminal work.  And, I also felt that even by then that the power of the nation was in the business part.  And, therefore, whatever I did I wanted to--so, when business--but that didn't mean that I didn't wanna do the other and be concerned about it (unclear).
Speaker 1: Was that, was, do you think you have that perspective because you did go to Wharton [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you know, and spent time--?
Speaker 2: No.  I guess I just, I just had that really from my mother [Laura Mason Coleman] and father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] and Granger [Lester Blackwell Granger] and the people.  Raymond Pace Alexander I think, Bill Hastie [William H. Hastie] that's, I think that's what they had.  I just, somebody told me.  I haven't seen it.  But, somebody told me there's a lawyer article done recently at the Yale Law Journal and it's about Charlie Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston].  And, that Charlie Houston said, the reason why he wanted to train lawyers mainly 'cause he wanted them to get into business.  Because that was it and I had known and, you know, I, well, I guess by the time I finished college I'd known enough about the struggle between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton.  And, that Jefferson felt that you have many in agriculture economy, have slaves take care of it as against, Hamilton felt that you should build roads, canals, and business and that was the, the future.  By the time I finished Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I'd been exposed to John Maynard Keynes and his theories of economy.  And, I could figure out what had to be done if blacks were really gonna become part of it, you know.  I feel, you know, much more pride today with the fact that the last time I introduced, your friend, who's the guy, Johnson--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Al Johnson [sic. Robert L. Johnson].
Speaker 2: To somebody, Thursday night at a party I said, "I wanna show you our first black billionaire."  To me that's, I'm serious, and this is important and I just think I, that made an (unclear).  Of course, there was, what was the lady that did the hair preparation, she was--?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Madam C. Walker [sic.].
Speaker 2: Madam C.J. Walker (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Walker, and then there was, you know, the people, there's some people out of Chicago [Illinois] and I--
Speaker 2: Right, the Johnsons, right.
Speaker 1: You know, the business people were the people I thought were, were gonna make the difference.  And, and I, you know, knew that you had to get people in proper housing and that sort of thing.  But, I even and felt it'd been much more sense if instead of putting them in housing projects, you'd spread 'em all over the suburbs in small ro- you know, people that would get the work, get things done that way.  And, I still feel that way.  So, that why I entered.
Speaker 2: But, you're saying those thoughts begin really back when you were a college student?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  When in college and you know, I had seen, you know, I had the boys club [Wissahickon Boys Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and also the, you know, the Depression [Great Depression] had come along and you had the, what it's called, the CCC [Civilian Conservation Corps]?  You know, the--
Speaker 2: Community--
Speaker 1: Community Civic--Civilian Service.  These kids (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Civilian Corps, right.
Speaker 1: Would go away and learn who to cut the trees down and everything.  I just felt that you needed people that, you know, got, got into business.  I knew that if you went to work for somebody like Ford Motor Company, you'll have a union.  And, because you were black and didn't get in the union early enough, they're gonna take care of those white boys before they take care of you.  And, I just felt you needed somebody in the room to say, "Oh, by the way, have you thought of this?"  And, that's why.
Story_ID: 568940
Speaker 1: How much were politics, like Republican politics playing a part in your, your, your, your life at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, not, not at all.  I mean, I was never a politic, except that one person that my father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] knew quite well was a guy named Hugh D. Scott [Hugh Scott] who was the Republican congressman from that district.  He went on to be the senator from Pennsylvania and he also at one time was chairman of the Republican Party.  So, you know, we knew him.  And, my Grandfather Mason, when he got the job, he had at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], you know, Taft [President William Howard Taft] was president (laughter).  He was a Republican president.  And, and we had the experience of the Underground Railroad.  And, at that time the Democrats, you know, were basically a southern party.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, I felt, you know, much of the Republican Party and I, you know, then I felt in the Democratic Party.  But, I never got involved and actually both, you know--the first job I got after law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] as law clerk to Judge Goodrich [Herbert F. Goodrich].  He was a Democratic guy.  And, Frankfurter [Felix Frankfurter] was Democrat.  And, was at, Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, LLP] they were all Democrats save one.  And, when I went to the firm in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], the Dilworth [Richardson Dilworth] was a Democrat.  So, I had always managed to associate with both of 'em.
Story_ID: 568941
Speaker 1: Now, in, at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you gradu- you majored in, was it eco- ?
Speaker 2: I majored in political science and government.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, was there any professor there that really influenced you that you thought was really good and did you, or did you do like an honors thesis?  Was that--?
Speaker 2: I didn't, we, I don't think we had to do an honors thesis there.  But, I, I thought that the guy who taught me psychology was awfully good.  And, I thought that guy that taught me some of the political science course.  I don't remember their names, but.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now, law school.  How is that decision made about where you want to go?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I applied for Penn [University of Pennsylvania Law School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and I applied for Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I got accepted at both.  The difference being Penn offered me a full scholarship.  Harvard offered me nothing (laughter), you know.  But, I decided to go to Harvard because I--
Speaker 1: Felt.
Speaker 2: Thought that Harvard was better than Penn then.  And, I went to Harvard in the first year.  I lived with my mother's [Laura Mason Coleman] sister [Emma Mason Groves] in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts] and, you know, they took care of me.  It so happened, after I got to Harvard, in the first semester you take one exam in criminal law.  And, I got a very high mark in that so they not only gave me a scholarship, but they gave it retroactive to September.  And, I must confess, I told my father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] I had a scholarship.  I didn't not tell him they'd given me three hundred dollars back (laughter).  But, that's what I used to court Lovida [Coleman's wife, Lovida Hardin Coleman], so therefore, you that was all right.  But, you know, so, I, so I, and I, so I, you know, that's the way it came about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I think I made the right choice.  I think at that time Harvard was much better than Penn.  I think Penn's gotten to be a much better school now (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 568942
Speaker 1: Now, when you entered the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], how many, how many blacks were in your class?
Speaker 2: There were two others.
Speaker 1: Names?
Speaker 2: One was Wade McCree [Wade H. McCree], who's from Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], a summa Fisk, the whole family a summa Fisk.  Went on to be solicitor general of the United States.  And, another, the other guy named Bill Edwards who went to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] there, a class ahead of me there were two.  Once was Matt Bullock [ph.] and the other was George Laden [ph.].  And, they must've been about five others there who were taking graduate work 'cause a guy named Charlie Quick [ph.] I know he was one of those there.
Speaker 1: George Laden was in the class ahead of--but, he had been out of sch-(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he finis--he'd finished college, but he spent a lot of time before he went to law school.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.
Speaker 2: But he, but he was in the class ahead of me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was those, you're, let me understand the law school, the classes you were taking in the years.  You took criminal law.  You took torts?
Speaker 2: I took criminal law, agency, property, contract and judicial remedies, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember who your teachers were?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew that, yeah, I knew that a guy named Walter Barton Leach [W. Barton Leach] taught me property.  A guy named Maguire [John MacArthur Maguire] taught me agency 'cause that was at the half.  A guy name Sheldon Glueck taught me criminal law.  And, oh, a guy name, gee, I'll think of the name, taught me judicial remedies, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is the--the names had changed by the time I got to law school--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah for sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But, yeah, that's right, right, right.  Its 19--it's 1941, right?
Speaker 2: I started in '41 [1941].  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 568943
Speaker 1: And, you were there a little over a year, or you--?
Speaker 2: No, I stayed, actually, I went, I started in '41 [1941], Pearl Harbor came along in '41 [1941] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Two [sic.].
Speaker 2: And, I then went to--when my number came up, I volunteered for the Air Corps [U.S. Army Air Corps] to train as a pilot.  But, the [U.S.] Army had the rule then, that they only take twenty-five blacks a month because you could only do it down at Tuskegee [Alabama].  So, I figured by the time (laughter), time the war, the war would be over before, I mean, you know, (unclear).  But, then what happened was in early 1943, Bill Hastie [William H. Hastie] who was the civilian aide to the secretary of war, Simp--Henry Stimson [Henry Lewis Stimson], protested and said that you ought to take blacks in just like everybody else, and integrate 'em.  They should be able to fight bombers and navigators.  And, and Stimson and Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] said, "No."  So, Hastie quit.  At which point they then called up all of us and sent us to school.  Not to train as pilots but just to take training until we finally could get in a class.  I finally got in a class of 44C I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  44C--?
Speaker 2: Forty--my--I'd would've graduated in 44C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my class (unclear).
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: I washed out as an upper basic training, so I did that.
Speaker 1: But, so, you were, you were out, you were part of the U.S. Army Corps?
Speaker 2: No.  The Air Corps.
Speaker 1: Air Corps.
Speaker 2: What they did, they--no, the Army, there was no separate Air Corps then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was in the Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I was--and the Army had a U.S. Air Corps, Army Air Corp--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I was training at Tuskegee to, to do that.
Speaker 1: So, is Tuskegee where everyone went to train?  Is that wh- ?
Speaker 2: Well, if you were black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Black.  That's where you went?
Speaker 2: --that's where you went, yeah.
Story_ID: 568944
Speaker 1: You were there for, was it a year?
Speaker 2: No, well, actually, I was there, well actually I, what happened was, they called us all up.  And, we were to report to Biloxi field, Mississippi [Keesler Army Airfield; Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi].  I told the people in Boston [Massachusetts] that I know that when I got to Washington [D.C.] that they were gonna segregate me.  And, where ever they segregate me, I was gonna get off the train, call you, and say, you got a bunch of soldier whose walking around down here.  And, I then suggested to them, because we had had a case in the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] that Charlie Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston] had won which says that on the Pullman train, they, they had to--they couldn't segregate you 'cause they didn't have any separate facilities.  And, so I arranged, so they gave me a first class Pullman ticket from Boston to Biloxi.  And, so, I went to (laughter) Biloxi, Mississippi, you know, first class.  My father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] went with me as far as Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  When I got off in Biloxi, the first command I ever got in the U.S. Army was, "Hey, nigger where you going?"  I kept on walking.  I must confess, I then chickened out 'cause when the guy said, "Hey, boy."  I settled for that and I told him where I was going.  So, they said, "Well, we're supposed to put you up--take you to Biloxi field," and it was about, I was the only one.  But, then he picked up some white guys and, and the white guys said, "Gee, what are all these blacks kids doing in town?  They're dressed like college people."  And, the guy said, "Well, you know that damn Mrs. Roosevelt [Eleanor Roosevelt], she convinced that (unclear) these black people can fly.  So, they bring 'em on the train."  So that's how we got there.  And, then I stayed at Biloxi for about three months.  And, then they took us over to Tuskegee [Alabama] and I stayed there for about five months.  And, then I went into the cadet corps.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, how long were you in the cadet corps?  For another--?
Speaker 2: No. I was, no, I was not the cadet corps for I took the pri- the basic, the pre-flight training for two months.  Then I, then I took the basic training and I learned how to fly a plane.  But, then when I got to the middle class, I washed out.  And, thirty days later, they sent me to officer's training school down in, someplace in Texas.  And, I stayed there thirty days and then they sent me to the Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] to be trained as CISCO Control Officer [Corps Information Systems Control Officer].  But, also Lovida [Coleman's wife, Lovida Hardin Coleman] was still in college [Boston University] up in Boston [Massachusetts] so, that's the reason why I really went back.  And, then I got commissioned from the second lieu- second lieutenant from the, from the Harvard Business School.
Speaker 1: So, once you got commissioned you went back to law school?  Is that how it worked?
Speaker 2: Oh no.  Oh no, I got commissioned and then they assigned me to the, to the 332nd Fighter Group as a, as a CISCO Control Officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, you were, so, you were out of school two years?
Speaker 2: By that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Two, years.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But, then I went in the Army [U.S. Army Air Corps] until the, until the war [World War II, WWII] was over.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 568945
Speaker 1: Then they brought back the 332nd Fighter Group and they made us the 477 Composite Bomber Group [477th Bombardment Group].  We're the only group in all the Air Corps [U.S. Army Air Corps] where you had both bombers and fighter together.  And, we were in Atterbury, Indiana [at Camp Atterbury].  And, then they had a white officer's club there and they said that all the blacks were trainees.  And, where you had these second lieutenant white guys who had never been overseas, they were instructors.  So, they went to the good officer's club and we went someplace else.  And, these 104 black officers said, "There's no way in hell, we're gonna do that."  'Cause these guys have been overseas, been shot at, and you know they were damn good pilots.  So, they then by that time found out that I'd had a year and half of law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So, they said, "Well, don't you go in because we need somebody (laughter) to get us out?"  But, just find, all you gotta do is find out Thurgood Marshall's telephone number.  So, I did that and then we said, "Well, we have to prove this guy is keeping up out because of color rather than because we're trainees."  And, you know, anytime you get 104 black people together some of 'em could pass for white, you know.  So, we sent some up there how could pass for white, they let 'em in, the others they wouldn't.  So, that's how we knew that that's what they were doing.  So, the, the, the 104 black officers then got arrested.  And, I had told them, you know, "I think I can get you out."  But, my punchline was always, "I just can't image that Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] will let you stay in jail (laughter)."  What happened at eleven o'clock the next morning?  Roosevelt died.  And, so when I walked in to see these guys under arrest they said, "For Christ's sake, Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.], you can't even depend upon the white guy dying at the right time."  So, so, Thurgood Marshall told me to call Ted Berry [Theodore M. Berry], you know, West--Togo West's [HistoryMaker Togo D. West, Jr.] father [sic. father-in-law] who was in, where'd they live?  In the--Cincinnati [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah.  That's right.
Speaker 1: And, the two of us tried this case and we got guys acquitted.
Speaker 2: Oh, you did.  You--?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, we got 'em (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And all the news--newspaper headline and everything that--so, that's who we--but in the meantime, they brought B.O. Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Sr.] back to take command over at the--and, Bob Maine [ph.] was one--was on the court.  So we, you know, we did all right, but we got 'em acquitted.
Story_ID: 568946
Speaker 1: Let me go back a couple of things.  First of all, when, when have you met Thurgood Marshall at this point?  Because you meant, you know, you say, "I called Thurgood Marshall," but when have you met him at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd seen him around the church someplace in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], you know, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He'd come to Philadelphia.  In fact, his wife, his first wife [Vivian Burey Marshall] lived in Philadelphia.  And, so, he, you know, he was a--and I also know him because when I go to Baltimore [Maryland], you know, they would always talk about Thurgood Marshall so I had (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  But, why was he the person to call?
Speaker 2: Because he, because he, at the time he was head of the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And, we just thought that he, you know, no, but he said, you know, Ted Berry [Theodore M. Berry] was a good lawyer.  So, the two of us tried the case and we got, we got 'em acquitted.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, what we did, we found an Army Regulations 210-19, which said that any facility on any base was opened to every officer.  But, this facil--the regulation was dated 1919.  So, you knew damn well (laughter), it end up doing civil rights or anything.  But, what had happened after the First World War [World War I, WWI], the West Pointers wanted to keep the [U.S.] National Guard officers, and the battlefield commission officers out of their big country club.  And, so they, they excluded them.  Of course, those people had enough power to get the [U.S.] Congress to tell the [U.S.] Army they had to change it.  So, that's where the change, so with a straight face ended this regulation adopted in 1919 meant you couldn't segregate.  So, that's how we won the case.
Story_ID: 568947
Speaker 1: You had mentioned your wife Lovida [Lovida Hardin Coleman].  When did you first meet her?
Speaker 2: Well, I met Lovida I guess about a month and a half after I started law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  She was a freshman at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  She was from New Orleans [Louisiana] but she had come to Boston [Massachusetts] took a year or two in high school and then she, went--started--was a freshman.
Speaker 1: And, how did you meet her?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, at some mixer about a month and a half after we were in law school.
Speaker 1: 'Cause Boston University, it keeps coming up as a place that either people went, you know, black went to graduate school.  There's certain schools you start hearing when you do these interviews that come up.  But, what was, what was she, you said she was majoring in?
Speaker 2: Well, she wanted to be a teacher.
Speaker 1: Teacher, okay.
Speaker 2: And, she, she went to, well, she went to BU [Boston University].  She wanted to go to Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] but they told her, she'd have to take another year in high school before she could do that.  So, she said that after being in Boston one year, she then went to BU.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about her family background at all?
Speaker 2: Well, interesting, her father was a doctor.  Dr. Hardin [Joseph Arthur Hardin, Sr.], a very distinguished doctor.  In fact, the City of New Orleans finally named a school and a playground after him [Hardin Park, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Also, in 1952, he was a delegation on the Republican delegation to the 1952 Convention [1952 Republican National Convention, Chicago, Illinois].  And, he and John Maynard Wisdom [sic. John Minor Wisdom] who was--went on to be a great lawyer in the Fifth Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit], were the two that led that delegation from Taft [President William Howard Taft] to Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower].  So, he, and then after that Eisenhower after he got elected president called Dr. Hardin and said, "What do you want?"  And, Dr. Hardin says, "I don't want anything."  And, Eisenhower said, "Well, you want something."  And, John Maynard says, "He wants to be a judge on the Fifth Circuit."  "I will take care of that, I gotta do something for your doctor."  And, so, Doctor said, "No.  I just wanna practice medicine."  Then about a month later Eisenhow- somebody else called from the White House [Washington, D.C.], called and said, "Look, we've solved the problem for you.  We're finding something for you to do where you don't have to give up practice medicine.  We're gonna make you the commissioner of the Port of New Orleans.  And, all you have to do whenever a ship comes in, go out and make sure the sailors get treated right; no disease.  And, for that you get a fee."  Of course this was when they were bring all the rubber in from, from Africa and up to the--up the Ohio River.  So, he for eight years did that.  Did all right.
Speaker 1: Now, how--will you spell your wife's name, first and last?
Speaker 2: Lovida, L-O-V-I-D-A.  Middle name is M-A-E.  And, the last name is Hardin, H-A-R-D-I-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What attracted you to her?
Speaker 2: Well, she was very attractive lady.  She'd very pretty, very bright, you know, I did all the--I had some competition.  One of my competition was Eddie Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke].  I mean, he was, he was a second lieutenant up at Fort Devens [Massachusetts] then.  Can you imagine that dude coming down (laughter), you know, and look good, yeah, so.
Speaker 1: So, how did you win out (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, I (laughter).  They sent, they the bastard overseas early (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: He was a--he went with the 92nd--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So, no, you won out against him.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know about that.  But, he's a, he's a--but, no, he was a very, but he was good.  But, you know, every, but no, but he--all the ladies like him, you know.  They, 'cause, you know, you ask a girl on a date from Monday to Thursday, she'd go out with you.  If it's Friday and Saturday, she said, "I'm gonna study," you know, because Eddie was coming down from Devens and he made--had two hundred dollars a month that he made.  So, he was a tough, tough competit- but, he a good friend, good friend, but.

Speaker 1: So you're saying, you got to know him [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke] during your time at law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], or later?  It was probably later (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I knew him, I knew him at law school and then I knew him, yeah, I knew him, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, you, you know, in Boston [Massachusetts] then as you know, you all circulate, you got to know people that welled in other places.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell me who, once again, now you, you do, you, you take, you're there a year, then you take two years--
Speaker 2: Two years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Off, and then you come back?
Speaker 2: I come back.
Speaker 1: But, this was also pretty typical for what was going on, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: I mean, 'cause people were what, you know, people were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everybody, oh yeah, yes, the war [World War II, WWII] when it was over.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: I was there about a year.  Is suppose I was there about a year and three quarters before I went and came back 'cause I, 'cause I--'cause Elliot Richardson [Elliot Lee Richardson] was in class and he got called up earlier so he had two years to go afterwards.  I just had about, well, I came back in what '45 [1945] and I finished in October of '46 [1946] so I got out then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, like in a year and a half, you fin- (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, a year and a half and then--okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So it was like your second year was split?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, how did, how did the--so, you didn't necessarily start, you know, finished with the people you started with.  But, Elliot, Elliot Richardson you met in your first year, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I met Elliot Richardson the first day I was there 'cause we came up together at Harvard Square [Cambridge, Massachusetts] on the subway.  And, he said, "Are you gonna go to the law school?"  I said, "Yes."  He said, "I am too."  And, that's how we first met; became very good friends.
Story_ID: 568949
Speaker 1: Friendship is, you know, it's, it often is just, you know, sort of chemistry.  What, what was it that attracted the two of you together earlier, that you liked about each other?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked him a lot.  And, we--at the end of the first year, we both made the Harvard Law Review so that put us together.  And, then when he came back from war [World War II, WWII] and I was--had finished law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], or finishing law school, I was the only person in my class that didn't have a job.  And, so, I, and Elliot [Elliot Lee Richardson] said, "What are you gonna do next year?"  I said, "I don't know."  And, so, he said, "Why?"  I said, "Well, I've been trying to get a job in Boston [Massachusetts], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and New York [New York], and nobody will hire me."  So, he said, "Gee, that seems to be wrong."  And, so, he apparently called his uncle.  And, the next day a chauffeur shows up with his chauffeur driven car plus five books and said, "Mr. Henry Shattuck [Henry Lee Shattuck] wants you to come down and see him in his office."  So, I go down to his office and everything.  And, Henry Shattuck calls a man name Charles Curtis who was head of one of the big law firm in Boston but also was still in the state legislature in Boston.  And, said, "Charlie, I have a young man in the office who I know you wanna hire.  And, he's, and he's, you know, was first in his class; said all that and everything.  And, I also know that just because he's colored that you can't hold that against him 'cause you're spending all your time on the floor of the senate and the legislature saying how we gotta treat black people better.  And, Curtis said, "Oh, I can't do that," you know, "Boston's not ready for that, yet."  So, he did refer me to somebody down at Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, LLP] and ended up getting a job there.  So, that's how, you know, that's a type of relationship.  And, then when later on he and I clerked for Frankfurter [Felix Frankfurter] together.  And, then when we were in the cabinet together--well, I was in the cabinet and he was sent overseas to Great Britain, and he called me up and said, "You can use my house," you know, so we had a house in the Maclay [ph.].  So, we were--and, he actually is the godfather, he's the godfather of my middle child [Lovida Hardin Coleman, Jr.] because she was born when I was clerking for Frankfurter and he was there.  Now, we, we've been very good friends.  And, when he went back to Ropes, Gray [Ropes, Gray, Best, Collidge and Rugg], he used to send me some business in New York [New York].  So, we were very good friends.
Speaker 1: Now, did you, were there discussion that the two of your would have, you know, about futu- you know future debates that you would have when you served on Law Review together, or?
Speaker 2: Or, sure.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we've, we had, we had debates the time for court.  That was hard work.  We used to have to work about eight hours.  So, you know, you do a lot of different things.  I think more helpful was that you, you know, began to work with other people who, by definition were, if you measured by grades, were the brightest people in the class.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And, also, you worked on revising documents that they did.  And, it did something for your ego if somebody who's supposed to be brighter than you, you could correct him and show him that he'd made a mistake.  So, you know, so it was a very good experience.
Story_ID: 568950
Speaker 1: So, let me ask you about the debates that you--first of all can you describe the process of even getting on the Law Review [Harvard Law Review] at that time?  And, what year that actually occurred for you (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: Given this--
Speaker 2: For me it occurred in June, '42 [1942].  And, then, they've changed it now, but then, they took the top eighteen people, provided those people had an A average.  They took nobody who didn't have an A average, and you had to be the top eighteen.  And, you know, they just call you up and say, "You've made the Law Review."  And, you go over and you start working.  So, you really had the top eighteen people in your class and also the class before the top eighteen.  So, there were, what, thirty-six people who were supposed to be, at least if you measure by their grade, supposed to be the best students.  And, then you work night and day for, for a year.  And, then the third year, you supervise other people working, so that's the way it goes.
Speaker 1: What did you learn from that experience, Mr. Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.]?  And, and before we get there, was that something that you knew a lot about Law Review, you know, coming in?  In know that, you know, once, you know, you get there, there's talk of Law Review, but was that something that you were sort of aspiring to or there was discussion about?
Speaker 2: No, I can't--I don't think that when I was--started law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] I thought that I would end up making the Law Review.  I must say that after the exam in criminal law and I'd done so well that I said, "Well, I must be a little better at this than a lot of other people."  But, I still never thought about it.  But, I, you know, I saw these people who were the thirty-six people in the law school who were thought to be the super giants.  And, obviously, you know, you wanted to, if you could do that.  But, I, when I finished the--my exams, I had no idea I done that well.  And, I got a telephone call from the president of the Law Review before I'd got my grades and said that, "You've been invited to join the review."  So, I figured I must've done quite well.  And, so, that's how it turned out.
Speaker 1: Now, at that point, how many blacks had really been on the Law Review?
Speaker 2: I was the third black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The first one was Charles Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston].  The second was Bill Hastie [William H. Hastie].  I'm the third (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can--
Story_ID: 568951
Speaker 1: Can we take this opportunity now, you know, for people seeing the interview, can you talk a little bit about Charles Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston] and, you know, and then Bill Hastie [William H. Hastie]?  Can you tell what their backgrounds were?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, you know, Charles Houston was twenty--?
Speaker 2: Well, they both they--Charles Houston and Bill Hastie were both older than me.  But, I met both of 'em; and Bill Hastie I knew even better because he finally became a judge in the Third Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit], and that was the circuit in which I practiced in.  Charles Houston was a very attractive man, went to Amherst [Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts] and did exceedingly well.  He then was in the war, First World War [World War I, WWI], and went overseas.  He as an officer and he came back and then went to the law school.  And, became--and he made the Harvard Law Review which meant he had grades all--an A average, and did quite well; taught by Felix Frankfurter.  And, then he came down to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and taught, and finally became a dean of Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].  He trained Thurgood Marshall, among other people.  And, I would say that it generally conceded that it was his ideas that really began to get people to think about how could we change the country so--erase segregation, at least in public facility, be eliminated.  It so happens that Bill Hastie was his cousin.  And, Bill Hastie came along, went to Amherst, did exceedingly well, went directly to law school and did exceedingly well.  And, when Bill came down he began to have a mixed career of practice 'cause his father [sic.] was a lawyer and has a firm here, Hastie, Hastie, and Houston [sic. Houston, Houston, Hastie and Waddie], yeah.  And, I don't know whether Charlie Houston was in that firm, but it's a Houston firm.  And, he did, but then he taught at Howard.  He was, he was the judge in the [U.S.] Virgin Islands and he also was governor of the Virgin Islands for a time.  And, he was civilian aide to the defense department [sic. civilian aide to the secretary of war] there, the Army Department [sic. U.S. Department of War; U.S. Department of Defense] during the Second World War [World War II, WWII] to, until he resigned, and then he was dean of Howard.  Then, he was appointed by Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] the Third Circuit became chief judge there.  And, I would say that, most people would say that, he's certainly one of the outstanding, brilliant minds that both of 'em were superb people.
Speaker 1: Now, just in terms of just sort of a timeline, Houston graduated in the '20s [1920s], right?
Speaker 2: In the '20 [1920]--
Speaker 1: From Harvard Law [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  Twen--
Speaker 2: And, he graduated in the, wait a minute.
Speaker 1: I thought he graduated from Harvard Law School in 1920, '20s [1920s].  Is that--am I wrong?
Speaker 2: He may, he may--I thought I would--no, the--
Speaker 1: Am I wrong?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't think he--no, you're wrong only because I don't think he went to law school until after he was a [U.S.] military man--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the war.  So, the war was over in '18 [1918].  And, he probably didn't go to law school until 1920.  He finished about 1923, '24 [1924] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  That's--
Speaker 2: Hastie finished about 1928.
Story_ID: 568952
Speaker 1: There's this gap of time, you know, and you're the third one on the Law Review [Harvard Law Review]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, at this time.  And, it wasn't like there were great numbers in between of blacks at the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], right?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: But, on average maybe of two a year, or?
Speaker 2: Two.  But, I would say that after the war [World War II, WWII] there probably were ten or twelve or fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's what it came up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what--this puts you, first of all, I wanna ask you, because I think there something about someone having a legal mind, you know, there's legal training.  But, there are certain minds that are more prone to excelling in the legal arena.
Speaker 2: I hope so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Would you say that?
Speaker 2: I hope so.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Also, I owe a lot of class a lot of money.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Sorry, I'm not supposed to be laughing, okay.  So, what, what, what do you think was it that you took to so well?  I mean, what fascinated you about legal jurisprudence or, you know, the study, you know, the study, the discipline?  What, what about it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I thought I could--
Speaker 1: Did find did you find attractive?
Speaker 2: I thought I could read and, and comprehend quickly and well.  And, that what I picked up, I remembered.  Although, part of that was because after I started law school within two months the, the war came along.  And, Walter Barton Leach who taught me, were teaching me property then said, you know, that, "Most of you guys are gonna leave.  But, if you learn how to overlearn, when you come back, you'll still remember what I taught you."  And, overlearn, he just said, you know, "When you're a young kid and you get a poem that you think should learn, you learn it.  Then you keep on reviewing it, you finally get it in your mind so you remember it twenty years from now."  And, that's what he called the concept of overlearn.  And, so, you know, you pick that up.  And, the whole time I was overseas or when I, when I was in the [U.S.] Army I carried my law books with me.  So, I used to do a lot of reviewing and that sort of thing.  So, I just, it was something that I just remember and did well.  And, then I, and then I liked it.  And, obviously, I knew, even though the first year the courses didn't cover that, that the issues of dealing with race in the [U.S.] Supreme Court that if I could really understand the constitution of the cases that that would help me then.  And, I also felt that even then I wanted to be a lawyer that handled people who were in business.  And, therefore, I could understand that corporate or that that would help me.  And, then when you're on the Law Review, you do a lot of things which are way beyond what you get to--exposed to in class.  So, you know, I have to take papers written by this and that sorta things.  So, it just, it just all came together.  And, each year they would have a big dinner where, you know, the justices of the Supreme Court who had finished the law school and were on the Law Review, we'd come back for it, the leading lawyers so I got to know them and the judges.  And, I just thought it was just a nice group to be with.
Speaker 1: And, was there any, you almost paint an idyllic existence there.  Was it idyllic in that way?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought, I thought it was.  But, once again, when I finished, even though first in my class, I couldn't get a job, you know.  So, that, that kind of rub you the wrong way.  But, I, no, I really enjoy, no, I enjoyed law school particularly when it turned out that I could, I could do it so well.  I mean, I had no idea when I went there that I, you know, I, you know, the first day you're there, then they used to tell you, "Look to the right of you, look to the left of you.  One of you not gonna be here nex- ," well, you know that (unclear), a lot of tension.  And, then it was also interesting to find people who, you know, had Phi Beta Kappa [Phi Beta Kappa Society] keys and wore then.  But, after two or three weeks, they took 'em off because they (laughter) figured (unclear), so, you know.  So, it was really a, it really a great challenge, and I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They--
Story_ID: 568953
Speaker 1: They took them off because they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, because they--
Speaker 1: It was so com- there were so many bright people around--
Speaker 2: Bright people.  But, also the fact that the, using the Socratic Method, the professors soon could handle you in such a way that you didn't understand what was going on--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So, felt dumb as hell.  So, you took the key off, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there any experiences in any of your classes that you didn't feel prepared or did that ever happened?  Or, you got called on and--?
Speaker 2: No, I, no I--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No, I, that never--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To the best of my knowledge that never happened.  That doesn't mean that sometime I, you know, I probably wasn't prepared.  But, I--no, I'm really prepared because you know my, well, my father [William T. Coleman, Sr.] was paying for it and I figure that, or I'm talking a scholarship but I just figured it was something that you spend your time on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, any course that you liked more than others?
Speaker 2: Well, in retrospect, I certainly turned out that I like conflict of laws and I liked federal jurisdiction.  And, I liked the constitutional courses and I liked the business courses.  And, I thought, I guess, my last year when I had tax that, you know, Griswold [Erwin Griswold] was a great teacher and I enjoyed--no, I enjoyed all of it.
Speaker 1: So, who, who taught you constitutional law?  Who was your--do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, T.R. Powell [Thomas Reed Powell] taught me constitutional law, and Paul Freund [Paul A. Freund] taught me federal jurisdiction and conflict of law.  And, also in conflict of laws, I won the Beale Prize [John H. Beale Prize] because I got the highest market in that.  And, that, that was four hundred bucks [dollars].  That's a lot of money in 1946.  So, I, so, I liked conflict.
Speaker 1: Now, how did this prize happened though?  What, what was that, was that a separate competition outside?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I didn't know, I must--I kind of cheated in a sense that, I read the catalog and it said, that the person that got the highest market in conflict this year got four hundred dollars.  And, I never told my other colleagues of the law (laughter)--about that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, I, I won the prize.  But, I, you know, so, I--but, I think it also helped me to get the clerkship with Judge Goodrich [Herbert F. Goodrich], because he was, Goodrich was a Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate but was also, at that time, probably one of the five outstanding professors that taught that.  'Cause he also taught at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And, I think that that probably was one of the reasons why he said, "I'll take him," as his worker.
Story_ID: 568954
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the discussions that, or let's say a discussion that you and you know, your other members of the Law Review [Harvard Law Review] had?  Or, you know, you know, disagreements back and forth, I mean, do you remember anything being hotly debated, or?
Speaker 2: Well, we had, well I reme--one day I remember there was one time when I was asked to review a paper written by another member of the Law Review and he went on the be the president of the Law Review.  And, also professor at one great law school, and dean of another great law school so he was--and, he was also clerk for Justice Jackson [Robert H. Jackson] one year.  And, I was able to convince him that what he'd written was wrong.  Now, this had nothing to do with race, this was some age issue, which certain gives you a little more confidence.  If you could have somebody who's obviously bright, you could read a document he's worked on for two or three weeks and tell 'em that he's wrong.  And, he finally agrees with you and he rewrites it the way you tell 'em to.  That's, that's very helpful.  We obviously, particularly after the war [World War II, WWII] had some discussions about race and, you know, what had to be done.  And, you know, there were disagreements on, on some of those issues in terms of, you know, could the [U.S.] Supreme Court really correct this?  Or, was this something you ultimately had to get so involved in politics that the, the political people would do it.  And, you knew that was almost impossible because it's ninety against ten.  So, you know, you don't win those battles, so.
Speaker 1: And, you, you had also come out of the war having won that one, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Case that you talked about.  So, it's, you know, you had had real practical experience--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, not only that--
Speaker 1: Not theoretical.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, but not only that, but you know, by that time Charlie Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston] and Bill Hastie [William H. Hastie] had won other cases so there were a few cases coming--and I also remember, I know T.R. Powell [Thomas Reed Powell] taught a--talked about a case dealing with a Texas statute which placed different safety requirements on a freight railroad as it went across Texas.  And, he, actually, he was the lawyer in the case he was arguing in the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  And, in the course of it he just said, you know, you know, "This is an intriguing case because perhaps this maybe--could be used in a case dealing with segregation."  Because the same way you, by that time, had, you know, different rules, different places where you sat in the first car, the last car, whether you're segregated or not.  And, that was the case he used.  I also remember that Paul Freund [Paul A. Freund] in federal jurisdiction said that the three judge court provisions, you know, and that's when you attack state statute in the federal court.  And, whether you win or lose, it has to be before three judges and you have a direct right of appeal Supreme Court, and so certain jurisdiction, you know, you don't have to depend upon that.  And, he, you know, he certainly suggested that maybe if somebody was skillfully bringing her case or dealing with that issue that if you realize, you do that.  'Cause I remember later when we had a case, when I was working with Thurgood Marshall and he'd gotten a good judge in the South.  And, he said, "I wanna resist the three judge court."  (Laughter) Because his guy's (laughter) is, is, you know, decided my way.  And, I said, "Well, you can't do that Mr. Marshall because you may lose it.  And, if you, or if you don't lose it, it goes to the circuit.  You got some people that, you know, are good.  But, you wanna be able to get to the Supreme Court."  And, so, we then worked out theory where it was a three judge court.  So, we, so we did pick up things which later on you could use in this other battle.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, at that point in time, Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] professors were, they were going in and out of government service and other things.  There was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, Paul Freund had been deputy solicitor general and all of--and Griswold [Erwin Griswold] had been in the government, or a lot of 'em had been in government, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, they brought that experience (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that stature to things?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 568955
Speaker 1: Now, when do you get married?  You get married--
Speaker 2: Oh, I got married in nineteen--oh, I got married in nineteen--
Speaker 1: Say nineteen forty--
Speaker 2: Forty-five [1945].
Speaker 1: Forty-five [1945].  So, before, the year before you--?
Speaker 2: Before I came--actually, I got married when I was in the war [World War II, WWII].  I mean, you know, in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: In the Army.
Speaker 2: In the Air Corps [U.S. Army Air Corps].  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, then you come back and you're (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I come back to law school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, law school.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, when you, do you remember the day you graduated?
Speaker 2: I finished law school in October, 1946.  So, the first of October.  I then--
Speaker 1: These school years; there--nothing is in the normal--
Speaker 2: Well, that's because we went summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You go summer too.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.
Speaker 2: See they, they had clas--see when I, when I was at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] the first year, I finished the first year in June but then I went to summer school.  And, so, so that's how I picked up that, that year.
Speaker 1: So, let me, so in your, so, just so I understand, you didn't have any like, you know, now it's big on clerkships.  There, were there any of those things that happened 'cause between the service and the things you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  These were all things, no, no, they happened after, no, no--
Speaker 1: It happened af- okay, okay.
Speaker 2: After.  No.  When, when I came back to--I finished in October, '46 [1946], then because Judge Goodrich [Herbert F. Goodrich] said he couldn't take me until the 23rd of May, '47 [1947], the law school appointed me as a teaching fellow for that time so--
Speaker 1: I was wondering why (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I understand.
Speaker 2: So, I was a teaching fellow--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Until then.  Then, I came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and I clerked and then I clerked for Frankfurter [Felix Frankfurter] and then I went to work at Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, LLP] afterwards.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did it come that you were clerking for or working for Goodrich?  How did that come?  Were--
Speaker 2: Well, I--
Speaker 1: Did you do the interviews?  Was it that--were they're applications?  I'm just trying to understand the difference in the process.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, yeah, yeah, I--well, somebody else made the application.  I'm, well he never told me but I think Paul Freund [Paul A. Freund] was the one who did it.  And, I know I say that only because I saw a book recently about the [U.S.] Supreme Court law clerks and there's a correspondent between Paul Freund and Frankfurter.  And, Paul Freund apparently wrote him a letter saying, "Why don't you take Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.] as your law clerk next year."  And, Frankfurter wrote him back and said, you know, "When I heard a lot about him, when I was up at the anniversary at Harvard.  But the guy that, you know, is doing my selection is Henry Hart [Henry M. Hart, Jr.]."  And, so, Paul Freund must have spoken to Henry Hart.  And, Henry Hart called me and asked me did I wanna be a law clerk to Frankfurter.  And, I said, "Yes."  And, then he hung the phone up and for two months I didn't hear anything from him.  And, I'd getting worried because I knew I was supposed to start work the first of September.  But, you know, I had no paper and no interview with Frankfurter or anything.  And, so, I called Paul Freund and said, you know, "Could you find out?"  So, he called Hart.  Hart said, "Gee, that Coleman must not be as bright as you said he was because once I asked him, he said, 'Yes,' do you think I would then tell him no?"  And, so, that's how I got the job.
Story_ID: 568956
Speaker 1: Now whose steps were you following in?  Had there been other blacks clerking for the [U.S.] Supreme Court justices at that point?  Had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  I was the first one.
Speaker 1: That's what I am saying.
Speaker 2: Not only that, but believe it or not, after me there wasn't another one for twenty-three years.  When a guy named [HistoryMaker] Tyrone Brown became law--he finished Cornell [Cornell Law School, Ithaca, New York] he was law clerk to, to Chief Justice Earl Warren.  And, after the third one, there was Karen Hastie Williams [HistoryMaker Karen Williams] who clerked for Thurgood Marshall.
Speaker 1: So, how, how was it, first of all, this is the court of courts.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, that was a great year.  I've never had a year like that.
Speaker 1: And, it's before Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].
Speaker 2: Before Brown, yeah, before Brown.  And, we, you know, we worked on cases.  Elliot Richardson [Elliot Lee Richardson] was the other law clerk.  So, we had that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, the two of you went in together?
Speaker 2: Went together.  We were together, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so, you started, you met the first day (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  That's right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and then you ended up--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: --clerking--?
Speaker 2: Then we clerked together, and worked together.
Speaker 1: And, did Frankfurter [Felix Frankfurter]--did he have two clerks?  You were the two clerks?
Speaker 2: Two clerks.  Yeah, we, two clerk--
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were the two clerks?
Speaker 2: Yeah, very, I--most of them had two clerks.  The chief had four clerks.  I think Black [Hugo Black] had only one clerk.  But--
Speaker 1: And, who was chief of the court then?  That was--?
Speaker 2: When we started, it was Vinson [Fred M. Vinson]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Chief Justice Vinson, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 568957
Speaker 1: And, talk about the work of a clerk and what Frankfurt--you know, 'cause each experience is based on the judge (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, ours was different.  In the first place, Frankfurter [Felix Frankfurter] read all of his petitions for cert [certiorari] himself, so we didn't have to do that.  Well, that didn't mean that sometimes he didn't say, "Gee, why didn't you look at this?"  And, also I can't say that I wrote an opinion which he then rewrote or something.  We just worked together and he would say, "What do you think about this, what do you think about this, what about this?"  And, then that become that dramatic time when he was sit in his chair and we'd be on two sides of 'em; the three of us would put together an opinion and finally get it done.  The other parts of the job were great.  Then, the court [U.S. Supreme Court] didn't start 'til twelve o'clock.  And, each day Frankfurter would've walked from Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] to the old state department building [Old Executive Office Building; Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Washington, D.C.] with Dean Acheson and they would've talked about all the policies going on and everything.  And, then Frankfurter a come to the court and he, for now, he'd say what action talked about so you knew what was going on there.  And, there be a lot of people that visit Frankfurter so you'd get a lot of conversation there.  I mean, it was just a give and take, back and forth.  And, we, you know, we, we had, we had more cases then.  It's a, you know, very important cases so, that we were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like what?
Speaker 2: Well, one was the case of dealing with Chicago [Illinois]--no, Illinois had a rule that to get on the ballot, you had to get a certain number of signatures in a certain number to states.  And, Wallace [George Wallace] was trying to get on the ballot in Illinois to run for president.  And, the question was whether the statute was constitutional or not.  We, we held that it was.  We also had the Wolf versus Colorado case [Wolf v. Colorado, 1949] which then held--the issue was whether if you seized evidence illegally, could you use it in a state court proceeding.  And, the case as it already held, you can't use it in a federal court proceeding, Weeks v. U--or, U.S. versus Weeks, or Weeks versus U.S. [Weeks v. United States, 1914]. And, we wrote sixty-three that you could use it.  That got overruled later in Arizona versus something case [Arizona v. Evans, 1995], overruled that.  And, and then we had some antitrust cases; very important, and other cases dealing with different issues, I mean--I got a whole book there.  You wanna see the book?  It's over there.
Story_ID: 568958
Speaker 1: How did this experience clerking differ from serving on the Law Review [Harvard Law Review]?  I mean, you know, 'cause you're in--and the only reason I say that is, you know, law school, you know, it's the, you're still a student, you know, and thinking you're practicing.  But, then here you are, you end up, you know, in the highest court of the land [U.S. Supreme Court] and you're seeing the, you know, not only just legal theory being played out at the highest levels but the politics of the court itself.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, yeah, it defi- but, you know, you--but you put together in the end there's an opinion and you realize that, you know, it's important opinions or, or and you, you know, learn something about the other just--I remember once, I was walking down the hallway and Justice Black [Hugo Black] said, "Why don't come and see me Mr. Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.]?"  So, I go in there, he spends about a half hour trying to convince me that Frankfurter [Felix Frankfurter] is wrong in a particular case.  What he's gonna do is against what Black wants to do.  And, I finally say, "Well, gee Mr. Justice, if you will repeat again those last ten words you said, I think you will convince yourself you're wrong."  (Laughter) So at that point he said, "Well, why don't you, you better go back to the other office."  And, he told Frankfurter on the next day, said, "Well, that Coleman is very, very relaxed guy," you know.  But, then we, we still remain friendly.  He was very, very good.  And, so, and we worked with the other clerks.  It was a great experience.  I mean, you just, you just couldn't--there's nothing been like that since, you know, in my experience that--and Frankfurter was a very bright guy and had some interesting cases.  We had another case which was, guess I would--wrongly decided were on a Michigan statute which said that a woman couldn't be a bartender unless it was owned by her husband or by her father [Goesaert v. Cleary, 1948].  And, we held six to three.  That statute was constitutional.  I'm pretty sure today people will say it's unconstitutional.  So, we, we had a--
Speaker 1: Now, Frankfurter was an advocate of judicial restraint.  Was that, were you of a similar mind as well with that?
Speaker 2: Well, 'cause I'd only been out of law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] a year so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, I hadn't--
Speaker 1: Well, I--
Speaker 2: I don't whether I am.  I still don't know.  No, he, no, I think the interesting things was, you know, once I knew I had the job I read about everything he'd ever written.  And, obviously, a time he'd done the, for the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] and he'd also been active sometime in helping the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] on cases.  And, so, I was surprised that once he got to be a justice that some of the theories and arguments he had then, he didn't carry that matter as a justice, you know, he thought there was more of for restraint and that sort of thing.  But, on the other hand, I had a feeling that if and when he ever got hit with the school desegregation case, he'd probably, you know, decide it the right way.  Although, it would be very difficult for him because he, you know, would feel that it was gonna cause great upbeat in the country and therefore, you know, how do you do it.  And, I think some of the other justice said, "You just can't do this, you know, the country will explode," so.  But, no, he was a, but, no, but he was very, very good.  But, you, you know, you learn how to think like him.  And, you could eventually argue with his way and get 'em done.  And, I also knew that he thought that, oh, Brandeis [Louis Brandeis] and Holmes [Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.] seldom, if ever, made a mistake.  And, if I could find that opinion that they had, I would be able to convince him that maybe I was right and he was wrong.  On the other hand, for some reason, he thought he had to convince me that Justice Taney [Roger B. Taney] who had writ Dred Scott [Dred Scott v. Sandford, 1857] was not the worst guy in the world.  And, he would constantly be asking me to read opinions that, that Taney had written before.  Like, habeas corpus cases or interstate commerce cases where it showed that he was a, you know, much more rational guy than he was at Dred Scott.  So, I, so I got a good education.
Story_ID: 568959
Speaker 1: So you spend a year clerking and this is a, it's a life changing experience.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, can you tell me though, physically how the court [U.S. Supreme Court] is sort of laid out?  I hear there's a gym on the--
Speaker 2: The top floor, yeah.
Speaker 1: Top floor.
Speaker 2: Where Mr. Justice White [Byron R. White] used to have us up there sometime playing basket--he's a great basketball player.  And, we--top floor there, yeah.  And, then there's a printing shop on the, in the ba--it was then, basement.  So, all the printing was done in the court itself.  And, the chambers--I mean, Frankfurter [Felix Frankfurter] didn't sit in where his office was.  He'd sit in the center beca- and he'd have his secretary on one side and we, and the law clerks had his office because he wanted to be in the middle.  And, so we, we had much better offices than he had.  And, very, very good.  And, then, you know, everybody took care of you and the valets.  I mean, I learned that every justice has a black valet then, which served me well.  Well, well, served Thurgood Marshall well sometime later when we had the Aaron versus Cooper [Cooper v. Aaron, 1958] case which is the case dealing with the Little Rock [Arkansas].  And, as you know, that case came up through the Eighth Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit].  And, Justice Whittaker [Charles Evans Whittaker] was the justice for the Eighth Circuit.  And, the [U.S.] Supreme Court was adjourned for the summer, and we had to get a stay out of Whittaker.  And, when we drew the papers and we went to the court, nobody knew where Whittaker was.  And, we had searched and searched and finally Marshall said to me, "Well, Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.], you're dumb as hell.  Don't you realize that every justice has a black valet?  So, why don't you get on the phone and start calling all these ministers and find out who his valet is?"  So, about an hour and a half later, we found out who his valet was.  And, we talked to the valet and the valet said, "At ten o'clock in the morning, I put him on a train at Union Station [Washington, D.C.] and he's going to California 'cause the bar association [American Bar Association] is meeting there."  And, Thurgood at that point got an airplane, flew into Nebraska.  He gets off in Nebraska and he has this picture and the Pullman train, he says, "Is this guy on the train?"  The guy says, "Yes, he's in, he's in cabin number eight."  So, that's how we got him to sign those papers.  So, you know, so, so I, but I learned that because I knew he had a valet.
Story_ID: 568960
Speaker 1: Now, Mr. Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.], how was it working, you know, and clerking in the [U.S.] Supreme Court when, you know, you would leave there and you were in segregated Washington [D.C.]?  Did that have any, was that--?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, that was just terrible.  Well, actually, interesting because in the court itself--well, you know there's a din- of dining room there.  Well, they had, not, you know, they have a cafeteria there.  I think from my observation at that time, the valets and messengers would all eat in one corner.  Now, whether that's the only place, I don't know.  But, as a law clerk I, you know, would join the other law clerks.  But, I remember there was a day when it was a semi-holiday because the cafeteria was closed.  The cafeteria at whosoever mission was closed and the only and so you couldn't get any place to eat there.  And, I was working with Justice Frankfurter [Felix Frankfurter] on an opinion and Elliot [Elliot Lee Richardson] knocked on the door and said, "The law clerks had decided to go down to the Mayflower [Mayflower Hotel, Washington, D.C.] for lunch, will you join us?"  And, I said, "Well, give me another twelve minutes and I'll come."  So, when I came out about twenty minutes later, Elliott said, "Well, gee it's kind of late, why don't we just go down to the railroad station and eat?"  And, I went down there, we ate, come back.  And, then I'd noticed about an hour later that both Elliot and Frankfurter were in tears because Elliot apparently had told Frankfurter that he had called and asked the Mayflower, would there be a problem.  And, then Mayflower said, "Well, we don't take any blacks."  And, so that's why, you know, (unclear).  I've always felt that that was the basis of a case that the court decided four years later called Thompson versus the District of Columbia [District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co., 1953].  Which is the case which says that there's an ordinance which was enacted some time in 1880, but was kept out of the code.  And, that's, but, that's still was applicable even though when the codes adopted, that [U.S.] Congress had said, "That all the ordinance are in the code."  And, I always thought that Frankfurter was so affected by that.  And, I've also seen something in the 'Simple Justice' ['Simple Justice: The History of Brown v. Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality,' Richard Kluger] where the guys says that when that case was up there, that Justice Reed [Stanley Forman Reed] who was from Tennessee [sic. Kentucky], I think, said, "You mean to tell me that a black person will be able to sit in the same room with my wife if they wanna have lunch?"  So, so, it meant that there was some tension on the courts.  I always felt that was one of the things done.  Also, there was another, got Truman Hobbs, Jr. [sic. Truman McGill Hobbs, Sr.] who clerked for Black [Hugo Black] and, and Truman was from Alabama.  And, his father was U.S Congressman Truman Hobbs [sic. Sam Hobbs] who was a very prejudiced guy.  And so, along about 6:30 at night, Truman would say, "Wanna ride home, Bill?"  Then, he'd pick his father up.  And, for the first week it was kind of awkward 'cause his father sat in the back, we'd sit up front.  And, clearly his father really didn't wanna talk to me.  But, we finally got to be so he would talk back and forth.  I lived on, what, I think, seventeen--there's an apartment; I lived there on 17th Street.  And, I just remember that, and he was, you know, he became a, he became a friend even though he was, you know, he, you know, there's a statute 'bout--Hobbs statute [Hobbs Act, 1946], which is a terrible statue.  So, I, you know, certainly got to know.  But, then the greatest thing in the world were, it was something called the House of Truth [Washington, D.C.].  And, that was a house which really had been started by Frankfurter when he was working down here before he got married.  And, each year eight bachelors would rent this house, you know, put up the money for maids and butlers and everything and they would live in this house.  It was in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.].  And, on Sunday starting at eleven o'clock; from eleven to three o'clock, they'd have a brunch.  And, you, if you got invited, you know, it'd be other law clerks there.  But, also some of the Supreme Court justices and cabinet officers, ambassadors and everything and it really was a great experience.  Because then those were the good ol'  days where you could have Scotty Reston [James Reston] and those guys there and you talk about things but it wouldn't be in the newspapers next day.  And, so, that was, that was really, you know, one of the, the great thrills that you really--that's how I got to know Scotty Reston and other people, you know, there, after became good friends.  So, it was a good, good experience.
Speaker 1: But, you were living inside the court and outside two worlds, though, as--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, right, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: And, we go, I would go up to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I remember when Howard Lasky [ph.] came, we, Elliot and I went up to, and Lou Park [ph.], went up to Howard to hear him speak and it was real, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, Elliot was, he was receptive, he, he felt comfortable (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he felt--well, most of 'em did.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: No, no, you know, these guys were young--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they'd been in the war [World War II, WWII] and--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And, some of 'em knew that the blacks had kind of helped them.  And, you know, things were a little different by then.  After the war, you know, people coming back and schools in New England were completely different.
Story_ID: 568961
Speaker 1: When your year is over, you, you're thinking you're gonna go back to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Philadelphia, right?  Because it's your home.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you had trouble finding a job, right?
Speaker 2: I couldn't, nobody would hire me in Philadelphia and, and so finally I called up Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, LLP] because they had indicated before I thought that they, you know, be interested.  And, I called and they said, "Sure, come."  I started on the first of September which meant that I got up at 5:30 every morning in Philadelphia and took the train to New York [New York], worked until about 6:00, and got home about 8:30 at night.  And, you also went to work on Saturday then.  So, I, so (unclear).  So, I did that for three years.
Speaker 1: Now, how large was Paul, Weiss then?
Speaker 2: Paul, Weiss then probably had about twenty partners and maybe thirty associates.
Speaker 1: Small.  Was it considered at that time a silk-stocking firm?  Or, it new--or was it newer?
Speaker 2: It was newer but it was arriving, you know, Garrison was the grandson of Lloyd K. Garrison who'd been the abolitionist [sic.].  Randolph Paul [Randolph E. Paul] was one of the great tax lawyers, and Weiss [Louis S. Weiss] was a very successful person and Wharton [John F. Wharton] was pretty successful who did a lot of corporate work but also represented the people in the theatre and everything.  And, it was, you know, we were, we were no Davis Polk [Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP] and we were no Cravath [Cravath, Swaine and Moore, LLP], but we certainly were thought to me one of the, you know, coming firm.  Today, I would say it's probably ranks at least four or five of the best firms in, in New York (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) New York.  That's right.  Now, when you, so the firm, so you have this thing, so we--are we talking 1948 now?  Are we--?
Speaker 2: We started in 1949.
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 2: September 1, '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Okay, 1949, okay.  And, so what, what is the firm structure that's sort of set up and who are you, you know, how are you as an associate?  How are you given work, I guess (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was, you know, I was given work, well, I did a lot of different type of work.  Well, the first because I had to commute from Philadelphia every day and that cost me thirty-nine dollars a month which, and I was only making about seven thousand dollars then.  I soon found out that Paul, Weiss had a system where each day a different specialty had lunch.  So, I'd get a free lunch.  So, if I, if I did some work for the entertainment people, the corporate people, the litigation people and the other one, and on Friday everybody ate together for one lunch.  And, then on Saturday, some client would usually take you to lunch.  So, I, so, I soon learned that it was to my benefit to be involved in a lot of things.  Number one is I did some work for Cole Porter and I did work for other people.  I did some corporate work and then I represented, well, I was a younger lawyer, but we represented the state of Israel when it had its first bomb issues.  And, I did some of that work.  'Cause I remember every day, I had to rewrite the description of the boundary lines 'cause they were fighting.  And, so, I did that.  But, also after I'd been there about a year and a half is when Thurgood Marshall called me to ask me to come down to see him 'cause they were talking about the Brown case [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  So, I used to often time, you know, leave Paul, Weiss at 4:30 and go there and work 'til 10:00 and I'd take the last train come back, so.  So, that's how I got to work on the Brown case.
Story_ID: 568962
Speaker 1: Were there of the associates that were there, had any others clerked for a [U.S.] Supreme Court justice at that point?
Speaker 2: No, except that soon after I came there [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, LLP] we hired another guy, Lou Pollak [Louis H. Pollak], who had clerked for Rutledge [Wiley Blount Rutledge] and then worked for somebody in the government but that job got over.  And, he'd also had married Louie Weiss' [Louis S. Weiss] daughter.  And, actually, when, when I was living in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and Lou was working in Washington [D.C.] and Katherine's [Katherine Weiss Pollak] here, they often commuted and met at my house, you know, for the weekend.  So, I got to know him well.  So, he came and I took him down with me to work with Thurgood Marshall.  He went on to be professor and dean of Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut].  And, then dean of Penn Law School [University of Pennsylvania Law School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and he's a federal district judge now, so.  But, I, we, I--Lou and I were the only two that were clerks.
Speaker 1: Now, did you find experience working the firm somewhere to clerking or were there other realities, you know, that's (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no.  It's different because you were, you know, you were dealing with clients and obviously you, you got to be sought after if you could do something different.  I remember one instance where they had a corporation and it was two families and each one owned 50 percent of the stock.  And, one family wanted to liquidate the business, the other family didn't.  Well, every year a new associate would be given this matter to see how you could liquidate a corporation where the vote is fifty-fifty, which you can.  Because I had to commute to Philadelphia every day, one day I decided to read the corporate charter.  Well, paragraph four of every corporate charter you've ever read said that the corporation shall have perpetual existence.  This charter for some reason says, "This corporation shall exist for twenty-five years."  And, so I then went in and see Judge Rifkind [Simon Hirsch Rifkind], and said, "Judge, do you realize paragraph--?"  Well, nobody read paragraph four 'cause they just assumed it was the other way.  So, that meant we could liquidate this.  Then I became the fair-head boy.  They thought I was the smartest guy in the world that I finally could liquidate this corporation.  And, we had other cases involving, was when television, 'cause there were two types of gadgets they had.  And, which one, and I worked with Judge Rifkind on that.  And, we also, and let's see, Louie Weiss was the, had been appointment master by the [U.S.] Supreme Court in the case that dealt with whether the northern railroads were engaging in any trust discrimination against the southern producers because their other rate structure that they were doing, and I worked on that with Weiss.  And, I also because--and I know if, with Garrison [Lloyd K. Garrison] and but also because of Garrison sometime would come down to Washington on that (unclear), come down with him and we'd stay with Randolph Paul [Randolph E. Paul], who's a tax lawyer.  I got to know him, so we tried a tax case together.  And, but, so I really did a lot of, a lot of different things.
Story_ID: 568963
Speaker 1: So, this was really, I mean, in many ways, your dream.  You were, I mean, it was corporate law.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was doing what I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did--
Speaker 1: You were, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was doing what I wanna do then.
Speaker 1: You were doing and then at the same time--
Speaker 2: And, I was all working on the Brown case [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], so I--
Speaker 1: No, that's what--I mean, you had both--
Speaker 2: Both sides, yeah.
Speaker 1: You had both things going on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, I had both things going.
Speaker 1: And, then let me ask 'cause just--so Thurgood Marshall is trying to assemble a te- you know, a team, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he did.  Yeah, he did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because really there's not a lot of precedent to fall on.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Had no precedent, had five cases--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's all just the opposite.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, he's at the, you know, NAACP Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] and he--so, what, tell us, tell us how he put together his team.  Was it just like asking, you know, trying to get people?  Was he convinced--
Speaker 2: No, no, he had, he had one, he had, you know, Constance--
Speaker 1: Robert?
Speaker 2: Motley [Constance Baker Motley], and Bob Carter [HistoryMaker Robert L. Carter], and Jack Greenberg, and Jimmy Nabrit, Jr. [James M. Nabrit, Jr.]  They were full-time there.  There other, a few other people that he had.  I brought in Lou Pollak [Louis H. Pollak].  I also brought in Charlie Duncan [HistoryMaker Charles T. Duncan] who was Todd Duncan's son.  And, then Paul Freund [Paul A. Freund] was involved.  And, then he had some people from Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut].  And, at that time, even Bill Hastie [William H. Hastie] was on the Third Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit].  At the beginning he felt he could sit in on some of these 'cause he was there, and then Bob Ming [William Robert Ming, Jr.] who was from Chicago [Illinois].  And, so we had about twenty people and we worked, you know, day and night doing it.  Then, Saturdays and Sunday getting it done.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what were the, what were the, you think, seminal moments in the history, you know, of the Brown versus Board in those, you know, early days of preparation, in your mind?
Speaker 2: Well, it depends.  I mean, have you ever read 'Simple Justice' ['Simple Justice: The History of Brown v. Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality,' Richard Kluger]?
Speaker 1: I've read some of it.  I haven't read all of it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Read all of 'Simple Justice.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean--
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: He's does the job better--no, but, it was really tough because you, you had to have a double strategy which was one, that these facilities were not equal.  And, also, that even if they were equal that segregation per se made 'em bad.  Because--and, you couldn't lose on ether one of 'em.  And, and, so, that was one other thing.  Next thing was, to make sure that the cases, when you lost them or won 'em in the court below, that the [U.S.] Supreme Court would clearly have to take 'em.  So, that brought in the three judge court play.  And, then, the big thing was not to make arguments which would help you on point A, but kill you on point B.  So, you know, the, the discipline of a lawyer as to what he ought not to say, or she are not to say, is as important as to what should say.  And, that's, so, that, those were basically it.  And, then to do all the legislative history of all the states about what been done and those were some of the issues.  And, of course, then we got around to the second part which was the decree which we had to work on.  And, that, that was a separate thing, but, you know, they sat the case down for re-argument for that, and that's what we did.  But, we worked hard on that.  I remember we started in 1950, and I don't think we filed those lawsuits until '51 [1951].  So, it was, you know, it was really backed--and Marshall was great.  Marshall was a good listener.  And, he--but he always commanded that room.  I mean, you know, you got the brightest people there.  At the end there was people who say, "Well, Thurgood, what do you think?"  And, he was, you know, he a much more able person and most people give him credit for.  And, so they were, they were a lot.  And, then there was, you know, some good time.  You got to know people that you felt you had something in common.  And, some of 'em became friends and still are friends.
Speaker 1: But, you were working towards the common good too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, you know, there's a lot of ego involved (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Well, we would, he had to be an arbiter of ego.  Was he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was able to do that.
Speaker 2: He was basically able to--oh, no, yeah, but that was really, you know, but I don't think the young student today realizes the extent to which that was a skillful task and one of which when it started didn't necessarily have to come out the way it did.  I mean, we could've lost that case (laughter) that'd been terrible if we had.  So, he, and he, we really--but, it was really, but that 'Simple Justice' says the story as well as anything.
Story_ID: 568964
Speaker 1: Mr. Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.], what, were you able to give any insight having, you know, sat on, you know, been in the [U.S.] Supreme Court?  I mean, it's different appearing before the court than being behind the scenes.  We you able to, you know--?
Speaker 2: Well, if I could, I couldn't tell you.  But, just--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm no dummy.  Put it that way.  I mean, I figure--I knew what the issues were and I knew how to get it.  And, I, and I knew which justices were those would be hard, and I knew what you had to say to some others, so, and, I could pretty much predict what the vote would be--although, I didn't know that I didn't know Earl Warren, you know, but that was a--of course, when the case was first there before we sat down for re-argument, the chief justice was Vinson [Fred M. Vinson]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, he'd written the restricted covenant cases.  But, then he decided Barrows versus Jackson [Barrows et al. v. Jackson, 1953] which--and, he decided the other way and that--so, he didn't quite know what he would do.  And, it was tough 'cause you knew you had Reed [Stanley Forman Reed] who was from the South.  And, we by that time had enough suspicious with Black [Hugo Black] that he being a good boy from Alabama there was limit to which he would go.  And, later on his cases stand up to back, backtrack from what he was before.  And, so, it was a very interesting time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, you're balancing the time at, you--at Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, LLP]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And, the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], yeah.
Speaker 1: And, the Legal Defense Fund for, now you were, but, wait a minute, you were at Paul, Weiss three years, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well--
Speaker 1: And, then, but by the time the case--
Speaker 2: I was--then I was in Dilworth [Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish and Levy; Dilworth Paxson LLP, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 1: Got real--you were Goodrich [Herbert F. Goodrich]--
Speaker 2: In the Dilworth, the Dilworth, no, the Dilworth firm.
Speaker 1: Oh, Dilworth, I'm sorry Dilworth.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dilworth.
Speaker 1: That's right, Dilworth.
Speaker 2: I was at--back, going back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, why, why that, and why do you say you can't, you couldn't tell me anyway?  Just because?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, suppose that was what happened--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That year, you know.  Was that Las Vegas [Nevada], if--what's happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Las Vegas. Okay, so you can point me to 'Simple Justice' ['Simple Justice: The History of Brown v. Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality,' Richard Kluger] on that one, right (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 568965
Speaker 1: Basically there was a lot of strategizing.  Because it's a different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, oh yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --thing when you're trying to establish, you know, precedence where there's not much to hang your hat on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, another thing I write, I got a classmate [from Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in every state in the South to do the research for what the state had done.  And, so, that was very valuable 'cause you, they picked up a lot of documents you normally you wouldn't pick up.  And, we found out we always thought was one of the very persuasive thing that except for Tennessee, because Tennessee never completely receded--succeeded from the Union.  And, also, Tennessee, Vice President Johnson [Andrew Johnson] was from Tennessee.  And, so, when he became president because Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] got assassinated five days after the end of the Civil War and he didn't want this anyway.  Tennessee got back in the Union without this.  But, every other state to get back in the Union you first had to show that they not only adopted the Fourteenth Amendment but they had not adopted any other laws, or they had repealed the laws which segregated.  And, a lot of the states after they succeeded from the Union had said, "Blacks can't go to school at all," or they went to segregated schools.  We found out that in every state when the Civil War is over and [U.S.] Congress proposed a statute which says you can't come back in unless you adopt the Fourteenth Amendment.  But, you also have to certify that there's no law you have which conflicted it.  Every state had repealed the statutes that it adopted, then adopted the Fourteenth Amendment, then re-enacted these statutes.  And, so, most of the schools, the laws in the South would provide for segregation were statutes which were enacted after the Fourteenth Amendment adopted.  But had been repealed and we thought that was some of the good evidence that shows that, you know, they knew what the hell they were doing.  That these, that these statutes really, you know, violate the Fourteenth Amendment.  So, that was all.
Story_ID: 568966
Speaker 1: Tell me the different roles that, you know, people sort of played.  Can you just go over that a little bit?  I mean, so you're saying that you got one of the things you did besides, you know, having inside knowledge of the court that no one had, okay, of that team?  You also had the, you know, members of your law school class [from Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], from the South--
Speaker 2: Yeah, from the South to do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do this, do this research?
Speaker 2: To do this.  I know we did other thing but read--there's certain pages of 'Simple Justice,' ['Simple Justice: The History of Brown v. Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality,' Richard Kluger] read and you'll see what at least, they thought I did.  No, really, no we did a lot and we--
Speaker 1: What role did Bob Ming [William Robert Ming, Jr.] play?
Speaker 2: Oh, Bob was very good though--and one of the things he wanted to do, he made the argument that race is really a religion.  And, therefore, if they segregated you that they were violating your religion.  So, therefore, they were violating the First Amendment which by that time had been said to apply also to the state.  And, that--and also, there were several United Nations [UN] treaties or something which said you can't discriminate on the basis of religion.  And, so, he wanted to make that argument but we kind of backed him off of that because there were cases which had kind of backed off--backed off of that themselves.  And, that was one of, that's one of the issues that we had.  Also, Ken Clark [Kenneth Clark]--
Speaker 1: Brian [ph.]--
Speaker 2: And Bob Carter [HistoryMaker Robert L. Carter] was--them dolls, which I always said that that was the dumbest thing in the world but--
Speaker 1: You did?  You thought (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  I was always against the dolls.  I always thought, they always thought Ken Clark and Bob Carter always gave me up when the case [Briggs v. Elliott, 1952] was decided because they thought that what won again 'cause in foot--that famous footnote the first article they cite is the article by Clark.  And, that shows that the just--I said, "Come on.  It's only because the lawyer you said, you cite articles according to the alphabet and Clark is--was the first name."  But, it, so we, so we had a lot of--you outta talk to Bob Carter, he'll tell you.  But, I always thought that was crazy.  Although most people thought it was good.
Speaker 1: Well, there has been a lot of discussion about the role of that research (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, basically can you restate the theory about the dolls for, you know, for just that.
Speaker 2: Well, the dolls were, that Ken Clark had made the study which said that when black kids went to segregated school, it adversely affected the way they could learn.  And, he had some theory that if you gave a kid a doll which was black, he didn't like the doll.  If the doll was white, they would hug it, you know.  I said, "Well, that--you know."  But anyway, but I hear you've been through all that.  But, it was a--so, we--that's one of the things that we played down.  I mean, what ended up is what they wanted was much more, so we had a lot of big fights about that.
Story_ID: 568967
Speaker 1: So, now, the role of [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin.
Speaker 2: Well, he--Marshall [Thurgood Marshall] depended upon him to, not only to collect the historians who could help us, but even more important to correct them and decide what they say, whether it was right or not.  And, I know there was one guy, whose name I can't remember, from North Carolina who was very good that he used.  And, John was really, he really knew what he was talking about.  And, he--part of the briefs he wrote and he did a good job.
Speaker 1: But, really tell, can you just, this was as in, you know, other cases but this brought together how many different types of disciplines?  Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], let's--maybe that's what I'm trying to, you know--?
Speaker 2: Well, you had, you had, you had historians.  And, then you had, who's the guy, named Davis [ph.] who taught at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] I think, who was very helpful.  Then, you have the psychology with Ken Clark [Kenneth Clark].  Then you have the constitutional law, you have federal jurisdiction and you have a lot of other things.  Then, you really have, which was very important, how do you manage the press, because we did not know when we started whether the national press would be with us or against us.  Because, you know, you didn't know how it'd come out.  And, you also, when we started didn't know whether who--the president of the United States would be for us or against us.  Or, but, the assistant general would do, so you had to know how to work those issues and it was, it took a lot of different people.  And, at some point you also had to begin the get the business people to realize this was a change that should be made.  And, I don't think it happened there but later, you know, when we get around to the Michigan school case [Grutter v. Bollinger, 2003], I think that what won that is the brief that the officer's filed talking about the need for, you know, affirmative action, that sort of thing.  Now the [U.S.] Army people, I thought that brief was the most persuasive of all the briefs.  And, I've heard some of the justices say that.  But, those are the things you need.
Story_ID: 568968
Speaker 1: Now, so, Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] was--there were five cases involved in Brown (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, five.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell which five cases they were?
Speaker 2: Well, one was from South Carolina [Briggs v. Elliott, 1952], one was from Virginia [Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 1954], one was from the District of Columbia [Bolling v. Sharpe, 1954], one was from Kansas [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], and the other one was from Delaware [Gebhart v. Belton, 1952].  The Delaware case was won below.  And, it was the state that was appealing that one.  The other four was all lost below.  The Kansas case, after looking at those dolls admitted that those dolls were persuasive.  But, so, that still doesn't make any different that you still could segregate.  The Virginia case looked at the dolls and said, this is much evidence against it as it is for it.  So, therefore, we don't find it's a fact that it does have that adverse effect on the children.  And, I guess, the South Carolina case said the dolls had no effect at all.  And, that's, and the Delaware case we'd won below so we didn't have that problem.
Story_ID: 568969
Speaker 1: So, you said that the last, I think you were saying the last week, Thurgood [Thurgood Marshall] stayed at your house.
Speaker 2: No.  I said, we supposed to stayed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were roommates?
Speaker 2: We were roommates at the Wardman Park Hotel [Washington Marriott Wardman Park, Washington, D.C.].  We had a suite.  We, you know, we had a big suite.  But, yeah, so we--and also (laughter), we, I guess about two weeks before, we were there for about two weeks, that we used to get a cake every night.  And, this black guy would bring this cake, knock on the door, open, I say, "Give me the cake."  And, we'd eat the cake, cake was good cake.  We then, we also, on the day before or the night before the argument, the guy said, "Gee, Mr. Marshall, can you get me a seat tomorrow at the argument?"  And, Thurgood said, "Well, I don't think I can, you know, I'll busy, but I'll see what I can do."  So, the guy comes back about three hours later said, "That's all right, you don't have to worry about that Mr. Marshall, I know you're busy."  Well, we go there to argue the case, the guy is sitting in where the justice's friend sit.  It was Chief Justice Warren's [Earl Warren] valet and his wife [Nina Elisabeth Palmquist Warren] was the one that would cook this cake (laughter) because they lived in the Wardman Park Hotel.  So, that was, so that was helpful, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, talk about that day of the argument for you, you know, you're sitting next to, you say, Thurgood Marshall.  What was that day like?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a great day.  It, no, really a great day.  And, I would say that the guy on the other side, principal guy is John W. Davis, of Davis Polk [Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP], and assistant general of United States.  But, also was the Democratic nominee for president in the 1924 election made a superb argument.  I think everybody said, you know, he was really good.  But, Marshall made even a better argument and won that, you know, at those, he knew when to get almost emotional.  But, when to play it cool and, you know, just as a lawyer.  And, I think he made, no, it was when--I think any law student worthy of the name of being a lawyer, you ought to read that whole argument.  'Cause it was, I think it was one of the best arguments I've ever heard.  It was very good.
Story_ID: 568970
Speaker 1: What was the essence of Thurgood [Thurgood Marshall]?  I mean, you had a long relationship with him, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know him for years.  I mean, he's iconic in that, you know, that's how people, but not many people, you know, knew him.  I mean, you know, I interviewed, I had interviewed Bob Carter [HistoryMaker Robert L. Carter] but, who worked with him for years, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but Bob--
Speaker 1: Wasn't a staff person?
Speaker 2: By that time they, they were not--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Buddy, buddy.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: But, Bob is a nice guy--
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's right.  So, I was just wondering if you have any sort of anecdotal stories about, you know, sort of him and--?
Speaker 2: No.  The only story I have is that, we got in the cab to go to court and on the way down, I said, "You know, Mr. Marshall, you really gotta be great.  You gotta be as good as Toussaint L'Ouverture was when he defeated those French at Haiti."  And, and Marshall said, "You still don't get it Coleman [HistoryMaker Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.].  We gotta be better than that.  We gotta be as good as Henry IV was at the battle," the battle at--what the name of, come on it begins with a W, it's the great battle the British had.
Speaker 1: Waterloo?  Bulge, no, no that's too late.  Battle (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: Bulge.  No, no, that's too late.  Wait, battle--
Speaker 2: This is--no, this is for--it was about fourteen--
Speaker 1: Battle.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well, it's a battle, there's a battle--
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter), no problem, wrong century.
Speaker 2: It's in my book.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Wrong century.
Speaker 2: I'll look it up in the book, it's in the book.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden] you, can you help us?  Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): I'm on it.
Speaker 1: No, no, there's a, but there's a battle, you know, where, where that great speech that, that people who's still in England will remember something.  Oh, come on this is a, come on, you never had, you never read 'Henry IV' [William Shakespeare]?  Come on.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  A long time ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well--
Speaker 2: Long time ago, too.
Speaker 1: All right, well anyway, look at 'Henry IV' now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, you know, and so that's it.  But, then when we go to the court, the cab driver said, "You two gentlemen realize that you don't--never told me where you were going? But, Mr. Marshall I knew where you had to be at twelve o'clock (laughter)."  And, so, that's how we got into court (laughter).  No really, so we were, you know, he was and know he was really tense.  It really, you know, really as to--you were too young to remember those days.  But, it was really a great time.  No, and he did a masterful job.
Story_ID: 568971
Speaker 1: Did you get any political pressure?  I mean, was there, the politics sort of nug--you know, trying to infiltrate or--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think, I don't think so, we caught, you know, obviously, we didn't know how Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] was gonna come up but he finally debriefed, you know, supported our position.  But, there was, you know, there's certainly this southern governors thought we were wrong as hell.  And, you did have the problem that I think a lot of the black teachers in the South didn't want it to happen 'cause they thought they lose their job.  And, you know, it was a, and there were some people that just, and, and well I, I mean, I can't say but there were some people who were friends who were not, you know, thought we were on the wrong track.  So, that's that, but, it was just one of the--read, read 'Simple Justice' ['Simple Justice: The History of Brown v. Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality,' Richard Kluger].
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, but the teachers did lose their, a lot of those teacher (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --actually end up did--
Speaker 2: Well, and also the principals or you know, or at one time you had a person would be principal of the public schools and--of superintendent other than black and they, some of 'em, a lot of people lost their job, yeah.
Story_ID: 568972
Speaker 1: You know, there'd been a lot of discussion about the, you know, the ruling [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] in all deliberate, you know, with the ta- the line, "In all deliberate speed," you know.  Do you think you understood that at the time?  Whether you think there was great understanding of--?
Speaker 2: Well, there were, there was, there was great, there was great misunderstanding.  And, what all deliberate speed meant because, what, it's 19--2006 now, and a lot of school are desegregated so, you know, and it was tough.  And, obviously they--we did have two opinions.  One was the Morton Salt case [United States v. Morton Salt Co., 1950] which says clearly that if somebody violates the law you have the right to make 'em end it immediately and the state could also make the violator do things which otherwise the violator wouldn't have to do.  And, so, that's, so that, that was it and I had made a proposal to the, to Marshall [Thurgood Marshall] to handle the matter differently which he didn't follow.  But, at the end of which I agree with what he did.  But, I thought that if, if we had done something else, we'd probably could've done a little better than we did.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your, what was your--?
Speaker 2: Well, my provision was, was to say that you've said that this is illegal.  Two, you gotta recognize that the life of a child for schooling is from the, is twelve years.  I did not put kindergarten in 'cause I've always been suspicious of thirteen; so, I--twelve years.  And, what you should do is go to court and tell the court that the governor of the state and/or the attorney general can, have to file a plan and it could start in the twelfth grade and desegregate downward.  Or, it could start in the first grade descend upward, or if it would say, we'll start at the twelfth and first grade, you give 'em an extra year and leave it up to them to do it.  Well, if you'd done that and then if the governor and the attorney general has to be the done to make the decision, that they will have made a difference.  But, you know, we, people, everybody in the firm said, you can't do that 'cause you can't admit that once it's a violation that people can take their time to end it.  And, so, as a result of that, we got what we got, which I don't think it certainly has not be as effective as it should be.
Speaker 1: Right.  Because there was no time period or ways (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No time period.  And, nothing ever got done and you didn't, you know, recognize the real problems which is the, is, as--oh, I lost the case four to four so I can't say anything.  But, in the Richmond school case [School Board of the City of Richmond v. State Board of Education of Virginia, 1973] where the judge below said that you can't desegregate these schools only by using Richmond [Virginia].  And, you have to bring in the force around the county and the court, hell no, you can't make 'em do that.  Or, the San Antonio case [San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 1973] where Marshall filed a dissent.  He lost it six to three.  That if you have, or you did in parts of Texas, a school district which was so poor that it couldn't afford it, that the state would have to have another taxing plan so that school districts have enough money.  If you've been able to get those two things through, I think that we would've probably been better off than we are today.
Speaker 1: But, that, that, okay.  Because really what it, what it left to was doing things legislatively on the state level?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  And, doing cases, keep continue to do cases--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  But, if you've given them some incentive, you know, something.  When you catch a guy doing wrong, if you say, well, if you decide to cooperate with me, I'll give you extra time.  That's tends to appeal, you know.  Or, you tell a guy, if you did something wrong if you don't plead guilty, I'm gonna give you twenty years.  But, if you plead guilty so you could testify against somebody else, I'll give you five years.  A lot of people would take the five.  Even if nobody wants to go to jail for five--and I just think that psychologically that we never got that into the process.
Story_ID: 568973
Speaker 1: Now, the other question I wanna ask, why did you leave Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, LLP] then to go?  Was it the commute?  Or, was it--?
Speaker 2: No.  I always wanted to practice law in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you wanted to, so aft--you didn't, so it was the commute that was killing you?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  Generally, I wanted to be a Philadelphia lawyer.  You know, I was born there, I'd grown up there, and I had a lot of classmates who were there and doing quite well.  And, I enjoyed New York [New York], and I, you know, and it just so happened that, what had happened Richardson Dilworth who was Democrat, got elected to be district attorney of Philadelphia and he asked me to become his first assistant.  And, I think he did that, or found out about me because he'd gone down to see Judge Goodrich [Herbert F. Goodrich] said, "Do you know any bright young people?"  And, so Goodrich said, you know, "Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.]."  And, I went over to see him and I listened to him and I'd pretty much said that I would do it.  Well, then he called me two days later and said, "I got a problem and you better come over tomorrow."  When I went over the next day as I went through his outer office, there were four black people there.  One was Austin Norris [J. Austin Norris], Charlie Baker [Charles Baker], Cunningham [Luther Cunningham], and who's the guy who's was a congressman; Bill Gray's father [William H. Gray, Jr.].  And, and Mr. Dilworth said that, they'd said that, they found out he was gonna make me first assistant that he knew that I was Republican and hadn't helped in the campaign.  But, that they would go along with it if he would say that they were the ones who came in to recommend it.  At that, by that time, I figured I didn't want the job.  So, I said something dumb, I said, "Well, I don't think you should ever have to be beholden to somebody taking a public job, I don't want that."  And, Mr. Dilworth said, "Well, I really think you ought to grow up Mr. Coleman" (laughter).  "In life you gotta make compromise." So, I said, "No, I just can't do it."  So, I went back to New York.  And, the next day he called me and said, "My partners and I would like you to join my law firm."  So, that's how I got to the Dilworth firm [Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish and Levy; Dilworth Paxson LLP, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 568974
Speaker 1: So, now how was that experience there?  You stayed at that firm how long you, you were--?
Speaker 2: Well, I got there in about '53 [1953] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 2: Or, '52 [1952], '53 [1953] I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I stayed there until 1975.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I--yeah.
Speaker 1: And, so, just talk, well, okay, that's, I mean, that's actually; that was a long time.  You stayed there until actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and I, at the end I was a senior partner in charge of all litigation and also they'd put my name in the firm, so I had to a good--
Speaker 1: And, at that time, you were the first black to really, well, even before with Pau Wei- [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP]--you were the first black hired into a white--?
Speaker 2: I would think so.
Speaker 1: Black--white firm (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I think, yeah, I think I, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay, period.
Speaker 2: As far as I know in New York [New York], they had never had hired a--and when I joined the Dilworth firm [Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish and Levy; Dilworth Paxson LLP, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] that was true there, too.  I came in as an associate.  I became a partner about three years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a quick time to become partner.  In that--
Speaker 2: Well, I was, but I was--
Speaker 1: You think, you think Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] helped in that way?  The Brown case (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I don't it helped but I would--we did a lot of the good work and-
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --and actually Walter, Walter Annenberg was very helpful.  You know, he was the owner of The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia Daily News, and TV Guide, and Official Detective in the--and he, you know, knew that I was coming.  Actually, when I was coming I found out after 'cause Mr. Dilworth [Richardson Dilworth] told me.  Although, some people say this is not true, that all the secretary's said they were gonna quit.  And, and Mr. Dilworth came over and told 'em, you know, "I think he's a good lawyer, you better stay a watch how he performs.  And, if he, and if you quit I think I can get somebody that's good as you."  And, I afterward found out, according to Mr. Dilworth that Walter Annenberg had found out that I was coming, and he found out then the trouble and he told the Dilworth, "Well, if you don't keep him, I'm not gonna keep my legal business with you," so I, so, he felt indebted to Annenberg.
Speaker 1: That's--had you known Annenberg before that?
Speaker 2: Never known him.  Never--knew of him, but never met, never met 'em and I've always felt that the, the compensation was years later, we both got an honorary degree at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] the same day, so we (unclear).  But, we, and he, we became good friends, I did a lot of legal work him so--

Speaker 1: Can you talk about the practice that you built [at Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish and Levy; Dilworth Paxson LLP, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?  You know, 'cause you were at the firm basically twenty years, twenty and over, twenty years.  Can you talk about, you know, because you had always wanted to, you know, do corporate law.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I did like corporate law.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your--some of your clients might like to know, you know, your--
Speaker 2: Well, like, well, Insurance Company of North America is now CIGNA, Pan Am [Pan American World Airways], which has got a business now, the Philadelphia Electric Company [PECO, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  The, the, the Philadelphia National Ba- no, Pennsylvania Company [The First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with the bank that has been merged now.  And, I did a lot of work for SEPTA [Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority] which was a transportation company.  And, I, you know, and Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, LLP] sent me some cases which I did which were quite good.
Story_ID: 568976
Speaker 1: And, then I got involved on a pro bono basis but--pro bono basis, then Girard College [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] case had opened up, Girard College there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you talk about that case?  I mean, that case came in what year?  That was after Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], right?
Speaker 1: That was after Brown which started, it started about 1956 I'd say.  And, it was originally brought by Mr. Alexander and--
Speaker 2: Mr. Alexander?
Speaker 1: Raymond Pace Alexander (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Raymond, Raymond Pa--oka- now, at this point he's in his fifty--?
Speaker 1: Oh, no.  He's still practicing law. Later on, he went on the bench.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But he's still practicing law.  And, we, and he filed a suite.  He lost it in the offense court.  And, I asked him did he want any help?  And, so, we lost it in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania but then we won it in the Supreme Court, and they sent it back.  But, then the trustees on their own, I mean, the court on its own removed the city as trustee and put in the same people but as non-tru- as non-city people.  And, we took that; we lost that.  And, then about two years later after Bill Scranton [William Scranton] became governor, the pressure to open it up started up again.  And, Cecil Moore [Cecil B. Moore] who was a good lawyer start picketing and everything and really raising hell.  And, so, Governor Scranton asked me and Charlie Biddle [Charles Biddle] to bring a lawsuit to try to knock out the practice.  And, we took it to the federal district court and we finally won it.  And, so, then they opened it up to, to everybody.  Then women go down too, even though the original grant says for white male orphans only, but women go.  It took us, all together, about fifteen years to get it done, but we got it done.
Speaker 2: So, you're saying it started in 1956 and then ended 19 (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, it started in 19--yeah, it started in--
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-six [1956] and ended up in 19--
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970].
Speaker 1: In 1970, yeah.
Story_ID: 568977
Speaker 1: How large was the firm when you first joined it?
Speaker 2: When I joined the Dilworth firm [Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish and Levy; Dilworth Paxson LLP, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] there probably were about thirty lawyers of which probably twelve to fourteen were partners, the others were associates.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I left it, there were about two hundred.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so, you, you in three, really in three instances 'cause the O'Melveny [O'Melveny and Myers LLP] was small when you started?
Speaker 2: When I started here, there were five lawyers.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, in three instance you really were in the beginning of what became major law firms.
Speaker 2: Well, no but this, this law firms is California (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was out of L.A. [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: California.  And, it had made--
Speaker 1: I know it's, I know it's L.A.--right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but there's (unclear), well, and now, now the head of the whole firm is here, so--
Speaker 1: Right, right.  That's what I'm say--I'm just saying that you've done that three times in your career in many ways.  Now what, were there things that, because what's interesting to me is that you start in a corporate firm, you know, basically in a corporate firm once you got, before, you know, what we think of, you know, well, it's in the beginning of what we know as the Civil Rights Movement.  And, you're doing sort of corporate law.  You have things like the Urban League [National Urban League] that are, you know, growing in predominance.  You also have in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's Leon Sullivan.
Speaker 1: Leon Sullivan.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, all of those things are moving towards, in the business arena.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, are any, is there any conflict with, you know, and also you are starting to serve, when do you start serving on corporate boards?
Speaker 2: I started, I started after I went to Philadelphia.  When I, when I went to Philadelphia before I left to come to government I was on the Pan Am [Pan American World Airways] board.  I was on the Western Savings Fund Society [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the Philadelphia Electric Company [PECO, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the INA [Insurance Company of North America], and the, The First Pennsylvania Company [The First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So, I was on those boards.  And, then when I, then I, 'cause I had to get my (unclear) when I went into government then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but when you sat on your first board, what year was that?  Do you, and which was the first board?  Was it, because Pan Am had been a client of yours, right?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, they became a client after I went on their board.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I see.
Speaker 2: And, actually, I'd met 'em, I actually met them in London [England] and so they became a client.  And, I was also on the American Stock Exchange [NYSE MKT] board too.  So, we, well, you know, they were--well, them boards were beginning to open up.  They were finding a few black people.  But, then after, after I'd left the government, I went on other boards.
Speaker 1: Right.  But, I'm, I'm asking what board was your first board?
Speaker 2: To the best of my knowledge and recollection was the Western Savings Fund Society.  Because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: I have, well, I can't think of it, but it, it probably about 19--oh, I'd say about 1958.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: In part I think because the big competitor was the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And, I think Leon Higginbotham [sic.]--I mean, Leon Sullivan (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sullivan.
Speaker 2: Was on that board and so Western was the number two, so they put me there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you, do you know who was the first black person who served on a corporate board, period?
Speaker 2: It may well have been Pat Harris [Patricia Roberts Harris].  I think Pat Harris was on the IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] board I think before she went into government.
Speaker 1: But, this is early '50 [1950], she was mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the--well, just--well, I don't, well I--
Speaker 1: I don't think--but, she was--
Speaker 2: I was pretty early (laughter).
Speaker 1: I was gonna say.  I mean--but, you're saying Leon Sullivan was before you?
Speaker 2: I think, I think Leon Sullivan was on the board of Philadelphia Saving Fund Society--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Before I got on the board at Western.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It may not have been out.  But, the Philadelphia Electric, you know, when they--and Pan Am, well, you know, it was a national company as against the banks in Philadelphia were, you know, semi-local, so.
Speaker 1: Was that experience of serving on a corporate board, was it a new experience?  Or, was it--you had already had your experience at Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], you had already, you had these--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, it was different, but you, you know, you learn, you learn, but I certainly had been on the board of the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.].  In fact, I think I was president of the Legal Defense Fund by that time.  And, so I, you know, I had experience and it was good experience and most of 'em resulted in my getting business.  I mean, you know, they were not good and then also the Pan Am [Pan American World Airways] thing made me very popular with my children.  That meant they had a free pass all over the world.  So, they, they (laughter), in fact my daughter [Lovida Hardin Coleman, Jr.] wrote me this wonderful letter when I had to resign to, what, secretary of transportation saying, "You gotta realize that your children sacrifice for father because I had just have to cancel my trip.  I had to go abroad, you know."  And, they really used it quite well.  So, it was a very--
Speaker 1: Well, Pan Am was almost the airline at that point, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, it was a great, great airline, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 568978
Speaker 1: So how are mainly getting business though?  Let me just ask you that--
Speaker 2: Well, I got, when I--
Speaker 1: Was it civic engagement?  Was it--? Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, when everything, now, you know, when I, when I went to the Dilworth firm [Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish and Levy; Dilworth Paxson LLP, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I was there may be about three months and Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, LLP] sent me a big case.  And, so, that, I did that.  And, then, soon after I went, and that's when SEPTA [Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority] got created.  So, I represented SEPTA in a lot of matters.  And, I--the firm, was a firm client but I did a lot of work for Walter Annenberg's company [Triangle Publications, Inc.].  Then, I got involved doing some work for Philadelphia Electric [Philadelphia Electric Company; PECO, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And, then actually by then probably four years after going there, I--we did a big matter for, for the Ford Motor Company which they were buying Philco.  And, they got word on a Thursday that Tuesday morning the government was gonna bring an injunction claiming this violate the antitrust law.  So, I picked up the phone and called Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] and said, "I gotta come down and see you, Mr. Attorney General."  He said, "Well, what about nine o'clock Monday morning?"  I get there at nine o'clock Monday morning and he's got Nick Katzenbach [Nicholas Katzenbach] there and he's got the head of the Civil Rights Division [U.S. Department of Justice] there.  And, I start talking about the Ford Motor Company in a merger.  And Kennedy said, "Well, I thought you were gonna come down here talk about the Meredith [James Meredith] case" 'cause he thought I was, you know, doing that.  "And, we're having trouble getting Meredith, keeping him in Mississippi [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi]."  And, he said, "I wouldn't have seen you on this."  I said, "Come on, they both take taxes," again so we, there were no merger, no merger.  And, I went back and said, told my law firm, I said, "Now, you guys stay the hell off my back," (laughter), because you, that's the way you get things done.  So, you know, really it's been a, been a lucky life, but it's a good life.
Story_ID: 568979
Speaker 1: Why don't we talk about your role with the Warren Commission [President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy]?  Because that occurred in 1964, right?
Speaker 2: Now, wait a minute, come on, it was later than that.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Let's see Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] didn't become president until 1960.  So, he must've been--it ran in '60 [1960], so he sworn in '60 [sic. 1961] so late '60 [1960]--
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sixty-four [1964], yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So, can you tell me how that happened?  And, you had known, while you--no.  When you were clerking, he wasn't the chief.
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Justice.
Speaker 1: No, he came as the chief afterwards, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  But, can you talk about how that appointment happened?  And, and for people who don't know the Warren Commission came about as a result of--the--his death (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Assassination, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, the assassination, right, of--
Speaker 1: Can we talk?
Speaker 2: John Kennedy, yes.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, we had that great tragedy in this country where a wonderful guy who was president got killed.  And, President Kennedy and certainly within four or five days thereafter there were all type of rumor.  Even including some implication it may be President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] or somebody had something to do with it.  And, Johnson felt that the only way to handle it was to appoint a commission.  And, after time, he persuaded Chief Justice Earl Warren to become the chairman of it.  I think I got approached because I knew Lee Rankin [J. Lee Rankin] who was the general counsel to it and he decided that among other things that it should be six lawyers who'd be senior.  Each one of us had a field, or fields that we're supposed to look at.  And, I was one of the six.  Bert Jenner [Albert Ernest Jenner, Jr.] was another one of 'em.  And, a guy named Adams [Francis W.H. Adams] who'd been police commissioner of New York [New York].  And, they had, you know, some other people.  My responsibility was to see; one, whether there was a foreign conspiracy.  Two, what Oswald [Lee Harvey Oswald] had done when he was in Russia.  And, when he was in Mexico.  Those two times he's out of the county.  And, three, to see whether if there was a conspiracy between anybody other than Oswald and other people.  And, and that's what we did; took us about a year and ten days to, to do the job.  But, once again I still stayed full-time at the firm.  This was, you know, I didn't have to leave the firm to do it.
Speaker 2: Now, I had heard some, you know, criticism of the Warren--I mean, there had been a lot of--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There'd been a lot of criticism of the Warren Commission.  Mainly, that some of the, you know, the hearings weren't necessarily together, you know.  People weren't sitting so they didn't, you didn't necessarily hear the same evidence.  You know, or testimony, I'm sor- I'm so--
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know what, I don't think--well, certainly all the testimony was recorded.  And, and in the key testimony they'd always been at least one or two commissioners present.  I think that, in my way of thinking, the reason why whatever we did, we was correct was that a person who's saw all of the evidence and had a specialist there the whole time, was Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy].  And, I can't imagine him being involved in a conspiracy covering up somebody who's killed his brother.  And, I think that was it.  I think it was a real tragedy also I'd also have to agree that to think that this particular guy on his own did it all by himself seems to be farfetched.  But, that's what the evidence left and I think today after all these years nobody's come up with anybody else.  So, I think it's pretty good idea we were right.  And, in addition, there are additional papers had been put in the archives which tend to back up what we said.  That doesn't mean there weren't some tense moments.
Story_ID: 568980
Speaker 1: Because I know that for an example, when I was doing the work on what had happened in the Soviet Union that Oswald [Lee Harvey Oswald] was up in Minsk [Belarus] and once it happened on the--and on the radio and they talk about him being there, this Russian general felt that he would made look--himself look good if he had indicated he trained Oswald, you know.  And, so, there was a lot of things memorandum and that really upset everybody, 'cause you said, "Gee, maybe there was something."  But, we finally were able to demonstrate that that was not true, and false, and so we, you know, we, we rejected that.  But, my, once again, my best answer is that it's been all these years and nobody's come up with a different answer.
Speaker 2: Now, how many people actually, how many total served on the Commission [President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy] and how much--?
Speaker 1: It was seven.  There were seven people.  I mean, one was Senator Russell [Richard Russell].  Another one was Allen Dulles, brother who had been for a long time head of the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency.]  And, then President Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.] and several other people whose name I can't remember right now.
Speaker 2: Was that your first time getting to know President Ford?  Was that the--?
Speaker 1: Well, that's the first time I really go to know him.  Though I did once or twice see him up on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] when we had some issues and I talked with him 'cause he had already become a leader in the, in the House [U.S. House of Representatives].  So, I did, you know, know him from that.  But, that was the first time I really worked with him and really go to know him.
Speaker 2: Now, was that your first time sitting on a commission like that, you know?  I mean, that had--the commission was (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was the first time--
Speaker 2: I mean, a federal, you--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Other than I had--well, soon after I left the justice--a guy name Adrian Fisher [Adrian S. Fisher] who at that time was general counsel of the, of the commission dealing with nuclear weapons and who you protect them, asked me to come down and do some work for it.  We had, the real problem was that we wanted to make some arrangements with the Soviet so we could really find out what they were doing.  And, as every schoolboard knows, the Russians don't like foreigners on their territory particularly during that time.  And, so, we were trying to develop some scheme where we could check if and when we thought there was an atomic event in the Soviet Union.  So, I spent about six months working on that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, okay, so that ends, was there any fallout from that, you know, at all?  I mean, it was so har--you know, his death was--?
Speaker 1: No.  Well, you know, other than the fact that there's certain people that were writing articles and there was actually a movie or a book which indicated that we didn't know what we were talking about.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, another guy I got to know very well was Senator Arlen Specter, who was a junior at that time and he developed the one bullet theory because Connally [John Connally] and Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] had both been hit.  And, everybody thought there were two bullets, so at least it he'd be two people shooting.  But, Specter was finally able to demonstrate by the direction of the bullet and everything there was one bullet that went through both of them.  So, that's, and once that was done--and, he's written a book about it and nobody has really challenged what he did.
Speaker 2: And, he was a, a juni- a staffer, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, he was a young lawyer then at the Dechert [Dechert Price and Rhoads; Dechert LLP] firm in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And, he was asked to do it and so we, we--I got to know him very well.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, he's a good friend now.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: He's a good friend now.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now, the nature of your practice still is, you know, you are doing, you do handle some transportation issues, you know, right?  You're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I, I do.  But, I--we represent Ford Motor Company in a lot of matters.  And, I am now working on four airlines who want to merge and become one.  One of the four happens to be a Chinese airline.  So, you know, and so, I'm doing that but I, you know, do a lot of different things.  I do some litigation.  I--another--I have a client who's probably one of the most successful hedge fund operators so, I try to advise him.  And, we do a lot of different, I mean, we do a lot of work--
Speaker 2: Well, you're talking now (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, now.  Now, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now.  Okay.
Story_ID: 568981
Speaker 1: Thurgood Marshall gets, he gets appointed to the [U.S.] Supreme Court in 1971 [sic. 1967], I think?
Speaker 2: Oh, President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] appointed him so--
Speaker 1: Seventy-one [1971].
Speaker 2: Yeah, about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, do you know much of the story behind that appointment?
Speaker 2: Well, I certainly, you know--
Speaker 1: Can you tell us?
Speaker 2: Well, President Johnson certainly felt that it was important that he opened up a lot of opportunities for, for Marshall.  I, you know, Marshall previously had been appointment to the Second Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Court] and that was a lifetime appointment.  And, then Johnson made him the solicitor general of the United States.  And, I'm pretty sure that Thurgood felt that, "Well, if I do this job well enough I, and there's a vacancy, I may be president."  And, then, when Johnson, when somebody died, Marshall followed the person on the bench.  And, he finally got confirmed.  I think that, you know, it was a good appointment.  He'd done a good job when he was on the bench.
Speaker 1: So, Mr. Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.], did you ever want to be appointed?  Would you have wan- ever wanted to serve?  Having had the opportunity?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I was pretty sure that until I was thirty, I think as a very young lawyer, think that's a great job.  But, since I've been thirty, I never had a particular feeling that that's what I'd like to do.  One, it's, it's hard work.  And, once you get the job, you really gotta work.  I mean, and if you're gonna be awfully good, you can't have a lot of people drafting your opinions, you gotta do the work yourself.  Or, even if somebody drafts it, you gotta check enough so you'd know that what they said was correct.  So, I--no, I don't think I would wanna, it's a job I wouldn't want.
Story_ID: 568982
Speaker 1: Now, the, the thing, okay so Watergate--so, Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], selected Johnson means, then we have Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you get involved, you know, as far as the Watergate scandal after that spin, right?  You, Elliott Richardson [Elliott Lee Richardson] comes--?
Speaker 2: No.  But, I didn't know.  I was not involved in Watergate other than--
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: Other than near the end.
Speaker 1: In the end.
Speaker 2: I wrote a, I wrote a op-ed piece for The New York Times, in which I said that, this was before he said he's gonna resign, that [U.S.] Congress should pass the statute saying that one, if he resigns he still gets his pension.  And, he destroy all the papers but he'd have to resign.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I'd, I was never--I mean, Nixon, I mean, Elliot wanted me to be involved in Watergate but, I didn't think I wanted to do that.  In fact, he had, had to recommended that I, that I be the, have the spot that Cox [Archibald Cox] took as the chief counsel but I, I didn't wanna do that, no.
Speaker 1: Now, why didn't you wanna do that?  High profile?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, I one, wanted to practice law and that would require me--well, to be a private practitioner that would require me at least to take a year or two years a leave of absence.  And, I felt there were other things more interesting to do that the time.  I certainly, and in retrospect, I wouldn't, you know, want to do that.
Speaker 1: But, you thought, you thought, I had read a whole thing where you, you know, the reasons why you didn't think, I mean, impeaching a president, you know, then who had--where you, it was something about--?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) If, if, you know, he would be in prison and, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I would say, well, what I was saying why I thought that, that it, it made sense to get the guy out of office.  But, don't then have criminal proceedings.  And, if you just impeach him and convict him that then he's still subject to being tried criminally.  So, you convict him.  I would certainly say that if you put him in a federal prison he'd be along with a lot of other guys that got put in there in his administration.  I would not wanna be around.  And, if you say, well, why don't we convict him, but after that's appealed and affirmed, we will then pardon him.  It just seems to me that American people would be even more irritated, say well, "The guy has been convicted.  Why are you affirming him?"  And, I just thought--and I was influenced in part because of, oh, who was the vice president who I guess when--
Speaker 1: Edmond [sic.]?
Speaker 2: When Jefferson [President Thomas Jefferson] was president--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Who the guy, he killed somebody [Alexander Hamilton] in New Jersey--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: Was that Aaron Burr?  Was it Aaron (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're talking about when--after--you're talking about President--are you talking about Lin- ?
Speaker 2: No.  I'm talking about--no, this was long time ago, I'm talking about--
Speaker 1: Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln]?  No.
Speaker 2: No, this guy, this guy was vice president of the United States and he killed somebody in New Jersey.  And, then he--his term was up.  But, then they had a trial down in Marshall, you know, the Chief Justice Marshall [John Marshall] tried him in Virginia.  He, he was vice president, the first vice president of Jefferson--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From New York.  And, also, you know, afterwards if you take the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] thing, that certainly had, had adverse effect on the country.  So, those were the reason why I just felt it didn't make sense to, to do it.
Speaker 1: So, you were calling for restraint?
Speaker 2: Yeah, restraint.
Speaker 1: You know, and basically--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, get him out of office and I, and I think, you know, I certainly felt with President Clinton that that was not something that you had put to even have impeachment, although he lie and that was tough.  But, I'm pretty sure he's not the only president that made out with some lady in the White House [Washington, D.C.] or near the White House.  I always remember Thurgood Marshall said that one reason why he didn't think that Westbrook Pegler was a son of a bitch was that he like every other reporter knew at four o'clock that President Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] was wheeled across from the White House over to the Adams House [Manger Hay-Adams; The Hay-Adams, Washington, D.C.], where the girl from New Jersey would be, and they never printed it.  And, then I'm pretty sure that when other presidents, some of which I've known, have been in the White House have done things, I just don't think that's what you put a guy in jail for.  Or, or get an impeachment for.

Speaker 1: So, you're practicing, you have a robust practice, you know, things are moving along.  You're enjoying practice.  You, you're, now, your wife [Lovida Hardin Coleman], is she really sort of the wife of a, you know, a famous well-known attorney and raising her--?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, no.  When I put my foot on those grounds at home, I'm just one of the, the people that she says what to do and then gets done.  I don't represent--I don't wash dishes or anything, but somebody else does that.  But, I don't do that.  But, no, but no, she's a very sensible person.  I, I guess I had the advantage that since her father [Joseph Arthur Hardin, Sr.] had been somewhat involved in public life that she knew that some men do that.  And, that's what they do.  But, she, but you know, seems to be very good.  But, when I'm home, you know, she's the one that runs the house and she's very good at it.
Story_ID: 568984
Speaker 1: So you get a call from President Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.] in 1975 asking you to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, actually, he offered you several, the, you had, he wanted you to do several positions, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what was the first offer, the first (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I can't say because my best friend took the job and I don't want that person to realize that they were second best.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But, it was a cabinet spot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and then he offered me the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But, why did you decline that spot?
Speaker 2: Because I didn't particularly want that job.  And, if I said why, you'd forget who got the job.  So, I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Secondly, he offered me a job of the--being, being a--top position in the state department [U.S. Department of State] which I turned down.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you turn that down?
Speaker 2: Well, 'cause I just, didn't wanna just didn't wan- at that time I didn't wanna do it.  And, when he really said [U.S.] Department of Transportation, I didn't realize they had a department of transportation.  So, you know, lawyers can never say, "I don't know what you're talking about, sir."  So, I said, "Gee, I better--gotta think about that."  And, so, when I went home fortunately, I guess for me, the--my daughter [Lovida Hardin Coleman, Jr.] was home that day from Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut] and said, "You should take it" because at that time probably less than 150 Americans had ever been in the cabinet.  And, it was good just for that reason.  And, plus the fact the country needed some people who hadn't been in politics.  So, I then called (unclear) Rumsfeld [Donald Rumsfeld] who was chief of staff and said, "Well, if the president still wants me, I'll do it."  So, then that's how I got the job.
Speaker 1: So, was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I enjoyed doing it once I got it.
Speaker 1: So, your daughter is the one to--you have to thank then.
Speaker 2: Yeah on that, on that particular--yeah, she was--her advice was one that got me to take it.
Story_ID: 568985
Speaker 1: But, of course, before that President Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] at the first election, about five days after he won offered me and wanted me to become the legal advisor for the state department [U.S. Department of State] and I turned that down.  One, because I didn't think he was that good of guy, at that time.  And, later on he, he wanted to make me the deputy secretary of commerce and had indicated that within six months I would be the cabinet officer 'cause that guy was gonna leave.  And, I didn't particularly want that--you know, I liked to practice law.  I had no idea that I would do anything other than practice law.
Speaker 2: Now, what, what were your feelings about Nixon then?
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't, I didn't, you know, I mean, I think that his, I mean, I, I came to realize I was wrong.  But, certainly I felt that in nineteen--, wait, wait, wait, first time he was elected that he certainly didn't seem to me, to be the type of man I thought should be the president of the United States.  Or, he may have been better than the guy he's run against.  But, I knew Humphrey [Hubert Humphrey] and I liked Hubert Humphrey.  So, I just felt that he wasn't the person.  I think after that, he certainly was a little better than I thought he would be on race matters.  He was the first one ever developed affirmative action, things like that.  And, I think that he was much better than people gave him credit for, and he had some tough times.  And, I always thought that Watergate was an unfair thing to get 'em on because all the evidence that I seen and read it, is that he didn't know anything about the break-in or anything.  And, his only fault was, after it happened and he certainly cooperated with the cover up of it.  But, if you're in the middle of a political campaign, I think anybody else do that, you know.  So, I just don't think that was the basis of which what happened to him should've happened.  And, I thought he was a pretty good person.  But, on the other hand, as I've told Kate Graham once [Katharine Graham], I really believe in Watergate because but for Watergate there'd been no President Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.] and I would not have been a cabinet (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause a lot of, you know, the blacks, there are those people who call themselves Nixon Republicans.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, black, you the---right, right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, no, no, I think he, no, I think he was a very good person and who's trying to do things which were the right thing.  But, at the time, you know, I didn't feel that way.  It was only later I did.  And, I also thought he got an unfair rap that what he got, you know, finally kicked out of office for (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 568986
Speaker 1: Now, Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.], what did you know?  Because Ford I would say is, just how he came in, you know, people have images of him falling all the time, you know, the president.  But, it was at the ti- it was him coming in after Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson].
Speaker 2: You mean after Johnson (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: No.  But, a falling--gosh, you know, I would say President Ford was the best athlete that ever occupied the, the White House [Washington, D.C.].  President Ford was a--at college, he was the center of all-star Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] football team and was an All-American son.  I know he was a very good thing and he was just coming down a stairway and he kind of stumbled; everybody can do that.  And, I've also know, I've talked with (unclear) a couple of years afterwards, after I left the office and he said that Ford was the first leader to say that if he got control of inflations that you will ultimately solve the problem of unemployment, and inflation was more important.  I also thought that some of the things that Ford did with respect to the Soviet Union were correct.  And, I also felt that if the election had gone on for another week, we probably would've won it 'cause we were catching up to this.  But, more time--and, I didn't think that Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was that good a president.
Story_ID: 568987
Speaker 1: Under your tenure, I mean, the department [U.S. Department of Transportation], being the cabinet officer, the secretary of transportation, what was that experience like?  Because obviously you had turned down all these other positions, you know, you really liked it.
Speaker 2: Well, I liked it because the, well, some of the things like for example, when I took office 20 percent of the Interstate Highway System [National System of Interstate and Defense Highways] was not completed.  And, that 20 percent was all tied up with litigation involving environmental problems.  I think that most people say by the time I left, you know, it was only twenty-three or twenty-four months later, those problems had been solved and the system got completed without any further difficulty.  You also had the entire Northeast railroad freight system in bankruptcy.  We got--took care of that.  We certainly had other problems on city transit.  There was no Washington [D.C.] subway, we were the ones that started that and went to the completion.  We had problems dealing with the automobile, one was the seatbelt issue.  The other was the, the airbag issue.  We, and also gasoline issues that we took care of.  And, we also had problems with the airlines with respect to noise as to whether they were too noisy.  Because after you build the airports, people started building houses around them, and we had that problem.  And, there were other problems we had and in addition there were issues having not that much to do with transportation.  But, yet I participated in the cabinet on.  I think we had a lot to do with making sure that Namibia which was the country, at one time, controlled by South Africa, got its freedom and didn't have the problems there.  And, I also think on, on certain other issued such as the Boston busing case [Morgan v. Hennigan, 1974], my being in the cabinet made a difference.  And, generally, I felt that it was a good job, I had good people and I liked the job very much.  I also decided that the Concorde had the right to land in United States.
Speaker 1: You were involved with the Concorde?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why I have the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  I mean, not the Presidential, but I was the--I'm an officer of the French Legion of Honour because with, with--Giscard d'Estaing [Valery Giscard d'Estaing] gave me the, gave me--made me an officer of the French Legion of Honour based upon it.
Story_ID: 568988
Speaker 1: Can you expound more about how you, you know, you played an important role in the Boston [Massachusetts] busing, the controversy.
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was the, the South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts] had problems and schools were segregated.  And, a federal judge said the only way to eliminate it was to bus kids from South Boston to the other part of Boston.  The white parents didn't like that.  They lost in the district.  They lost in the circuit.  And, then they were trying to get certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States.  And, actually, Bob Bork [Robert Bork] at that time was solicitor general of the United States.  And, also, that cabinet seemed that outside the issue as to what should be done with New York [New York] with respect to its financial prospect.  Should we let it go bankrupt and then have somebody else bail it out?  And, I remember that cabinet meeting quite well.  And, it's been reported in--publically, so I can say it, that the attorney general came in and said that with respect to the, the New York situation where you let 'em go bankrupt and then a federal judge can, can, you know, cut down the wages and do other things.  And, then with Boston, he said, they should stay out of the busing thing and just let the white parents try to win in the Supreme Court.  And, I interrupted and said, "You know, Mr. President [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.], this is amazing that with respect to one issue when you're talking about running a city, the one thing that politicians are supposed to do, you tell them to stay out and get some judge to do it.  But, that's when you're dealing with busing and schools that no politician has ever solved the problem.  It's only been done by, done by the court and therefore you should let the courts keep on doing it."  And, he said, "Well, we better just put both issues off."  And, he did and we did the right thing in New York.  And, I think we did the right thing in Boston; we stayed the hell out of that case.
Speaker 1: So, that, that's what, you know, you've often said is that it's important to be at the table.  You know, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, that's very important.  Yeah, you be in the room.  And, I remember when I first start working with Mr. Marshall, Thurgood Marshall, and I, you know, thought he didn't know I was a Republican, and I thought he was a Democrat and I said, "Well, I guess, you want me to change my registration."  He said, "Well, one, I'm not a Democrat.  I'm an Independent.  I haven't received a party.  But, secondly, Bill [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.] somebody's gotta be there to watch those bastards, so, you stay there."  So, that's what (laughter), so we, we never in any way ever, objected to my being a Republican.  And, he was friendly with a lot of Republican.  No, I really think that's true, and I think the same way.  I think anybody who's a Republican ought to get to know the Democrats and understand their problems at time, come in and tell them.  I mean, I think that there a fair number of people who are judges on the federal district court or court of appeals who happen to be Democrats.  They got there only because I was able to intervene and tell the right people that you ought to, you know, let this guy go through.
Story_ID: 568989
Speaker 1: But the thing was that one of your priorities was you wanted to develop a comprehensive transportation policy, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Have you read that (laughter)?  Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, the statuary said you were.  I'm the only secretary [of the U.S. Department of Transportation] that would do it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, statuary says that's one of the jobs, I'm supposed to do.  And, I thought it was important.  I felt that in the time I had, I could not develop a plan, but I wrote a long paper, helped to write it, where I point out the issues in the various argument.  And, then I expected the next secretary would come along and complete it.  But, I think now, I think now has to be done now is quite clear that you gotta rebuild a lot of the highways.  And, I think you gotta take some of the airports and put 'em someplace else because the cities have been built around them too much.
Speaker 1: When you did that was there a certain timeframe you were looking forward to?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, I felt that, you know, I always thought we was gonna win the election--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, we--and I thought I got four more years.  But, actually, I think about a month before the election, President Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.] told me if we won I was gonna be the attorney general the next time because Levi [Edward H. Levi] didn't wanna stay on.  So, I don't think I was giving that up, I mean, as a lawyer that's a good job.
Speaker 1: You mean, being a U.S. attorney--?
Speaker 2: No.  The attorney general of the United States (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) General.  That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're talking about what Elliot Richardson [Elliot Lee Richardson] had had?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were gonna follow him?
Speaker 2: Well, I was gonna follow Levi.
Speaker 1: Well, you gonna follow Levi?
Speaker 2: 'Cause Levi was gonna go back to the university [University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois].  And, I really would've, think I, I think I would have liked that job.  Although, I think if I, if the job I really like in the government I would be, to be the secretary of the treasury or the secretary of state I think those was two great jobs.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We still haven't had a black U.S. attorney general.  No, right?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, you had, you've had two that been the deputy.
Speaker 1: Deputy.  But, I'm talking, I'm talking about--
Speaker 2: Well, but, no, but, but, Thompson [Larry D. Thompson] could've been the attorney general if he wanted.  I mean, President Ford offered it to him before he offered it to Gonzales [Alberto R. Gonzales].
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But, Larry wanted to go and make some money.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: He's general counsel of PepsiCo now.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.  I see.  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Very, very able guy, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, Eric Holder's [HistoryMaker Eric H. Holder, Jr.] was the--turned it down.
Speaker 1: Right.  He was the deputy.
Speaker 2: And, I'm pretty sure that if, if Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] had won, he probably would've appointed him as attorney general.
Story_ID: 568990
Speaker 1: So you return to private practice after that.  But, you then, that's what, that's when you came to, what--why did you re--did you go back to your firm?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I came--no, I came here.
Speaker 1: Because, now, why was that then?  Why not return?  Is it because you have become part of Washington [D.C.]?
Speaker 2: No.  No, no.  I thought that--well, I really had intended to go back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  But, strangely enough when I, well I wouldn't talk to anybody until after I left the office.  But, I just assume I'd go back to Philadelphia because my name had been in the firm.  And, I figured they'd put it back and I like Philadelphia.  But, they got into a controversy because I guess, well, actually what happened, that's after we'd lost the election, about a month later I got a call from Tom Watson [Thomas J. Watson, Jr.] who was chief executive to OB--of IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  And, he said, "I'd like you to join our board."  And, I said, "Well, I can't talk to you now because I'm still in office.  But, if, when I leave office if you still want me, give me a call and I'll talk with you about it."  And, so, on the 20th of January that year--next year, right after Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] took the oath of office, which meant I was out of office, he called me and said that he wanted me to go on the board of IBM.  I said, "Yes."  And, he told me it paid forty thousand dollars a year.  And, I said, "Fine."  And, then I called Lovida [Coleman's wife, Lovida Hardin Coleman] and said, "Well, honey, I'm not completely broke 'cause at least I'm gonna get forty thousand dollars a year."  And, so, so I did that.  And, then I had about three days before the last day, I had said, "Oh, my God, come Monday, or whatever the 20th was, will be the first time in forty years that I never had an office to go to the next day."  And, so, I called my good friend Elliot Richardson [Elliot Lee Richardson].  He said, "Why don't you talk to the Woodrow Wilson Center [Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Washington, D.C.]."  And, I called the guy I knew over there.  The--George Packard [George R. Packard] who was the deputy and he said, "Well, come over as a scholar and we'll pay you the same thing you're making as a, as a cabinet officer."  So, I started over there.  And, then I start talking to the Dilworth firm [Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish, Levy and Coleman; Dilworth Paxson LLP, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and they, by this time I'd been asked to go on about three or four boards.  And, they said, "Well, yes."  But, one of the things they said, "That any fees you're getting from this company, you gotta put in the firm," you know.  So, I--
Speaker 1: Was that a new policy that was (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  No.  I mean, I would say that was typical.  O'Melveny [O'Melveny and Myers LLP] did have that rule.  But, so, that's--
Speaker 1: So, you're saying when you were on those boards before, those fees--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: The fees--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would put 'em in the firm.
Speaker 1: The firm?
Speaker 2: And, then at the end of the year when they figure the bonus, they would consider that.  But, I--after, so I, so, after I got on nine boards of which I always kept a fee and I think four of 'em pay me a pension now.  And, two that don't had arrangement that every time I went to a meeting I got stock for free.  And, so the stock's worth millions of dollars now.  And, so, it would--been a good deal.
Story_ID: 568991
Speaker 1: But what did you like about a--now, how, how did O'Melveny [O'Melveny and Myers LLP]--?
Speaker 2: Well, because I had known Warren Christopher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, Warren Christopher called me and said that he was coming into the government to be the deputy attorney, to be the deputy secretary of state and he wanted me to, you know, join his office.  And, then four years later we would figure out how we were gonna run the firm.  And, so--
Speaker 1: Well, it worked out that way?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wait, now, how had you met Warren Christopher?
Speaker 2: Well, because I'd known him because he was a very active guy.  And, you know, the Bar Association [American Bar Association], I'd met him and he'd been active involved in, it was something called the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights [Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law] and he was on that.  And, he had a good reputation all over the country and I'd gotten to know him.
Speaker 1: And, you're saying, while he was deputy--?
Speaker 2: He left the firm to become the deputy secretary of state under Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.].  And, he said, you know, I'm gonna do this for four years and I'll probably come back to the firm and we, you know.  But, he left open the question whether when he came back will I still be there?  But, that's the way it happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so, this, the firm at that point it was just, it was an L.A. [Los Angeles, California] firm but it was (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) L.A.--
Speaker 1: But it was just--?
Speaker 2: And, they had just opened, they'd opened about three months before they'd opened an office in Washington [D.C.].  They had five lawyers here just starting up an office 'cause Gibson, Dunn [Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP] had done the same thing.  And, so, we thought we should do that.
Story_ID: 568992
Speaker 1: What was the nature of the--who were they representing here?  Because, L.A. [Los Angeles, California] I would th- I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, L.A. they had a good--
Speaker 1: --was it defense?  Was it, was it--?
Speaker 2: No, they had, no they, they had very few clients here [Washington, D.C.] other than we--the one, the big one I remember then was that the Penn Central [Penn Central Transportation Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] had spun off all of its non-real property.  And, there was a group of people operating, you know, during the deals on that, and we were representing them.  And, that's probably was it other than, you know, if Security Pacific [Security Pacific Bank, Los Angeles, California] had a problem before the treasury department [U.S. Department of the Treasury] there, they'd ask us to handle it from here.  But, it was a very small office and it was very, when I came, it was very little here.
Speaker 1: So, what were you thought then when you, when you then came on, who were some of the clients you brought on at the beginning?  Because it was real--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I'd been in the government for twenty-three months and if the day I came I had brought a class with me, I would go to jail.  Because it mix what I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: In the government I was--so I, but, I, well I would, you know, after I'd been here for about two months Phil Ruffin company [Ruffin Companies] has an issue which he asked me how to handle that.  Shortly thereafter the Ford Motor Company asked to see me.  But, in the meantime, I'd gone on the board of Chase [Chase Manhattan Bank; JPMorgan Chase and Co.].  So, I knew, and the chief executive of Ford was on Chase.  And, so, I knew, I knew the chief executive and I also knew the general counsel because I'd done some work for Ford in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And, he came in and said that they had a real problem.  That they had three or four years of car, 20 million of 'em, and the allegation was, they jumped out of park when they shouldn't.  And, he wanted me to represent them.  I foolishly said, "Gee, we'll have no problem of legal fees, I'll just charge you a buck [dollar] an car."  But, (laughter), for 20 million [dollars], sound like a lot of money.  But, anyway, we did that, so we, so that got us in a lot of things.  And, then--
Speaker 1: Wait.  Did you, how did you say you were charging?  Is that, was that a joke?
Speaker 2: I was joking.  I was joking, but the guy (laughter)--
Speaker 1: You--okay, okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: I just said, "No fee, I'll just charge you a buck a car," you know, 20 million sound like for a guy who was already making his cabinet of sixty-eight thousand dollars; that sounds like a lot of money.  But, we did that, then we did other things for Ford.  And, then I went on the board of Philadelphia Electric [Philadelphia Electric Company; PECO, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I went back on the board of Philadelphia Electric and it had the electrical plant, nuclear plant [Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station] in, in Peach Bottom, New Jersey which the government shutdown and I represented to get that open.  And, then I went on the board of the Insurance Company of North America and they had a lot of problems, so I start doing those.  And, other things happened and, you know, clients came in and I began to do the work for them.  And, I went, I went back on the board of Pan Am [Pan American World Airways].  And, Pan Am began to sell off some of its assets.  We also, including the shuttle they had from Frankfurt [Germany] to Berlin [Germany] and I began to do those things.
Speaker 1: So, now, how are the key members of the firm [O'Melveny and Myers LLP] at that time before Warren Christopher came back then?  Was it, who were--?
Speaker 2: Well, a guy name Jim Greene [James Coffin Greene] was then the, was the chairman of the firm.  And, another guy named Bill Vaughn [William W. Vaughn] who was head of the litigation department.  And, you know, they were good lawyers but they, you know, it was a different type of thing from then we have today.  I mean, you know, it wasn't quite--
Speaker 1: Well, because you've grown, I mean, how many lawyers are here today now?
Speaker 2: Well about, in this office here, there about 250.  But, not only that, but the head of the firm A.B. Culvahouse [Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr.] who was a young kid here, and I think I trained him.  And, then he went to work for Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] as a counsel at the White House [Washington, D.C.] and then he came back here, and you know, he developed a lot of business.  Then we start doing work for Chase Bank 'cause I went on the board of Chase and other things, so, you know, we, so we just, today we do completely.
Story_ID: 568993
Speaker 1: Can I also ask something just in, you know, sort of context?  At the time that O'Melveny [O'Melveny and Myers LLP], you know, was established a branch here, was there a trend sort of, you know, fri- large firms in other places to start developing a D.C. [Washington, D.C.] office?  When did that sort of happen?
Speaker 2: Well, that, well, I would say that there were about three or four major firms that had significant offices in Washington.  Morgan, Lewis and Bockius [Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP], a Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] firm, had an office here because it did a lot of natural gas work and I, and I took the client from 'em so I know them very well.  'Cause while I was at the Philadelphia firm we, we took the Philadelphia Gas [Philadelphia Gas Works, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] work from 'em.  So, that took away that business; but, they're still here.  And, there were one or two New York [New York] firms that had offices here.  But, mainly then the New York firms if they had a Washington matter, they would get Covington [Covington and Burling LLP] or one of the Washington firms to handle it.  And, that's the same way, nationally, you know, when O'Melveny, you know, would, when it was on the West Coast if they had, if IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] had a matter, and IBM major lawyer then, I guess it still is, is Cravath [Cravath, Swaine and Moore, LLP].  If it were on the West Coast, Cravath would call up Christopher [Warren Christopher] and say, "Look we got this matter; we want you to handle it for us."  And, we'd handle the staff and everything.  But, now, you know, Cravath would say, we got a matter on the West Coast, you just tell three partners and ten associates, a boy or girl, she gonna live on the West Coast for the next year; and, they do that.  And, I've, soon after I got here, I recognize that's that gonna happen all over the country.  That, if you got a major matter, whether it's in Chicago [Illinois] place, if you're a good enough firm, you can handle it.  You just send your people out there.  And, so, that was part of the trend, and so that's what O'Melveny began to do and so far we've been very lucky at it.
Story_ID: 568994
Speaker 1: Now, O'Melveny, how large is O'Melveny [O'Melveny and Myers LLP] in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] now?
Speaker 2: Well, O'Melveny, I would say on the West Coast; well, totally O'Melveny now is about a thousand lawyers.  On the West Coast there must be about four hundred.  In New York [New York] there're about 250.  In London [England] there's about fifty.  In Brussels [Belgium] we have about twelve.  In China we have over fifty lawyers.  So, you add it up, that comes to a thousand of 'em.  But, in California we're in L.A., Century City [Los Angeles, California], San Francisco [California].  So, you know, you do, and so that's, you know, and that's, that's where you practice law today.  It's just different, yeah.  I'm pretty--Jenner and Block, another great law firm, like on any day I'm pretty sure that at least two-thirds of the lawyers are not in their hometown.  They're someplace else trying a case.  You know, we're doing all the Merck [Merck and Co., Inc.] cases now.  They're all over the country.  And, actually, I got some people up in Canada trying this case up there.
Speaker 1: Now, this, so, was this experience here any different than, you know, the experience you had in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Well, it's different in the sense that--
Speaker 1: I know different from, it's different cultures.
Speaker 2: But, there more people.  But, and the main thing is, is that the practice of law has just changed.
Speaker 1: Can you speak to that?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, it changed in a sense that most top U.S. firms today have officers overseas.  Something before the Cleary Gottlieb [Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton LLP] and a few others, other than London, very few American firms had office oversea; now you have.  I mean, you know, when Christopher [Warren Christopher] came back from being secretary of state, deputy secretary of state, he said, "Look, you know, we'll probably never catch up with the New York [New York] firms that started offices in Europe right after the Second World War [World War II, WWII].  But, the new place is China."  And, so, we began to look for American kids who were Chinese mother and father, one or the other, who were going to school here, train 'em, and then we started the office in Shanghai [China].  And, then after that the federal government--the Chinese government insisted we also have an office in Beijing [China].  And, then we had one in Hong Kong because there're certain types of transactions you do there, you can't do in Shanghai.  And, that's how it developed.  But, this is true, you know, you take a thousand now, there're a couple of law firms that have about two thousand lawyers there now, which never before happened.  And, that's just the practice of--that's just a different, different ballgame now.
Story_ID: 568995
Speaker 1: Are the issues any more complex you think with the--what you're talking about is basically globalization.
Speaker 2: Well, globalization issues are complex, you know, I, you know, for a drug company that the other day they sell and develop certain of their products in, in Iran.  They gotta train the doctors in Iran to be, you know, administer these drugs.  And, the other day I got a call and said, "Look, we've decided that the only way we can train these people is to give 'em a two months course in Lebanon. Can we do that without violating any of the arrangement we have with the treasury department [U.S. Department of the Treasury]?"  Well, somebody's gotta, gotta work that out.  On--another one, same, same drug company, that to get an established drug into Japan, it usually takes eight years.  So, you gotta know how to work the system to get it done in a year.  And, so, that, you know, takes time, take a lawyer and vary other things.  Or, or, you know, now the Ford Motor Company and General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] are beginning to say, well some of our cars we should make in China.  Well, you gotta have lawyers that known who to handle that problem.  You got a tendency now where the private equity companies are really challenging the way you used to operate and they're buying companies and paying $20 billion and $30 billion for a company and you gotta know how to handle those transaction.  And, those deals are taking place all over the world.  And, so, you just have to be able to do things that we, you know, like communication I guess.  If you wanna speak to Shanghai [China] and get you to Shanghai quicker than I can get you to New York [New York].  I just call on the phone.  And, that's what our people getting back to the base; that's what our people should know.  And, I don't, you know, they don't know and I'm pretty sure that, you know, you have the right people that, you know--South Africa is gonna take off.  But, you gotta have people that know who to work that deal, you know, we got this big office in London [England] and they're two guys, you know, white guys that we just took on.  And, I said, "What were you doing before?"  And, they said, "Well, we were in South Africa trying to do X and Y to get the people there and the companies there to realize that they need our services to get things done."  So, that's just what's happening in the world.  And, I don't, you know, I don't say that you're exporting all jobs out of the country.  I just think that's the nature of which you have other things here, here.  On the other hand, yesterday a guy wants me to help 'em says, the Saudis and other people begin to recognize that on this energy problem, come hell or high water, the United States is gonna learn how to use the gray and make escrow.  And, therefore, these guys who's got the money now wanna be on these new deals.  So, they're buying up these damn farms in the Midwest and that's just the way the nature, that's the way, you know, you, you're--(unclear) and I was on the phone just a while ago, somebody said, well, you know, and I, you know, and you gotta know these things.  And, I just think it's a tragedy that our young people aren't beginning to know them the way they should know them.
Story_ID: 568996
Speaker 1: Now, when you say, beginning to know them the way they should, what are you talking about?  What would, what would you--?
Speaker 2: Well, I just think the public schools are lousy.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And, I just don't think and I just think that the most of those that go to, to the colleges I think they're lousy.  Second and thirdly, you take 80 percent of the black kids that I see when they're in these law schools whether it's Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], or Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], or Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], they wanna spend all their time doing civil rights and they're not learning the business.  But, if you learn the business, you can, you can help in civil rights.  I know, when I was in the Dilworth firm [Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish, Levy and Coleman; Dilworth Paxson LLP, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and we represented Levitt and Sons [Levitt and Sons, Inc.], you know, they'd built Levittown, New York; Levittown, New Jersey; and Levittown, Pennsylvania.  They were building Levittown, Pennsylvania. Bill Levitt [William J. Levitt] purchased fifteen thousand acres of land in Levittown, Pennsylvania.  And, the guy that sold him the land, right next to it, he had the waterfall, and he just assumed that he was getting the water.  It turned out that under the deed he didn't get the water.  If you got fifteen thousand acres of land and you don't have any water, you certainly can't have people living on it.  And, so, we represented Bill Levitt and I was able to prove to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that the guy that owned the water was really a public utility so he had to sell it to me.  At the same time, Bill Levitt, and this is way back, I'm talking about 1960, would not sell to blacks.  And, he's having Levittown, Pennsylvania, wouldn't sell to blacks and the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] sued him.  I wouldn't represent against him, but I did tell the firm, "Well, they can't win that lawsuit because in the allegations the only thing they're saying is that Levitt gets certain federal money but, the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't apply to the federal government."  And, so, in the federal district court, the case got thrown out.  And, I told Bill Levitt, I said, "I'm pretty sure you're gonna win in the circuit.  But, do you think you're going to be able to keep on doing this, because you got a business where you depend 85 percent on governmental money and if you don't wake up."  So, he said, "Well, why don't you call Thurgood Marshall and we'll discuss it."  And, we spent two days discussing, we finally settled it.  And, he said, that after the first three hundred homes, he would open up and sell to blacks in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Long Island [New York].  The reason why he had the three hundred limitation, he didn't want 'em all to move into one ghetto, he want to spread over the whole place.  And, so, that solved that problem.  You know what happened three weeks later?  Who becomes secretary of HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]?  Bob Weaver [Robert C. Weaver]--
Speaker 1: Bob Weaver.
Speaker 2: The first black--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, Bill Levitt called me up and said, "For goodness sake Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.], you're the smartest guy in the world.  Can you imagine what my life would be now, if I had to go to that guy asking him for some help?"  (Laughter) And, so that, you know, but, that's, that, I'm serious, and these kids don't, these kids don't realize that.  And, I think it's, I think it's a great, I think it's, you know, a great tragedy to them.
Story_ID: 568997
Speaker 1: This is the question I have for you, like here at this firm [O'Melveny and Myers LLP] how many, how many black partners are, I mean, how many black partners are there?
Speaker 2: Well, we have as far as I know, we probably have, probably 'bout eight, nine, or ten.  Now, that doesn't mean that in a new hiring class, that we don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know--
Speaker 2: We try to hire 'em.  But, you know, I get a guy, Har- guy went to Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], he's on the Law Review [Harvard Law Review] and he comes here and, you know, but he wants to do is civil rights work.  But, now he's teaching at George Washington Law School [George Washington University Law School, Washington, D.C.], you know.
Speaker 1: But, do you think that's the problem, because I really, it's a problem that, that there, the numbers, the numbers in firms have not changed dramatically.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I mean, like twenty, I came out of law school twenty-four years ago.  They haven't changed that much.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, for the women they have (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, women, women--
Speaker 2: No, really--
Speaker 1: Women, women--
Speaker 2: I got a girl,--
Speaker 1: The women.
Speaker 2: --Jessica Miller [Jessica D. Miller].  A young lady here, she can't be more than thirty.  We just made her a partner.  In all of these Merck [Merck and Co., Inc.] suit, she is running them.  I don't--she doesn't into court but, you know, she does all the stuff and that's what she does.  She's got two or three children and husband's a lawyer too.  And, that's what she does.  On the other hand, I--wonderful guy from Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] who was so good at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] that he won the Oscar Wilde Prize [ph.] which was for the best economic student.  He goes to Yale, then the works for the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] for three years.  He comes here, I put him in with Goldman Sachs [Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.].  I put in government work.  But, but all he wants to do, one is to go off and campaign for Kerry [John Kerry] (makes noise), and now he's working someplace else.  I mean, you know, you just--and he's gonna end up forty or forty-five and therefore he's gonna miss the opportunity.  Whereas if he, you know, if he--I get other, you know, another guy whose son, a white guy, son's the president of the chief executive of Lockheed company [Lockheed Martin] out here, went to Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.], and he's doing hedge fund work.  You know, he's not anywhere near as bright as the other guy.  But, that's, I mean, he's, you know, he's, but just, they just don't do it until they learn that.  Now, that doesn't mean that once you get it that you can't go off and do this other stuff.
Story_ID: 568998
Speaker 1: So, Mr. Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.], what do you think then that the chances are?  Because remember, I mean, when you were telling the early part of your story--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, the focus was, you know, that you strategically chose business.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That that was, you know, the next frontier, you hear that even with other people saying business is the next frontier many years after you first start talking about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, there's not enough in the pipeline in some respects, do you think, what do you think the answer is?
Speaker 2: I think you gotta tell the kids that that's what got to do.  And, then that, you know, for one, which you will disagree with it, I just think it's a tragedy that in a black community 90 percent of the people always vote for the Democrats.  Now, if you go to the Jewish community, 35 percent will vote for the Republicans.  If you go to women, they don't split their--nobody else is split that way.  And, that's just dumb.  That doesn't mean that you might not think that one party's better than the other.  But, you've gotta be in both parties.  You gotta be in both businesses and I see too many white kids really not that bright.  But, they come down from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or some place, they go to work for these damn investment firm and they end up--I mean, you look at The Wall Street Journal today.  The average bonus for a guy who does trading in one of these venues, is $2.5 million.  And, that's, you know, you, if you got 'bout five, $2.5 million, you buy yourself a house, you take care of your kids and you're able to do things.  And, another guy, you know, working at, work at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and he's been there ten years, now he's gonna leave.  And, I said, "Gee, why do you work at Columbia?"  You know why he worked at Columbia for ten years?  Because by working there ten years, it meant that any of his children can go to any Ivy League school they get admitted to and they--and all their tuition is paid.  So, he's picked up a couple of million dollars and therefore he, now he's gone off and he's got his own business.  And, I just think that you, you know, if you real--just read that book on Alexander Hamilton.  And, that's what the other people do.  And, I saw too many poor white kids come out of Kentucky and, and yet come to these good schools and they get into business rather than to do these other things.  Or, take A.B., A.B. Culvahouse [Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr.] and I went to his house, Ten Mile, Tennessee, I mean, country boy, but he's making about 3 or $4 million now.  And, I just think that that's what has to be done and you gotta teach people how to do that.  And, these kids are bright.  I mean, I mean not, you know, when I was in the Air Corps [U.S. Army Air Corps], I used to play poker with some 'em.  They could beat the hell outta me playing poker so I know they can count and they can do these things, and they just don't do it.  And, that's what I think is the, is a tragedy.
Story_ID: 568999
Speaker 1: Now, what do you think though about the black community and what is needed?  Like we were just talking during the break that you said that you think we have twenty-five years to correct ourselves.  That's not that long.
Speaker 2: No.  No, it isn't, no.
Speaker 1: That's really almost one generation.  That's one generation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what, how do you think that it could be done?
Speaker 2: Well, I think there, well--
Speaker 1: I don't think it'd be done in one generation, but go on Mr. Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.] (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, well, I mean, it has to be.  I mean there's too many other people (laughter)--in one generation, you, you go up on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.], you'll see some businessman that one generation were poor as a church mouse and now they go it, you know.  But, first things is the public schools.  And, that's a, no that's a very simple thing.  You know, I talked to two governors, both Democrats, in two states, and I asked them, "Any new person that wants to become a school teacher, do they have to take an exam?"  The answer's yes.  Now, I said, "Governor how many of your existing teachers could pass that exam today?"  Each of 'em said, "Not more than 25 percent."  But, the others couldn't.  Why?  Very simple.  When I grew up, if a young lady finished Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] or some place or, or, you know, Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], and was good, the only thing they could do is teach.  Now, those are the people coming into the law firms, go to the banks, and they do other things.  And, same way in the black community.  You go as well-trained people, they go off in these other jobs and so they're gone.  And, that's, and so you gotta replace 'em.  Now you say, where are you gonna get that talent from?  It very simple, one, you got a lot of kids who just finished college who would love to teach for two or three years, and then they wanna go off do something else.  Second year, you got a large group of men and women now forty-five who have just come out of the [U.S.] Army.  Those people know more about the world than you ever will know about the world.  At forty-five they get a good pension, but they'd love to get a second job teaching.  And, thirdly, you've got a lot of men and women in these corporations that come out at fifty and they are retiring because they're not gonna become the chief executive, and they'd love to teach.  And, that's where you get, get your people.  And, you gotta tell the business community that this is, this is important and you gotta pitch in the money to help the school teachers take a test.  And, if they flunk, you gotta have some way to get 'em out on pension, do something else with 'em.  But, you gotta get 'em out of the system.  And, that's, you know, every, and then so that's, that's one thing you have to do.  And, secondly, you just gotta, you know, get kids to realize that you could be very effective in doing what you wanna do, if you're in the room where the guy there is making up his mind what to do, and that's what you, that's what you have to teach.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the black community, what do think it needs to do besides, you know, being not just signing up for the Democratic Party.  I mean, what else, what else, do you think it need (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think it has to, you know, realize that there's a lot of opportunity (laughter).  You gotta go out and get it, and you know, and you go to college, you gotta work for it.  It's not just a simple thing where you just can pick it up.
Story_ID: 569000
Speaker 1: Integration.  You fought for integration.  Do you think it was--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I think integration, I think integration works if once you get it, you know what to do with it.  I mean, you know, you work and you, you gotta, you know, know how to get trained in what to do.  I mean, I know, my, my, you know, my sister [Emma Coleman Dooley] when she finished Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], she then taught at some school in Virginia.  And, that place, they had a terrible white mayor.  He, he was the most prejudiced guy in the world.  And, they said, "Well, we gotta get a new mayor."  Well, none of 'em were registered to vote.  And, at that time, Virginia had the rule that you had to take an exam before you could vote.  And, when you took the exam if you lived in the state and over twenty-one for more than three years, you had to pay three years back poll tax.  And, the exam, they gave you a blank piece of paper, they didn't tell you the question, and they didn't tell you the answer.  You had to write the question and the answer there.  And, so, my sister and her husband [Wilburn Dooley], for two years, every night after school, would have the people, and learn 'em how to do this.  So, they finally passed the test, they kicked the guy out of the thing, and they got what they wanted.  I just think that's what, that's what you have to do.  And, you're one of these, you know, these other kids, these other kids do it.  I mean, this is not, well, you didn't come for all that.
Story_ID: 569001
Speaker 1: In nine--is it 1995? You won--you were awarded under Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], the Presidential Medal of Freedom (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  How did that feel?  You know, I mean, first of--
Speaker 2: Oh, great, great.  Well, I mean, I was on fire.  I always felt guilty because I fed the guy for a year.  He was my son's [William T. Coleman III] roommate a Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut].  The first year, they had no money, so I (laughter) so, I, no really.  And, I, and you know, and my son, he was a Republican at one time.  But, he comes home one day and said, "You know, Bill Clinton is running for president.  I used to pick the guy's underwear up, I really gotta support him."  So, he supported him.  He became general counsel of the [U.S.] Army.  And, I, you know, and so I know Bill Clinton, so, he, you know.  I fed him for a whole year.
Story_ID: 569002
Speaker 1: Now, your children, give your, you have three children.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, their names?
Speaker 2: Well, my, the, the oldest one is a boy.  He's William T. Coleman III.  And, my daughter--
Speaker 1: He's a lawyer, right?
Speaker 2: He's a lawyer in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] now.  And, my daughter is Lovida H. Coleman, Jr. [Lovida Hardin Coleman, Jr.] because when she was born, she was the first new generation of girls and everybody else had the name of Matilda.  And, he said, no, I say, "I'm gonna name it after my wife [Lovida Hardin Coleman]," so nobody could jump on me for that.  And, then the third one is Hardin L. Coleman [Hardin Coleman], who is in, he's a, he's the deputy dean of the School of Education in Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Education, Madison, Wisconsin].  But, he, he was one that came home from Williams [Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts] and said, "I know you want me to be a lawyer, but I'm not gonna go to law school.  Because if I go to law school it means that for the rest of your life, the Coleman family will be known as father dominated.  And, I don't want that.  I don't think you want that."  He said, "I wanna teach."  So, he taught several prep schools.  He then married a wonderful girl and they went out to Shanghai [China] and he taught--you go to Shanghai for two years and called me up one day and said, "Look, I realize I'm the only Coleman kid that didn't get three years of graduate school, I've just been accepted to get a Ph.D. at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] in psychology, I assume you'll pay for it."  So, he did it.  The day he graduated, Donna Shalala hired him at the University of Wisconsin.  He's now head of the department there.  So, he's a, he's done that.
Speaker 1: You must feel incredibly blessed.
Speaker 2: Well, we've been lucky.  Well, the mother, they had a good mother.  I mean, she knew how to take care of 'em.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was that a terribly reflective time for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I, no, I just did it over time.  And, obviously, somebody else has to really write and make it better.
Speaker 1: I know, but was it reflective?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, I think, I think, I think it is.  But, you know, obviously, I'm pretty sure everybody reads it, will--sounds too much like a lawyer because I discuss cases.  I talk about the Brown case [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] and what I thought about it and other things I did.  And, I testified against Bob Bork [Robert Bork] when he was up and I explained why I did that.  And, I talked about when I was in the government, what I did and everything.  And, I let him read the conclusions of (laughter)--
