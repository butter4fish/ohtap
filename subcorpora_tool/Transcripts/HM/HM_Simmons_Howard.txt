Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers archive.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Observing is Thomas Jefferson.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Howard Drayton Simmons: H-O-W-A-R-D, D-R-A-Y-T-O-N, S-I-M-M-O-N-S [HistoryMaker Howard Simmons].
Speaker 1: Now, you were telling us off camera that--you know, about, about the meaning.  Can, can you tell us about what Drayton stands for?
Speaker 2: Drayton is my mom's maiden name [Lillian Drayton Simmons] and Howard is my father's middle name [Luther Simmons].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I, I like that.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, do you have any nicknames or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No nicknames.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Six, eleven, forty-three [June 11, 1943], Pittsburgh, PA [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a commercial photographer.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Five, twenty-five, ten--2010 [May 25, 2010].
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are at The HistoryMakers, 1900 South Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.
Story_ID: 613946
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Thai food.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, that would be difficult to say.  I, I was--actually, no, I, I like Chicago [Illinois].  So, that--that's an interesting answer I suppose.
Speaker 1: Right.  Hardly anybody says that, but--I mean, they, they don't say they don't like it, but they don't say they prefer it.  The last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or expression or saying?
Speaker 2: It's kind of a poem and maybe I should not say who says this, but seize the time, let not the moments wane, so precious is this day for even now it slips to eternity.
Story_ID: 613947
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side [Luther Simmons], but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Lillian Ella Drayton: L-I-L-L-I-A-N, E-L-L-A, D-R-A-Y-T-O-N [Lillian Drayton Simmons].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Place of birth is--oh, I wrote that down.  I had to--it's South Carolina and it's July 9th and--thank you so much for that.
Speaker 1: July 9th.
Speaker 2: Right and--
Speaker 1: What, what year is it?
Speaker 2: Yes, look on here.  I had to look all this up because--Sumter, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Oh, Sumter, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 7/9/1900 [July 9, 1900].
Speaker 1: And what, what--okay.  Nine- 1900?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And, what, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family's history.  How far back can you trace them and what do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, it's kind of--kind of difficult.  They moved to--they moved to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and the--she moved with my, my aunts and they were close when they moved to, to Pittsburgh, my Aunt Ada [Ada Drayton], my Aunt Tessie [Tessie Drayton Butler] and Aunt Beatrice [Beatrice Drayton Price], and they supported one another and helped each other when they moved, and they were--they were very close.  We had some family in Philadelphia [Philadelphia] and as a matter of fact, when my mom passed, they really helped me because even when I came home from the [U.S. military] service, I lived with them and that--they were very instrumental in my being able to, to even do what I'm doing, as a matter of fact.  Because--well, I don't know if you wanted me to get--me to get into that right now because you asked me the question about family.
Speaker 1: Yeah, just--
Speaker 2: We'll stay away from that.  And I think we had a very close family and not many of the family other than them who I had my--some of my cousins and--there in Pittsburgh.  But there wasn't--there wasn't a lot of us there in Pittsburgh because since they came from the South, there weren't a lot of us.  I really didn't have other than the, the family--my immediate family and them, there weren't a whole lot of us there in Pittsburgh.  There were some in Philadelphia, but a lot of them--a lot of us were in the South, a lot of my family.
Speaker 1: And what, what are the stories about your mother's side of the family in the South?  What, what, what kind of work did they do?  Are there any stories from the, you know, the Civil War or slavery or any, any of that?
Speaker 2: Well, there were stories about in--being in the South.  You know, there were some that my Aunt Ada would tell us about.  And there were even situations where I know one of my cousins far back was almost lynched where they came into the, the house to get him and she was telling us how he hid under a bridge and they almost took him away from the house.  And, of course, just the general stories of how it was living in the South and type of work that, you know, they did at that time.  And it was--I'm--it's a shame I don't know as much about my history and I wish I knew more about it.  And I know (background noise)--do you recall when one of the firemen were, were killed in the South, recently in South Carolina?  And I know their--one of, one of them was named Drayton [James "Earl" Drayton] and there's probably an excellent chance that I'm related because I--I've--I run into--I run into Draytons very, very seldom and that's a very rare name.
Speaker 1: It seems like there was a track star named Drayton in the '60s [1960s] down there.
Speaker 2: But I know if it's--if it's from South Carolina and anywhere near that area, Sumter, there's an excellent chance I'm related.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause there aren't that--aren't that many Draytons around.
Story_ID: 613948
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Lillian Drayton Simmons] say about--did, did, did she actually grow up in South Carolina or, or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  And she moved, sh- they all moved to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] around the same time--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --and--
Speaker 1: --did they go to school in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Mom didn't graduate from, from high school.  And my oldest daughter did some research on history in my family.  Robbin [Robbin Simmons Mugnaini] did some research and she's still doing that to find out more and more about my family.  Because I don't know that much about the history of my family on my mom's side and--which is kind of a shame.  I need to know more about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, about what--how old was she when they moved to Pittsburgh, she and her sisters?
Speaker 2: I would--let's see, it's--I'm thinking in their twenties, right, right, in their twenties.
Speaker 1: So it would be in the 1920s.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  She used to talk about how they used to party, and they were--when they moved here, she and, and mainly my, my Aunt Tessie [Tessie Drayton Butler], she and my Aunt Tessie.  Because my, my Aunt Bea [Beatrice Drayton Price] was, was very, very staid and, she, she didn't go out much at all.  And my Aunt Bea was the oldest one and so she didn't, didn't go out much.  But my Aunt Tessie and my mom used to--they were party girls.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was a, she was a beautician.  She had a hair salon.  And her husband was a barber and he had a barbershop in Pittsburgh.  So, they--and they bought--they both had a barbershop and hair salon together in Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she live in the Hill District [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: They had--their barbershop and hair salon together was in the Hill District.  And my Aunt Bea, I'm trying to remember--my Aunt Beatrice was a, a seamstress and she used--she, she was a seamstress.  Now you're bringing this back and I'm thinking about certain things.  I remember going to the barbershop to get my hair cut by my Uncle Eddie [ph.].  And see you're bringing--this is interesting to bring back some of the things that I remember.  And I remember we would go down to their--they--after, my Aunt Tessie got a divorce and so--my Aunt Ada [Ada Drayton] never got married and we, we would go down to visit them and, and they lived in East Liberty in Pittsburgh, which is a area not too far from where we lived.  And so the three of them lived together and we would--I, I remember how we would always look forward to going down to, to visit them, and it was just a, a very warm time.  So, that was the, the--the closest family unit, was my Aunt Tessie, Aunt Bea and Aunt Ada that, that meant so much to us.  My sister [Margaret Simmons Jackson] and I, we would visit them.  That was the, the closest time.  We visited them frequently.  We--as far as other members of the family, we did have others, but as far as on my mom's side, unless we went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to visit my Aunt Renna [ph.], my Aunt Renna in, in Philly, that was probably it in Pittsburgh.
Story_ID: 613949
Speaker 1: Now your mother [Lillian Drayton Simmons] and her sisters kind of migrated to, yeah, Pennsylvania together, you know, one being in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and then rest of them in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  Did, did you ever meet your, your grandparents at all?
Speaker 2: No.  My, my grandparents on both sides died before I knew them, perhaps before my birth.  That's why I tell people that I--my genetics, perhaps, don't lead to longevity (laughter).  So, no, I never knew any of my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there were never any reason--never any reason to go back to Sumter County [South Carolina] to see anybody or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which might be interesting to, to do.  Maybe I should, should do that.  I think--I think my, particularly my oldest daughter [Robbin Simmons Mugnaini] would like to, to do that because she has been doing a follow up on our history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's a famous county--I mean, where they did the PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] special on Reconstruction they focused on Sumter County.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a famous black congressman down there during Reconstruction [George Washington Murray] that had a real dramatic story in Sumter County.  I'll think of his name in a minute.  But, but--okay.  So, did your mother have anything particularly noteworthy to say about growing up, you know, in the--
Speaker 2: No.  No.  We--it seems that we talked more about her life in Pittsburgh than we did her life as a young woman in, in Sumter [South Carolina] because I frankly didn't know much about Sumter until I talked to my sister [Margaret Simmons Jackson], and she mentioned Sumter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, so your mother became a beautician in Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: No, Mom did work--she worked for people cleaning house.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  All right.  Somehow I got that mixed up with someone else.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was my, my--
Speaker 1: Your aunt?
Speaker 2: Aunt, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Aunt Tessie [Tessie Drayton Butler].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she did what's called day work and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Right, day work, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she was able to come back home, you know, afterwards 'cause it--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  And it was amazing how little money she made cleaning house.  And when I look back on that, it's, it's kind of a sad situation because now I have letters from her that she wrote me in the [U.S. military] service and I think about the fact that while I was in the service, she was still doing that kind of work.  This is when my father [Luther Simmons] had passed years before that.  And it's--it brings a tear to my eye to read those letters, that she's still going to work on the streetcars and buses to make it to work, making just a pittance.  So, that's what she did.  But, she, she kept things going after my father, father passed and with the help of my, my aunts because they helped her.
Story_ID: 613950
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Luther Howard Simmons: L-U-T-H-E-R, H-O-W-A-R-D, S-I-M-M-O-N-S [Luther Simmons].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Is April 1st, 1896.  I figured that--when I figured that out, it's--it seemed like so long ago (laughter).  They had--they had us at--a rather--
Speaker 1: Late in life.
Speaker 2: Late, late time in life and when I talked to my sister [Margaret Simmons Jackson] about this, she said that they actually had a couple children before us who, who passed away which, again, sometimes when you start delving back into time, you learn a few things that can be surprising when you talk about these things.  And I understand, too--see, my sister was a, a preemie.  She held the record for size of a surviving premature baby in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  She was one pound, fifteen ounces.  She was just under two pounds.
Speaker 1: Gee whiz.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  Okay, I guess let me get away from that and get back to, to--
Speaker 1: Well, where, where was your father born?
Speaker 2: Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Wilkinsburg.
Speaker 2: Right outside of Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I say right outside, it, it was next to Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so what do you--what can you tell us about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, they--we did visit them a lot.  They--he has his brother, Uncle Johnny [ph.], and he had five children, and we would visit them a lot.  And other than that, that is as--that's about all of his family that I know of or saw.  Honest--he had a sister who decided that she would pass on to the other side and decided--and this is years ago so, and, again I didn't know any of his parents.  They passed be- .  So, I didn't--as far as grandparents, I didn't know them.  And his--our cousins, we would visit a lot and see them.  They were--the guys played football and they were, they were football stars at their high school.  And my--I had a great father.  He got me into model airplanes, model trains, and he spent a lot of time with me.  So, we had a very close family and--
Speaker 1: Now, now did your dad--so, did he grow up in Wilkinsburg or did, did he--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --did, did he grow up in Pittsburgh?  Okay.
Speaker 2: He grew up in, in Wilkinsburg.
Speaker 1: And, and did his brother stay in Wilkinsburg, the one you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --went to visit?
Speaker 2: Uncle Johnny, right.
Speaker 1: So it's like a--like a suburb or a, a--
Speaker 2: Right, like a suburb.
Speaker 1: --someplace on the outskirts.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, it's easily accessible or--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My father was a interesting person.  He, he did a number of things.  He, he was--oh, he, he had Bud Simmons and the Dixie Brownies; he had a band.  He--having never gone to school, he had a--he was a physical therapist, which--I found out other things that was interesting about my father.  I, I found out one very interesting little anecdote.  Dad decided he was going to have a healing service in downtown Pittsburgh, and he had a turban and had this big tent and so he was going to heal people.  And so, of course, this was, of course, to make money.
Speaker 1: This is faith healing (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, faith healing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so a lady rolled up in her wheelchair and Dad laid hands on her and she got up and walked.  And Dad took his turban off and left 'cause this was too much for him.  And my, my cousins told me about this.  This was not that many years ago that I found out about this and he would see this woman in Pittsburgh and cross the street.  And I did not find out about this until later.  We were just cracking up about this.  So, Dad was quite a character.
Story_ID: 613951
Speaker 1: He did just a lot of things.  He was--like I say, he started his contracting business.  He did painting.  He did--he did wall washing and he got into steam cleaning, cleaning buildings.  And the--this actually led to our problems because what happened, Mom [Lillian Drayton Simmons] would always tell him to get insurance.  She said, "Buddy, get insurance."  Her--she called him Bud.  He was--it was called Bud Simmons and the Dixie Brownies because that was his nickname, Bud, Bud Simmons [Simmons' father, Luther Simmons].  And she would call him Buddy and he would call her Pal.  That was his nickname for her.  She said, "Bud, get insurance, get insurance."  She kept saying that.  I remember her always saying that to him.  This is when I'm little; I'm five years old.  And we had a reasonably nice home.  And so what happened, he was steam cleaning this big building in downtown Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and when you steam clean the buildings and at this time, you put--you would apply a rubber like material to the glass or to the windows to protect them from the acid because you would apply acid, then steam clean the acid off while cleaning the buildings, and this would protect the windows from be--being etched.  And one of the workers apparently did not apply it properly.  So after they did the building and they stripped this rubber from the glass, all of the windows were etched and he was not insured.  And--now, in those days, if a company told you that you did something incorrect, you never questioned the product because that's just the way it was.  Nowadays you might say, well, your product was inferior.  So, of course, he took them at their word and I--in thinking back, there's always a possibility that the product was inferior.  So, he was sued, did not have insurance, and we lost everything we had.  We lost the house, he lost his truck, we lost--we had nothing but the clothing on our back and our Cocker Spaniel.  And we ended up in downtown Pittsburgh in the Bailey Hotel.  I'll never forget that.  And one room in down- in one of those slum hotels.  And we had no place to go.  And our [maternal] aunt, my Aunt Ada [Ada Drayton], found a place for us to live.  And so--it was downhill from there.  We must've moved a dozen times.  And I never realized how poor we were until I look back at some of the photographs of where we lived.  I don't think we never had any furn- no, we never had new any kind of furniture.  We even had used mattresses.  That's why if you recall in the story I mentioned bed bugs, it was--it was rough.  But, our family unit stayed together and as a family, we were--we were a happy family.  Through the rough times, we were happy.  And--
Speaker 2: How, how old were you when your, your father got sued and lost everything?
Speaker 1: I, I would say maybe seven, six or seven years old because we were living on Milwaukee Street not far from the Hill District [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] because that's where--we would--that would be called the Hill District, right?  And we were--the Bailey Hotel was right down in the Hill District, too.  I remember the Bailey Hotel, just, just raggedy hotel.  I'm sure you know the type of hotel, you know, and, and we had no place to go.  We had nothing.  They took it--they took it all.  They took everything.  So, that was quite an experience.
Story_ID: 613952
Speaker 1: But in the story, your father [Luther Simmons] really sounds like someone who really was versatile and talented--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --could do a lot of things, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he, he--and he was the type of person that would just do--find some way to, to make something happen.  And he spent time with me and that, that mean--that meant so much and it means a lot to me now and I think it made a difference.  Not think; it made a difference.  It makes a difference now because getting me into model airplanes, model trains--
Speaker 1: Did he continue to do that even after the, the--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --economic fall?
Speaker 2: Oh, right.  Right.  That's when--well, as I said, I was six or seven years old, maybe seven or eight years old and he got me into model airplanes and model trains when I was around ten.  And so I--I'd have model layouts and--for the--for the trains and I built the airplanes from kits.  And so that enabled me to get into constructing the planes and all, and that makes a difference now.  I'm very handy around the house and when I'm building things and repairing things around the house, I stop and say thanks, Dad, 'cause it makes a difference.  And building sets if I have to do that or when I had my studio and I would do things I'd say thanks, Dad.  And I'm, I'm really good at building things and I--I'm very meticulous when I build things, and that's made a difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now did your father's people, did they have any tradition of being from anywhere else other than Wilkinson?
Speaker 2: Wilkinsburg [Pennsylvania].  I--
Speaker 1: Wilkinsburg (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wilkinsburg, right.
Speaker 1: Wilkinsburg, yeah.
Speaker 2: I--that's a good question.  I'm going to call my cousins now in I think Minnesota.  I think that's where some of them have moved.  I'll--I'm going to find out about that, where, where maybe some of them came from to, to move to Wilkinsburg 'cause I've just known, you know, of them being in Wilkinsburg.  But, again, it's just a small nucleus because I, I don't have that much--and when it comes to extended family, it's kind of small.
Story_ID: 613953
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents [Lillian Drayton Simmons and Luther Simmons] met and, and fell in love and got married and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm trying to remember.  I--that, that question, I can't answer.  And I'm sure they might've told, told us, but I don't--I can't relate that one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But they, they, they did meet in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And I do remember they, they used to--they worked at a, a resort together, she as a--serving--that, that just came back to me, that they were working--oh, I'm trying to think if it was--it was--it was a place where I know wealthy people who had a boathouse or something like that, and that just, just kind of came back to me when you mentioned that because I'm picturing them there.  I don't know why--it seems like I saw an old photograph of them together out--hm, that's interesting that that just came back to me.  And they were--they were young.  And I don't think they met there.
Speaker 1: About when did they get married do you think?  I mean, do you have any idea?  And you were born in '43 [1943].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were they--were they married in, in the '20s [1920s]?
Speaker 2: Twenty-three [1923].
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty-three [1923].
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Okay, twenty years before you--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Isn't that amazing?  Why did that hit me?  Why did that hit me?  Boy, you're shaking some memories out of me and my memory is pathetic.  I tell people I have some-zheimer's, not Alzheimer's, some-zheimer's (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, that's better than Al- .
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so they got married in 1923--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --in Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: I'm amazed.
Speaker 1: And, so they, they had--by the time he lost everything, he had a chance to really accumulate some things.  They lived through the Depression [Great Depression]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know--
Speaker 2: Right, they talked about that.
Speaker 1: --together as a couple and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, by the time you came along, things were starting to turn a little bit I guess.
Speaker 2: I'm just amazed that that hit me, nineteen twe- wow, okay.
Story_ID: 613954
Speaker 1: Well, we always ask this question.  When, when you think about your parents' [Lillian Drayton Simmons and Luther Simmons] talents and personalities and their character and, and dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.  Because I try to do different things and I'm into music.  He even took some pictures.  Now, I can think of pictures that he shot and that's interesting.  Because he, he took photographs of a number of things and, and--when I say things, of certain jobs I know.  But he also had, I think--I think I remember seeing some 8 x 10 photographs that were shot by Teenie Harris [Charles "Teenie" Harris] in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  Yeah, I think he hired him for some photographs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my father was very creative.
Story_ID: 613955
Speaker 1: Now, did your father [Luther Simmons] ever talk, talk about where he got his musical training or?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't know--he played--I know he said he played banjo, mandolin, and guitar, and I don't know where he got his training for that.  But, I know he played at--in, in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], he played 'Show Boat' [Oscar Hammerstein II] in Pittsburgh.  I had a photograph--
Speaker 1: Oh, he played in the production of 'Show Boat'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had a photograph of him.  I don't know what happened.  I had the picture of him and the, the Dixie Brownies, and it disappeared and I--that breaks my heart.  He had a picture.  They had the bandanas on their head and my--and my Uncle Johnny [ph.] played, too.  He was in it.  He was in Bud Simmons and the Dixie Brownies.
Speaker 1: Now, how would you typify their music?  What kind of music was it?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but I, I guess it was kind of the--I suspect it was just a kind of New Orleans [Louisiana] type of music.  That's what I, I gather, but I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Kind of--
Speaker 2: --I really don't know.
Speaker 1: --country, jazzy stuff that they--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --used to play in those--
Speaker 2: And I, I never heard him play.  I never heard him play.  But, Dad wasn't--
Speaker 1: Oh, you never heard him play?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh, never.
Speaker 1: So he had given it up altogether by the time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you came along?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah, Dad just went into just all sorts of kind--just, just different kinds of things.
Speaker 1: So he had--he really didn't play at all when you--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I had my model train layout, Dad built houses for the layout out of matchsticks.  He made a matchstick village.  So, Dad was an interesting guy, interesting guy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds like it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Could he draw, too?  Was, was he--
Speaker 2: You know, I don't--I don't--I'd never seen him draw, but I wouldn't doubt that he could, yeah.  And--yeah, he, he passed away of--he had Parkinson's and I never knew that because I--you know how sometimes things are just there and you--that's just the way it is?  But his hand shook and I, I--that's just--Dad's hand shakes, and I didn't know about Parkinson's.  That's just Dad.  And he had asthma and--
Speaker 1: How, how old were you when he passed away?
Speaker 2: I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's--
Speaker 2: And it's interesting that I didn't grieve.  I was able to accept it at that age, at sixteen.  I was--just the reality that I was able to deal with it.
Speaker 1: So this is 1959 or so?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah, I, I was able to deal with it.  And I don't know how to explain that.  And of--you know, of course, I miss my father, but I was able to deal with it.  I was able to handle it.  I handled that very well.

Speaker 1: How long did you stay in the Bailey Hotel [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know how long it was.
Speaker 1: Was it years or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, it wasn't--unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Just a brief period of time.
Speaker 2: No.  It might've been a week.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: 'Cause my Aunt Ada [Simmons' maternal aunt, Ada Drayton] came to the rescue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you all moved in with her?
Speaker 2: Right.  We, we found--no, no, she found a place--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --for us to move.  Aunt Ada was interesting person, too.  She was--she was like the consummate old maid 'cause she never would party or she would--and she even looked like an old maid.  But every--there were always rumors of her having a boyfriend here and there, but the--and she had that look of the old maid, you know, and--but we moved in with I.B. Thompson [ph.].  He looked like a Fred Sanford [Fred G. Sanford] looking little guy.  We moved in with him and we always suspected that this was one of her secret boyfriends.  And so he was a guy who always would drink.  He was always drinking and he was a character.  Like I said, he looked like a little Fred Sanford.  And he would always--his favorite expression, every time he said something, he would always say, "That's for sure."  Every so and so--, "That's for sure."  And it seemed like he was always drunk.  I don't think he always was, but it seemed like he was.  But he was just this kind of a character.  And we lived upstairs in his house.  We lived--I remember it was a long stairway.  We'd go--we lived--I think we might've been on the third floor.  But, we lived with him for a while.  And then we moved down the street not far from where he lived in another house.  So, we--it seemed like we moved--Mom [Lillian Drayton Simmons] always said we were gypsies and said--we were always moving.  It seemed like we were moving from one place to another.  We're just like gypsies (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So did, did you move more than, than--that's like--
Speaker 2: About--
Speaker 1: --twice or three--
Speaker 2: About--oh, no.  About a dozen times.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't know why.  We just moved and I have no idea.  I don't know if it was because we couldn't pay the rent or what, but that's just the way it was.  And--
Speaker 1: Did your dad [Luther Simmons] ever go back to--I mean, what did he do for a living after--
Speaker 2: He was always doing something, always doing some contracting business.  I remember we moved into a storefront on Brushton Avenue and on the storefront, L.H. Simmons and Company [ph.] (laughter).  It was painted.  The whole thing was painted and it's--and, so you couldn't see through it, but it had L.H. Simmons and Company on the front, at the storefront where we lived.  And I remember I had my little--in the--you know how on, on storefronts sometimes they have a platform on the storefront, I remember I had my little railroad train on there, my HO gauge trains were on there.  So, that's just the way it was.  So, you don't question that.  That's the way it is.  And it wasn't something where we thought that much about it.  It was home.  Wherever we moved was home.
Speaker 1: And you could--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --bring your trains with you wherever you go.
Speaker 2: Yeah, everything.  That's--you know, that's home.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And one time we lived on one street and then we moved, it was right next--near a corner lot where there was a house and then we moved to that house that was on the corner lot.  So I--again, I never questioned why.  It's just the way it was.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: But we stayed--I was a happy child.  You know, we--I was never stressed, never had any problems, and we always moved in, in the area where we stayed in the same school district.
Speaker 1: So, is that--was that your--just you and your sister [Margaret Simmons Jackson]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 613957
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, now, what's your sister's name again?
Speaker 2: Peggy, or Margaret [Margaret Simmons Jackson].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We always call her Peggy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was born about when?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-nine [1939].
Speaker 1: Nineteen thirty-nine [1939].  So was--she was a little (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Four years--
Speaker 1: --older than you.
Speaker 2: --different.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Matter of fact, her birthday was two days ago.  I didn't call her (laughter).  I gotta call her.  She never misses my birthday.  She--my card arrives maybe five days before my birthday.  She never misses.  We're so different.  Peggy and I are just different creatures.  She's more like my Aunt Ada [Simmons' maternal aunt, Ada Drayton].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very much like my Aunt Ada.
Story_ID: 613958
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Going to kindergarten and chasing this little boy home because he called me a nigger.
Speaker 1: What--little white boy or?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a little white boy.  That's one of--and if there--at that time, the school [Madison Elementary School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] was predominantly white, I think, and that was the first time anyone called me a nigger.  And let's see, before that?  (Pause) Oh, I can go earlier than that.  We lived on Webster Avenue and there was a ice house around the corner, and it--the guy would--had a ice wagon driven by a Clydesdale.  And he would come out and you would hear the cloppety cloppety clop.  And he would, "Hey ice, hey ice."  And people would come out and tell him, you know, they wanted ice and he would take the big thing and throw the ice over his shoulder and bring it in, and we would have a--we had a ice box.  Makes me really sound old, doesn't it?
Speaker 1: I was--I, I remember that, too, actually (laughter).
Speaker 2: And I--2113 Webster Avenue; that's where we lived.  And I remember that--there's even a picture of me in front of the house with my--I remember--I can remember my skate was off and I had to go home and have somebody put my little skate on, those little skates that you would twist onto your shoes.  I remember we lived (background noise) there.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: I remember that and I remember the numbers man--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --(laughter) would come by.  That's, that's going back.  I must've been--I must've been three years old.
Speaker 1: Now, explain what numbers is 'cause somebody's gonna be watching this in the future who has no idea what we're talking about.
Speaker 2: The numbers--Mom [Lillian Drayton Simmons] would play the numbers (background noise).
Story_ID: 613959
Speaker 1: So the numbers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The numbers man would come by.  I remember Mom [Lillian Drayton Simmons]--I can remember Mom with her stockings rolled down (laughter), sitting and playing the numbers.  And the, the numbers man would--and I remember the stock, playing the stock market, and I really never really understood all that with the numbers.  And then she had a dream book and you would--there were certain dreams--I didn't really understand.  I guess there's certain particular aspects of a dream that you would figure out what a certain dream meant and--
Speaker 1: Translate it into numbers?
Speaker 2: And you'd translate it and it, it--you would get certain numbers.  And, so the numbers man would come by and you would play the numbers and you, you get your--I remember the little--the book that had the--had the, the little slip in there and you would--you would give him, him the one with the--and you would keep your copy.  And sometimes if Mom hit the numbers, you know, it was a big deal to hit.  And it was, of course illegal, but I--nobody bothered them.  And it was a big deal and they would call, Mom would call and talk about hit the numbers.  "I hit, you know, hit the numbers."  And it was--I, I always remember Mom playing the numbers.  It was a big deal.  But--
Speaker 1: It was kind of like a lottery but it was run by the--
Speaker 2: Right.  And I remember--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Sweiger's grocery store [ph.].  It was a Jewish grocery store down the street from where we lived and they would give us credit, and you--we could buy groceries from them and at the end of the week or whatever time, then we could pay and we could get groceries from them.  And that was just half a block from us and right down the street from the--.  And the ice house was around the corner and it was back up a little ways.  I'm--it's surprising all these things that are coming back.
Story_ID: 613960
Speaker 1: Did you pretty much live in the same neighborhood all the twelve times you moved or?
Speaker 2: No, this, this was closer to downtown.  This was--this was in the Hill District [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  The other time, this--well, they--this was the--the place where the ice house was was not far from where we bought our home, the home we lost, and this 2113 [Webster Avenue] was--I was born there at 2113 and I was born at home.  Dr. Franklin [ph.] was my doctor.  He delivered me at home.  And so that's where I lived until we moved to 3333 Milwaukee Street.  And, of course, that was a big deal because we bought a home at 3333.  And I'm, I'm surprised that I remember so much from Webster Avenue, but I do remember the ice house and Sweiger's grocery store [ph.] and just, just hearing that Clydesdale come out of the ice house so much and the guy bringing the big ice chunk into our--into the--he would bring it into the house and put it in our ice box.
Speaker 1: So, was the Webster street house the house that you all lost or the house--
Speaker 2: No, Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: --you, you--okay.
Speaker 2: Milwaukee Street.
Speaker 1: Milwaukee, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, Webster street is what you--you finally got another house at the--
Speaker 2: That was our first--where, where I, I was born.  I was born on Webster Avenue.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And that's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where the ice house was around the corner and Sweiger's grocery store was down the street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we--Dad [Luther Simmons] bought the house on Milwaukee Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's the one that you all lost.
Speaker 2: That's--we lost.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Because we were renting on Webster Avenue.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you ever--was he ever able to recoup enough to get another house?
Speaker 2: No, that's when we start moving.  We just moved and moved and moved and moved and moved.
Story_ID: 613961
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing up?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The sights?  The sand hill.  There was a big hill not far from our house on Milwaukee Street where all the kids would go and play.  It was a big red dirt hill and the kids would go up and play on that hill and just have a ball on that hill, and I would go there a lot.  And I was--I've always been a loner and I would go play by myself a lot, just by myself.  And Mom [Lillian Drayton Simmons] and I always had a connection, and there were times that I would go out and my playing and I would just have this urge and I'd have to go home.  I'd be playing with my buddies sometimes and I'd say, "I gotta go home," and I would just stop and go home.  And I would walk in the door and Mom would be with--talking with one of her friends and she would laugh and say, "See, I told you I'd bring him home."  And I--that's happened a lot, where I would just--I'd be just playing, having a ball and whatnot and then say, "I gotta go home."  I would just stop right in the middle of just having a--having fun and laughing and playing, and I would stop and say, "I gotta go home."  And I would just--whatever I was doing, I'd go home.  And Mom would say, "See," with her friends, and she would laugh and say, "I told you I'd bring him home."  And that, that really happened a number of times.
Speaker 1: So, so, she really thought that by thinking about you coming home, it would actually bring you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would have this insatiable urge to go home.  So, I was--that's--the sights and sounds, that's one.  And, of course, I mentioned the ice house and the sounds, that, that Clydesdale, cloppety cloppety clop, "Hey ice, hey ice," that's a sound.  Sights, the Boulevard of the Allies.  Smell, sights--that--Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] is steel--steel city and Dad [Luther Simmons] would--sometimes we're, we're going downtown at night, and in Pittsburgh, being the steel city, that's where all the steel mills were going along the river.  And at night, you'd go along and the sky was lit up golden brown, and--from the steel mills just cranking at night.  And you'd hear them, just the bang and the bang and the bang.  And you'd smell the sulfur and all in the air and, and it was just lit up at night.  It was just quite a s- just quite a sight to see at night, to see this and all this smoke is going into the air and not realizing, you know, this stuff was, you know, carcinogens just in the air.  But what a magnificent sight, to see that all along the river and it was called the Boulevard of the Allies where you would drive along the river.  And just to see the mills just pumping at night.  Oh, they went nonstop.  It's a steel city.  And that was just a magnificent sight 'cause you would see all that.  Also in Pittsburgh, even now when I go home to see--it's something you don't see anywhere else and I, I miss the hills, up along the mountains and the hills, you see little houses dotting all up along the hills.  You--it's something you don't see here, to look up there and there are houses up there all along, you know, and you got the roadways going like that along there and, and the little houses.  And I've thought I would like to document that because when you go and the sun is hitting up there along the hills and the trees, and since Chicago [Illinois] is so flat, you know, it's, it's flat, but there's a house.  You know, there are houses up there (laughter), you know.  And it's, it's really--and Pittsburgh has more bridges than any city in the world 'cause you gotta have bridges to get across from this hill to that hill.  And to see all the bridges and then to see all the, the houses, it's really something that's really something to photograph, and I've wanted to do that.  I've wanted to go with a really long lens to shoot the houses and, and it's really picturesque.  It's really something to see.  And living there, that's just the way it is, but when you've been away and then you go back, and to see--as I, I keep saying up there because, you know, here in Chicago it's just flat.  And one--it, it hit me one day.  I, I--we went back for my mother-in-law's funeral, and we're driving along and I think it was the Boulevard of the Allies, we're driving along the boulevard and I looked and said, wow, that--what a view.  That is really something.  And there's another scene.  You go through the--what they call the tubes.  You go through the, the tunnel that goes through the mountains in Pittsburgh, and when you come through, you see what is called the Golden Triangle where the three rivers converge.  And when you go through it, it opens up, and you're going across this bridge.  And that--that's quite a sight, when you go through there and bam, it just seems like it opens up and you see downtown Pittsburgh.  That's one of the sights and sounds that's always been a part of my life as, as a child.  So that's another one.  Sights, sounds, that's pretty good coverage.  Of course, Mom's cooking, her sweet potato pie.  She made great sweet potato pies, smelling chitterlings (laughter).
Story_ID: 613962
Speaker 1: So what about school?  Now, tell us about school.  Now, where did you start at grade school?  Did you--did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was at Mad- there was a little school up the street.  I think it was Madison [Madison Elementary School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], yeah.  That's the one where I was called a nigger (laughter) on the first day of school.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--I imagine you went to a lot of schools.
Speaker 2: No, I said we--oh, we managed to stay in the same district.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Somehow, we didn't change schools.  The, the elementary school was up the street in Milwaukee, on Milwaukee Street.  It was right up the street.  Then, we went to--my sister [Margaret Simmons Jackson] and I both went to a Seventh-day Adventist school.  And then from there, I went to--out in the--in the Homewood district [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], which was not far from Wilkinsburg [Pennsylvania].  We went to Crescent--I went to Crescent school [Crescent Elementary School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], which is an elementary school.
Speaker 1: Now, were your parents [Lillian Drayton Simmons and Luther Simmons] Seventh-day Adventists or?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: It just--
Speaker 2: It just--it's because it was a religious school.  It was like going to a private school, so--you know, that, that was I guess like sending your child to a Catholic school because it was good education.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know how they afforded that, but some--
Speaker 1: By the way, though, what denomination were they or were they religious?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: Baptist?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the name of the church that--was there one church or just--
Speaker 2: Ebenezer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It burned down recently.  It was a big thing in the news as a matter of fact, that Ebenezer Church [Ebenezer Baptist Church] burned down because it was an old iconic church there, kind of a landmark in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Was, was that a big, I mean, a part of your life growing up, going to--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, at that time it was.  Mom was in the choir, so it was a, a big, big deal then.  It--if it's necessary for me, me to continue as far as schools--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll, we'll keep--
Speaker 2: We went--
Speaker 1: --keep going.
Speaker 2: --went from--and then I went to Westinghouse High School [Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and--
Speaker 1: So, just two elementary schools?  I mean, just two different ones?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, we, we stayed within the same area somehow.
Story_ID: 613963
Speaker 1: When you were in grade school, I know you were interested in model trains and model planes and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What, what else were you interested in?  And you said you spent a lot of time by yourself?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would say--well, I had friends, but I really--I was still a loner even though I had, had friends.  And I think I, I--in a sense, I still am.  I have a lot of associates and a few close friends, but I'm the type of person that I can--I can just walk down the street by myself and have a wonderful time.  I've been downtown at night and just walked and just looked at this magnificent city.  I love Chicago [Illinois].  There's a certain enjoyment to solitude, being within myself.  And I remember going trick or treating by myself when I was about ten years old and, and, and really enjoying that.  I was barely able to make it home with two shopping bags full of candy and goodies.  So, I--again, a lot of friends--a lot of associates, a lot of associates and a few good friends, and I think you're fortunate--you're fortunate if you find one true friend in life, I think.  And, of course, there's my wife [Marva Simmons], very fortunate there.  So, in, in high school [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] as far as interests, it was music.  That was my main thing in, in high school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you--well, in--did you have a favorite subject in school?  Was it just, just mu- was it--
Speaker 2: Basically music.
Speaker 1: --music, basically.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In, in, in grade school--was it any, any different in grade school?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I wasn't in music in grade school at all.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Academia was never my high point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Model trains and model planes helped me get through Latin class.  You might ask, how's that?  Well, we had a Latin project and so they had a--they had like a, a fair that the school participated in for the--for the Latin class and I built a catapult and it was really nice.  That saved me (laughter), saved my butt.  And so it was--it was really nice.  I think I won some--I won some sort of award for it and, and so it--were it not for that, I probably would've failed Latin class, but that got me through.  So, my skill with building things got me through.
Speaker 1: It was a model catapult like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a medieval (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, the--
Speaker 1: --kind the--
Speaker 2: --yeah, like--
Speaker 1: --the kind the Roman Empire--
Speaker 2: Right, with the ropes and all twisting so it pulled back and, and so I built that, and it was pretty nice I might--I must say so, and--
Speaker 1: How big was it?
Speaker 2: It was about three or four feet long and it got--made it to the Latin fair and it made a pretty good showing.  So, that saved me.  Thanks Dad [Luther Simmons] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was, was that one of your projects that your dad helped you with or?
Speaker 2: No, Dad was--had passed by that time.  Um-hm, yeah.  So, I did that all on my own.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I did it from a photograph that I saw in one--in the Latin book.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I, I was into music and I was--
Speaker 1: What kind of music were you into?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in the band and in the orchestra.  And I made it to--I played first horn in the all-city orchestra and--
Speaker 1: This is the French horn, right?
Speaker 2: French horn, right.  It was--that's my favorite instrument.  And played in all--in what's called honors band, which was comprised of students from all over the--actually, all over the state, played under the direction of Arthur Fiedler.  Yeah, so that was--that was--that was great.  And, so that--the music, getting into music really helped me just throughout life, helped me in photography.
Story_ID: 613964
Speaker 1: By the time you were in high school [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], had you shot any pictures?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you--not really--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I mean not even with the family Brownie camera or?
Speaker 2: Actually, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, when I look in my scrapbook, I took a lot of pictures in the scrap- a lot, and even did some--a lot of playful things, shooting in the mirror and shooting our cat and dog.  You know, I shot them on the ground, in the grass.  I have pictures I shot of our cat; Terry [ph.], our dog, and our--Skippy [ph.], our cat.  I--when--in looking at our scrapbook, I'm looking at the number of the photographs that I shot with our Brown- my Brownie Hawkeye [Kodak Brownie Hawkeye].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--which is interesting.
Speaker 1: So--but, but you never thought well, you know, this could be a career (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Never.  No.
Speaker 1: --or anything--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --like that?
Speaker 2: I was home on leave and my real close friend, Devon Gaines [ph.], who is, is the one who introduced me to my wife [Marva Simmons], had a camera that he had borrowed from someone and it was one of those flip cameras with the bellows.  And those cameras, you estimate, okay four feet, you put it on four feet, and it had the aperture and showed a speed on it, and I knew nothing about these things.  But, I got the film and on--you get the piece of paper and it says bright sunlight with the film and you adjust the aperture and--which I didn't know it.  It had f/8, bright sunlight, 1/125th of a second, which I looked on the camera and there it was and I adjusted it and took pictures.  And, of course, in that you adjust shutter speed, aperture, and exposure--that was the first camera that had adjustments on it.  So, when I got the pictures back, they were sharp and they looked so different than box camera photographs which were--had sort of--you know, they weren't crisp.  And I looked and I said, wow, these look so nice, and I got another roll of film and shot some more.  I said, wow, these look so nice.  There were just crisp images.  And I was smitten and I started shooting just while I was on leave and I started taking more pictures and--
Speaker 1: This is when you were in the Air--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--I was home on leave from the [U.S.] Air Force.  So, I gave the camera back and I said, well, I've gotta get a camera.  So when I went back to the Air Force, I, I bought a camera and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 613965
Speaker 1: In high school [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], you were playing a French horn--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --classical music and--
Speaker 2: Classical and, well band music and I was in the band and then I got into the orchestra.  But the--I fell in love with the French horn after hearing it in--the horn in, in, in the movies.
Speaker 1: Now, that's I, I, I would--I intended to ask you about movies.  Did you attend a lot of movies in those days?
Speaker 2: Not really, no.  But, I just--I fell in love with the sound of the horn.  I just love the horn.  I love it now.  It just--I think the French horn is one of the most versatile instruments and it can--it gives such a dynamic--it has such a dynamic range.  It has probably the widest range of any instrument in the orchestra.  And it has such a--just extraordinary character of sounds.  A trumpet can't give you such a wide range of sounds and such--I mean, just--it's so--such a magnificent instrument.  I'm, I'm just--I love the French horn.  I love it.  I love it.  I mean, it can just about give me chills.  And you would--you can't have an adventure movie without French horns.  The horns are always just soaring and just singing and they can be--they can be sweet and somber and wonderful.  They can be exciting and blaring and just, just--it's just a wonderful instrument.  I love the French horn.
Speaker 1: What's The Delfonics song that opens with the French horn called?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: (Makes sound) (Singing), "Didn't I--"
Speaker 2: Oh, right, right.
Speaker 1: "--blow your mind this time?"
Speaker 2: 'Didn't I (Blow Your Mind)' ['Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)'].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  It's, it's the French horn.  And it can--gives you just--I mean, it's just such a, a--just--the instrument is just fantastic and it's one of the most difficult instruments to master.  Yeah.  Dale Clevenger is the first horn player with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.  Now, I got into playing a little jazz with the French horn.  Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: Now, you don't hear about that very much, jazz, French horn.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Julius Watkins played jazz horn.  I had an opp- a once in a lifetime opportunity.  I'll never have it again.  I used to go around and play some jazz, you know, go in the little places around Chicago [Illinois] after I got out of the [U.S. military] service--I mean, after I got out the--yeah, here, when I moved here, I was still playing my horn.  I played in Oak Park River Forest symphony [Symphony of Oak Park and River Forest] for a little bit.  So, I would go around, play some jazz here and there.  So, I go up north and I walk in and play some jazz, had my horn, and who is on stage trying to play jazz and not doing a very good job of it?  Dale Clevenger, Mr. Chicago Symphony Orchestra, one of the baddest horn players in the world.  He's world ranked.  Can't play jazz.  So, I had met him on an assignment I think for the Chicago--when I was working at the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times].  So, I, I, I had known him.  You know, I knew him.  Of course, I introduced myself.  Hey, you know, this is a bad dude, not on the stage trying to play jazz.  So, I could've blown him away.  I mean, I'm no--this guy--this, this guy is--I mean, really, this is Dale Clevenger, but with jazz, he wasn't doing it.  So, I said, wow.  I said, "Can I sit in?"  "Oh, oh no, no, you can't sit in."  He wouldn't let me.  The trumpet player who was on, on stage, too, I had seen him at some other places and I knew him, but I can't remember exactly how I knew him, but I was just like this is--oh my god, get up there and play--if I get up there, if I could only get up there.  And he wouldn't let me on stage.  And so I saw the trumpet player outside later.  I said, "Dale said I couldn't sit in."  He said, "Oh, man, you could've sat in.  He was scared of you."  That's what it--what it was.  Can you imagine a once in a lifetime opportunity to blow this dude away?  I could--that's one of those things you could just talk about forever 'cause he couldn't play jazz, but this guy--this dude is just incredible.  He just--he really is.  He's just a phenomenon--he's just the, the--he's the man.  Of course, he's not--he's not in the same--he's not in the same category as Barry Tuckwell.  Yeah, Barry Tuckwell is, is really bad.  But that, that was one of those experiences I just say if (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know your French horn players.  You know--you're into the French horn.
Speaker 2: Oh, the French horn is just--yeah.
Story_ID: 613966
Speaker 1: I got--this, this--you know, and Dennis Brain's no longer with us, but he was--he was a maverick.  He's one of these dudes, these--young guy that was really bad.  He was--he would come in late.  He wouldn't warm up.  He would come when they're ready to play and just sit down and play 'cause you always warm up.  And there was--this one conductor was upset 'cause he came in late.  So there was a horn part solo, he slowed the orchestra down just to mess with him because it was very difficult and he slowed it down.  And Dennis just did it, no problem, no big deal.  Now, he got killed in an automobile accident 'cause he was into sports cars and all--he was just really crazy.
Speaker 2: It's, it's just hard to imagine a swaggering French horn player.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was--
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: That's what he was.  He was a swaggering--he was--this was in England.  But, there--the French horn, it's, it's a very--it's a very difficult instrument.  I was--there's a, a, a very difficult piece, 'Konzertstuck' for horn and orchestras--orchestra ['Concert Piece for Four Horns and Orchestra'].  It's a four horn--four part horn piece.  And, see horns, the horn has such a range; you can go from really, really low to up into the stratosphere.  And so when you have a four part piece for horns, you can get a sound you can't get from any other instrument 'cause no other instrument has a range like this.  So, you can get--the four part harmony you get from four horns is extraordinary, but it's really, really difficult.  This, this piece is something else.  So, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra was playing it, so I had to go check that out 'cause I wanted to hear Dale [Dale Clevenger] hit this high note.  And this high note is up there.  And I went--he didn't hit it.  But if you didn't know the piece, you wouldn't know.  I was laying in wait and--hit that sucker.  He didn't hit it.  But, I found--he--the next night, he hit it, but he didn't hit it that first night, no, no, no.  And so I asked some other folks who went to see it, they said he hit it that second night.  But, 'Konzertstuck' for horn and orchestra is a bad piece, that piece.

Speaker 1: Let's get back to high school [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, now, were you involved in any clubs in high school or any--
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Other than band and--
Speaker 2: No, I really wasn't.  I was--the music thing was my thing and I wasn't into sports.  Man, I--sports is not my thing and it, it never was.  And so as, as we discussed earlier before, before this interview, you remember we discussed the ability to do anything you want if you put your mind to it?  Basketball, no way (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, did you try to basketball and you didn't like it?
Speaker 2: No, I, I remember when I was younger, I tried Little League, and I came to the realization that hitting a baseball is not my thing.  I could never do that.  So--and I have no problem accepting that.  Sports, it's just not my thing.  Though I--I'm a very determined type of person and there are things that I can do because I put my heart into things if I really want to do it and am real determined.  But, I don't have a problem with the fact that I'm just--sports is not my thing.
Story_ID: 613968
Speaker 1: I want to return to your, your father [Luther Simmons] passing away at age sixteen.  Now, you're, you're only sixteen and your father passed away and the family's kind of--is struggling--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --anyway.  I mean, how, how did--how did that affect your whole family?  You know, I, I know--I know you said you were kind of--you kind of had control of your emotions during that time, but your father obviously meant, meant a great deal to you and, you know, how did you--how did you all, you know, make it?
Speaker 2: My aunts.  My Aunt Ada [Ada Drayton], my Aunt Tessie [Tessie Drayton Butler], and Bea [Beatrice Drayton Price], they, they all rallied around my mom [Lillian Drayton Simmons] and, and they were always a very strong unit.  Remember, I said, they all kind of stuck together and they, they helped my mom.  And, I guess we'll, we'll get to that later, they, they were there and they were a factor with me, and a factor in helping me throughout, even later on.  So--and, and we can discuss that, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --later.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, that, that aspect of, of my family was a great influence.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I get the idea, too, from--in this interview that you--a lot of things you, you were still discovering and may, may still be discovering about your father in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in terms of faith healing and some other things that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, that was so funny.
Speaker 1: --that his--you never heard him play.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And he had a career as a musician and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a lot of different things were--yeah.  So, did you have a sense when you were coming up that it's okay to try new things because of, you know, some of the stuff--
Speaker 2: Oh, right.  I see a lot of him in me because there, there are things that I--that I have tried and I'm, I'm still trying.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's some things I'm working on now (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, when you were a senior in high school, I mean, did you have a favorite teacher or, or--in school or, or--
Speaker 2: That's the first time I've been asked that question.  A favorite teacher?
Speaker 1: Or a mentor or anybody like that around that--
Speaker 2: I can't--I can't say that I--that I had a favorite teacher or mentor, though there are--there are little things that I've taken from certain teachers that have affected me.  I had a English teacher who if you put was in a sentence, it was all over because the teacher said if you don't use was or is, it will force you to write better, and I found that to be true, and it does.  It forces you to write more creatively.
Speaker 1: If you don't use was or is--okay.
Speaker 2: In a sentence.  If you just eliminate that, it will force you to write more creatively.  And if you put that in a--if you had to write something and you put that in, you would fail.  If you had a was or a is in a sentence, and it forces you to write more creatively.  I enjoy writing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--all right.  So, that's another thing.  So, so did you write quite a bit in high school or did you--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, I like--I really liked to write, and I still do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you showed us a, a poem before we got started that you wrote--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for--and it was produced--
Speaker 2: And, and I like to write--I like to write music.  I like to write--I'm, I'm better with lyrics I can say because with music theory, music theory was never my thing, but I like to write lyrics.
Speaker 1: So how were your grades in high school?  Did you get decent grades?
Speaker 2: Mediocre.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Like I say, academia was never my thing.  That's why I say my--I think my daughters [Robbin Simmons Mugnaini, Tracey Simmons McGhee and Christie Simmons Edwards] have had to get their DNA relative to academics from Marva, my wife (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, did you know her in high school?
Speaker 2: I knew of her.  Interestingly enough, we went to the same high school.  I knew of her because of--my friend mentioned her name.  I said Marva Randolph [Marva Simmons].  Oh, I think she's probably like a combination between Linda Bennett [ph.] and Kate Gibson [ph.].  Yeah, she's kind of cute.  I think I'd like to meet her.  And then he took me down to her house and that's how I met her.
Speaker 1: This is in high school?
Speaker 2: Right, in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is Westinghouse?  George W. Westinghouse High School  (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Westinghouse High School [Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  Right.  Um-hm.
Story_ID: 613969
Speaker 1: So you--were you a senior then or were you--
Speaker 2: I was in the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 1: Oh, you were in the Air Force when you met your, your wife [Marva Simmons]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: I was home on leave.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And she was in high school?
Speaker 2: She was getting ready to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well speaking of college (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cheyney State, Cheyney State Teachers [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna--well, we'll, we'll get back to meeting her later, but, but when you were a senior then [at Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], what were your prospects?  What were you thinking about doing or do you have any aspirations for a career or?
Speaker 2: I was thinking about music and I heard that the Air Force was coming to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] to audition for the band.  And it wasn't the Air Force band, but it was an Air Force band.  You know, they have field bands and then they have the Washington Band [Military District of Washington Band].  The Washington Band is a professional organization.  And, of course, when I went down to audition, Channel 2 [KDKA-TV, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] was down there (laughter).  You know, so I was on camera when I was auditioning, which was a little--a little pressure.  So, they asked the newscaster, "Well, do you think he's gonna make it?"  And they said, "Ah, I think he--I think he made it," which was kind of an interesting experience.  But, I got my notification that I made it.  So, this is during the Vietnam era, so I did not do this to avoid going to Vietnam, but it quite possibly saved me from going to Vietnam.  I'll, of course, never know that, but it did--
Speaker 1: Now, what were your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) preclude--what?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: What were your political ideas, I'm sorry, in those days?  Did, did you have a sense of the Vietnam, what the Vietnam War was about?  Were you thinking about civil rights or--you know, the Civil Rights Movement was, was starting to really crank up.
Speaker 2: As far as Vietnam, I did not have any particular ideology relative to Vietnam at that time.
Speaker 1: This is '61 [1961].  It was really just starting.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  And--
Speaker 1: Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was the president.
Speaker 2: Right.  I think--of course, I couldn't help but be aware of the Civil Rights Movement, but I wasn't that really into--you know, being in Pittsburgh and all, you, you of course know--you're aware of all the things that are happening.  But, I, I would say I was somewhat insulated from the reality of it.
Speaker 1: Did, did you--did you--did your family like subscribe to the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] and, and--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Courier, right.
Speaker 1: --Ebony, Jet, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you get most of the magazines?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that, of course, was a part of--that was just a part of black culture when, when it comes--what was there?  You know, that, that was part of, hey--
Story_ID: 613970
Speaker 1: And were you aware of Teenie Harries [Charles "Teenie" Harris], the photographer for the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] that--
Speaker 2: Right because he was the photographer.  And I didn't--I never considered that as--again, I never thought of being a photographer, but Teenie Harris was the man.  That was the photographer.  So, that name was just a, a part of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  He was--he was the photographer.  When you saw the paper, his, his name was there and I believe he took some pictures for my father [Luther Simmons] because my father had photographs of some of the buildings that he steam cleaned.  And there's a picture of--I don't know if he took this picture of my father.  My father is on one of the--he had the planks going across from ladders and he and his guys are kneeling on the plank across with some of his men that worked for him, and I don't know if Teenie Harris shot that, but I'm sure there are pictures that, that Teenie Harris shot for my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he was a busy photographer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I thought I'd ask about that.  Now--okay, so he's pretty well known figure in Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Ahmad Jamal is from Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: Right.  What about some of the other people in the district?  I heard that--
Speaker 2: Ahmad Jamal, what was--xylophone--
Speaker 1: Lionel Hampton.
Speaker 2: Lionel Hampton from Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: George Benson I heard--was it Little Georgie Benson?  Wasn't he downtown?  I don't know if he was around when you were coming up, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know.
Speaker 1: And they, they called him Little Georgie, I think, Benson and--
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  Pitts- Pittsburgh has--there's a lot of notables from Pittsburgh, so small city but a lot of--
Speaker 1: August Wilson would've been about your age.  Did you know him at all or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or Rob Penny the playwright or--okay.
Speaker 2: No.  There was someone else I just heard recently is from Pittsburgh.  Well, I don't want to spend too much time trying to think about that.
Speaker 1: Well, well, what about in your school?  Were, were there any, any of the students, you know--
Speaker 2: Liscio [Tony Liscio], football player from Texas [Dallas Cowboys].  He--we had a--we always had a championship football team, but only a couple guys made it.  Other than that, I can't, can't think of anyone.
Speaker 1: And the high school [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] was a mixed high school or, or was it all--
Speaker 2: It began mixed and later on it became about--now it's all black, but it became--when we--when I graduated, it was probably, oh, 98 percent African American.
Story_ID: 613971
Speaker 1: So, after auditioning for the Air Force band, you were on your way to the [U.S.] Air Force?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That, that summer that--
Speaker 2: Right.  That, that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) after graduating [from Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: That was very exciting.
Speaker 1: So, where were you sent?  Where, where did they send you?
Speaker 2: I was sent right here in Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Went right there in Rantoul, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Is that Chanute [Chanute Air Force Base, Champaign County, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yep, good 'ole Chanute.  But first what happened, I--in basic training about a week after I--after I was in basic training, I came down with an incredible headache and I thought my head was going to explode.  And I went from--the TI, training instructor, asked, "What's wrong?  You constipated?"  He put it a little more flowery than that.  And, so he sent me to the clinic in the ninety degree hot sun, had to walk there.  So, I got to the clinic and I waited and waited and they looked at me and checked me out.  So, they say, oh, go to clinic number two, whatever it was.  So, I walked to that clinic in the hot sun and waited and waited and they checked me out.  Well, go to the other clinic.  So, I went to another clinic in the hot sun.  So, I finally saw a doctor who knew something and it was--it was a colonel as I recall.  The next thing I knew, I was in the ambulance headed to the hospital and then into an alcohol and ice bath to get my temperature down right into the emergency room--I mean, into the operating room.  And I had acute sinusitis.  All my sinuses were filled with pus, frontals, maxillaries, and they had to immediately get the, the, the pus out, which was in all four of my sinuses, and if they had not operated right then, there was a possibility it would've--well, they said it would've gone right into my brain.  And so I was in for about a month in the hospital and Mom [Lillian Drayton Simmons] couldn't afford to come down, you know.  She was, you know, of course in panic mode.  And so they had to flush out my sinuses every day for three weeks and in a sense, that was maybe a fortunate thing because we had no medical insurance.  And that would've happened, I'm certain, had I been home.  So, that's--that was an interesting experience that happened to me in basic training.
Story_ID: 613972
Speaker 1: And then after that, I went to Chanute [Chanute Air Force Base, Champaign County, Illinois].  I was at Chanute for about a year and a half and then I went to the Philippines.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This the first time you've been out of the United States?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Were they using Philippines as a staging area for Vietnam in, in those days?
Speaker 1: I--to--yes, to some degree.  But Subic, Subic Bay was there for the [U.S.] Navy and that was--they had a big naval base there [U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, Philippines].
Speaker 2: How do you spell that, Subic?
Speaker 1: Subic.  S-U--
Speaker 2: Subic, oh.
Speaker 1: I think it's S-U-B-I-C.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You'll have to check that one out.  But, that was a really, a really good assignment because we would rehearse in the morning for about two hours maybe and the rest of the time was ours, you know, where we could rehearse on our own if we wished.  And we were stationed--well, not stationed, we--our barracks was out in the residential area of the base, so we weren't with the other troops.  We were out where the, the married airmen lived with their families, so it was a residential area, so we were--it was just heaven because we, we had house boys who cleaned our, our rooms and washed our clothes, and took care of everything for us, and it was just--it was a wonderful assignment.  And we traveled around the Philippines, and played concerts and parades all around Baguio [Philippines] and Manila [Philippines].  And it was a public relations type of thing that we did, and that was it.  That's what we did.  And it was just a wonderful assignment.  However, got an assignment, we're going to Vietnam.  What?  Vietnam (laughter)?  So, we're going to Vietnam?  We--the, the Vietcong had hit Bien Hoa Air Base [Vietnam] and at that point, it was the largest U.S. facility that had been hit by the Vietcong since--during the war [Vietnam War].  And so we went for troop morale to play a base parade.  I said, no.  I'm going to Vietnam.  I said, no I'm not.  I don't want to play in Vietnam.  So, I said all this time, they all--I hadn't gone to Vietnam and here I'm really going to Vietnam.  And so we went up there and the, the, the airfield was all blown up.  So, there we are, marching on this airfield with all the bomb craters and everything.  And so, we played the parade and then we spent the night, and that night--we stayed in the officers' barracks, which was I guess as compared to what the other troops were staying in, I guess it was kind of nice.  And so that night, I woke up and I heard (makes sounds)--bombs going off in the background.  And I said--I'm, I'm lying there saying, I'm really here.  I'm in Vietnam.  I'm really here (laughter).  And so I said, oh, I wanna get out of here.  So, so the next day, they said, "Okay, guys, you can leave or we can go to Saigon [Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam] for lunch."  What do you think those idiots decided to do?
Speaker 2: Go to lunch?
Speaker 1: Go to lunch.  Isn't that incredible?  So, we get on a bus and go to Saigon.  Now, we're going on this rocky road to Saigon.  Now, a bus full of airmen, U.S. troops going to Saigon.  So, of course, there's always a possibility of being blown up on a bus going to Saigon.  I'm nervous riding down to Saigon.  And then you know you always heard about people in restaurants or wherever you are and a little kid comes up and tosses a grenade into the restaurant; that was happening.  I did not enjoy that.  I don't remember what we had for lunch, but I could not wait to get back.  So, I can say I'm truly a Vietnam veteran.  I've been to Vietnam for a day and a half; that was long enough.  But, that was an experience I'll, I'll remember.
Story_ID: 613973
Speaker 1: But it was--that was--it was a good experience.  We had some good times.  It was--it was actually fun.  I met--as a matter of fact, I extended my--for nine months for the whole purpose of buying more camera equipment because I can get camera equipment inexpensively over there, but then they sent me to New Orleans [Louisiana]--Biloxi--not New Orleans--Biloxi, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What a--
Speaker 2: About what year is this?
Speaker 1: What a surprise.
Speaker 2: Is this in the '70s [1970s]--I mean--
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: --sixty-three [1963]?
Speaker 1: It was around '65 [1965] I think it was 'cause I got out in '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: You stayed in for a long time then.  You were there for almost--
Speaker 1: Four years and nine months.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So you--so you entered the [U.S.] Air Force in 1961?
Speaker 1: I, I--six- I got out--as soon as I left high school [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], '61 [1961]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: --I went directly in.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Four years, nine months.
Speaker 1: I remember one time we were coming back on--we flew on what they call the gooney birds, the C-47s [Douglas C-47 Skytrain], boy, we hit--this--I think I was at Chanute [Chanute Air Force Base, Champaign County, Illinois] that time.  Boy, we hit a storm.  I thought it was all over.  Boy, that--the planes were really--they were just going like that (gesture), really.  That was all over.
Speaker 2: How did you like Biloxi?
Speaker 1: Oh.  That was not--that really was no fun.  I didn't spend that much time in Biloxi.  I would go to--it, it was nice going to New Orleans 'cause we would go on the weekends a lot or whenever we could get a little leave, a little leave time.  But, you know, in those days, Biloxi was no fun.  But, I was so disappointed because I was told, they said, okay, we don't have that many horn players here in the Philippines, so you--if you extend, there's an excellent chance you're gonna stay here, so I extended for nine months and I got my papers and they said Biloxi, Mississippi.  I said, oh, no.  But, hey (laughter), so be it.
Speaker 2: They were fighting to integrate the beach in Biloxi and--
Speaker 1: I haven't--
Speaker 2: We've, we've interviewed some of the civil rights activists down there and the--
Speaker 1: I don't know what's--
Speaker 2: --some of the struggles in Biloxi.
Speaker 1: I don't know why that happened, but I was so upset about that.  But, I was back--
Speaker 2: Oh, go ahead, finish, finish your sentence (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I was back in the states, so.
Story_ID: 613974
Speaker 1: You're in the [U.S.] Air Force, you're in Biloxi, Mississippi.  And you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --then, then you went from Biloxi to?
Speaker 2: I was discharged from Biloxi.
Speaker 1: Discharged from Biloxi.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: So, did you stay in Mississippi long to savor the atmosphere there or did you--
Speaker 2: The joy of Mississippi?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: No.  I--
Speaker 1: In 1965.
Speaker 2: --ran screaming from Biloxi back to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and I was fortunate to be able to stay with my [maternal] aunts.  That's where I stayed.  My sister [Margaret Simmons Jackson] was there and so that was home for me.  And I secured a job three days after discharge.
Speaker 1: Really?  And, and what, what kind of job was it?
Speaker 2: It was working with an industrial photographer.
Speaker 1: Now, did you do any photography in the [U.S. military] service?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact--
Speaker 1: Now, we're, we're skipping something here, so--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --we need to go back and, and pick this up.  Now, you said on that on leave, you were on leave when you first used one of the more sophisticated cameras where you had to adjust the shutter speed and, and distance and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and, and that enlightened you as to what the power of a camera might be.
Speaker 2: Right.  And this was--I was on leave from Chanute Air Force Base [Champaign County, Illinois] and a good friend of mine had a, a camera that he borrowed, and it was a folding camera with the bellows kind--the old black cameras that folded up, you opened them up and they had the bellows, and it was adjustable, unlike the box cameras like the, the old Brownie Hawkeyes [Kodak Brownie Hawkeye] and the Brownie Starflash [Kodak Brownie Starflash] type of cameras that I had used in the past.
Speaker 1: Was, was it using a bigger film than 120?
Speaker 2: Right.  It was similar to--I don't know if it was really 120, but it was almost that size.  It might've been 620 film.  But, I asked my friend [Devon Gaines (ph.)] if I could borrow the camera and so I knew nothing about photography, using an, an adjustable camera.  So, I bought the film and I followed the instructions in the--and it comes with the film and it tells you the adjustments for bright sunlight, cloudy or inside.  And so I looked on the camera and it had the shutter speed and the exposure for, you know, shutter speed and aperture.  Of course, I didn't know what either of them meant.  It just had the numbers and I looked on the paper, and it showed the numbers, and there's f/11, f/8 and what have you and, and for the--for the shutter speed.  And so I translated that, twisted this and twisted that.  And then I would guess the distance.  I'm five feet from you and I would--you know, it was what's called zone focusing.  You would guess and then if you were to infinity, you would put the infinity number.  So, I took pictures according to the paper and I put it in the drugstore and picked it up in a day or two.  There was no such thing as one hour photo then.  It might've been three days.  So I got my pictures back and opened it up and said, wow, look, they're sharp.  They look so crisp and it, it was just as nothing I had seen before because with the box cameras with no focus, the pictures always come out milky looking.  And they--it just--it looked so pretty to see them nice and sharp and, wow.  I was--I bought some more film and went out and shot some more.  And then I started doing little experimental things.  I, I shot some things at night because I began to understand that if you change the shutter speed and left a little more--little more time and opened that little thing up (laughter), you could shoot at--with, with less light.  So, I started playing around, and I got my film, my pictures back and, wow.  So--I mean, I really--I was smitten.  So, I returned the camera to my friend because I was going back to the base and I decided I had to get a camera, and that's the way it started.
Story_ID: 613975
Speaker 1: So what did you get?  What was your first intentionally pur- purchased camera?
Speaker 2: It was a--I think it was a, a Asahi Pentax.  That was the equivalent to the Honeywell Pentax.  And so I started shooting--
Speaker 1: That was automatic, isn't it?
Speaker 2: No, it was a single lens reflex.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I just started shooting and shooting and I started reading to--I wanted to learn more about shooting and as much as I can about the camera, so I--
Speaker 1: Now, this is in 19--I'm sorry, 19--what, what year do you think this is when you got the camera?
Speaker 2: That would be '62 [1962], I suppose.
Speaker 1: Sixty-two [1962].
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962], '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you bought it--
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was--around '63 [1963], six- around '63 [1963] I think.
Speaker 1: Asahi.  Now, what--yeah, I guess Honeywell [Honeywell, Inc.; Honeywell International, Inc.] must've had some kind of deal with Asahi [Asahi Optical Company, Ltd].
Speaker 2: Well, that was the Japanese company that made the Honeywell Pentax.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Don't ask me of, of why it was the Asahi Pentax.  I think that's what they carried at the base.
Speaker 1: Right.  I had one of those too at one time, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.  Because I went to the--to the, the BX, the base exchange and they had the camera there.  And it, it was--it was just really exciting because the pictures with that were even sharper than the little box camera and it was--and then I learned to process the film and then they had--
Speaker 1: Did you learn that in the [U.S.] Air Force--I mean, in the Air Force facilities there or?
Speaker 2: Right, they had a, a--
Speaker 1: Photography--
Speaker 2: Photography lab there where the airmen could go and, you know, develop your film and learn to print.  So, I, I learned by reading and any way I could to find out more about it because I became more and more interested in it and I wanted to learn as much as I can.  And it was--it was just it.  I was--I was--again, I was bitten, smitten in love, so that was it.  So, I started just shooting more.  I bought--I remember I bought a little telephoto lens and wide angle lens, and so I just really started getting into it, and I started shooting nonstop.  And when I was--when I went overseas, I, I got a, a Nikon because, of course, Nikon was--that was the camera.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  That's when you went to Philippines?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 613976
Speaker 1: Interestingly--I'm trying to--I'm trying to remember when I won the photo contest.  I won a first place with a shot that I took in, in Chicago [Illinois] at Grant Park.  I won a first place--I shot a friend of mine lighting up his cigarette on this foggy night in Grant Park.
Speaker 2: Is this like while you were still in the [U.S.] Air Force or?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right, I was--I was first place in the Air Force, Air Force contest.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What is this, 19--what do you think, '63 [1963], '64 [1964]?
Speaker 1: I would say sixty--maybe '64 [1964].  I, I can't remember.  I found the--I found the article, too.  I'll have to find that.  But, I, I shot just every imaginable thing I could because I--again, it was just fun trying all different experimental things and learning what I could about shooting and developing.  And so I kind of trans- I kind of translated my meticulous style of model airplane building and trains into photography.  I, I became very precise about temperature and developing film, both film and, and the paper, and that makes a difference, too, in your processing.  Everything should be very persistent--very precision from your temperatures for your film, for any--any solution that you put your film in should be constant because it can make a difference in the quality of your processing.  So, that's an aspect of photography that I like: precision aspect.  And now that the dark room was changed into a computer, there's certain aspects of that that no longer exist.  But, again, it's a tool.  I always say that about photography.  From the camera to the computer; it's a tool.  There's some people who don't like digital because the dark room aspect is no longer there and film is turned from grain into the, the digital aspects.  And it's, it's--some people say you don't get the same look.  It's a tool, roll with it.  Just create with it, whatever it is and you can make beautiful imagery with whatever way you go.  It's about (points to head) this.
Story_ID: 613977
Speaker 1: So you won a contest in the [U.S.] Air Force.  Did you shoot pictures for any, any of the Air Force publications or anything like that when you were in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --Air Force?
Speaker 2: No.  It was just--because--all I did was, it was the band.  I was just music.  That was my thing, just music.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  'Cause I know there's a lot of photography done in the Air Force especially with planes, aerial photographs and they do a lot of stuff with--but you were (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But that's a particular dis- .  Just as I was in the band, there are people who are photographers in the Air Force and that's what they do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A lot of people ask, well, when you were in the Air Force, what did you do?  And I'll, I'll say, well, I was in the band.  They said, right, but what did you do?  I said, that's what I did.  And some people find that difficult to, to grasp.  But it was a great way to, to spend the time in the--in the [U.S.] military.  And it was educational because we had a chance to travel around.  We went to the--Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam for that period, day and a half, and we went all around the Philippines to different places, and while we were in--even in Illinois, we traveled around Illinois, went to Michigan, and all around this--the--you know, the Midwest.  So, it was a good experience to meet people, travel, and we were basically goodwill ambassadors.
Story_ID: 613978
Speaker 1: All right, you're back in the United States.  You came back to Biloxi [Mississippi] and then got out of there, went back to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is it 1967?
Speaker 2: I was--
Speaker 1: Fi- or '5 [1965]?
Speaker 2: --discharged in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Sixty--
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966].  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I, I got a job as I was saying.  Three days after discharge, I was able to get a job at a place called Judge studios [Judge Studio, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And I--it--Judge studios was an industrial photographer--well, Mr. Judge [Jack M. Judge] was an industrial photographer and my job was to copy photographs in his files that had been had taken over the years.  And I call--it was with a camera that had a, a--just continuous roll of film; it wasn't just single shots of film.  You know, it was a continuous roll of, of film.  So, I would shoot with--on this copy camera that had this big rolls of film on either side.  And so I would shoot and it would just--almost like motion picture film, but just imagine it being like two and a quarter film, wide film.  And so I was copying all these prints, just hundreds and hundreds of prints, and this is for the record--for his records.  I guess perhaps the negatives were missing for these photographs.  And as an industrial photographer, you're shooting things in plants, you're shooting things of, of machinery, of big motor parts, in factories, and he had been--he, he was an older gentleman, so these things went back.  But he wanted all copies of them, all of these things, and there were hundreds and hundreds.  So, my day was spent at a copy camera shooting these things, one after the other after the other and processing these continuously long rolls of maybe thirty feet, forty feet of film, and hanging them from the ceiling to dry.  And I had my name for it, and I called it project copycat.  So, I was on doing these--copying all these photographs all day long is what I was doing.  So, this guy would go out during his lunch break and get drunk at lunch.  Then, he would come back and he would raise holy hell.  And I did my job.  I was on the case doing what I was supposed to do, going up on the ladder to hang this stuff from the ceiling and hang it down and we had all this film going like this from the ceiling.  And so it, it--I just--it really upset me that this guy would come back like that.  So, I went home and I told my Aunt Ada [Simmons' maternal aunt, Ada Drayton], I said this guy is just really getting on my nerves.  I said, he goes out and gets drunk and comes back and just gets on me and I'm doing my job.  And so my Aunt Ada says, "Well, you know you have a place to live.  You don't have to put up with that."  So, it went on--
Speaker 1: Now, was your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) few more times--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, was your mother [Lillian Drayton Simmons] still alive at this point?
Speaker 2: No.  She--remember, she died when I was in the Philippines.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: I--oh, I didn't tell you that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I, I was not in the Philippines, Philippines more than a few weeks before my mother passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I had to come back from the Philippines for my mom's funeral.  And that's when I kind of surprised my wife [Marva Simmons].  She was in school and I showed up by surprise and saw her when she was in college, Cheyney State Teachers College [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania].  And that kind of actually accelerated our romance.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause when she saw me, she just broke out in tears 'cause she thought I was still in the Philippines.  So--okay going, going back to Jack Judge studios.  So, I finally--I told my Aunt Ada that I think I'm going to quit and she's--she encouraged it because of this guy, the way he acted.  So, I went in one day and I told him that I'm quitting.  And I was in touch with the receptionist there.  She was an older lady, too, had been working with him for a long time, and she told me when--later when I talked with him, she--with her, she said he was very, very upset that I quit.  And so, I was without a job for maybe a couple months, but thanks to my Aunt Ada, I was able to look for a job just in--for photography.  That's--because had I not had a place to live, I would have been forced to find something, anything.
Story_ID: 613979
Speaker 1: I was wondering if you thought about or if you tried to pursue a job as a French horn player?  Because I know Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] was very culturally, you know, friendly city and they've got a symphony there and everything and probably some minor, you know, symphonies, too.  Did you look for a job as a--as a French horn player?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a photographer.
Speaker 1: At this--so, at this point, the, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, the French horn was--
Speaker 1: --French horn was--you still loved (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I realized, again--I, I was fully aware that my expertise with the horn was not of the caliber to make a living by playing the horn.
Speaker 1: Now, you've heard people say that you can be anything you want to be if you just (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm messing with you now.
Speaker 2: We've discussed that reality, haven't we?  So, no, I knew that I wanted to, to shoot.  I--even--I think even if I had the chops to be a horn player, I was really in love with the camera, and that's what I wanted to do.  So, my Aunt Ada [Simmons' maternal aunt, Ada Drayton] made it possible for me to look for a job specifically in the field of photography.  So, I knew I had to start somewhere.  And starting in the lab was fine with me.  So, I banged on doors around Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and I went to a place called Gateway studios [Gateway Studio, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  Now, Gateway studios was a commercial photography studio that was a full service studio.  When I say full ser -full service that means that they had a photo lab there, too.  So, rather than sending their film out to have it processed, they had everything right there.  So, of course, I had hoped to be a photographer there, but I didn't have the experience to be a photographer at a commercial studio 'cause commercial photography is a little different animal.  But, I could've been an assistant.  Well, working as a, a lab tech was good enough, too, because I was doing something at least in the area of photography.  So, they hired me as a lab tech and of course I had to learn that, too, because they processed their transparencies and negatives, they printed, and so I had to learn that.  So, that was--that was great.  So, I worked there and on my lunch break, I would go out and take my little trusty camera and go out and shoot, just anything around the city.  I would even photograph things in windows.  And interestingly, interestingly enough, I met Burt Globus [ph.] who had a jewelry store 'cause I was shooting things in his jewelry store window, and that's how I got my engagement ring for my wife, through him.  I met him and he gave me a good deal on, on Marva's [Marva Simmons]--both the engagement ring and my wedding ring for her.  So, I would shoot and then I would go back and process my film and make--I could make 16 x 20 prints.  And I would shoot things on the weekends, shoot any young ladies I wanted to photograph or--I remember shooting at a dirt track with the dirt racing bikes and I got this one guy doing a wheelie with his dirt bike coming over a ridge and I blew that up to 16 x 20 and mounted the prints.  And these were among the prints that I brought to Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 613980
Speaker 1: But, going back to Gateway studios [Gateway Studio, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], I wanted to go downstairs to the studio and be a photographer.  That was my hope.  I got one assignment.  I did some aerial photography for the--for Gateway studios, but I--they wouldn't give me a job as a photographer.  That's what I wanted.  So, what I did was I compiled a portfolio and consisting mainly of 16 x 20 color prints.  At that time, a portfolio of 16 x 20 color prints was reasonably impressive I would say.  And so I decided I'm going to go to Chicago [Illinois] and hit on Ebony magazine.  And so I had a friend who lived here who worked for Channel 2 [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois], he was a sound tech, and I had a guy that was in the [U.S.] Air Force with me in the band who lived here.  He was a keyboardist.  And so I called and said I'm, I'm coming to Chicago.  And so I didn't call Ebony; I just grabbed a flight, came here and walked in the door.  And they sent--Alex Poinsett, who is a writer, they sent him down to look at my images.  And he was playing interference so he could say, oh, sorry, we don't have anything.  And he liked my work and so then he sent me up to see Herb Nipson [Herbert Nipson], the managing editor at that time.  And Herb then told me to come back the next day so I could see Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson], and so he hired me.
Story_ID: 613981
Speaker 1: And that was quite an experience.  I mean, to come to Chicago [Illinois] and get a job with Ebony magazine.  I mean, that was the magazine, you know, especially as far as in African American publications goes.  I was just so excited.  I mean, going back to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], I got a job with Ebony magazine.  You know, to tell the people at Gateway studios [Gateway Studio, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], you know, I'm going to Chicago, and I'm going to work for Ebony magazine as a photographer.  It was just--
Speaker 2: Now, now, now that's something.  Now they, they, they won't let you be a photographer--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but you go and become a photographer at, at Ebony.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, tell them, say, well, sorry, I'm going to (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.  It was just--oh--I mean, that's, that's a fairytale and I had never worked for anyone as a professional photographer.  I had never done an assignment for anyone.  And I didn't think about this until very recently, I'm talking about last couple months, that I had never been given an assignment.  I had never shot a story, you know, not even for high school [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  You know, sometimes--or not--or most times, a photographer has been on the high school newspaper or somebody's hired you to do something to tell the story and I had never done that.  I just shot those photographs, like I say, on my own somewhere.  But for someone to say, "Howard [HistoryMaker Howard Simmons], I want you to go and do a story on--," I had never done that.  And so I just went out the gate, going places, across the country, shooting whatever, different stories.  I shot--
Speaker 2: What was your--what was your first story?  Do you remember your first--
Speaker 1: I'm trying to remember that.  I can't remember what it was.  I had forty out of town assignments in nine months.  I was going nonstop.
Speaker 2: Now, who, who else was on staff then besides you?
Speaker 1: Moneta Sleet.
Speaker 2: Was that Moneta Sleet, Jr., or Moneta--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Moneta Sleet, Jr., right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--because in Chicago--yeah, the other guys were out of town, all West Coast and East Coast.  And they worked me--(laughter) they kept me going.  I've--I remember times I would come in to drop my film off and find out I had to pack up and leave again.  So, I was just shooting all the time.  And--but, how could you put a price tag on the experience?  I was covering all sorts of assignments, historic assignments.  I was at Arizona state penitentiary [Arizona State Prison, Florence, Arizona] doing breakouts, I think it was, with Jim Brown, Raquel Welch [in 'The Riot']--
Speaker 2: This was about that same time--this is like '67 [1967], right?
Speaker 1: It was all in that same year.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I, I left within about nine months.  I reluctantly left.  I--it was a--it was truly a wonderful experience.  I've--came from Pittsburgh from a photo lab as a young truly inexperienced photographer to the, the position as a staff photographer for Ebony magazine; that is something that even now seems unrealistic.  It seems like it--well, it was.  It was a dream.  I, I found a letter from a friend of mine who learned of, of, of my securing that job and he's saying, "Man, I heard you got the job with Ebony magazine," he said, "Man, that's so cool, man--," and he's just going on.  This is about a two page letter congratulating me for, for getting the job.  And it just really reinforces my recollection of what an experience that was to, to get that job.  That--
Speaker 2: Now, now that was--
Speaker 1: It--it's something that's--considering all the realities of being actually an amateur photographer, moving into that position was just something that--that's--it's unreal and it was just a wonderful experience.  And I have to really thank Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] for giving me that chance.  I really--you know, it's more than thank you, Mr. Johnson.  It's, it's--what can one--what can I say?  And I had so many experiences just to, to, to cross the country, back and forth to, to go into so many different places, to meet so many people, and to, to experience history.  And, again, can't put a price tag--
Story_ID: 613982
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I want to go back over some of that, but in 1967, you also got married [to Marva Simmons], right?
Speaker 2: Right.  It was--no, I got--yeah, right.  It was after that I got married.  You--I'm--I was thinking--right, after I left Ebony--I got married before I left--in between my leaving Ebony and going, going to the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times].
Speaker 1: Okay, I probably shouldn't go so fast then.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, but, now, there was a picture you shot of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and, and his wife [Coretta Scott King], I believe--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that appeared on a cover of--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --Ebony?
Speaker 2: It was Dr. King by himself.
Speaker 1: Just Dr. King by himself?
Speaker 2: Right.  I was at a--it was at a--I'm trying to remember where it was because I shot through some railings like out on the floor and it makes him look like he's in like a smoke type of situation, his profile.  And that's the cover that I, I, I looked online, they had all the covers of Ebony and they, they, they said there was this one cover that was missing.  It was my cover.  I don't know.  But that--that's--I, I--and I think I, I, I was at an affair a few years ago and they were showing a--it was a PowerPoint presentation and that picture showed up.  And then I saw someone had a painting of that picture.  Yeah, so it's a good feeling as a photographer to see your images around different places, and, you know, to, to feel that you're a part of history.  That's the one thing about being a photographer, it's being an artist (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, in those days when you were just starting out, I mean was it--I, I guess it must've really been a thrill to meet--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --to be standing next to Dr. King or in the presence of--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Were there any stories about discussions that you had with him?
Speaker 2: I never had a chance to, to speak with him.  But it's kind of interesting, when you're there with these people and they even look your way, it's something about that, that--it's kind of--it's kind of awe inspiring, though I've never been struck by people of fame, but there's still something about that.  You say, here's this person who means so much to history.  I may have been struck more just by seeing this, this gentleman and this person of history than a lot of others.  But, I've been around a lot of famous people, so many.  I tell people to keep your distance from your heroes because you want them to remain who they are to you as opposed to who they might really be as people.  Keep them your heroes because sometimes you don't want your heroes to be human.
Speaker 1: Did you--were, were you every privy to conversations or behaviors that made you kind of, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --lower the status of the person in your mind?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I think it's better to keep them at a distance.  And I, I think in most instances--but, there, there, there are people who I've, I--who have not disappointed me, but I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I--
Story_ID: 613983
Speaker 1: Were there any things, any incidents you could tell us about, about where you were privy to conversation or behavior that you thought was kind of--
Speaker 2: I, I think it's, it's best not to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) contrasting with, with the person--
Speaker 2: I would--I would--as far as the negative--on the negative side, I would not like to discuss that, though, I, I will discuss one I think we discussed.  When I was on the set [of 'The Riot'] with Jim Brown, he was--I did nothing to him other than not put him on a pedestal.  I did my job.  I was there shooting for Ebony and--
Speaker 1: How do you do that?  Now, say, say you're, you're Jim Brown and I come up, I'm going to shoot you.  Do I--how do I greet you, how--is it necessary or, or what--I mean, how, how would you--did you have any training about how you ought to do that from Ebony?
Speaker 2: I would approach--no.  I approach you as a subject that I'm doing and I treat you with respect and I'm there to take your photograph.  And--
Speaker 1: So, just a simple introduction, I'm, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Howard Simmons--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --and I'm here to--
Speaker 2: Right.  And I don't know--I, I don't understand if I was supposed to be awe struck, but he didn't like me and he threatened to throw me off the set.  I didn't--I am always a respectful, respectful person, always to anyone, and--
Speaker 1: What triggered the throwing you off the--I mean, the--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't recall.
Story_ID: 613984
Speaker 1: It was an interesting thing with [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, too, when I was at Caesars Palace [Las Vegas, Nevada] to photograph him for a cover [of Ebony].  He was--he would be on--it was a montage cover and he was there.  And so when--this was a early assignment and so when we got there, I wanted to shoot him outside and it was like it was--might start to rain or something.  It was very overcast.  And so he, he strutted in the room and he said, "Well, it looks like it might rain," he says, "well, maybe we can shoot tomorrow," and he reached for the phone, "we, we can get--I can get you a room."  And so he picked up the phone, he says--and I'm--I was just sitting like--I'm looking like this, I'm sitting.  And so he, he--'cause I, I just was just ignoring him.  And the writer was there talking about getting--if we could shoot him today or how we might shoot him and all.  And I was sitting there just--I didn't even look his way.  So--and the writer's negotiating on how we could shoot and why and how and all about the light and all.  And so he said, "Well, I can get you a room.  Maybe tomorrow will be a better day to shoot."  And so he went to pick up the phone and it was--then, it looked like the sun came out--well, not looked like, the sun came out, and--because he was calling for a room.  And he said, "Oh, the sun is coming out.  Why waste a room?"  And hung up the phone.  And I still--just--I'm sitting there, said, "Okay, we can go out and shoot."  So, we went out and I took the pictures.  I just shot, took the pictures that we needed and we came back in.  And so when we were leaving he said, "Man, with an attitude like yours, you can't help but make it."  It was so interesting that he noticed the fact that I just basically ignored him.  I didn't--I mean I did--I didn't--when--ignore him, I didn't pay any attention to him the way he was acting.  It was amazing.  "Why waste a room?"  And the way he said it.  It was just this arrogance that he had.  You know, I'm Harry Belafonte.  And just--even the way he stood.  He was carrying--he was strutting around the room, too, as he was talking about, you know, "The sun--looks like the sun is out--or the sun is not out.  It might be better to shoot tomorrow," he said, "I can get you a room for the night."  And he went and picked the phone up and he was getting ready to call and he looked outside, "Oh, the sun is out.  Why waste a room?"  (Shakes head) (Laughter) Just--you know, in a place like Caesars Palace (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So were you--had you--I mean, so you had no coaching as to how to behave necessarily, but you--
Speaker 1: No, I was just sitting there.
Speaker 2: --but you--
Speaker 1: Like this.
Speaker 2: --but you--did you determine in your mind you were--you weren't gonna get excited about these celebrities or (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just--people are just folks to me.  And, and I've always felt that way, too.  And I'm more impressed by you, you know.  I like folks, just people.  And I find--I've, I've, I've found some people to be actually repulsive but--I'd say most people I--I've found to be really good folks, really good people, but then I've had a couple people that have been very disappointing.
Story_ID: 613985
Speaker 1: Well have there been any real, real positive stories that you remember of some of the celebrities you, you shot in those days?
Speaker 2: Can- Cannonball Adderley and Nat Adderley, we, we had just good rapport.  You know, we were--being in music, you know, MF means mezzo forte, medium loud.  And so we were joking about that.  I'd say, "Yo jive, mezzo forte."  You know, so, that--we just had a good rapport.  That, that was fun, being with those guys.  It's--Walter Payton, when I had my--that was--of course, that's much later.  Walter Payton, he's a good guy.  But, let's go back to the Ebony times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so, now you left.  And why did you--you were there nine months you said?
Speaker 2: Right.  I was--less than a year.
Speaker 1: This is a dream job.  Everybody couldn't believe you get a position like this and--but, you left.
Speaker 2: It was--I was getting married [to Marva Simmons] and I thought that the--getting married was a time that I would need more money.  I was making $125 a week at that time.  So, I--
Speaker 1: Now, let's put this in perspective, 1967--
Speaker 2: So, it's about--
Speaker 1: --working in the GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] plant, you might make a hundred and--it's something about the same thing, working in a GM factory.
Speaker 2: Right.  I never--I, I never made a comparison.
Speaker 1: Really.  I, I, I did work in one in that--during that era.  That's about the same amount of money.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, I was working for Ebony magazine and that was for the--one just starting and young guy, my first job as a professional photographer, and the status of working for Ebony was just--you know, that was a million dollars.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that being said--
Speaker 2: The job.
Speaker 1: --though, it's about the same amount of money of somebody working in Detroit at Ford [Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan] or someplace.
Speaker 2: Really?  Yeah, I had never compared that.  But I approached Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] and asked for a raise.  I told Mr. Johnson I'm getting married in a couple months and I wonder about getting a raise.  You know, I'd been working and that time I was just--I was working more than any single photographer on the staff.  And so that's why I thought I could ask him for a raise.  And he gave me just a flat no.  He didn't say, "Well, maybe next year," or "Maybe after you've, you know, maybe proven yourself more or something."  He, he gave no reason.  He didn't say, "Because," or "Maybe because" or "If you've been here a little longer."  He just said no.  And I was really hurt.  And--
Speaker 1: So, this is Mr. Johnson himself--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that you're talking to?
Speaker 2: Mr. Johnson, just flat no.  I, I don't know if I had--I would have responded a little differently if he had given me a "No because--," but just a no really hit me hard.  And I really liked the job and the prestige of working for the premier black publication; that meant so much to me.
Story_ID: 613986
Speaker 1: I had been approached by [HistoryMaker] Bob Black of the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times] about considering working for the Sun-Times.  And to me, working for a newspaper was kind of a--below working for Ebony, quite a bit to me, you know.  A newspaper?  I said, oh, I don't want to work for a newspaper.  So after that, I was on the phone to Bob Black.  I said, "I want to talk about working for the Sun-Times."  So, he arranged an appointment with the managing editor, Emmett Dedmon, at the Sun-Times.  And so I went in and talked to Emmett Dedmon.  We talked salary, no problem.  So--
Speaker 2: How much more was it?
Speaker 1: Maybe--it might've been maybe close to 175, a hundred dollars, which to me is a lot.  It's a lot.  And I don't remember exactly, but I think it might've been--might've been seventy-five.  But that, considering, that's a lot.  And it was interesting that when I--they, they hired me, they said, "Well, you gotta get a radio in your car."  I said, "I don't have a car."  So, they said, "Oh, okay.  What are we gonna do about this?"  So, they leased a car for me, and that was the first time they'd done that.  So, that started a whole trend at the paper.  They started leasing cars for the photographers; that became a standard.  And so, I learned--once I started working for the newspaper, I learned and gained a totally new respect for news photographers.  I learned that the news photographers are among some of the best photographers around 'cause it's a completely different, just a different style and just a different type of shooting because you've gotta be on it.  When you're a news photographer, you don't have time to stop and think.  You gotta get it.  And these guys are the baddest dudes around.
Speaker 2: Okay, now who was on the, on staff with you?  Now, now Tweedle [John Tweedle]--
Speaker 1: He was with the Daily News [Chicago Daily News].
Speaker 2: He--okay.
Speaker 1: He was the first black photographer with the Daily News.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's '64 [1964] he started, so he was the first one.  And then Bob Black was--he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was the first with the Sun-Times.
Speaker 2: --first with the Sun-Times.
Speaker 1: He's the one--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He's the one who was instrumental in--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --getting me this--
Speaker 2: --how, how soon after that did John White [John H. White] get on with, with the Tribune [Chicago Tribune]?
Speaker 1: No, John White was, was the second one with the Daily--
Speaker 2: At, at the--at the Daily News?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think that was a couple years, maybe--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --maybe a couple years.  And Ovie was with the Tribune.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Ovie Carter.
Speaker 2: Ovie Carter, okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And it's--once I, I got on board, I began to realize that the news photographers are able to go out--you don't have time to, to stop and think and compose.  You've got to instantaneously see that picture and grab it.
Story_ID: 613987
Speaker 1: Did [HistoryMaker] Bob Black, was he the person that kind of mentored you or helped you or, or was there someone else there?  Because this is a whole new, you know, kind of thing, right?
Speaker 2: You just come on board and you gotta do it.  Nobody mentors you, nobody trains--you're going to--going on assignment.  And things are happening and--at, at Ebony, sometimes there are things you cover, too.  Ebony prepared me because there, there are jobs that I've had where I've been on demonstrations and things are happening at Ebony too.  But most news assignments or many news assignments were that way.  But I didn't--I didn't appreciate the news photographers until I started working for the paper.  And when you're working with a stable of guys and you see what these guys bring back, and sometimes you don't have time.  You're out there and these guys come back from assignment.  And to--see, I had more side by side with photographers.  You're both--or maybe you're with a whole bunch of guys at the same assignment.  So your stuff has got to compete with their stuff and you got the competition out there.  And you have to come back--and your stuff is going to be in the paper with their stuff; that's the challenge.  See, if I'm shooting for Ebony, I'm by myself.  It's just my stuff showing in--only one in Ebony.  It's not even as if t- other magazines are gonna be there.  Not--no other magazines on the assign- I'm just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were some of the better guys there at Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times]?  How, how many were in the pool in the stable and who were some of the (unclear)?
Speaker 2: There might have been a dozen guys, you know, maybe a dozen.  But, the challenge is, at that time, you had Chicago Today, you had Chicago Tribune, you had--you had the Daily News [Chicago Daily News], the Today, Tribune, Daily News, Sun-Times, and I think there was some--somebody off the paper but even--and then you had the Sengstackes' paper.
Speaker 1: The Defender [Chicago Defender], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Defender.
Speaker 1: And the Reader [Chicago Reader]--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: --I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: But you had--okay, if you're on an assignment, if it's real big news, everybody is going to be there, be it a, you know, morning publication, evening publication.  And all the--I'm not talking about all guys in the Sun-Times--from the Sun-Times, but I'm talking about the other papers.  And if you're there and everybody is shooting at the same thing, you can get blown away if somebody comes back with a fantastic picture and you don't have a fantastic picture.  That's the challenge.  You're competing against these guys.  And there's nothing worse than to see this guy over there and you know he's got a angle or a perspective that you don't have.  You know it.  You know--you said, darn, man, he's got--he's over there and he's got something (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so what's your--what was your strategy?  You want to get there first and get--and get your--
Speaker 2: You may not even be there first.  You may all be there at the same time, but this guy moves a certain way.  Like the picture I got with the guys looking at, at, at city hall [Chicago City Hall, Chicago, Illinois].  And it's almost--and it's a great feeling when you know, I got this.  You know, you say, I got this and nobody else has got it.  It's a good feeling, too, when you got it and nobody else has got it.  But, it's a terrible feeling when, when the other folks don't.  And you know when your stuff shows up in the paper you got a great shot and the other guys were there and they didn't get that shot.
Story_ID: 613988
Speaker 1: That was the thing--that was the difference when suddenly I'm out--I've never been in that situation, you know.  When--I, I hadn't shot before like that when--in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] 'cause I had never worked professionally and then in Ebony, I had--I wasn't competing with anybody 'cause I just shot for Ebony.  I'm doing it myself.  And suddenly I'm thrown in with--by the way, I've never discussed this.  I never thought about this until now, until we're talk--I never thought about the fact that suddenly I'm in with a pool of guys and these guys--some--these guys are good.  Some of the old dudes, some of the--I'm talking about, I was there with guys on the verge of retiring, and some of these cigar chewing dudes, some of the old dudes.  You know, you're thinking, oh, these old dudes.  You know, what's up with these dudes.  These guys have been shooting a long time.  Some of these guys are just instinctively good photographers.  That's what they've been doing thirty years.  These guys, they're just good.  Sometimes you don't think about these guys just being good.  That's what they do.  And they see things in ways maybe you don't see 'cause they've been just doing this.  And they're these old news photographers.  There's a story about one of these guys when Queen Elizabeth [Elizabeth II] visited Chicago [Illinois] and this guy was one of the long cigar chewing guys with the hat on, you know, and he was late.  The, the queen came to the Navy Pier [Chicago, Illinois].  And he was late getting there.  And all the photographers are lined up on the Navy Pier.  And he got there too late.  And the queen is str- strolling along Navy Pier.  And he couldn't get there with all the photographers and there were a bunch.  I mean, there was a bunch of photographers there.  And this is way back, 4 x 5 days, I think it was.  And I think even it might have been cranking news cameras, but everybody was there.  I can't say for sure for the cranking, but there was a whole bunch of photographers.  The guy was too late.  He was on the other side.  He's the only person on the other side 'cause he was late.  And he said, "Hey, Queenie!"  And she looked, and he had the shot of her looking towards him like that and all the photographers lined up.  That was the prize winning shot.  And he--that was--just things like that, you know.  And these guys were classics.  Some of the guys were classics.  And it was interesting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What, what, what was his name?  Do you remember?
Speaker 1: I don't remember his name.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But he was one of those guys that had the short--always had the cigar just about smoked down.  But, there were some of the guys that I got a chance to meet and it was--I, I didn't mix with some of those guys.  It's kind of oil and water 'cause there weren't that many black guys that--
Speaker 2: How were you treated?  I mean--
Speaker 1: Oh, it was--
Speaker 2: --by white guys?
Speaker 1: Some of the guys didn't--
Speaker 2: Was it--was it kind of tense?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was kind of tense.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Especially some of the older guys.  And I came and I used to wear turtlenecks all the time or mock turtle necks.  I didn't wear a shirt and tie.  Everybody was wearing shirt and ties--shirts and ties.  And they didn't like that.  And some of them really would get on me about not wearing a shirt and tie.  I said, "When Emmett Dedmon hired me, I had a turtleneck.  You don't like it?  Talk to Emmett Dedmon."  And so eventually, everybody stopped wearing shirts and ties because I kind of changed things over there, so that was interesting.  But it was--it was--it, it was interesting, not, not--you know, trying to mix with these guys.  But--and I was kind of a radical in those days.
Speaker 2: Now, now--okay.
Speaker 1: There were things that--little things were said.  I remember they brought back a picture of some little monkeys that had been born at the zoo and somebody made a few little comments.  And I stood up and had a little sermon back there in the dark room, had to make some little--get some little things straight.  'Cause I, I, I was very open about certain things.  But it, it was--it was interesting.  But we--finally, things leveled out, guys retired, some of the old dudes retired and, and so things were cool.
Story_ID: 613989
Speaker 1: Mayor Richard M. Daley [sic. Richard J. Daley] is the mayor then and--
Speaker 2: The king.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: King Daley.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, you get a chance to cover him (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, number of times, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, did you find yourself in--well, you must've found yourself in places where a lot of black people period just don't go.
Speaker 2: I've, I've been places where folks have never really encountered black people.  I've--even one on one situations where the--obviously the people have never really met a black person in--really, in, in person.  I was on an assignment on West Garfield [West Garfield Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois] where there was a problem at a school and I almost got arrested because the people were upset with me.  The cops threatened to arrest me where the people called me a nigger and I said, "Not just a nigger, a black nigger."  And the people went crazy 'cause they didn't know what to say when I did that.  And they would say, "Oh, you're ugly," you're this, you're that.  They were--it's all--they just went crazy 'cause of when I said that.  I--when I said that, it disarmed them and the police threatened to arrest me.  I'm--(laughter) they were about to arrest me.  And I have been arrested.  I was arrested and maced along with some kids on, on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  There was a problem at one of the high schools and I--I'm taking pictures.  Cop says, "Oh, taking pictures, huh?"  Zip.  Threw me in the squadrol where they had arrested some kids that had been creating problems, were, were in the squadrol that they had arr- they put me in the squadrol with the kids.  And the kids were banging on the squadrol and cop came up, looked inside, okay.  Sprayed mace all in the squadrol with me in there.  So, I got--I would get arrested and harassed by police quite a bit.
Speaker 1: And did they have any idea who you were you think at that point?
Speaker 2: I'm there with my cameras.  Obviously--
Speaker 1: You had your press credentials with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They didn't care.  There was another time a reporter and I--actually, there was a plane on the runway at O'Hare [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois], and there was something going on and we didn't know really what it was, and we got on the live runway (laughter).  We drove onto the runway, yes.  And the guard--the guard there at the gate was looking--he was so curious as to what was happening with the plane on the runway he just waved us through.  And it was a young reporter, too, young guy, and it--and we, we actually got out on the live runway, yep.  We got out there.
Speaker 1: Did you have a--well--
Speaker 2: And we didn't get arrested, though.  We, we were--we got escorted off, but we actually got out there on the runway, which was something else.  It's--I've had some interesting experiences.
Story_ID: 613990
Speaker 1: Now you shot Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] funeral, too, didn't you?  I read (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't--I didn't get inside, though.  I--Moneta Sleet got inside and he actually got a--
Speaker 1: He got a prize winning picture of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King], right?
Speaker 2: Pulitzer [Pulitzer Prize], right, right.  So, I've actually--but this was afterwards.  There was some, you know, experience at, at King's house, but that was long, long time after that.  That was after I left the paper.
Speaker 1: What was the most interesting or interesting shots that you took during the time with the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times]?  'Cause you were there from, what, '68 [1968] to '76 [1976]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968] to '76 [1976].  The most interesting--I try to think about that even after, after agreeing to, to do this.  The most interesting shot.  Wow, that's a--I've, I've just done so many--so many--oh (laughter).  Okay.  This might--for one, it was interest--this is interesting from the standpoint that it really bothered me because sometimes people do things for shock value and it was--Barb Rivera [ph.] was the fashion editor and sometimes things bother me because people do things for the sake of shock value.  We're interviewing--it was at Eb- we were interviewing--there was one white model in the Ebony Fashion Fair.  And so Barb Rivera, the fashion editor, was--we were backstage at--it was McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois], and we're interviewing her, the one white fashion model for the Ebony Fashion Fair, and we're interviewing.  And so we're backstage and she just drops her clothing as we're interviewing her, totally nude, just swoop.  And that--it bothered me because sometimes--again, people do things for shock--I just walked away (laughter).  It--it's--and I don't say that it's most interesting, but it's, it's one thing that really upset me.  So, that's one thing--I, I, I don't get upset very easily, but that really bugged me because it was done for a reason.
Speaker 1: And you considered it--well, go ahead.
Speaker 2: I, I con- it was insulting and it upset me and, I mean, just dropped her clothes.  We were backstage and she just dropped her clothes, she's standing there in the nude for an interview.  Why would somebody do that?  And it really--that upset me.  So, that's one thing as, as a memorable, memorable thing of somebody doing something for the sake of shock value.  And I, I just walked--I just turned away and walked away.
Speaker 1: Disrespectful.
Speaker 2: It was very disrespectful to me.
Story_ID: 613991
Speaker 1: So that's something that, that was--something that really bugged me.  But, at the paper [Chicago Sun-Times], something that was--I've had situations that were emotional situations, very emotional.  When I was at a scene of a--and this was one of the things that made me kind of glad to get away from news because you're not supposed to get that caught up emotionally, but I've had some situations that were kind of emotionally draining.
Speaker 2: What, what was the incident that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Over on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], this--the tavern where a--brothers had a tavern and they were killed during a robbery.  And so I'm outside the tavern and things were happening, the police were there, detectives were there and, you know--you know, crime scene.  And this lady walks up holding a baby and she came around.  She's--you know, something is going on.  You know, she's disturbed.  And I said, uh-oh, she's connected.  So, I start shooting (gesture).  And so she goes up to a detective and somebody screams, "Get the baby, get the baby."  And she just falls.  And it was her father and her uncle who owned the tavern and that--it was just so emotionally draining to see somebody--you know, you captured the situation where this person has just discovered that her father and her uncle had been killed right there.  And that stands out in my mind because you're right there and you can just feel what was going through her, her mind right there on the scene and you're right there as she comes and you see her walking up to the scene, and then she's just looking back and forth.  She's looking back and forth to the police, the tavern, to the--and, and she's carrying her baby.  That was--that was pretty heavy.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That--that was pretty heavy there.  I was at the--do you remember the Dan Ryan "L" trash where the--"L" [elevated train] crash where the "L" turned over and--I, I covered that.  I was able to get down on the tracks even inside the train.  I was able to get a lot of stuff there.  That was--
Speaker 2: How--I know the photographers are always asked the question about when you're on the scene of a tragedy and people need help, I mean, do you keep shooting or do you help them or--
Speaker 1: I've, I've never had that--
Speaker 2: Never had that--
Speaker 1: --choice.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think I'd probably have to help in the midst of, of shooting, too.  It would be very difficult for me not to.  Because I know when I think about if I'm on the street somewhere, I would probably get killed in, in the midst of, of an assault or something.  I couldn't stand by and just let something happen.  I figure, you know, I--have to stay away.  It would be very difficult for me to just let something happening figuring, you know, I have to look out for myself 'cause if I can make any kind of a difference, I, I, I couldn't just stay out of it.  I think there's some situations where you, you have to, but that would have to be an extraordinary situation.  I think in, in a situation where someone has done something stupid and gotten themselves in a situation, you weigh the--weigh that out.  But, I know a friend of mine was on a--on a train and some guy just slapped her, tried to talk to her and she didn't want to talk to him and he just slapped her.  And everybody just sat there and didn't say a word, didn't say anything.  And there's no way I could stand by and watch that.  But in taking--in shooting, I, I know as a photojournalist that you're supposed to, to shoot and, you know, get--take--you know, record the story, but you can't let everything just happen without trying to do what you can.
Story_ID: 613992
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay, tell me about the John Drummond photograph, him peeking into city hall [Chicago City Hall, Chicago, Illinois].  How, how did that happen?
Speaker 2: We were waiting for return of Mayor Daley [Richard J. Daley].  And so all the press is waiting outside.  And we're waiting and waiting, and so I thought it would make a nice shot of--if I went in to shoot out, and I really didn't expect Drummond and the other reporter to, to take that peek inside.  And it's one of those everything happens at the right time and, bam, I got it.  And it always (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He, he, he grabs the window and like he peeks in the--
Speaker 2: Well, you don't grab it.  It's the doors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's, it's the two doors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And both of them--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --look--it's almost like I set it up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's one of those shots that you would set up for a commercial shot; that you would do for an advertisement.  You know, has anybody seen the mayor?  Anybody seen Mayor Daley?  And it just looks like I'd set that shot up and it was one of those shots where I was there--that's the kind of shot where everybody else wishes they had gotten it, and I know it's one of those things that everybody is looking at, oh, no, he got that.  That's the kind of thing where I had it and they didn't get it.  And when they looked in the paper and saw that and they know they weren't there.  They were there but they weren't where I was.  Yep, that--that's one of those where you feel so good.
Speaker 1: The angle opportunity with the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was a shot that I got of a fireman gagging out of a window.  There was a photographer from the Daily News [Chicago Daily News] standing right beside me and he didn't get it, right there, same time.  And that, that, that happens.  So, it's just being ready at that right moment and it happens both ways.  I'll never forgive John White [John H. White] for something he did to me.  It's on record, John.  It was--we were running--there was a guy in the river right next to the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times] building, at that time Sun-Times/Daily News building and, see, I need to beat myself up, too, 'cause it was not John's fault, I let him do this to me.  We're running to get the picture and he said--John said, "Can I borrow your 200mm lens?"  Now, I'm about fool enough to let him borrow that.  That's like jumping off the ship and someone is--the ship's going down and he says, "May I borrow your life raft?"  You know?  And I let him borrow my 200mm lens.  So, guess who had the best picture in the--in the paper?  (Pause) Now, isn't that something else?  That--I'll never forget that and he laughed at me after that, too.  Can you imagine that?  I let him use my telephoto lens.
Speaker 1: Too nice, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm just too nice.  I remember that.  We're going across the bridge to get that shot.  "May I borrow your 200mm lens," (laughter).
Story_ID: 613993
Speaker 1: There's an exhibit.  Now, by this time, you're, you're fairly well known and--in Chicago [Illinois] and South Side Community Arts Center [South Side Community Art Center, Chicago, Illinois] has a 'Through Eyes of Blackness' exhibit featuring you and [HistoryMaker] Ovie Carter and John--
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Bob Black.
Speaker 1: --John White [John H. White] and, and who else is in it?
Speaker 2: That was it; it was the four of us.
Speaker 1: Just the four?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  And did Herb Nipson [Herbert Nipson] have anything to do with setting this up or?
Speaker 2: No, that was--that was my brain child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I thought it would be nice for the four of us to do an exhibit since we had such a, a gathering of, of work that we had--that we had shot.  And so I was able to get Daryl Grisham of Parker House Sausage Company [Chicago, Illinois] and Kodak [Eastman Kodak Company] to come together and help us sponsor--not to help us, but to sponsor the exhibit and pay for it.  So, it turned out to be--it was a mammoth production.  We had prints as large as 40 x 60 and we--Gamma Photo Lab [Gamma Photo Lab Inc., Chicago, Illinois] printed everything and we--not everything.  We printed everything up to 20 x 30 and it was quite a production, took a lot of work.  Oh, it was unbelievable.  I wouldn't do it again (laughter).  It was--it was really a lot of work.  But, it was quite--it was a beautiful exhibit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did, did it travel after it left there?
Speaker 2: We had planned for it to travel a lot.  We wanted--frankly, I had hoped that it would travel across the country because we had crates made for all the prints and John for whatever reason decided to pull his prints out.  And so because of that, it kind of took away from the exhibit 'cause it really required--it needed all of us in it.
Speaker 1: I mean, you'd have to I guess rethink it on some level.
Speaker 2: Right.  It, it--because it--together, it was just really a, a very powerful exhibit.  We had some just beautiful images.  It was really fantastic.
Story_ID: 613994
Speaker 1: Now, was there a black photographer association in Chicago [Illinois] at that time or, or had it been formed yet?  I know there--at one point, there, there is.
Speaker 2: Right.  There is now, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But--
Speaker 2: --there--at that time, there wasn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  And when was it formed?  Do you--do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I could--[HistoryMaker] Bob Black is one of the main photographers at--in that organization [Chicago Alliance of African American Photographers].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, you--there's another famous picture of Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] shedding a tear.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell, tell us about that photo.
Speaker 2: Well, that was--I think it was--it was talking about Elijah Muhammad at one of the Saviours' Day occasions and that was one of those, again timing; just right time.  I also have a picture of Elijah Muhammad where he's, he's just like that (gesture), and that's another one of those just serene type of images where you just, click, got it.  That's the thing about photography.  It's, it's so--it's a matter of timing and just that moment, which we--we'll discuss further as we--as we go on and hopefully about just capturing those moments and some of the ones that I've captured since.
Story_ID: 613995
Speaker 1: Okay, well in, in '76 [1976], you, you went freelance.  Now what, now you've got a--as they used to say in the community, you got a good job.  Now, why would you leave that job to go freelance (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My wife [Marva Simmons]--my wife would probably concur (laughter).  I--my love for commercial photography was always there and even back--going back to Gateway studios [Gateway Studio] in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], I wanted to, to try to, to make it in commercial photography.  I, I liked the deliberate aspect of commercial photography, and so I thought I would give it a chance, see if I could make it.  I took a leave of absence first from the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times].  And Emmett Dedmon, the gentleman who hired me allowed me to take a leave of absence to see if I could make it--make it happen, and so that's what I did.  I took a leave of absence and after I think it was six months, six, eight months, I came back and resigned my position.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't easy, still isn't (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, did you have--
Speaker 2: I would--I'd be retired now like John--like, like Bob [HistoryMaker Bob Black] is.  It would make life a lot easier if I had done that, but I have no regrets.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you--how did you approach it?  Did you write out a business plan and get a--did you need to get a loan or anything or did--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --you just--what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I had found the place for a studio.  We--I--my initial idea was to have all the same guys in the exhibit ['Through Eyes of Blackness'] resign--one at a time, I was going to do it with one of the others and one of the others, and the idea was to have--it was--Plus Four [ph.] was the name of a business idea that I had with the other three guys.  But I was the only one willing to, to throw it all in and, and try that.  So, I did it on my own.  I went out there by myself.
Speaker 1: Now, what did your wife say about it?
Speaker 2: She was, of course, a little reticent, understandably, and it was something I really had my heart set on and decided to do it.  I found a place for a studio.  And commercial photography is a world that was really new to me.  I had to basically learn as I worked at it.  And actually, the primary person that made it possible was Vince Cullers--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) of Vince Cullers advertising agency [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 613996
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about Vince [Vince Cullers].
Speaker 2: When I first moved here [Chicago, Illinois], having the love for commercial photography that I had for so long, I learned that there was a black advertising agency and I was so excited to find that there was such an animal.  And so I sought out the Vince Cullers advertising agency [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].  And I went up to the agency to meet Mr. Cullers, and so I met him early on, even before I decided to leave the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times].  And so, it was just such a--it was a--an exciting experience to meet someone like Mr. Cullers.  So, when I left the Sun-Times, I approached Mr. Cullers and told him what I was going to do.  And so, he taught me about the business.  I knew nothing about it.  I never assisted a commercial photographer, so I guess it goes back to my approaching Ebony--I mean--right, approaching Ebony.  And so that's how I started.  He gave me a chance with some of his premium accounts and I started from there and just kind of moved on step by step, and started there and then I began shooting for some of his clients such as Kellogg's [Kellogg Company] and Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], Standard Oil [Standard Oil Company], Illinois Bell [Illinois Bell Telephone Company].  And I kept trying to get into Ebony magaz- I mean--Ebony--getting into Burrell Advertising [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois].  That was a little difficult to get in there.
Speaker 1: That's another black agency in town--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tom Burrell's [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell]--yeah.
Speaker 2: Tom Burrell.  It was really one of the major agencies across the country.  And so I began doing work with them thanks to their chief and head art director at that time, Lowell Thompson, and I always give kudos to, to Lowell 'cause he, too, was very helpful in my, my career, another maverick kind of guy.  Yeah, he's cool, always--I'm always thankful to Lowell for what he's meant to my career.  And then I, I bought a building up on Chicago Avenue, which was the old Chicago Fish House [Chicago, Illinois].  There were only a couple of people who encouraged me to go there because of the area.  And Vince was one of the people who said, hey, go for it, and it turned out to be my favorite studio.  And then I, I got more work from Burrell.  And I tried to break into the general market agencies, which was just difficult to do.
Story_ID: 613997
Speaker 1: Despite the work that I had to show, it was just difficult to get into the general market agencies.  That would've made the difference.
Speaker 2: And there's some big ones here in Chicago [Illinois] right there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, yes.  Even though I did do some work for them and the work was good, it was just very difficult.  That's--
Speaker 2: Is that Foote, Cone and Belding--
Speaker 1: Foote, Cone and Belding--
Speaker 2: --and--
Speaker 1: --I've done work for them.
Speaker 2: --who's the other one?
Speaker 1: BBD and O [Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn; BBDO Worldwide].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Leo Burnett.
Speaker 1: J. Walter Thompson.  As a matter of fact, my friend worked for J. Walter Thompson and he gave me work, and some of the people even asked why, why do you use black photographers (laughter)?  Right, he asked, well, I don't ask you why you use white photographers.  But, it's, it's a--just an interesting situation.  I did an impossible shoot with a Michael Jordan shoot.  It's one of the most difficult assignments I've had 'cause I had to shoot Michael Jordan by himself, I had to shoot Michael Jordan dunking the basket, I had to shoot him with a hamburger, I had to shoot him with two--a hamburger and a Big Mac, I mean all in, in one--in span of a few hours.  It was one of the most challenging jobs I've had.  It was for J. Walter Thompson.  I pulled that off because there was an affair going on out at where the Bulls [Chicago Bulls] prac- at their practice facility and I had no idea there was a--they had scheduled a f- some affair out there.  That was so difficult, and I managed to pull it off.  And plus he was late.  He was about an hour late for the shoot.  That was--and I pulled it off.  I said, wow, I've done this, I know I'm in the door now.  Nope, didn't happen.  But, it's, it's, it's been wonderful.  I've had a chance to travel, I've had a chance to--I've been to Zimbabwe for Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company] for Burrell [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois].  I've been to Paris [France] ten times for the Ebony Fashion Fair.  What they do is they shoot some of the exclusive fashions that they're considering for the fashion fair.  They can't bring them here.  They're so expensive and they--I guess the insurance would be just incredible 'cause they're, they're one of a kind items.  And so shooting there is just--I mean, and it--it's hectic.  They start--we start about 8:30 and shoot until maybe--we might not finish until seven or eight, and the pace is just crazy, but that was interesting.  I was the first photographer that they sent there.  Usually, they use Paris photographers, but I think there was a problem with scheduling.  And so, Mrs. Johnson [Eunice Johnson] had that problem with the scheduling, so Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] said, "Why not use Howard [HistoryMaker Howard Simmons]?"  And so they sent me over and that was--that, that was a fun shoot.  It was crazy.  But it was interesting, I--you know, that was first time shooting over in Paris into this little studio.  So, I went in and there's a box light hanging from the ceiling on the tra- I said, I'm cool.  I'm at home 'cause it was similar to the light I had in my studio, so it was a--it was a good shoot.  And they, they were really pleased with the shoot.  And so they, they used me for the next, I think about nine times, I think, so--
Speaker 2: So every year you go--what, in the spring?  Was, was it in the spring?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was spring, and--
Speaker 2: Fashion season I think.
Speaker 1: Right.  It was a--it was a--the, the shoot, the pace is crazy.  And Mrs. Johnson is over--out there, "Shoot that, shoot that, shoot that!"  She was--she's--she was fun.  We would---I would joke with her and she was--it was fun shooting with her.  So, that was a--that was a good experience, too.  It was interesting to shoot with Ebony again, you know, old home.  And so it--it's, it's been a wonderful trip.  The whole photography thing has been, been fun.
Story_ID: 613998
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of equipment did you use from--or did you--did it vary depending on assignment?
Speaker 2: Everything from 35mm to 8 x 10.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I use all the formats.  And now digital is the format.
Speaker 1: Were you--were you quick to move to digital?
Speaker 2: Took--it was--it was kind of--almost intimidating because here's a new animal for me and I remember Bob [HistoryMaker Bob Black] kind of--as, as a, a factor with my--a new experience for digital--with digital because he--I went down to Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times] one day and he was showing me something he had shot.  He shot an assignment and he went to the computer and had downloaded something, said, "Here, let me show you what this--what the digital thing is."  So, he downloaded it onto the laptop and he pulled up the image and put the magic wand on it, which I didn't know what the heck the magic wand was on Photoshop, and I'm looking in amazement.  This is a number of years ago, so the--this--the paper had just started going to digital.  We're talking 2.5 megapixels.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's--I mean compared now, 2.5 megapixels, so he puts it on the computer and I'm looking, hits the magic wand, the light in the background, and--I mean, to me, this is truly magic with the magic wand.  I'm--I had never seen this.  I was like--I said, "Man," I said, "I'll never learn this," I said, "Man--."  He said, "Oh, man, there's nothing to it.  This is easy stuff, man."  I was just blown away.  This--I mean, this is so new to me.  So, I'm feeling so far removed from this.  I--I'm telling you, it, it just--it really blew my mind, it really did.  I--because I, I had been just totally removed from digital.  It was just brand new to me.  Then, I'm, I'm somewhere and I'm--and Bobby Sengstacke [HistoryMaker Robert Sengstacke] is talking and he's talking gigabytes and ram and I'm (laughter) gigabytes and ram.  I said, what's Bobby talking about?  And, and, I'm just so out the loop.  I felt just, just like--you know, I'm feeling that I'm in the age of the dinosaurs and these people are talking about, you know, computers and, and I'm just in the dark ages.  And so my family bought a little Nikon 880 Coolpix [Nikon Coolpix 880], a little camera for me for Christmas.  And one of the--Irv [ph.] down at Central Camera [Central Camera Company, Chicago, Illinois] suggested--'cause my middle daughter [Tracey Simmons McGhee] went to the same church with Irv, he said, "Well, this is the camera.  Get this one for him.  This will be--will help."  And he had all the controls.  This camera had all the controls and adjustments in the menu as a professional camera.  They don't do the shoot--point and shoot like, like that now.  They don't have all this on it.  And it had it all.  So, I got that for Christmas and that was a camera which I nicknamed Mighty Mouse that I used to help me learn digital.  And then my buddy, Victor Powell, Mr. Digital, I call him the digital wizard, Victor helped me learn about digital and I'm in the loop now.
Story_ID: 613999
Speaker 1: I know what a gigabyte is.  I'm into Photoshop (laughter), so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, do you--do you think that a per- and you said some, some people are still reluctant to use digital and--but, do you think a person engaging in commercial photography nowadays or working for a newspaper can survive if they don't--they're not using--they're not shooting digital?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause there are some clients who demand it.  I mean, there are people who, who will call and ask, "Are, are you shooting digital?"  I mean, it's just--that's just--that's just it.  It would be almost akin to someone shooting a 4 x 5.  You know, someone saying, well, you're shooting what?  (Laughter) It, it--you--really.  Now, I'm talking about a, a--say a news, you go on a news assignment with a 4 x 5 Graflex, you know.  It's just--you've gotta get with it.  There is so much--you have so much control with Photoshop.  Of course, you can trans- you can always, always make--digitize your, your, your film.  But, the immediacy of the image and the--there's just so much you can do.  I'm on an assignment the other day, I'm on the assignment, took my computer, downloaded the stuff, did a few adjustments, I gave the client a disc [compact disc] and went on my way.  I mean, there's so much you can do.
Speaker 2: So is there any advantage to having a--I mean, to fine arts, I guess, venue to using--to still developing film.  I mean, are, are there--do you think there are images that you can get using chemistry that you can't get on a--with digital technology?
Speaker 1: There's still questions about archival permanency.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I'll know for sure when I reach 167 [years old] if there's some questions about the true archival permanency 'cause how can you prove it?  I'm, I'm--I would imagine there, there might be some--you know, with different scientific methods of truly, you know, determining archival permanency, but I don't think you really know unless you can live to be another hundred years and look at the images.  I have--I have prints that are forty-five, forty-eight years old that are just as crisp and beautiful as they were when I did then--when I was in the [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So--that makes me feel old (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, now when you look (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't feel old now; I feel great.
Story_ID: 614000
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything--now, you're still shooting and you're still--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --still doing commercial work and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Right.
Speaker 1: --and when you look back on everything you've done to this point, I mean, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I might--I--when I had this gentleman give me--who wanted the building I had on Chicago Avenue [Chicago, Illinois] and told me pick any buildings you want, I would've gotten some houses and rented a studio.  That's what I would've done differently.  Yep.  I would've gotten into real estate--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and rented a place for the studio.  Then, I would've had some investment property.  That would've been cool.  Though, one of the buildings I got was a good selection for rental property, but just keeping tenants in it was kind of a difficult thing at that time.  So, there are things--but, I have no regrets.  I have been a very fortunate person.  I have a wonderful wife [Marva Simmons], a wonderful family.  I'm so fortunate there.  I always say I'm, I'm a billionaire there.
Story_ID: 614001
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a good question.  It frightens me to the point that I'm, I'm truly frightened.  I'm, I'm wondering if we are headed for economic and social extinction.  With our youth acting the way they are acting, with our community deteriorating the way it's deteriorating, with the threats that we're facing in so many ways--you look in our communities and what do we have?  You look at the grocery stores, which are nonexistent, you look at the cleaners and who's--who owns the cleaners?  Who owns the gas stations?  Who owns the Dunkin' Donuts?  Who owns the mom and pop grocery stores?  Who owns the J and J Fish [JJ Fish and Chicken]?  You go to--
Speaker 1: We used to.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, used to.  You go to the, the hair product stores, go to the nail salons, what do we have?  And everywhere you look, we are purely consumers.  It's not easily turned around and I don't know how you turn it around.  And even if we do have any hopes and, and if we do have ambitions, we still have to go to the other side even to get financing.  There was a time I think we, we, we missed it in the '60s [1960s].  We were on our way and we blew it.  You only get one chance.  I don't we--I don't think there's a second chance, and that scares me.  It's like the--I, I liken it unto the Formula One racetrack when the cars are zipping by and zipping by and zipping by, and then you have to make your, your pit stop.  We make the pit stop and the crew is chilled out, drinking, smoking, laid back.  And, wait a minute, you're supposed to be on this car getting this thing to get back out on the track and everybody's chilling out.  And when you lose--when you get behind in the Formula One race, you're in trouble.  You're in serious trouble when you get behind on the pit stop.  And you get back--not only that, when you get back out on the track, you've got new folks in the race.  The--now, we have to face, face the reality of the Hispanic reality.  That's a reality that's happening.  So, not only are you behind in the race, but you've got new competition.  You can't catch up.  I don't--how do we catch up?  What--what's going to happen?  And that's frightening, man.  But not just with Hispanics.  We have other people that are now a factor, Indians, Koreans, and there's, there's a Chinese reality that's coming upon us, too.  Look at all the products.  I walk down the, the aisle at a--at a Kmarts and a Target and look at the products.  I've, I've even mentioned this to my wife [Marva Simmons].  Look at all the products, not some, all of the products, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, made in China, made in China, made in China; every last one.  And as African Americans, what are we making?  What are we doing?  And we're out there--and then we have these kids killing each other.  Kids--in Oak Park River Forest High School [Oak Park and River Forest High School, Oak Park, Illinois], something like 50 percent of the African American kids are dropping out of high school.  You look at the young men, the way they're conducting themselves.  Our young women can't find young men.  So, it--it's terrible.  Health issues.  I ride the bus and train, public transportation all the time.  I've been on the bus where 80 percent of the people are obese.  So, we got a health problem and that.  I'm frightened, I really am.  And I have grandchildren, so I don't know what the world holds for them.
Story_ID: 614002
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Pause) You're speaking specifically of photography?
Speaker 1: Well, no, not, not necessarily just that.
Speaker 2: Raising three wonderful daughters [Robbin Simmons Mugnaini, Tracey Simmons McGhee and Christie Simmons Edwards] is a very important thing in my life and I think that when one looks at our society, what's happening with our society and our children; that is so important.  When I--when I look at my children, it means so much when I--when I see what they've accomplished, and it makes you feel that you've succeeded.
Story_ID: 614003
Speaker 1: Well, tell us something about them, their, their names and what they're doing now and--
Speaker 2: Okay.  My oldest daughter, Robbin Mugnaini [Robbin Simmons Mugnaini], is a newscaster and anchor at FOX news [WSVN-TV] in Miami [Florida].  And she wanted to become a newscaster once I took her down and--Channel 2 [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois] when she was nine years old, and that's been her desire and love since then, and she's achieved that.  And Paolo [Paolo Mugnaini], her husband, is a great guy.  He's a--he's a videographer and photographer, chef, certified trainer, and he's like my, my son.  And he's from Italy.  They got married there in Rome [Italy] and his parents just love Robbin and we've been there actually a couple times.  So, she's found a good guy, which means so much nowadays.  Tracey is my middle daughter.  She's a sales rep for Pfizer pharmaceuticals [Pfizer Inc.].  She's been named among the six top sales reps in Illinois.  And she's just--master's degree in business.  She's always been a business type person.  And she's, she's married to Rob [Robert McGhee], who's a vice president of U.S. Bank, great guy, just--again, another great guy.  And they're very much alike.  They're very business oriented.  And so they're good--just great couple.  My, my youngest daughter [Christie Simmons Edwards] studied at Alvin Ailey [The Ailey School, New York, New York] in dance and she's decided that dance is not her direction.  And she's married to Chris [ph.], and--oh, Edwards is the last name.  I didn't give her name.  Oh, I didn't give Trace- Tracey's, Tracey McGhee [Tracey Simmons McGhee], Tracey and Rob.  And so they have two children and this is her second marriage and Chris is a great guy.  And so she decided that she didn't want to pursue dance any longer, so she went to work for some doctors at Northwestern [Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois], right on Chicago [Avenue] and the lake [Lake Michigan].  And so she started getting promoted, just one after another, one time after another just in a matter of months.  And then she decided she wants to be a doctor, so she's in pre-med and they've worked out scholarships for her at Northwestern.  And so when your children do that well, it's--makes you feel just wonderful.  It is--it's such a wonderful feeling.  And you, you feel that you've done something right.
Speaker 1: Well, in terms of--in terms of your own career, I mean, I, I know your parents [Lillian Drayton Simmons and Luther Simmons] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can't--I got to add--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --the woman who has helped make all of this possible, my wife of going on forty-three years, Marva [Marva Simmons], so--okay, now we move on (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, what does she do?  I mean, is she--
Speaker 2: She's a retired teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so--and she--she's just--that's the one.  That's the foundation of the family.  When you have a good wife that makes the difference.  She's always there, always--she's got my back, always there for me and for the family, and the girls love her to death.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that, that makes a difference.  Okay, now we can move on.

Speaker 2: [U.S.] Air Force (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) is still around--I mean--in--yeah, in the Air Force, yeah.  But, what, what do you think your--do you think your parents would be proud of what you've done so far?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I, I wish that I could just see them to just say thank you.  I said 'cause Mom went through a lot.  She worked so hard and--to keep things going and I look at some of her--I, I, I don't look at her letters anymore.  I have a lot of them 'cause it, it brings tears to my eyes because she--you know, to see her--be a good boy, you know, when you're away, and, you know, don't hang with the wrong crowd and, you know, her grammar wasn't good in the letters.  She spoke well.  And it's interesting when I look at the letters.  You know, her grammar was good when she spoke, but in the letters, you know, her writing was that well--it wasn't that good.  And to read those letters, it brings--it brings tears in my eyes, and think how hard she worked for seven dollars a day.  That's what she made, seven dollars a day working, and she worked so hard.  And then, you know, she died of cancer.  So, I wish I could say thank you because they made the difference in my life.  That's, that's why I am who I am because of my wonderful parents.

Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked we need to talk about before I ask my one last question?
Speaker 2: Hm.  I don't know.  We've covered a lot.  (Pause) I don't know, where is photography going?  Which I wonder.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we could add--yeah.
Speaker 2: I, I know with, with, with digital photography, I have to, to wonder.  It has changed the, the industry so much.  The future is such that it's, it's kind--in, in a--in a way, it's disturbing because off times the, the response is, oh, we'll take care of that in Photoshop.  And that--and you hear that more and more.  Oh, don't, don't worry about that.  I'm gonna take care of that in Photoshop.  And I think it might get to the point that it will all be done in, in--in an equivalent to Photoshop until it will be--we'll take care of that in Photoshop (laughter).  So, the photographer might be eliminated where they'll have a layout and you won't need a photographer, and that just might happen.  I think even to the point of--I told someone this and they didn't believe me.  I think it's 'Final Destination' where they have some characters that were not real that look so--it's--a couple of them were very close to, to looking like real people.  So, I, I think that the future is going to get to the point that--you're gonna see some commercials and--still commercials with, with still images that I think are going to look so real that they'll start having some where you won't have a--you won't need a photographer, the still life images and such, that you won't, won't even need a photographer.  That's not very nice, is it (laughter)?  It's not a nice thought.  But, hey, things are moving on.
Speaker 1: Or, or could it be that the photographer would be the artist who sits in front of the computer and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  It might be that sort of thing.  Because even with Photoshop, some people who don't have an eye for photography can do some re- just disgusting retouching if--again, you gotta know what you want.

Speaker 1: Last question.
Speaker 2: Last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 1: For being an honest and real human being.  I think real- being a real person and true person probably means more than anything, that--being a good father, good husband.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Certainly.
Speaker 2: All right.  It's been a pleasure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Been a pleasure, too.  Okay.  Thank you.
