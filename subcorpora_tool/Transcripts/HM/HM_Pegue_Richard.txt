Story_ID: 11686
Speaker 1: I want to start out by really asking you about your family and--But I wanna start out also by asking about, what you know about the origin of your name.
Speaker 2: I've read on the Richards side of it.  I just forget what it comes from. Pegue, I always term it Mississippi and New Orleans [Louisiana] cotton field French. But I found that it has a Spanish equivalent spelled the same way, pronounced totally different. So somewhere back there, down there everybody got together. I met a young man, who was from North Carolina, same name, Charles Pegues with the S however, and he was plant--His folks were plantation owners. So if you put two and two together you can come up with four point one that's where it is.
Speaker 1: And the Spanish pronunciation, how is it pronounced?
Speaker 2: I really can't--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Can't do it?
Speaker 2: Do it.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's alright.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about--Do you remember your father much? Or you were three when he passed away.
Speaker 2: Not really. No.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what you know of your father? His name? And, I mean you know--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The name's the same [Richard Pegue]. And he was a Park District Policeman when the Chicago [Illinois] Park District was a separate entity from the Chicago [Illinois] Police Proper. And he was killed in 1946, when I was three. So my memory of that is not really there.
Speaker 1: So he was really killed? I never think of the Chicago [Illinois] Park District people being able to be--Does that mean he was killed in the line of duty? Do you know--
Speaker 2: In the line of duty about 60th [Street] and Eberhart [Avenue]. [Chicago, Illinois] Which wasn't too far from where we lived. And I read some newspaper accounts, but not really much to remember.
Speaker 1: Do you know was he born here or was he--where was he originally from?
Speaker 2: He was born in Mississippi and I wanna say, Indianola [Mississippi] but I don't think that was it. Siren courtesy of the Chicago Fire Department.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think of where my grandmother [Mary Pullins] was born. It was not Indianola. I can't think of it.
Speaker 1: Amory [Mississippi].
Speaker 2: Amory, Mississippi?
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Mississippi.
Speaker 2: A-M-E-R-Y?
Speaker 1: A-M-O-R-Y I think.
Speaker 2: A-M-O-R-Y?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm I think that's it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now your mother. Can you give her name? And can you tell us about her and where she was from originally?
Speaker 1: Laura Louise Mays was her maiden name. She was from Georgia, Columbus, Georgia. 1922 was when she was born.
Speaker 2: And do you know about--Did she ever share anything about growing up with you? Her growing up?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Was she a sort of quiet woman?
Speaker 1: Quiet?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: No! She got real live. Really live (chuckle) after I grew up she got--You know, when you're a little bitty--you have a different perception. But after she whips your behinds a couple of times you discover that she can get live.  And she did get live.
Speaker 2: And let me ask you, the grandmother that gave you the reel to reel, was that your--on which side your maternal or paternal?
Speaker 1: That was my father's mother.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay. So--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) No, take that back. That was my stepfather's mother actually.
Speaker 2: Hmm. Your stepfather's--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) It was, yeah.  It was kind of open to interpretation from the newspaper article.
Speaker 2: But it was my stepsister's grandmother.
Speaker 1: So your mother got remarried then.
Speaker 2: My mother was married three times.
Story_ID: 11687
Speaker 1: Now tell me what Richard, what--if you have an earliest memory, what your earliest memory is?
Speaker 2: One of them would have been throwing water balloons off of the third floor of 6218 Eberhart [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] when the watermelon man, watermelon man came down the alley and you'd throw the balloon off of--and then you run back into the kitchen. One of the things watermelon man--water balloon. That was about the time that I was beginning to realize where I was. That would have been like 1947, '45 [1945].  Just yesterday.
Speaker 1: You were '19--okay '46 [1946].  You were still about four or five? Richard, hold on a second.  I need this address.
Speaker 2: Three or four, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: What do I remember from then? (Mimes touching a wall.) Inside the womb the pantomime, who did that, that pantomime?
Speaker 1: Was it Richard Pryor?
Speaker 2: Nah. It was somebody else.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) It was--It was the famous pantomimist (sic)--
Speaker 2: Marcel--
Speaker 1: Marcel Marceau.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You would do that?
Speaker 2: No. (Chuckling) Oh my--
Speaker 1: What did that mean then?
Speaker 2: I mean just before, like before then, I don't remember. That's as far back as you could go.
Speaker 1: Now you have a--you have--Is it one sister?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: Okay. Is that a stepsister or is--
Speaker 2: Yeah. But, you know, that's my sister.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Your sister. Okay. And her name is Janice. She was younger then?
Speaker 2: 1951 compared to my 1943.  So she's eight years younger.
Story_ID: 11688
Speaker 1: Can you describe sort of family life growing up and the type of person, you know, child you were and--
Speaker 2: I was pretty cool. I guess I was whatever you would describe as average. I mean I had a liking for music reasonably early, like about four or five. And I didn't get into too much trouble.  I played with matches just like everybody else does--the one time. And after that my interest kind of went towards music, but not rapidly.
Speaker 1: Now when you say,  you had an interest in music, you know, around four or five, what do you remember? Was there a lot of music in your home?
Speaker 2: Listening to the radio. And my mother always listened.  Maybe that's why I ended up working in that field. But there was so much radio that I listened to before I knew what it was.
Speaker 1: And do you remember some of the personalities or things that were on at that time at that young age? You know.  I'm gonna ask you one other thing--
Speaker 2: Not to tap your feet.
Speaker 1: Okay. (Chuckling) Okay.
Speaker 2: Did I do that right? Yes I did.
Speaker 1: (Chuckling).
Speaker 2: I remember--Al Benson and his first coming. And by that, I mean about 1949, here in Chicago [Illinois]. I had no big interest in him or the programs at that time [at age six].  But I do remember him. Probably because of his speech pattern. Which has been heralded.  Well, you know, before.  I remember Canadian Ace Beer was one of his sponsors. That's (chuckle) the one thing that stood out. So I listened to a lot of radio from way back.
Speaker 1: Can you replicate what Al Benson sounded like?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) No.
Speaker 2: I have a friend, who can do it and he's really good at it. It was a combination of mispronunciations, probably sounded like he had false teeth. I know how that sounds because (clicks his own teeth). People talked negatively about the way he sounded.  But I've got an interview that he did. And he said truthfully that he just tried to be hisself. It was easier and he didn't pretend.  I liked the way he sounded.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Because he was real.  He was not the--He was Al Benson. And he was there before all of them, as far as I'm concerned.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what everyone says.  Except there were people--some people also in the South too. But he was big here. Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. As far as--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) As far as--
Speaker 2: Being from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Chicago--
Speaker 2: That's all I knew.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 11689
Speaker 1: Are there other memories of yours of growing up that you sort of remember? I mean playing with kids in the neighborhood, your friends, you know, home life, family life, any of that?
Speaker 2: Well we went from 62nd [Street] and Eberhart [Avenue] to Princeton Park, out in 91st [Street] and Wentworth [Avenue,  Chicago, Illinois] . The distance from one side of the street to the other was several miles then.  Today it's only about thirty feet.  The world got smaller. And I droved past there a couple of weeks ago. And I always look from one side of the street and go, "It's teeny-weeny compared to me and that red--American Flyer red wagon that I had. I've got some pictures.  And every now and then I look at them and think about life back then. But the first grammar school was Gillespie [Elementary School], at 93rd [Street] and State or Gillespie portables in Princeton Park. And then I integrated a grammar school, Cornell [Elementary School,  Chicago, Illinois]. And I did integrate it. That was a real experience.
Speaker 1: So the community you moved into was what type of community then?
Speaker 2: Chatham [neighborhood in Chicago], 73rd [Street] and Evans [Avenue] and that was 1951. And that's where I grew up. We integrated the block. We integrated the grammar school. I was just an integrationist. And I had a ball.
Speaker 1: What made your mother--What made your mother decide to move there? I mean [unclear]? Do you know?
Speaker 2: My--I would think that the move was based on that was the pattern at the time. To move into the seventies [blocks] was a feat in itself at the time, in 1951. I think it was the idea of a safer neighborhood. And it was my mother [Laura Louise Mays] and me. Not really a two-parent household. Then, at that time, however, she was--she had remarried.  So it was a two-parent household. And then my [step]sister [Janis] came along and her grandmother.  So there were four or five of us in that big house.
Speaker 1: And that was the time of a lot of restrictive covenants here. I mean even that, you know, the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s], you know, at that point in time. But did you--Any experiences as a child any hostility or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Ooo yeah. In--At Cornell [Elementary School], at school being the first, I would say for a few days.  But after the second brother and the third brother then we had to start fighting our way out of the schoolyard. And I can remember their names even. Nathaniel Barnes (ph.) and Quitman Ireland (ph.). And we saved each other. And--then we started having fun.
Story_ID: 11690
Speaker 1: Can you describe what you were like young? I mean were you well-mannered? Were you quiet? Were you mischievous? Were you introspective? What kind of child were you?
Speaker 2: I didn't bother anything. I had a dog, I had a cocker spaniel. I started reading science fiction a long time ago. And so I read a lot. And I had the toys. We weren't rich. We weren't poor. I had a piano. We had a piano. More than that, once I got that tape recorder I was off and on my way. I had a movie projector. I had the toys. But my toys were good toys like that.
Speaker 1: So what attracted you about science fiction? What was that all about?
Speaker 2: Because I didn't like the rest of it--whatever there was to read, science fiction was--caught my eye, caught my mind. And I was in space a long time ago. Tom Corbett and the Space Cadets ['Tom Corbett,Space Cadet'] on television.  I'm looking for that tape right now. 'Captain Video'. I was into the space stuff. So when 'Star Trek' came along that's old hat.
Speaker 1: So were you a 'Trekkie' ?
Speaker 2: Oh definitely.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh. Okay then.
Speaker 2: Black and white Trek.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: When it first started.
Story_ID: 11691
Speaker 1: Now so you said that when you got the tape recorder [as a gift from his grandmother for his eleventh birthday] things sort of open up. And what was important about that? Because it was a reel-to-reel.
Speaker 2: Yes. It was--It allowed me to borrow music from the radio of course. And get the music of the time. And some of the events of the time. But mostly the music. Whatever they'd done recently with Napster I was doing in 1955. Stealing the music and ironically trying to cut the disc jockey out of the tape. A mistake, terrible mistake.  Should have let the music roll--let the tape roll and get the disc jockey and all of that. But not thinking. And now that tape would be so valuable to so many people. And now I think of people who tried to get me out of the tape. "Durn yah! Take me with you." You know. But the tape recorder was the key to helping my ears hear what I needed to. And the key to jumping into electronics. And the combination of the electronics and music. So it was--That was it--the recorder.
Speaker 1: Why do you think your grandmother gave it to you?
Speaker 2: Because I wanted it. Why? I mean she was very accommodating as far as that was concerned.  Why did I want it? Because I saw it and saw what it was capable of. And once I got it. I was recording everything. Sound effects, my piano playing--yuck. Just a lot of stuff.
Story_ID: 11692
Speaker 1: What other things were happening to you at that time? I'm sorry. I'm mean I'm just trying to figure out your maturation process, that's all.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm. Women.
Speaker 1: (Laughing).
Speaker 2: Got yah (chuckling)! Well. I'm a normal man and--little girls, who were not so little 'cause I was little.  Also I noticed that if you were playing the music you could talk to all the women along the way. And I did. But in high school the music in terms of dealing with the live music aspect. We had a singing group in grammar school. Two of the members went to Hirsch [High School, Chicago, Illinois] with me. We took the group there. And the group grew and grew. Members in and out. And I was the star. Now.
Speaker 1: Wait! So wait a minute. Is that the group the Belvederes?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So the Belvederes started in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Actually in elementary school with me playing the piano. And two of us went to Hirsch and then we started adding people to the group. No more piano. I started singing background. And that was the start of the Belvederes, who became the Norvells, who recorded that big hit on Chess Records called 'Greasy Kid Stuff' and the other side. And we were stars. We thought.
Speaker 1: So was--Because wasn't Richard Steele, he wasn't--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But he--When did he come in? In high school?
Speaker 2: He came in, in high school. He transferred from [Francis W.] Parker [High School, South Side, Chicago, Illinois] to Hirsch, and that's where we met him.  We were singing in the lunchroom and he joined in one day. And we said, "Hey! Why don't you come in the group?"
Speaker 1: So did the group--The group originated at school not at churches.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And the group originated at school. I joined the choir in high school. We all did. We were drafted, because we were causing so much commotion in the lunchroom, the music department approached us and we got in the choir. But I sang in church too.
Speaker 1: So what denomination are you? What--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Lutheran.
Speaker 1: Lutheran. Oh! Lutheran.
Speaker 2: The original Protestants. Right on! (Chuckling)
Speaker 1: Huh!
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) We still sang those (singing) "The Lord is--" not the--They're gonna change that one day.
Speaker 1: You sang the spirituals. The high--the high high
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)  Hymns. Hymns.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously)  Hymns! That's right hymns.
Speaker 2: Hymns.
Speaker 1: That's right . That's right.
Story_ID: 11693
Speaker 1: Your activities really are around music at this time [high school] and your people. I mean how large is your group?
Speaker 2: The group [The Belvederes] was only five of us. And I played guitar.
Speaker 1: And you were--Weren't you singing--Was it--Did it start out to be doo-wop?
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We did the Spaniels. We did The Dells. We did all of those people. Did you expect classical?  I didn't get into classical until later. But I got into it.
Speaker 1: You know, what I find--'cause doo-wop was very, very popular here [Chicago, Illinois]. And there were a lot of groups around in different, you know, in different--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Thousands--
Speaker 1: Thousands.
Speaker 2: Groups here.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that, you know, just that whole phenomenon?
Speaker 2: Well it was the closest thing that you could do to become the star that you wanted to. And after 1955, I mean there was life before then.  But '55 [1955], and I always give credit to a New York [New York] group, Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers. Once they hit, then you saw it was really possible. I mean once they were mainstream with that one song ["Why Do Fools Fall In Love?"] then anybody could do it. So we felt. Now before then there were what I call the 'true-wops'. Not the doo-wop but the true-wops.  Which would have been the groups like The Flamingos and the Moonglows, who were there doing it. But that was before the mainstream hit came along. I respect so much those groups though. And I love playing their music on the air. But it was that phenonomenon of Frankie Lymon, who made it possible for everybody to come along and doo-wop and be a success.
Story_ID: 11694
Speaker 1: Why do you think Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers  took off the way they did?  Do you think it was good management? Do you think it was that they were youth or--
Speaker 2: It was all those things. And now that you can look at the business as an adult, you see where it was all of those things in harmony. The young lead singer.  The twelve, thirteen, and fourteen year old phenomena, which has been repeated.  That was one key thing. The background was choreographed. They had steps. They did--They were very visual. But the song was a wonderful song. So it was all of those things. And it happened at the time [1955] that, that rock and roll stuff was busting out on the Perry Como and the Kate Starrs and the traditional people now on the radio you can hear music that appeal to you. Not only on your station, but on other stations as well. So it was a combination of all of it. And the business behind the record business.
Story_ID: 11695
Speaker 1: You know, it doesn't matter what your background is or your neighborhood, or your zip code. It [new music] wasn't what was before.  I mean what is rap to me now?  "Turn that stuff down!" That's what my mother was saying! In the--even when Mary Wells was--"Turn that stuff down!" You know, and then she said, "It all sounds alike!" And no it didn't. This song was about going there. And this song was about going here. But it was whatever fame we could get at the time, and doo-wop thing was it.
Speaker 2: Now at the same time, was this when WGES [AM radio, Chicago, Illinois] was in its sort of hey day or--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Or was what was really available--?
Speaker 1: WGES, which was 1390, was playing those doo-wops and the existing at the time jazz. And it's a very broad term. And kind of like I've heard the expression used, 'swing jazz' or jump". It was like going--It was the music that Red Saunders [jazz percussionist] and his band would play at the Regal [Theatre, Chicago, Illinois] between the shows or between the acts. It was jazz based but not by what we consider jazz now. But those doo-wops were just at the right time.  Whatever fame you could get since you weren't an instrumentalist--you could get it singing doo-wop.
Story_ID: 11696
Speaker 1: Now, 1390, isn't that the WVON [AM radio, Chicago, Illinois] call, I mean numbers?
Speaker 2: Ah, there was a big mix-up on that. 1390 was WGES first. Then it became WYNR [AM radio, Chicago, Illinois].  Then along came 'VON on 1450. Then 'VON and 1450 were sold to a company that bought 1390. So the VON call letters went from 1450 to 1390 and then back again. The reason they went back was to avoid confusion [chuckling] by creating more confusion. I was part of the decision making process to remove 'VON from 1390, in 1981. It was my decision along with Marv Dyson's.
Speaker 1: Oh!
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My fault.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But they gave the 'VON back to some of the people who were there when it started namely Pervis [Spann], since he is part owner of it. 'Cause those call letters would not have been available had we not turned them aloose.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Hmm.
Speaker 2: And there was kind of a negative on the VON call letters.  Because that was like "that old station."  And 'GCI [WGCI-FM radio, Chicago, Illinois] was "this new station." So they wanted their own identity. So it was instead of 'VON and 'GCI it was 'GCI-AM and 'GCI-FM. But that was part of my doing. (whispering) They never thanked me for giving their call letters back. But I did it.
Story_ID: 11697
Speaker 1: WGES--GES that was the station you were listening to. Right?
Speaker 2: All of us were. Al Benson. to those people. Al Benson, shall I name? At least those that I know.
Speaker 1: Now Al (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Ric Ricardo, Norm Spaulding, Sid McCoy, Sam Evans--'Jam With Sam'--that was the guy. He was in that evening listening period that as teens we all listened. So I grew up listening to Sam Evans or 'Jam With Sam' play his music from nine o'clock [P.M.] until midnight, on 1390 [AM]. And that was good stuff. That was Frankie Lymon and The Spaniels and The Dells. And--Boy, those Dells, they go way back, don't they? But they made such good songs, yeah. And I remember listening to all that on a little brown wooden radio with the one knob there that my mother gave me, trying to keep me away from her radio. But it didn't work. (whispering) I tore that radio up.
Speaker 1: So did you have any favorite one of those DJs, any one your favorite? Was it Sam the--
Speaker 2: 'Jam With Sam' because he was the one. We knew he was an older guy not our peer, wasn't a young guy.  But he had the music we wanted. Dick Clark was never as young as his audience.  But he had the music that we wanted to hear. So Jam With Sam was my guy. And all of us as teenagers, who grew up in that period.  There were others on the air but we really didn't listen to them that much.
Speaker 1: So you were spending your time between performing, you know, with your group [The Belvederes]. And where were you performing? (unclear) I mean in--
Speaker 2: Every basement that would have us. Right? We did parties. While in high school it was principally the assemblies that we did. We became the in thing. We were the first black talent on stage at Hirsch High School [Chicago, Illinois], as far as I know. No one before us and certainly no one who did popular music. There may have been a young lady who played piano.  But nobody, who (finger snap) could get up and do the thing. We were the group. And we were the spotlight.
Speaker 1: And Hirsch was a mixed school then? Oh yes because you're--That right.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Very much.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's--Okay right.
Speaker 2: Very much. Hirsch was--when I went in, in '57 [1957], Hirsch was thirty percent black at the most.  When I came out in '64 [1964]--sorry '61 [1961], Hirsch was thirty percent all others and seventy percent black. That period between '57 [1957] and '61 [1961], was the turnover. And it was great.
Speaker 1: That's a huge turnover when you think about it. People were coming in by droves and people were leaving in droves too.
Speaker 2: In four years.  Maybe I'm a little heavy on the percentages.  But certainly sixty-five/thirty-five.
Story_ID: 11698
Speaker 1: Now you--at the same time that you're--What did the--So you're performing, but when did you start really acting as, you know, the music--When you say you provide music for dancers was that through the group?
Speaker 2: No. I started playing disc jockey in the--at the different parties in 1957. When I went into high school.  It just kind of happened like that. The first party I did was with my church. I had no equipment. My church's public address amplifier and my tape recorder that I had used to get the music off the radio. So I was the disc jockey. I'd play my tape.  Then I got records. Ah I was happy. I had me a seventy-eight [rpm] and forty-five [rpm], I was getting down, you know. That first party was at 76th [Street] and St. Lawrence [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] at Woodfield Ingleside Church. And then a couple of others and people see you playing and they ask you to do their parties. And I brought equipment and I did more and more. So I've been spinning records since 1957, in terms of the public. And I haven't stopped. It's fun.
Speaker 1: It just came up that you got asked to do it the first time? Is that it? Or you volunteered?
Speaker 2: Nah. I got asked.
Speaker 1: You got asked. And I wanna ask a question later about this. But let me ask--I wanna ask this question. Have you found like over the years just the act of DJ-ing [disc jockeying] has changed much? You know--
Speaker 2: Oh certainly.
Speaker 1: In what way?
Speaker 2: Along with the--Along with playing the music, personality to a degree based on what was happening on the radio started to determine what you did on the streets or at the party when you were spinning music. The people on the radio became personalities in '62 [1962], '63 [1963].  So the people who were in the clubs started to emulate the disc jockeys that they heard on the air. [Bill] 'Butterball' [Crane] was a great disc jockey at WVON here in Chicago [Illinois]. There were 300 Butterballs out there in the street, who were talking and sounding like Butterball sounded on the radio. And Joe Cobb.  Joe was a fast talking hip [snapping fingers] type of disc jockey.  And Joe Cobb had to have 250 people in the street sounding like him. You know, you've made it, when you got over a hundred people sounding like you. So the people in the streets followed the style of radio. And radio followed the style of the music.
Story_ID: 11699
Speaker 1: What does it feel like, you know, to--you're making people have a good time, you know.  You're an observer sort of. You know, you're--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What do you think--What was that whole sort of experience like? I mean what made you like DJ-ing is what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: I think that the ability--There are two things happening.  One the ability for the disc jockey to perform was one thing and develop your skills at that act.  And the other thing is dealing with the feedback from two sources, what you say and what you play. Some people spin music and say nothing. And that's good. That's good for them. But their able to get feedback by watching the crowd, the people react to the songs that they play. It's a two-way conversation very often with nothing said. But those of us that do have the ability to communicate with people, who are dancing to our music, we feed off of each other. And in that case that's also the ability to do that and trying not to interfere with the music. Same thing in terms of the air.  There was a style of doing radio and talking all across the records and I think we've all heard that at one time. I don't knock it. But I don't want to do that when somebody is out there listening just to hear their favorite song. So in terms of radio we might work the intro. But once the guy opens his mouth and takes that breath you're out of there. You know. Let them hear the words at least and that's the way we do it. But it m--it does make a difference.  Because if you do say things that are pertinent and that people can emotionalize, feel with, they feel that you're talking to them and not at them. And they become your friends. And you become their friend. And it happens on both levels.  I think on the air as well as in the clubs.
Story_ID: 11700
Speaker 1: In 1961, when you, you know, when you graduated from high school you start working--You said you took a job bagging groceries until Morrie Albert came along and hired you? Or were--Or did you go and get a job at Morrie  Albert?
Speaker 2: I did two things.'61 [1961], my cousin was an assistant manager at the Del Farm Food Store--Supermarket at 63rd and South Park [Chicago, Illinois] then. So that was a family thing. "Go get a job, boy", my mamma said. So I did. But in '62 [1962], while I was going to Wilson Junior College [later Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois], I'd heard about this record shop [Met Music] on 58th Street.  But I'd never been there. And then, I went there. And that was it. I'm in love with a building that has a record shop. And I ask the owner, "Do you need help?" I was willing to work for free just to be around the music. And he was a very gracious gentleman. He hired me. He was also my contact later on with Leonard Chess [originally Lezjor Czyz, founder of Chess Records, Chicago, Illinois]. And it was Maurie Alpert who put me in touch with Leonard and recommended me for the job at 'VON [WVON-AM radio, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: So were Maurie Alpert and Leonard Chess friends then?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or just business associates?
Speaker 2: Both.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both.
Speaker 1: Okay. So when you got that job in the record store, you were probably in seventh heaven. Huh?
Speaker 2: Absolutely. No pay. Just,  "Al, these are the records I'm taking home this week, Boss." "Okay." Didn't steal. And didn't get paid because I was working on my collection and it paid off.
Speaker 1: So was that what--This was located let's say-- His record shop was located where?
Speaker 2: 58th and the El [elevated train], 328 East 58th Street.  So right near the El tracks, at 58th Street.  There was another Metropolitan Record Shop at 47th [Street] and South Park [Avenue] right across from the Regal Theatre. Few people knew it, they were cousins. But they were not connected in that business. Metropolitan was a different store. I never worked there.
Speaker 1: And now is the community around there mainly black at this point in time or is it mixed?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood?
Speaker 1: Hmm. The neighborhood there is all black?
Speaker 2: All black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we had customers at 58th Street from all over the world. That was the record shop in terms of getting hard to get records. And we had people from Japan, Sweden, Germany, who came there. In some cases once a year and they spent a week at the shop in the basement going through the records. These are people that are serious about their music. And we had them.  It was the record shop. And I'm certain before that time there were probably others.  But what I liked about the Met was not only the music, but the whole aura around it. And the fact that it wasn't a neighborhood record store. It was one of the world stores.
Speaker 1: And you--How long had it taken him to--How long had that shop been there?
Speaker 2: He [Maurie Alpert] opened in the early '50s [1950s], I think.  I'm not sure. And he had the store until 1970. So it was a  good almost twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: So he was a lover of music himself.
Speaker 2: Mmm no, he--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Or you think (unclear)?  More of a businessman?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) He was a businessman.
Speaker 1: He was a businessman. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he--Was he that much into the music at all?
Speaker 2: Nah.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Isn't that interesting?
Speaker 2: He didn't have time to express any particulars about the music. He was business. But he was one of the most likeable, pleasant people. I don't know if he listened to any music at home. But he was such a pleasure to work with and talk to. And everybody liked him.
Speaker 1: So was he was a good mentor to you as a young black kid or not really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He--In fact, he knew that I was into the creative side of the music. So he funded--He had, had a record company . He had put several records out on the Penny [Record Company] label, P-E-N-N-Y and I saw it in the basement. I said, "What is this?" He said, "Ah they had a record out." "Well I got a group. I've got a couple of singers." And one of the gentlemen in the record store sang. So Morie funded my studio career. He made fifteen maybe twenty different records put out fifteen or so. And I had the major hit of that series. Not a million seller.  But it did good locally. And Little Ben and the Cheers was a group from Altgeld Gardens [public housing project, Chicago, Illinois] that I had come in contact with through a friend. They were the nephews of the Norfleet Brothers [gospel group]. So they came from a gospel family. But we recorded 'I'm Not Ready To Settle Down', by Little Ben and the Cheers. So the gospel singers was getting down.
Speaker 1: Hmm. Can you sing a refrain from that?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) (Chuckling).
Speaker 1: Come on!
Speaker 2: That's cute.
Speaker 1: That's cute?
Speaker 2: I can give you the words.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: "Darling I love you." Lord Jesus. This was a long time. I wrote this on a brown paper bag.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) So you--Oh! That's right! You wrote that. That's right. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what motivated--Okay. But you--Were you in love sort of at the time?
Speaker 2: You know, I was walking to the other job from the record shop to the grocery store. And it was about I guess my girlfriend at the time.  She became my wife. And maybe I wasn't ready to settle down.  But it was a good song, I think. And I wrote it on a brown paper bag from the record shop to the grocery store. Two years later, I wrote the arrangements on the kitchen table. 'Cause we had gotten married. So it was at that point that it became real.  And she used to kid me about, "That song is still not pertinent, is it? You use that word. You don't mean that now do you?" "Nah. You and me baby."
Speaker 1: So what are some of the--Give some of the lyrics. What are some of the--But do you remember? I know.
Speaker 2: Why do I draw a blank right now?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh.
Speaker 2: But it got--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I see.
Speaker 2: To be, "Darling I love you. I really do." I mean great words, you know. Then end story is, "Pretty soon I'll be ready to settle down." And that was it. It just resolved in the song, "I'm not ready. Darling I love you blah, blah, blah." And--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You know, it gets--
Speaker 2: Of course, when I get in the car those words are gonna (snaps fingers) right there.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Are going to--right (snaps fingers) there.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) may come back before you know it.
Story_ID: 11701
Speaker 1: Now the other thing so you're also besides working at the record store, how did the whole thing come about going to Columbia College [Chicago, Illinois]? You're going to Columbia College was before you had the record come out, 'I'm not Ready To Settle Down'.
Speaker 2: Ooh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just slightly.
Speaker 1: Okay. Just slight. And how did that come about? And what was Columbia College like in those days, too? Because it's a much different institution now--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm. Yes.
Speaker 1: --than it was.
Speaker 2: 540 North Lake Shore Drive on the seventh Floor, I think. It was a small school compared to Wilson Junior College [later Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] certainly. And I liked Columbia because it was very intimate. And you could learn something about the business of radio from the classical perspective. I don't mean the music.  But I mean from the formal presentation. And learn something about television. I was a photographer of sorts. And the interesting thing to me was to see my pictures that I had shot with my 35mm camera, appear on the television screen, in some context. But I finally had to put the camera down.  Because it got expensive when I started buying sound equipment. And that was it for Columbia.
Story_ID: 11702
Speaker 1: Your mother-- what did she think of you going to Columbia [College Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh she thought it was wonderful, of course. My grandmother funded the trip to Columbia and made me pay her back. Which now that I look back on it was the right thing to do.  But at the time, "You mean I gotta pay you back Grandma? Oh Grandma let me rub you down."  You know.  But she did.  She was responsible for that.  And my first official piano lessons at age thirteen.
Speaker 1: So at the time that you went, you--had you decided you wanted to be a DJ [disc jockey]?  Is that--
Speaker 2: --at Columbia?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah that was in the back of my mind, but to learn about the whole radio business and on air, behind the scenes, the whole thing.  I went into Columbia after Wilson [Junior College, later Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] which would have been about '65 [1965].  So when (sings) "Sugar pie honey bunch" [Can't Help Myself], was a brand new record, I was going to Columbia.  But in 1957, to go further back again, I visited--'59 [1959]--WBEE [AM radio, Chicago, Illinois]. They had studios at 6205 Cottage Grove [Avenue] in the Trianon Ballroom Building.  And I would go down there on the weekend and visit the weekend disk jockey down there.
Speaker 1: And who was that?
Speaker 2: His name was Russ Vanoy.  And of course Russ' daughter is married to some guy who plays basketball.  I think maybe one day he'll be successful at it.  A pretty good kid.  But I used to visit Russ at WBEE and he would let me answer the phones.  Man! I'm in radio big time.  He'd let me answer the phones and then I started--when they closed that studio, visiting WBEE, their main studio in Harvey [Illinois].  And that would've been like when 'Lonely Teardrops' was a brand new record.  And thirty years later, I'm working there.
Speaker 1: Now how did you come to know Russ Vanoy?  Was it that he--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) He was the weekend disk jockey.
Speaker 1: And so you just--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Knock on the door--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: "Can I see?"  He let me see.  And his--he was no longer there when they shut down that studio in the city.  And I never heard from him after that.  You know, we weren't that close.  But he was an acquaintance.  And he was the guy that let me in the front door.
Speaker 1: So you were, you were really pretty intent on this whole thing?  This was not passing--this was not a passing fancy.  (Simultaneously) This--the whole music thing.  It was all tied together.  The radio and the group and the tape recorder and the spinning records in the street.
Story_ID: 11703
Speaker 1: And so what were some of your favorite groups then at that time?
Speaker 2: All the locals.  Well most of the locals.  Impressions, Dells, Spaniels, Flamingos, Eldorados. Those were the big ones.  And most of them out of Vee-Jay Records [Chicago, Illinois] here.  Recently reading about some of these groups and the groups who were in the spotlight in the early '50s [1950s], I mean it's just the good stuff to be able to read about what I missed.  Just by a hair. Like maybe by five years.  And there're some really interesting stories about the Moroccos, the Dandeliers.  These are the older groups.  But the Flamingos go way back like the Dells.  And there's still a version of the Flamingos out there.  But nobody's original like the Dells.  They're the guys.
Speaker 1: That's amaze-- So when did the Dells get started?
Speaker 2: It had to have been like '50 [1950]--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Wow!
Speaker 2: '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Wow!  When you think about that--
Speaker 2: About 1953.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did--Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Go ahead.
Speaker 1: So you what--Do you think that was more home time--home town pride in the groups?  Or that this was really a unique sound that was a Chicago sound?  You know, or--I mean what do you think your attract--You know, you said "I really like, you know, I like the locals."
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  It's pretty much still the music that you grew up with.  This was the music that was always around you.  And eventually you wake up and realize it and get involved.  I mean I carried the--the songbook.  You know, the little magazine that had all the words to all the current songs.  I used to buy those.  "Why do fools fall in love?  Uh-oh" (chuckling),  You know, that had-- I --can't think of the names.  But they were songbooks.  And I used to buy them, and read them.  But you knew--you really didn't need them if you were an avid radio listener.  Because you learned the words.  And it wasn't hard, because life was so much simpler then.  I can't remember the words to my own song but it will come to me shortly.
Speaker 1: (Laughing).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 11704
Speaker 1: Okay let's talk about how you got introduced to Leonard Chess [originally Lezjor Czyz, of Chess Records, Chicago, Illinois].  And you said that you know, the owner of--Maurie Alpert--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Actually introduced you.  And was that a case of--Did that have--I know that's been--Well anyway how did that come about?  What--Did he come into the record shop?
Speaker 2: Oh no.  I would sometimes go to Leonard's base of operation at Chess Records to pick up records for the record shop [Maurie Alpert's Met Music, where Pegue worked].  So I would pick up from the manufacturer, bypassing the distributor and the records going directly to our retail outlet.  Because they were friends. Now you get that picture?  And during the course of events, I met Leonard.  And I said, "Maurie why don't you talk to him?  He got this radio station WVON.  I can do that."  And he did.  And I did.  That's how we got started.  Now, on the way I met Herb Kent.  Because Herb was playing our record in 1965.  That same hit 'I'm Not Ready to Settle Down' [written and produced by Pegue] So I brought the group [Little Ben and the Cheers] by the radio station.  I'm a big-time promoter, right?  I brought the group by the radio station and I had met Herb.  And a year later he stopped at the record shop, because he was looking for some records that we had.  A year later [1967], Herb asked me to come work at his record shop [and dance party hall] at 'Times Square' on 49th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue].  And so I did.  Not knowing that a year and-a-half later, I would be working at the radio station.  And so I did.  The irony is in 1981, early '82 [1982], I hired Herb to work at WGCI [FM radio, Chicago, Illinois], where I was program director.  So I worked for him, he worked for me.
Speaker 1: Now talk about Herb in those days.  What, you know--'Cause that was--he was, he was, he--had sort of created the characters, 'The Wahoo Man' and--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) 'The Wahoo', 'The Gym Shoe Creeper' and all of his cast of characters and the 'Electric Crazy People' totally amusing--amusing to us.  There was nothing on the air like it.  And even though there weren't that many installments, they did a lot.  It wasn't a new one everyday.  But you could hear them and always crack up with whatever was funny.  I mean even if you heard the same script twenty, thirty times, it was still funny.  It never wore out.  He was a genius at putting that, that stuff together at that time.
Speaker 1: And talk about the sock hops.  Because people--a lot of kids came out to those sock hops right?  Were they just--they weren't mainly ki--right? They were--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) We were all grown up at eighteen and nineteen.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay. So okay (laughing).
Speaker 2: At seventeen and--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay (Laughing).
Speaker 2: Sixteen.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (Laughing).
Speaker 2: Weren't you?  Yes you were.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (Laughing) I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: All right?
Speaker 1: (Laughing) Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) So there we were--and you know? When people weren't killing each other, it was a far better time for us.  Everybody had a good time when you didn't have to worry about your safety.  And the music was so vibrant at the time.  It was--the same way the younger generation reacts to rap [music] now.  That was us thirty, forty years ago.
Story_ID: 11705
Speaker 1: Can you tell a little bit about the story of Leonard Chess [originally Lezjor Czyz], and how they [he and his brother Phil, originally Fiszel, founders of Chess Records and WVON radio, Chicago, Illinois] got started and what-- Because they really--I mean the fact that they combined WV--the ownership of the station was a big deal.  That separated them from Vee-Jay [Records, Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: They got a split right?  'Cause Vee-Jay was really hot at one--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  They were down--they've always been down the street competitors.  Chicago's top product output came from Chess and Vee-Jay.  And they both had stars of absolute significance.  With a few artists that even went back and forth between the two.  The Dells were recording for both companies at different times.  Everybody else was independent.  But the real hits came out of Chess and Vee-Jay.
Speaker 1: So now what were some of the other artists with Vee-Jay? As opposed to some of the other artists with Chess?  Vee-Jay was Jerry Butler, the Dells, Wade Flemons, Dee Clark and on a lease deal the Four Seasons and that unknown group called the Beatles.  But there were plenty of other artists, smaller artists.  The Eldorados, the Spaniels, the doo-wop groups that were on Vee-Jay.  And Jimmy Reed, their main blues person for so many years.  They were a great company.  And their story is great to. Just as the Chess story is great.  I've read two, three books on Chess.  And it's a real kick to be able to read the written word about what you experienced part of--with Chess.
Speaker 2: Now--so all this activity is happening on the street.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: And--this is a little really bit before Motown [Records, Detroit, Michigan] really takes off right?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: And you talked about that some in, you know, in the article about how Chicago [Illinois] had a--I mean, you know 'cause--there was a real activity and energy here and it doesn't seem like it has, has ever existed since then.  But there was a real energy and activity.  But I'd like you to just sort of take us back and try to talk about, you know, why, what was the Chicago sound that developed out of here?  How did it differ from, you know, what was developing in Motown?  You know, why--what happened to it?
Speaker 1: The Chicago Music was more blues based and jazz based than some of the other areas of the country's.  I kind of break it down to: There's a Chicago sound, there's a New York [New York] sound.  There was kind of a Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]  that area, there was a Los Angeles [California] Sound.  But that's about it.  There were four or five major centers.  New Orleans [Louisiana] sound, which exemplified--Well let me just give you some examples.  I--would probably be the easiest one.  Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers was that New York jump J-U-M-P sound that just went all over the place.  The Chantels, my favorite girls' group, I love them so much.  They had that New York Sound.  But the Chantels, Little Anthony [and] the Imperials, the later Flamingos, all had that New York sound. The Chicago Sound was the Spaniels, Dells, Eldorados, Flamingos, the blues influence coming from the South via Muddy Waters [McKinley Morganfield], Jimmy Reed, Howlin' Wolf [Chester Burnett], these people.  The New Orleans sound exemplified I think best by (pauses) yes [Antoine] 'Fats' Domino. The studio--I can't think of the name of the guy--Toussaint--
Speaker 2: (unidentified observer:) Allen Toussaint.
Speaker 1: Allen Toussaint. That type of material with the horns, the low brass, the trombone, I love that stuff.  The New Orleans feel to that music--And then the West Coast, Sam Cooke.  And we claim Sam Cooke from Chicago.  But his first hits were all West Coast work.  'You Send Me' was the West Coast.  His early hits on SAR and Keen, those labels were all West Coast.  When he got to RCA [Radio Corporation of America] Records, that's when some of his recording was done in New York.  But the West Coast groups, the Six Teens, Eugene Church and the Fellows, the Hollywood Flames--every part of the country had a regional sound to it.  But Chicago's was distinctive.  The Detroit [Michigan] sound is only either after Berry Gordy [of Motown Records] or before Berry Gordy.  Before Berry Gordy it was--it, too, was more blues flavored.  But with the start of Motown, the infusion of what would now be called 'pop', the well-orchestrated things, that became the distinctive Detroit sound.  But 'The Wind' [1954, by] Nolan Strong and the Diablos from Detroit exemplified the Detroit sound before Berry Gordy.  And it was very close to our Chicago sound.
Story_ID: 11706
Speaker 1: Well in regard to Sam Cooke, Sam had the experience of having been the whole gambit from the so-called 'chitlin' circuit', gospel circuit.  He had all of this experience.  But more than that he had the business.  He learned the business of music in regard to publishing, ownership, master, deals, leasing, everything except engineering Sam Cooke was into as far as I can tell.  After reading a couple of books on him, he was one of the more articulate intuitive people in terms of the business.  It was about contracts.  It was about recording agreements.  He had the business acumen and when he left, he left a void in terms of younger people coming into the business.  And they're finding out about this now. The rappers are now involved in learning what publishing is about.  They went from zero to big business.  But you don't do it without the knowledge.  And their reading about the business has helped them get to that point. 'This Business of Music' [by M. William Krasilovsky] is a series of books that helped me. Because 'I'm Not Ready to Settle Down' [written by Pegue and recorded by Little Ben and the Cheers] had to be published.  So it was Maurie's [Alpert] publishing company, which I administrated.  So I had to learn about publishing and the business of it.
Speaker 2: So tell--talk about that. I didn't even know he had a publishing company. So
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There were a lot of people got ripped off there--But I mean no, no, I don't mean from him but I'm saying--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, a lot of black artists got ripped off over the years, you know, from publishing houses.  But what did you learn about the business when you were, you know--? So you were administrating--so you were keeping the books?  Um-hmm. Just--just, just for our--the product that I had created.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: Nicolet [Music] publishing, which was the publishing company [of Maurie Alpert] also I later found out owned one-third interest in 'The Monkey Time', Major Lance's song that was done by Curtis Mayfield. We had 'Monkey Time' and 'Hey Little Girl' and I think--'Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um'  I think we had that.  So there were three partnership deals that our publishing company had with some major artists and major songs.
Speaker 1: So what did you learn?  Was there anything surprising you learned about the publishing business when you,  you know,  were exposed to it?
Speaker 2: Well the one thing is that publishing as a word is an intangible.  You can't hold it in your hand.  Let me give you some publishing.  There it is.  Okay.  But if I have the contract, and we do that, then it means something.  It means having the check come to my address as opposed to your address for airplay and mechanicals and now licensing in terms of music use for Internet, in terms of music use for commercials. It's a big thing.  It's the legal, the intangible legal right to own a piece of music.  And so many people were ripped, ripped, ripped off because, "What's the publishing, man? Give me a dollar."  Bing ding da ding, and then you play.  And then you sing.  And then you sign that contract. And you don't read it.  And this happened all up and down this street [South Michigan Avenue, Chicago Illinois] Record Row. The people who are making the music now have so many chances to learn more about the business of it due to the changes in technology.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Now--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) They teach this in school now. They didn't teach it before.
Story_ID: 11707
Speaker 1: What did your group change to the Norvells?  Was that--And what was your group? Can you give the names?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean I know that it was Richard Steele that--
Speaker 2: Richard Slaughter is his legal name.  Richard Steele is a radio name.  Victor Trice (ph.) was our base singer.  Claude Wyatt (ph) also known as Addie and Reverend Wyatt's son was in our group.  At one time a friend of mine named Lamonte Boston (ph.), Toya Perry (ph.)who went to high school with us.  And I hope I don't--William Smith (ph.) was one of our members.  And I think that pretty much covers everybody (unclear).  We all grew out of Hirsch High School [Chicago, Illinois] with the exception of Richard who went to [Francis W.] Parker [High School, South Side, Chicago, Illinois] first and then came over to Hirsch.
Speaker 1: So why did you change from the Belvederes to the Norvells?
Speaker 2: Because it was sexier.  It sounded better and it was a better image for us.  The Belvederes, nahhh.  The Norvells--hey! (unclear).
Speaker 1: So did you guys you know, pay attention to your dress and you know, and your moves?  Did you practice those things?  Or that was--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) All the groups had the basic one step, finger snap, one step--we really didn't do big choreography. The Temptations had not come along yet. The Vibrations was a group that had choreography that we saw here in Chicago. And the whole Temptation concept had not hit. So there were a few major groups that had the steps to go along with the music.  But most of the time it was so cool with the hands and just that.  And--But the real steps were done by the Vibrations who did flying leaps across the Regal Theatre stage.  I mean they were enormously physical before the rest of the choreographed groups.
Speaker 1: Now what were some of the songs they're known for?
Speaker 2: The Vibrations?
Speaker 1: The Vibrations.
Speaker 2: 'The Watusi' was the big one.  'Oh Cindy', 'So Blue', 'The Junkaroo', 'Since I Fell For You'. They  had a lot of hits.  They did a version of 'Misty' that was wonderful. But they weren't from Chicago, although they did a lot of recording here.

Speaker 1: Berry Gordy in terms of putting the product out, probably first hit about '59 [1959] with Marv Johnson.  The 'You Got What it Takes'  Some of that stuff was not even on his label [Motown Records, Detroit, Michigan] .  But he was learning about the business.  But he hadn't hit the big time.  See, Vee-Jay [Records, Chicago, Illinois] and Chess [Records, Chicago, Illinois] were already rolling.  They just didn't go to the extent that he did in terms of artist development.  Gordy had that down, development and merchandising.  If Leonard [Chess] had done that, the Dells would have been you know, right up there.  Etta James would have been all the way up there.  She got there on the merit of 'At Last', and some of the other--a beautiful record. And beautiful lady.  But Chicago and the other cities didn't have that mass-merchandising concept that Berry Gordy was able to swing.  I read his book too.  I mean I would read on 'em.  But if it had happened here, it would have been bigger and I would never have turned those [Vee Jay] masters aloose on the Beatles.  But you never know what kind of forces are at work to make you turn those masters aloose.
Speaker 2: You're saying you had masters or Vee Jay Records had--?
Speaker 1: Vee Jay.
Speaker 2: Vee Jay. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1: The opportunity comes to go to WVON [AM radio, Chicago, Illinois].  And you're invited to come to DJ [disc jockey] at this point [1968]?
Speaker 2: At [W]VON?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: I was invited to get a hundred and fifty dollar a week job and I jumped at it.  It was not only--It wasn't so much to DJ, to be on the air.  That wasn't it.  It was--I was music director for the radio station, which meant that I chose the music that was to go on the air.  Previous to me, the music director was [Earl] E. Rodney Jones and was [Moses Lindberg] 'Lucky' Cordell.  But Leonard [Chess, owner of both Chess Records and WVON] saw fit to have me in that position. There was a reason for it.  With the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] breathing down his neck, everybody's neck, it was a nice reason to have a green kid in there who knew nothing and knew nobody.  So, wet behind the ears?  I was.  But fortunately I knew something about the business already.  So it was a great experience.  In terms of life experience, it was right up there in the top ten.  Because I knew just enough to be able to be aware of what was going on.  I feel that I turned out to be an asset for the station in more ways than one.  For one, I was the only one who had the right to tell Leonard, "Take this record off your radio station," one of Leonard's records.  "Because it's not doing anything." And he'd listen to me.  I wasn't the final word. But he paid attention.
Speaker 1: Now how--I mean just practically speaking, how does the role of music director work? When--and I'll say a couple things--when Leonard Chess owns his own--
Speaker 2: Radio--
Speaker 1: Not only radio station.  But he owns his own--you know, publishing company.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You know, mus-, record company.  Except for the FCC breathing down--I'm just wondering how that works, that you could sort of stand up?  And the other thing is what about the DJs themselves?  Don't they have a role and weren't they sort of active? And aren't people courting them as well? And would they ever say to you, "Go away."  You know, "This is the artist,"  you know,  "I'm gonna--" Or, "I like this artist." Was there any of that?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.  Well originally as far as that rock 'n roll radio was concerned, in some cases the disk jockey was the sole determination of what was played.  The classic tales are those of the Alan Freed, the New York disc jockey or Cleveland [Ohio] disk jockey that coined the radio phrase of "rock 'n roll."  In his case, he had total say--say so over what he played.  Now this was repeated around the country.  This was nothing new in fact. But with him bringing this black music into a white radio paradise, certainly it started restrictions that weren't in existence before.  The payola scandals  that grew out of Alan Freed's situation that made national headlines forced restrictions on disk jockeys around the country.  Because the parent company did not want to get in trouble with the government control.  Music directors was a simple way of saying this one person has the ability to put music on our station and we're watching you.  So don't you do nothing wrong 'cause we got you.  So the music director brought the focus down to one person and not the staff of disk jockeys because there certainly were radio stations that had a staff of disk jockeys.  And everybody decided what they wanted to play on their show.  Whether they were brokering or not.  In a staff situation like 'VON was, the responsibility fell on an individual.  There was always a music director at 'VON.  'VON never had wide-open music access.  If they did, I didn't know about it.
Speaker 1: Now but what about the other side where you have an owner, you know, who, who has his own record company?  There weren't--I mean was he--I mean--
Speaker 2: I know what you're saying.  The big thing about it was Leonard Chess owned Chess Records and he bought this radio station that the government finally said they could have, the Chess family could have.  But the provision was "Thou shalt not occupy more than ten per cent of your total playlist."  So if you were playing a hundred records, you couldn't have more than ten.  And that was my job to make sure that he never had more than ten per cent of the list.  Now that's just the list.  How does it get played?  That's not even discussed.  Is this new record by Little Milton Campbell a real hit?  We think so.  We think this is a real hit.  "Hey guys we're gonna play this record."  And they pound it and they pound it--and it was a hit.  For several reasons.  One is maybe it was a good piece of product.  Maybe Jackie Ross's 'Selfish One' was a good record.  And it was.  Maybe the Dells or the Radiants or whoever, or maybe Minnie Riperton.  These are name brand people that were either in groups or solo artists.  Mitty Collier's 'I Had a Talk With My Man Last Night', right up there with Etta James's 'At Last!' as far as I'm concerned.  Both on the Chess label but if we were playing seventy records, then Leonard couldn't have more than seven.  And that's the way it generally was handled.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Now let me add one thing.  You would think that this was a special thing just based on WVON.  Nobody said anything about Columbia Records, which was part of CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System].  CBS is a radio and television network.  Well I think that Johnny Mathis was probably played on a CBS radio station at one time or another.  You see RCA [Radio Corporation of America], CBS, and I don't know who else was out there in terms of the majors that were also into the media.  But Chess was not the first guy who owned a record company who owned a radio station.  It had been going on at Columbia Broadcasting Systems for years.  No big thing was made about it.
Story_ID: 11710
Speaker 1: Now I want to talk about the WVON [AM radio, Chicago, Illinois] of that day and what, you know, made it so unique. And that's what I'll ask.  What made it so unique?  I mean you had these personalities.  It was twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, right?  That was--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That was the number one thing.  Always there.  We never had with the exception of WYNR [AM radio, Chicago, Illinois], here we go back to 1390 again.  WYNR was a full-staffed 24-hour operation as I remember.  So they were one step ahead of WVON.  But the composition of WYNR was not "down home."  This is Chicago.  This is "Upper Mississippi" and Leonard Chess [owner of WVON] knew it.  'VON came up in competition to WYNR with good old down home radio.  Polished and glossed with the Top Forty format of the time.  And 'VON won.  It was definitely black.  It was no pretense of being gray.  It was, "This is a black radio station.  Here is Muddy Waters, not Clear Waters, but Muddy Waters."  Clear Waters, a great artist too.  Okay but it was really black and we were going to say--they were because I wasn't there then.  They were going to save black folks.  And they did.  [Moses Lindberg] 'Lucky' Cordell has more of the story on that.  Because he was there almost upon creation of that product.  I came in later [1968]. The whole station only existed in that form from 1963-64 [1964] until 1975.  About twelve, thirteen years, for the life of that one station that had as much impact to get to be the number one radio station in Chicago overall with the other top forties at the time, WCFL [AM radio, Chicago, Illinois] and WLS [AM radio, Chicago, Illinois] battling each other.  But 'VON coming up the middle and becoming the number one station.  Short lived but true.
Story_ID: 11711
Speaker 1: The week that I first started, the station whose parking lot can't be more than 100 feet by 40 [feet] had the parking lot and traffic on Kedzie [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] tied up.  Because they were giving away free radios.  Now the free radios, you might think "Oh I'm gonna get a free radio and I can--I don't have to listen to that station.  I can listen to everybody up and down the dial."  No sir, buddy.  That little transistor radio, which was about that tall, was red and white and it had one station on it.  Guess which one it was! 1450 [WVON-AM radio, Chicago, Illinois]!  It had a little tuning dial, which could allow you to get to 1450 and-a-half maybe or 1449 and a half.  But you would never leave 1450 with that radio.  And people were hurting theirselves to get that radio.  Just as they were hurting theirselves to find the car key.  A car key  that was buried or hidden somewhere in Chicago [Illinois] for the Cadillac.  The Cadillac full of money or whatever it was at the time.  The station very wisely had bought a car, hid the key and gave clues on the air.  And I re--I wasn't there at the time.  But people going nuts tearing up people's lawns, climbing up their trees to try to put these clues together to find the Cadillac.  Some one did find the Cadillac.  Later on, there is nothing new at WGCI [FM radio, Chicago, Illinois].  We took little plastic buses that had the station logo on the side and wrote a serial number on the back of the bus, taped it up and I hid them throughout Chicagoland [Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area].  There's a bus somewhere near you.  The same basic promotion principle.  But the 'VON thing was phenomenal.  'Cause they seriously hurt people's yards, digging in somebody else's yard, looking for the key to the Cadillac.  Radio--because there weren't all the choices at that time--there was no Internet.  I mean there was no computer thing.  There was no FM [radio] to speak of in those years.  So everything was graduated into a 'VON , a little to WBEE [AM radio, Chicago, Illinois], a little to what was WAAF [AM radio, Chicago, Illinois] or WGRT [AM radio, Chicago, Illinois] depending on how far you go. But 'VON nailed it in that time between '65 [1965] and '68 [1968], the real peak years for the station.  Now who was in charge of promotions?  How did these promotions come about?  Was that Leonard Chess [Founder of Chess Records and owner of WVON-AM, Chicago, Illinois]?  Who was the--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No. The promotions were generated most of the time from the Sales Department.  There was not so much of a Promotion Director as a General Manager and Sales Manager type people who--and the Program Director.  So [Moses Lindberg] 'Lucky' [Cordell] and [Earl 'E.'] Rodney [Jones] would work with these people and come up with the various promotions.  Herb [Kent] was very creative in terms of the promotions.  But the station embraced with Herb being the focal point, his bike rides from wherever they went.  But I mean thousands of people with bikes just following Herb down the street.  The Christmas Basket Give-away, which was actually a promotion vehicle that was tied in to give back to the community in that sense.  But the sponsors that were on the station were able to get into that visible area of promotion by just providing product.  So there were plenty of opportunities to give sponsors' materials away and get their name out there.  The crazy promotions, like the Cadillac and the hidden key thing, those were essentially station driven promotions that, aside from the Cadillac dealer, may have not a had a lot of people attached to it but created a lot of talk.
Story_ID: 11712
Speaker 1: Now did you find that--a sort of a true sense of family there [at WVON-AM radio, Chicago, Illinois]?  Are people sort of coming in and out and they're sort of on their own? Or I mean was there--
Speaker 2: I imagine it was the equivalent of a baseball team, a basketball team.  We--I use 'we' but they were a little leery of newcomers.  I was a newcomer at one time. And in no uncertain fashion did--was I looked--I wasn't welcomed with "Oh you're Richard!  Yes we've heard about you."  It wasn't that way.  You had to earn your stripes.  Everybody had their own particular thing.  The system was there.  It wasn't rigid.  You weren't restricted totally.  But you had to get your area, find your niche.  I found mine and I'll admit it.  And I've never denied it.  My niche was on the coattail of Herb Kent. But remember, I worked for him.  But before I worked for him, I had listened to Herb since 1950-whatever it was, '7 [1957], '58 [1958].  The music then was current music.  I love that music.  'Oh What a Night', by the Dells.  I remember Herb playing that.  I still play it.  It's a dusty!  I just love the music.  My niche was probably my honest to goodness love for the music of that time. And the fact that I had my own way of putting it together is my niche.  I mean I'm not a comedian.  I don't have a Herb Kent voice.  Oh--I can't get down there (chuckling).  But I loved the music and I found my niche and my niche is the music.  Now did you--Talk about--'cause you talked of-- your playing of the music.  What--You said, you sort of had an instinctive sense just being around music, about what--You know, how to bring songs together and how to transition in and out--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm. Um-hmm.  Which is one of the things that I taught or attempted to teach my students at Columbia [College, Chicago, Illinois].  And yes I did teach at Columbia.  Not only in regard to the music but also in regard to their radio production methods.  How to sequence, blend or contrast the material that they were working with.  To use a marshmallow here and you use a steel hammer there.  How do you make them come together?  Or how do you contrast them?  In both the music--But it always came back to the music whether the vehicle was a commercial or a piece of song.  It's all about sounds and instruments and how they work together or in contrast.  So it's part of what I taught in commercial productions.
Speaker 2: And when you say you came on the--I don't know (unclear) but when you say you came on the coat tails of Herb Kent, how did that actually--what are you talking about besides--?
Speaker 1: I got weekends on WVON. Because Pervis [Spann] was busy, busy!  Out selling Aretha [Franklin].  He had Aretha performing here and there and then all the other artists of that period back in '67 [1967], '68 [1968].  He was busy promoting his shows.  He had to be away from the station on the weekends.  So [Moses Lindberg] 'Lucky' Cordell was gracious enough to say, "Okay you take this."  So I had had Saturday nights after Herb [Kent] went off playing his dusties.  So by default, I was placed after Herb.  And he had played dusties from 7:00 o'clock or so until midnight.  And I had to come behind him.  It wasn't a battle. This is not what it was about.  In fact in order to break it up, I would play the current music of that time for at least an hour and a half before I would do my version of what I wanted to hear and what I thought the audience wanted to hear.  I would listen to Herb [Kent] so that we would not play the same songs.  But it was not a competitive situation.  It was the fact that we both--I feel we both loved those dusties.  And I give him credit for being able to first of all call the music that ["dusties"] and put it on the mat the way he did.  I mean Herb [Kent] was in radio ten--like fifteen years before I was.  So I had--I'll say it--a good teacher.  A good guidance counselor in terms of the direction.  And earlier when I said, you know, there were 15,000 people sounding like Joe Cobb and [Bill] 'Butterball' [Crane] and [Earl 'E.'] Rodney [Jones], there were.  And they were role models for a lot of the people in the streets who had not gotten into or would never get into the industry.
Story_ID: 11713
Speaker 1: Leonard [Chess, originally Lezjor Czyz] was probably the ideal--My ideal description of the word "boss."  He--You knew who was the boss. 'Cause in no uncertain terms--and this is up and down the line from the record company [Chess Records] on through.  He was very expressive.  That's a delicate way of putting it.  He's the only person who could cuss you out, and you go "Yeah, well okay, you're right!" (chuckling)  You know, he was just very--I think the realness of what Leonard was, was enticing enough for you to believe it and not challenge it.  But yet not be just a blind follower.  His personality was very strong, if that makes any sense what I just said.  His personality was very strong.  But it was not hostile.  It was--He definitely had a direction, and he knew--And you knew that he knew.  It was the kind of situation that, you know, this guy is smart.  So, "No I can't put anything over on him.  But maybe I should just give him the best that I got."  And when you did that and you did a good job of it, he would, he would let you know.  And it wasn't necessarily with money.  It also was an appreciation that he would show.  But meanwhile, somebody else could come in the office.  And the quiet that we have in the studio would be transfixed to a very loud, desk-pounding situation.  And you'd sit there and go "Oh I'm glad I didn't get that one!" (chuckling).  That happened a couple of times.  I had no idea who those people were.
Speaker 2: Now--you--He liked the black community then.  Do you think he might--?  It's not like Maurie [Alpert].  You said Maurie was a business-. Do you think Leonard Chess liked the black community--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Both of them.
Speaker 2: Both of them--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Both of them.
Speaker 2: Both--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Both of them were in business--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 1: Which is why we are talking about them.  But they were not exploitative in any way, even Leonard.  In the book 'Spinning Blues into Gold' [by Nadine Cohodas], you'll see some of the things that Leonard did for his people, for some of the blues artists, possibly, who had hit hard times.  I think the classic story--and I read a book by Etta James ['Rage to Survive: The Etta James Story']--on Etta James, you'd see that Leonard helped her with the hard times that she went through.  She had some addiction problems, it's not about Etta but it's about everybody that Leonard took care of, in a sense.  And when you--when you look at him and his organization from a take-care-of standpoint, the negatives that maybe would come up with an idea toward exploitation tend to disappear.  His positives outweigh any negatives that I've ever seen or heard about.  And that's on a personal basis, as well as those things that I've read about.  He did a lot to protect I'll say our interest as well as his interest.
Speaker 2: Well that says a lot. And that's sort of [Moses Lindberg] 'Lucky' Cordell's view too, really.  So--and this was really a unique chance to work in radio in a real way though, too.  Right?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Very.  Very. Because this was the big time.  This was the 'GCI [WGCI-FM radio, Chicago, Illinois] of its day.  Again, the difference between now and then was there are so many more choices now.  You can listen to the world now.  But then, if you were in the black community, there were really maybe three, four choices that you could make and most of those choices were not twenty-four hours a day.
Story_ID: 11714
Speaker 1: Was Pervis Spann the most entrepreneurial of the group [at WVON]?
Speaker 2: I would say Pervis was the king of the entrepreneurs in the fact that he discreetly did a lot of things with a lot of people.  I mentioned Aretha [Franklin]. I'm sure--the names of that time--I'm sure he booked Otis Redding somewhere.  I'm sure that due to nature of that business, Pervis probably led the--from the outside looking in--was one of the most aggressive people in the business.  'Course, we don't know what everybody, you know, does.  But on the outside Pervis was--I mean he wasn't on stage at the Regal Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] because he liked standing in front of a crowd.  At the time that he and [E]. Rodney [Jones] were managing or were involved in bringing shows into the Regal Theatre, they did well.  That famous intro that we hear with Pervis introducing to people, "B.B. King live at the Regal [Theatre]."  And Gene Chandler's live version of 'Rainbow' ,  "Ladies and Gentlemen, now the star--" Yeah.  Whatever he was doing.  That's a classic.  And he was--nobody else that was at 'VON [WVON-AM radio, Chicago, Illinois] was ever in that position.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was working out of the--What--Cha--High Cha--the--God, what were some of the places he said he managed at?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Burning Spear--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Burning Spear, right.
Speaker 2: Which was the High Chaparral or--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: All depending. Well he always had his--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) His places.
Speaker 2: His places of involvement.  And most of the time they were more than just a--They were not appearing there, he was directly involved in that business.
Story_ID: 11715
Speaker 1: FM started affecting 'VON about '73 [1973], and more so in '74 [1974], 'BMX being the first full-time black--Not -owned, but black service FM.  FM was slow to catch on.  I mean it wasn't overnight.  But VON's ratings, starting about '72 [1972]-3 [1973], started to be impact by the automated WBMX--because there were no live people on there.  And they were playing--In some cases that automation unit that they have, was playing two and three records at the same time, "more music, more often".  Right?  But they corrected that, and then when they did go live, they certainly had an impact on Chicago's percentage of people listening to FM was on the rise.  Particularly about 1975.  And then, along comes WGCI [FM, Chicago] in '75, sitting outside of the the WVON studios in a trailer.  So what use to be WSDM [FM, Chicago] with the girls and "all that jazz", and with Yvonne Daniels, at one time, became the nemesis of WVON-AM.  So it was a product partially of our own creation.  But WBMX, on the other hand, was the other station in Oak Park [Illinois] that went full-time black service in '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Then what--Who created the new WVON that's more like the brokered--You know, where it's half--half--
Speaker 1: Ok, it had to do with the application for the license on 1450 [AM, Chicago], after Globetrotter [Communications, Inc.] went to 1390 [AM, Chicago]. Globetrotter Communications 'GCI [WGCI-AM radio, Chicago, Illinois].  After they picked up the 1390 frequency, 1450 was up in the air.  Wesley South and Pervis [Spann] applied for the license. But also, another group applied for the license.  There was an interim operator of the frequency.  And that was WFMT [FM], the classical station.  So you had WFMT-AM on the air, on 1450.  Beethoven, Brahms, Tchaikovsky on 1450.  That doesn't sound right.  But it did happen.  And in 1979, Pervis and Wesley got the license in conjunction with the other group.  So each group had approximately 12 hours a day.  Pervis [Spann] and Wesley [South] opened 1450 as WXOL [AM, Chicago], WXOL 1450.  The other station was W--and remains WCEV [AM, Chicago].  They share the frequency.  And like I said earlier, we [WGCI] gave up the 'VON call letters in '82 [1982].  And 'VON snatched them right back.  They were so glad.  And I still haven't gotten a drink.  You guys, could give me something (laughs).
Speaker 2: (laughs) You want a drink of water?
Speaker 1: (Chucking) A drink of water (unclear).  Can I drink it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh this is wonderful.
Speaker 2: (laughs).
Speaker 1: No.  I wasn't talking about you.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously laughs).
Speaker 1: I was talking about 'VON still did not--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh.
Speaker 1: Like I said, I was part of that process.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 1: They really haven't said, "Thank you very much."
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) They never said thank you, okay.
Speaker 1: But it was alright, for my brothers and sisters.

Speaker 1: I started doing commercials [in the 1970s].  Commercials in the form of not only the spoken, but also in the form of music.  So my records that I had produced in '65 [1965], '66 [1966], '67 [1967], came down to sixty seconds.  The Fun Town jingle is mine.  It was my number one hit.  Fun Town was a great little amusement park.  And the Fun Town jingle was recorded across the street from this studio [The HistoryMakers, 1900 S. Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  And we had a good time with it.  And I had a good time with that commercial.  And that allowed me to move into advertising.  Those early commercials for Harvey [Illinois] Chrysler-Plymouth [automobile], Moo and Oink [meat distribution company and grocery store], real works of art.  But they were my--they were my hits.  And there were plenty other accounts that came along.  So I got my agency [REPCOM Advertising] started in the '70s [1970s], primarily thanks to the work I did with Fun Town Amusement Park.
Speaker 2: Now do you--Can you repeat that jingle?
Speaker 1: That's a hard one.  Fun Town--Gee--It started with the kids, "Hey Mommy, hey Daddy, let's go to Fun Town.  Fun Town, Fun Town for the kids and you, 95th [Street] and Stony Island Avenue."  Those are all the words.  But it was the way we did the chant and the singing across the music.  But it certainly had an impact on a lot of people.  And those people who are from Chicago [Illinois], as some comedians have said, you know, "You know, you're from Chicago [Illinois], if you can sing, 'Fun Town, Fun Town for the kids and--'" You know.  And that's been on national television.  I'm so proud of that!
Speaker 2: I think Moo and Oink, too.
Speaker 1: Moo and Oink is--It was unique, because--And these were not long songs.  These are just two and four lines jingles.  But they're the ones that stick to your mind and they never leave.  That's the type of stuff I like to write.  The Moo and Oink jingle was recorded in my living room, by myself and one other gentlemen who did the singing.  So it was a creation of the two of us.  But to most people who listened, it was a bunch of stuff going on.  Yes, I did all the music myself.  Yes, I did take those piano lessons.  Thank you, Grandma!

Speaker 1: What about with WGCI when you, you know, worked with Marv Dyson and--
Speaker 2: I went to 'GCI [WGCI] from WJPC [AM, Chicago].  When we went into 'JPC  in 1978, that was me and Charles Mootry.  Marv Dyson was on the way out.  The irony is that in 1981, Marv was promoted to General Manager of WGCI.  And he made the call and said, "Come on over.  I got a radio station for you."  Shooo!  I was gone.  The other reason for that, and it's rather humorous to me, at this time, is the administration at WJPC would not let me play dusties on Saturday night, when the station got twenty-four hours.  They would not let me play my music.  We're twenty-four hours now.  I was playing dusties on Sunday afternoon, and that was good.  But now it's Saturday night all over again.  And they wouldn't let me--I'll call the name.  Tom Joyner was Program Director and Charles Mootry was General Manager.  Those were the two people who were responsible for me not playing dusties on Saturday night at WJPC.  I think the last time that I made the request was in the-- in Mr. Mootry's office.  And they said, "No."  And I recall taking this pose.  And then laughing and just walking out the office.  'Cause two weeks later, I started at 'GCI.  (Whispers:) They wouldn't let me play my dusties.  That's a real private, light moment for me.  Of course, when I did get to 'GCI, not only was I playing my dusties on Saturday night, I was playin' it--playing the dusties on both stations, on the AM and the FM.  And I loved it.  We had a lot of reach because the AM gets up to South Milwaukee [Wisconsin] at night. And the FM is all over the place.  So I was having a ball.  And then, there was the battle with WJPC at the time.  And I was Program Director.  So we had--When I ask you to let me play my Dusties say yes.
Speaker 1: So that was--And that was--You did that until when?
Speaker 2: I was at 'GCI '81 [1981] 'til '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: And then talk about also the Taste Entertainment and that whole--
Speaker 2: Taste--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) 'Cause I remember coming there a couple times.
Speaker 2: In the last seven years.  Richard Steele [Richard Slaughter]--Just can't get away from your high school buddies, can you?  Richard and myself, and LaDonna Tittle went into the Taste Entertainment Center in 1994.  And we did a Friday night after work set.  It's still going on.  LaDonna has left.  Emilie McKendall came in during the course of events, and Emilie has gone on to other events.  But Richard and I remain with those people who love dusties, and that "stepping" thing which shall always be "bopping" to us.  Can you bop?  Yeah, I'll bop.
Speaker 1: Boppin'--Because, you know, that's the first time I saw that.  Because most people refer to it as Stepping--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: And they say it is a Chicago tradition.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It's--Steppin' is a Chicago tradition since the mid '70s [1970s].  But it was more defined when V103 [WVAZ-FM radio, Chicago, Illinois] hit the air in '89 [1989], I think it was, and had the show on Saturday night with Kenny Thompson.  And he used the term "dusty steppers." And they promoted it very well.  And that's what it became.  But steppin' is bopping for your children.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughs).
Speaker 2: "Old school" is "dusties" for your children.
Speaker 1: That's right, okay.

Speaker 1: Now I have a few--just a few more questions.  One is, when you think of the 'dusties', you know, how would--how do you describe the dusties?
Speaker 2: So many people that I've come in contact, still do the thing, "That's when singers could really sing."  It is the backlash and reaction to 'Rappers Delight' [by the Sugarhill Gang].  '79 [1979], and in my opinion, marks the benchmark, the dividing line in the sand between what is not dusties and what is dusties.  With 'Rappers Delight' and the, the other--'Christmas [Rappin']''--Kurtis Blow--those two songs, which went mainstream as far as the community was concerned, marked the difference between pre-rap and after-rap.  So in my opinion, I--it's just the way I see it.  Dusties stopped in 1978.  'Ring My Bell', Anita Ward, was the end of dusties.  So they go up to that point.  Because at that point the groups started dropping off in terms of mainstream popularity.  And rap, which some people thought would go away, will never go away.  And it's a legitimate art form.  I'm reading Quincy Jones's book.  It's excellent!  And he has some good viewpoints on rap, and I agree with him.  Dusties are songs that were out from '75 [1975] and before.  There's a good twenty years worth of music there, from '55 [1955] to '75 [1975].  And if you're a purist, from '50 [1950], from the end of Louie Jourdan, into about '70 [1970].  So from '50 [1950] to '70 [1970], or '55 [1955] to '75 [1975].  It depends on what your likes were at the time.  But that was music where people actually had to sing.  Chaka Khan can sing.  Natalie [Cole] can sing.  Peabo [Bryson], which is not dusties, Peabo Bryson. But he can sing.  So when you compare them--And that's what we do.  We compare our people.  The dusty people to what is current and there really is no comparison, it's just two different things.  It's not apples and oranges, it's apples and steel.

Speaker 1: Are you happy with the course that your life has taken in that way?  You know, do you ever think, you know, "I should have continued performing?"  Or--
Speaker 2: Oh no. The first singing group, I played piano.  Grammar school.  Second phase, with the high school group [the Belvederes, later the Norvells], I had the baritone part.  I wasn't even the high tenor.  I was just the baritone.  But I was satisfied singing that "Ooooooh," you know.  That was okay.  So once I learned--Got my formal music learning thing down, I was very happy being able to hear stuff in my head.  And be able to transpose it to paper.  And interpret it to other people to perform.  One of my idols--Or mentors let's just say, was a gentlemen named Johnny Pate, who was an arranger and jazz bass player from Chicago [Illinois], right here.  I met him through the record shop [Met Music, Chicago, Illinois].  Because he was working part-time there.  Johnny Pate, after a couple of years of working with him, ended up arranging a ton of Chicago [Illinois] music, including The Impressions, and Walter Jackson, and it goes on and on.  Johnny Pate was the arranger on 'The Monkey Time' that our company--publishing company [Nicolet Music] has part of.  But it was Johnny who took me to my first Johnny Pate session.  Which was The Impressions, 'It's Alright'.  So when Curtis [Mayfield] sings, 'and everybody clap your hands', here they are. (Holds up his hands.)  Each one worth a half-million sales (chuckling).  I was one of the hand clappers at that session.  So every time it plays, I look up at the speaker.  And there I am, you know.  But it was from Johnny Pate that I learned my arranging skills.  And I would steal his music after the session.  I'd steal the guitar part and wait for the record to come out.  And then see what they did.  And learn how to do that.  That and a little formal education.  But the background has been fine for me.  I like to see stuff come out of my head and actually appear somewhere.

Speaker 1: What are your thoughts about black radio, and what is called "black radio" since that has really been your career in that, you know, in that arena.
Speaker 2: Now, then, when?
Speaker 1: Then, now?
Speaker 2: It's going to go--I'm fearful that it's going to go the route of tap dancing.  Tap dancing was wonderful when I did it in 19-pssht--But it's not what I do now.  And it's barely around.  Black radio, as we knew it in our age group, is rapidly disappearing with the technological advances.  The ability to pre-record and sound like you very much are alive in another city.  As Tom [Joyner] does, as Doug Banks does, as Howard Stern, as anybody does.  That feeling, when you say black radio, to us was something personal that we could reach out and touch.  And you could go see a Richard Pegue or a [E.] Rodney Jones or whoever it is.  And they would talk to you on the phone.  An--and you could see them at the grocery store buying whatever it is that they needed, because they lived in the neighborhood.  That personal touch of radio is fast on the way out, due to the technical side of things.  We can sit in this studio and play a record, and have the people in the Motherland listen to it and see it on the Internet.  That's wonderful technology.  But that means that we can't actually touch them.  And real black radio has always been a touching medium, as far as my experiences have been.  From the time of visiting that radio station [WBEE, when he was a teenager] to working, it's been within reason.  I could get to it on a bus if I had to.  But it's so much business now.  And it's just cold.  And I think, to a degree, impersonal.  Because you really can't care about every single being out there.  And I'm sorry to see that go.  But that's what's happening.
Speaker 1: Now what--When people talk about you and they say, "Richard Pegue," what do you want them to remember you for?
Speaker 2: The Moo and Oink jingle? (chuckles).  Nah.  Yeah, that too.  But the fact that I really did love that music.  I really did love it to the extent that I played it and participated in it.  And that I had the best of both worlds so to speak, of being able to play it as an observer and create it on the other hand.  And have all of that meet up in the middle.
