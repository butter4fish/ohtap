Speaker 2: My mother who too was an educator, but in her childhood, it was a little different, she had to come home and, she had two dresses and she'd wash one to go to school and wear the other.  And so the memories of her childhood wasn't so great for her, until after she became ho- older and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and understood, some things.
Story_ID: 523626
Speaker 1: She [Walker's mother, Bernadine Turner Lucas] also, her and her brother were driven to Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, and let out on the side of the road to go find their father [Milton Turner, Jr.] which was not far, so she was forced, not for--well forced to find her dad who was now remarried and, to a lovely woman who really took care of them.

Story_ID: 523627

Speaker 1: And you never met him?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: And what was your--
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: --memory of meeting him?
Speaker 2: I don't have one, because I must have been about three or four years old--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --when I met him, but yes I did.  I have vaguely, I remember he was a very staunched, a man that looked very empowered, had beautiful black skin, just beautiful black skin that just glowed, and it, it wa- it would, it depicted strength of what people in the South and the others were going through, you know, he had all the characteristics of that in his face.
Speaker 1: Where was he from?  You said from the South, people in the South, do you remember his home state?

Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And we were the best of friends, other than granddaughter and grandma and, of course, you know as your life gets, takes on a different route and you get older you learn better.  So I think she tried to put as much into saying, "I'm sorry for whatever I did in previous years"--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and to the raising of myself; my, my mother and father [Jack Lucas (ph.)] raised me but she was there, you know, she was, she was there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know a wonderful woman.
Speaker 1: Do you know where she was born?
Speaker 2: Here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: She was born here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you know where, do you remember where she lived?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I'll take that back, she was not born here in Chicago, she was born in Kentucky.  My mother was born here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you know anything about her family?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's--
Speaker 1: Your grandmother's--

Speaker 2: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: He was from Pittsburgh (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: And do you remember his parents?
Speaker 2: Very much so, they were lovely, lovely people.  Pittsburgh is a coal town, that, you have coal miners, we lived at the community that had black and white alike and I never experienced in my childhood, only until I got to Chicago [Illinois], this difference in color, you know.  The area that we lived in, I didn't know that we were poor because everybody did the same thing, you know?
Speaker 1: Which was?
Speaker 2: Well, you, when you woke up in the morning, you saw the white coal miner walking with the black coal miner and so the changes that you did, they were all just normal to people, you know, it didn't make a difference in your life, that you know, that people didn't have to go through the differences that they go through now because you felt so equal to one another.  And so I never knew any prejudices until I came to Chicago, Illinois, and my grandparents on my father's side, they were--my grandmother's husband worked in the coal mine, I remember him coming home, and sitting at the table after washing up with just a T-shirt on and beginning to eat and syrup dripping from his mustache, he had a big, big f- one of them full red mustaches, you know?  And he would be eating, he would be sopping syrup and the syrup would be just dripping from his mustache (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now what was his name?
Speaker 2: I don't remember his name.  I don't remem- I think it was Daddy Red [ph.], 'cause he had red hair, but I think we called him Daddy Red.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, and what about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Aunt Honey [ph.], that was my aunt and her sister who was my grandma was Rosa [Rosa Lucas (ph.)], who was a lovely, she worked for everybody.  She washed and cleaned and then you know you had, you had the kosher chickens; we lived right up on the, right beside one of the, the Jews that did the chickens in the cellar?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so, and she would ring the chicken by its neck and--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and clean 'em and you know?  And I never will forget she gave me the chicken one day to hold in my lap and all of a sudden, he dead right?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And all of a sudden this chicken moved, girl I liked to had a fit--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --I threw that chicken, you know how the, the blood was still running warm--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in his body--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and this chicken moved, I threw that chicken to the floor, oh god.  I threw it, and then from then on I was actually afraid of a live chicken, that was so funny.
Story_ID: 523630
Speaker 1: What are some of your fondest memories of your childhood?
Speaker 2: I had real good memories, vague memories of my childhood in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], there again that was an experience where you went to school with black and white, we had a pet hen that we would watch in silence as he laid, she laid eggs, I mean those were just, you know, just very normal things.  Now when we got here to Chicago [Illinois], I had a wonderful childhood as well because, I was trained to do some of everything, I was a Girl Scout, I went to ballet lessons, I took tap, I took music, I did all of the after girls, after school programs, anything to enhance me as an individual.  There was a, 47th Street, was very popular, it was almost like Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada].
Story_ID: 523631
Speaker 1: You were how old when you moved to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Seven.
Speaker 1: You were seven years old (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seven years old.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the circumstances of why you moved from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] to Chicago, why the family moved from Pittsburgh to Chicago?
Speaker 2: No I don't.  I just remember my mom [Bernadine Turner Lucas] coming first, me and my mom coming and then my dad [Jack Lucas (ph.)] joined us, but no I don't remember the circumstances--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and why.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay, so you were about to tell us about your--
Speaker 2: There the--
Speaker 1: --experiences
Speaker 2: --that 47th Street was very popular, I mean it was like a strip on Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], you know, and of course, during that area, all the stars came here, like Sammy Davis, Jr., Josephine Baker, Lena Horne.  I grew up in an area where, oh gosh, Joe Louis lived right down the street from me, him and Marva Louis [Marva Louis Spaulding].
Speaker 1: And, and where was that?
Speaker 2: We lived at 45th [Street] and, 46th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue], and Joe Louis and his wife lived at around 44th [Street] and Michigan, but his wife's family lived in our building which was the Trotters, 'cause she was formerly a Trotter be--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --before becoming Marva Louis.  And so it was nothing to see him come by to visit, you know, which was exciting for young people--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --'cause he was called the Brown Bomber, during that period and the Bud Billiken Parade [Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic] used to come down Michigan Ave., and that's when they had jitneys, cabs that you could--
Speaker 1: And this was, what?  What would you say?  What year was that?
Speaker 2: I don't know the year Sasha [Sasha Daltonn], but what I can say is that I was in the era of us, eight or nine years old, eight, nine years old.  When I came to Chicago, you used to have to have ration stamps to either buy shoes or sugar.  You know, if you wan- if you needed sugar, you bought sugar, but if you needed shoes for your children, you use these stamps to buy shoes--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that they would give you once a month, but yet to, to the--
Speaker 1: That must have been around 1943, '44 [1944]?
Speaker 2: Something like that, right, right.  And yet, the, the city was, was jumping, Chicago is a city that has so much, they've given so much to the African American movement, they've given so much to history as you say that has not been told yet.  There's a lot of history right here in Chicago--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --because all of the stars, all of whoever was anybody, came to Chicago and served right there on 47th and King Drive [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive], the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know you had the Met [Metropolitan Theatre, Chicago, Illinois] on one side of the street and you had the Regal Theater on the other side of the street.  I remember going to see Sammy Davis, and him sitting down on the stage and smoking a cigarette.  There was a very famous restaurant that was very polished called Morris Eat Shop [sic. Perfect Eat Shop, Chicago, Illinois], right down the street on 47th street that, at my mother took out the time to take me to places like that so that I would know how to interact with people, you know?  She, it made her, she, it may have been since she had twenty dollars, but this was the easier that she had de- designed for, to take me and it would have cost eighteen of those twenty dollars, that's what she did.
Story_ID: 523632
Speaker 1: I wanna go back and talk a little bit more about your mother [Bernadine Turner Lucas] and father [Jack Lucas (ph.)].  When they came to Chicago [Illinois], did your mom work?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mom always worked.  My mother believe it or not, started Secretaries Week here in the City of Chicago, she always played roles of secretary, worked with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], worked for the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], as well as the Chicago Defender, writing as a columnist.

Speaker 2: She started that column.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about why she started it or her experiences with the paper?
Speaker 2: She wo- she was trying to get people to become more involved collectively in what was going on in Chicago and especially she was very concerned about the secretaries of the af- especially the African American secretaries that didn't get the proper recognition that they needed.
Speaker 1: So, the Secretaries Week was started by her and she was writing for which paper at the time?
Speaker 2: For both.
Speaker 1: Okay, so both.  So she still maintained her relationship with Pittsburgh Courier?

Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --he was that kind of man, everybody respected him because he was just a man's man, family.

Speaker 1: Reverend Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Maxine Walker], you came to Chicago [Illinois] at the age of seven, where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: Col- Colman Elementary School [Zenos Colman Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Where was it located at?
Speaker 2: (Cough) Excuse me, pardon?
Speaker 1: And where was that located?
Speaker 2: 47th [Street] and State [Street] where it still is, yeah.  The Owl Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] was right across the street from it, it's gone.
Speaker 1: You were in what grade then when you?
Speaker 2: Second grade.
Speaker 1: Second grade?
Speaker 2: Right, second grade and had a fabulous teacher who was a historian within herself, Tina Rosemann [ph.]
Speaker 1: Rosemann?
Speaker 2: Tina Rosemann was her name, she taught second and third grade and during that period you weren't supposed to teach black history in school, but she had a way of teaching black history and then she had after classes that you could go to where she taught us black history.  So, where, well I was privileged because the average kid did not get that, you had, you really had to be at Colman School and had to be a student of Tina Rosemann, to get that.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the things that she taught?
Speaker 2: I don't, all I remember is that it was interesting and intense, she made it very interesting for you to go, you know, history can be boring--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and so, when she made it interesting, it was very easy for you to go back to the classroom--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and pick up a history book.  It's just so unfortunate that our history has been so made up, it was just after becoming an adult, maybe I was about forty, forty-five years old that I didn't, I was always taught that Columbus [Christopher Columbus] discovered America. I had to go to Jamaica to find out that he didn't discover America--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know?  And I think that that's just so wrong for our, or people who know the truth and not to teach our children the truth.  And so Tina Rosemann, was a great woman who was recognized by everybody.

Speaker 1: You went to Colman [Zenos Colman Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] all of your elementary school years?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, except for one, I got sick, caught tuberculosis and--
Speaker 1: And what year was that?  Or how old were you?
Speaker 2: --I was thir- about thirteen, about thirteen.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Thirteen or fourteen.  I caught tuberculosis which was very contagious, was the killer of that season, like cancer seems to be of this season, of course being an only child I was able to be quarantined in my home until they found a bed for me, and there was only two institutions here, one was MTS [Chicago Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium, Chicago, Illinois] and the other was--
Speaker 1: Now MTS was?
Speaker 2: An institution that they housed and took care of tuberculosis patients.
Speaker 1: And do you remember where that was located?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, here in Chicago [Illinois], and the other one was 159th [Street] which ho- it will come to my memory in a moment that is still there but is no longer a tuberculosis institute.
Speaker 1: Would that have been maybe Oak Forest [Oak Forest Health Center, Oak Forest, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: It was Oak Forest.
Speaker 1: Oak Forest.
Speaker 2: Oak Forest.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Right.  I spent two years and three months in Oak Forest without coming out because I had, I was so, as a kid fighting the disease, and people were dying like flies, and as a kid fighting that disease, I was really fighting the fight.  I had pus, that ran from my bones, pus and blood, they'd have to turn me, I couldn't turn over, I didn't walk for a year, I had to learn how to walk and when I stood up, my body would collapse that's just in, and, you know, when you went to get weighed and you had gained two ounces, that was a major thing, you know? During that period, but I fought a good fight and won it, had after getting well enough, I had to have five ribs removed which was called, let's see, not a lobectomy, yes, it was a lobectomy [sic.] and of course they did it much differently, they chopped you up during that time, they rarely have to do it now, and when they do, do it, it's very minor, just a little cut up under the arm.  So I really, because of that, I really thought that I would beat this cancer thing because I had been through so much with the tuberculosis, but it, those per- during that period I missed out of school, except that I would take classes there at Oak Forest and when I finally was discharged, then I went back to school taking courses.
Story_ID: 523637
Speaker 1: I started out with a school that I can't remember the name that's, was on 79th Street, what was the college there on 79th?
Speaker 2: Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Not Chicago--
Speaker 2: Wilson (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) not Wilson--
Speaker 2: Wilson Junior College [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, on 79th about 79th and Calumet [Avenue], something like that, it was there for quite some time, but anyway, I started out taking courses there and then various, rapidly after that, I became interested in religion and I began to take courses in Moody Bible Institute [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Now Reverend Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Maxine Walker], you, you contracted--
Speaker 1: Tuberculosis--
Speaker 2: --tuberculosis, while still in elementary school?
Speaker 1: --while still in elementary school.
Speaker 2: And so, you were able to finish elementary school--
Speaker 1: I was.
Speaker 2: --in the hospital [Oak Forest Health Center, Oak Forest, Illinois], or through some program at the hos- that the?
Speaker 1: It was a, no, I, either it was right after I had graduated, because I graduated from--
Speaker 2: Colman [Zenos Colman Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: --Colman, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then you?
Speaker 1: Then I--
Speaker 2: Got sick.
Speaker 1: --got sick, right.
Speaker 2: And you were in the hospital for two years.
Speaker 1: Two years and three months--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --before I was able to even have surgery, with tuberculosis was just such a disease that ate up your body and stuff, you had to get well enough to be cut on.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, and so it took two years and three months.
Speaker 2: And, when you came out of the hospital, then you went to high school?
Speaker 1: No I went to, start taking college courses.
Speaker 2: So you didn't do high school?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: That's amazing.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: And you were about seventeen years old at that time?
Speaker 1: I was, the exact age.
Speaker 2: Seventeen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 523638
Speaker 1: And so you went from grammar school [Zenos Colman Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] to college?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's correct.
Speaker 1: --the college on 79th Street?
Speaker 2: That was, yeah.  And I'm surprised that you don't remember that, we will remember it before it's over with.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But yes, and I was smart, I've always been smart and I'm a quick learner, you know, and so those things that I have a passion for, of course, like anybody else when you really have a passion for something, you put more energy--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --into it and learning for me is, I become like a sponge, I loved learning, I mean it just opens me up to a total different person.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, you know, you, when you lack certain skills, you learn how to use other skills--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --to take the place of those skills and I know for a long time, Sasha [Sasha Daltonn] I, because of who I represented in the community I used to hide the fact that I didn't have a high school education. I would lie and say I did, but it's when you get to know yourself and you know your worth, and you know that you are smart, then you don't have to do that--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know, you, there was no reason to do that.  But, yes I, and I enjoyed the college courses so th- this place on 79th Street is really getting me because it was right across the street from a restaurant, a Chinese restaurant, but anyway, we'll think of it.
Speaker 1: That's, you're probably one of the few people though who went from grammar school--
Speaker 2: Oh yes--
Speaker 1: --straight into college.
Speaker 2: --yea- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When you went to college you had a full program, were you there full time?
Speaker 2: I was there full time, yes, I was there full time and just, you know, I, I, I went to Moody [Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, Illinois] and finished up courses and then went back, you know, just like I said, learning is like, I become like a sponge when it comes to learning.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So you never went to DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Never went to DuSable, I entered, they entered me in, my name is on roll, but I never went--
Speaker 1: But you never got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) as a student.
Speaker 1: --there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you, did you finish at that college ever?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay you left there, you took some courses there and then you went on to Moody?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Story_ID: 523639
Speaker 1: So now we get married, do you have children?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that.
Speaker 2: Got married to a, I've always had an older mind, I got married to a man who was twice my age and who was self-employed and so we worked in the business which was a good business, a very good thriving business, he had a restaurant and grocery and drugstore combined.
Speaker 1: And his name was?
Speaker 2: Thomas, it was Cecil Thomas Walker [Cecil Walker (ph.)] and of course that store was at forty--46th [Street] and Drexel [Boulevard].
Speaker 1: And do you remember the name of the store?
Speaker 2: Tom's Kitchen [ph.].
Speaker 1: And what year did you and Mr. Walker get married?
Speaker 2: I do not remember, I don't remember (laughter).
Speaker 1: I don't remember when I married my first husband either.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And when I remember, I say I thought they took that date from the calendar, so (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay so, and you had Tom's Kitchen?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you said he had other businesses?
Speaker 2: No, he just had Tom's Kitchen, but it was a very lucrative business, it did very, very well.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And we all worked there, it became a family business you know?  And even during that time I went back to the school on 79th Street and took some more courses while, you know, after marrying him, well no, I lived with the man nine years.
Speaker 1: With Tom?
Speaker 2: With Tom, lived with him.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Married him and stayed together two years.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was because I felt like I was doing penance. I had loved him so long, and then fallen out of love, and then when you have children, you feel that you owe it to yourself and to them, to be married--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but when I married him, I did not, I no longer loved him.
Story_ID: 523640
Speaker 1: Let me just back, back track a little bit.  When you came to Chicago [Illinois], did your family attend a church here?
Speaker 2: Yes.  At that time, we were Methodist.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And what church did you attend?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember Sasha [Sasha Daltonn].  Oh, it was right down the street from us, and we lived at 46th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue] and it was between Michigan and Wabash [Avenue].  But it was a Methodist church.
Speaker 1: And where, was your family active in the church?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, my mother [Bernadine Turner Lucas] and I was always active in church.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what you did?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, well we attended Sunday school and my mom said I was always a child that at the end of the class I would say but--have my hand up.  But also we were active in plays and stuff that they did and mother was active with that.  During Easter holidays and stuff, I had toys and I was always trained to keep toys, so they were in good shape so if they needed little tables and chairs, and dolls and stuff, we would bring them to be a part of--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --the nativity scene that we would do for that particular holiday.  So yes, we were always active and I respect it as well as in bible class.
Story_ID: 523641
Speaker 1: So you stayed at the Methodist church until you were married [to Cecil Walker (ph.)]?  Or did you go to another church?
Speaker 2: No.  After I became an adult, this was when I was a child, that I was--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Methodist.  After I became an adult, then I got involved in, when I was involved in, between the Catholic church and the Protestant church because my children, I sent them to Catholic school and I too had been one that went to Catholic school, so you know that was--
Speaker 1: When did you go to--
Speaker 2: My (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Catholic school, in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: No here, in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: And what school was that?
Speaker 2: Corpus Christi [Corpus Christi School, Chicago, Illinois], went there and, I never became a Catholic, because they could never explain to me about the blood of Jesus, according to my understanding.  I've always had a mind of my own, but I studied with them and studied catechism, you know, did the things I was supposed to do.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember what ye- what years you went to Corpus Christi or what grade you were in when you attended?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember I remember going to Corpus Christi and then at one point I went to St. Benedict [St. Benedict the Moor School] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which was a boarding school.
Speaker 1: Now all of this was between your elementary school years?
Speaker 2: No.  This was before.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you came to Chicago, you were seven?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then, at seven you went to Colman [Zenos Coleman Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And then somewhere in between there, before you got sick, you went to Corpus Christi?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And then after Corp--
Speaker 2: St. Benedict.
Speaker 1: --then you went to St. Benedict.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And St. Benedict was where?
Speaker 2: In Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: St. Benedict is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, very good, both they're, of course you know, both are very good schools.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: There (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Why a boarding school?
Speaker 2: I don't remember why during that particular time.  Evidently it must have been something going on with my mom [Bernadine Turner Lucas] or whatever, I, I don't know the reason why but it was very interesting and--
Story_ID: 523642
Speaker 1: There was a priest there that taught me so much about life, that I asked questions of, that I couldn't ask my mom [Bernadine Turner Lucas]--after, at least I felt like I couldn't ask her--
Speaker 2: Do you--
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: --remember some--
Speaker 1: --I--
Speaker 2: --of those questions?
Speaker 1: --I do.
Speaker 2: Do you mind sharing them with us?
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know whether this is appropriate for this thing, but I'll tell you what they were, and you can edit it out if it's not.  But, kids were going around calling things like, a male's organs, they was calling it dick and so, I went to the dictionary.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Dick wasn't in it, (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, then I did the same thing with the female organs, and that was a cat--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --according to what they were saying on the street and I never could have went to my mother and asked her to explain that to me cause I was just at a young age, but I was inquisitive, and I used to wear the library out there at forty--what is it?  48th branch library [George Cleveland Hall Branch Library, Chicago, Illinois], at 48th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue], I lived in there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I couldn't find it anywhere and so Father Benedict [ph.], you know, kind of, the priest believed if you're old enough to ask, you're old enough to know.  And when he got through with the organs and sex, you'd put it on a plate and get you a knife and fork, (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --but it was such a tremendous learning--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for me.  So, I say all that to say, I've never been, I've always been a person who thought for myself, you know I, you know, I've never been one that you would just pass off something to me.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna investigate it.
Speaker 2: Now how long did you attend the boarding school?
Speaker 1: A year, just a year.
Speaker 2: So, so that we're clear with the chronology, you came to Chicago [Illinois], you went to Colman [Zenos Colman Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], then for a while you went to Corpus Christi [Corpus Christi School, Chicago, Illinois]?  You left there and went to St. Benedict [St. Benedict the Moor School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], and then you got sick and went to?
Speaker 1: No, I came back from St. Benedict, I can't remember whether I came back to Corpus Christi, or what.  But I got sick Sasha [Sasha Daltonn] before I was, let me, I'm trying to think of what year.  When I got sick I must have been about fourteen or fifteen because I stayed in the sanitarium [Oak Forest Health Center, Oak Forest, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: For two (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) two years--
Speaker 2: --years.
Speaker 1: --and three months.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 523643
Speaker 1: We were talking about the marriage and Cecil [Cecil Walker (ph.)]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --before we backed up a--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --little bit.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you, ho- do wha- would you share with us how you met?
Speaker 2: Just met through some friends and because of the restaurant that he owned [Tom's Kitchen (ph.)], and there was a neighborhood bar down the street that everybody went to, it was just a ca- he was a very good looking man, much older but very good looking man.  I was a person who had an older mind, I never ran with young girls and groups, I never did that--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know.  I always sought, my mind set was just always totally different.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so, I could relate to him and of course he could relate to me because I was a young girl, right (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: He did--
Speaker 1: --were you working at this time?  What were you doing?
Speaker 2: I can't remember whether I was working or not.  I must have been but I didn't have to be, 'cause I was raising my kids and having a rough time financially, but I always kept an upper lip, you know?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I could have or could not have been.
Story_ID: 523644
Speaker 1: Tell us the names of your children, you have nine children?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let's hope that--
Speaker 1: --can you give us their names and their ages?
Speaker 2: Girl, their names, now you may have to go get them to get their ages.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But I'll try.  (Laughter) Oh my goodness, my daughter from California should be, she would be able to roll 'em off.  Okay, Bernadette Wimberly [ph.], and Bernadette is fifty-two years old, Jacqueline Lucas [ph.], she is fifty, Belinda Scarbrough [ph.], I'm not sure of her age, but I think it's forty-eight or forty-nine, then Timothy Walker, and I don't remember, I think Tim is forty--Tim is forty-nine, so Belinda is probably forty-eight, Raymond Walker [ph.], I can't remember his age, Yolanda Walker [ph.], I think Yolanda's forty-eight, Yolanda Walker, Mark Walker is thirty-five, Tracey Hubbard [ph.], I'm not sure of her age, she's forty-something.  Do you have nine yet?  Who do, oh no Barron Walker [ph.], twenty-five.
Speaker 1: So we have Bernadette, Jacquelyn, Belinda, Timothy, Raymond, Yolanda, Mark, Tracey, and Balonn?
Speaker 2: Barron.
Speaker 1: Barron.
Speaker 2: Is that nine?
Speaker 1: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
Speaker 2: Oh good, you got 'em all then.
Speaker 1: And you were an only child?
Speaker 2: And I'm an only child, I'm an only child, can you imagine that?
Speaker 1: And you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --always wanted children?
Speaker 2: No.  I did not.  I wanted one, no more than two, but the priest that I told you about, messed me up because he had me thinking that to give a child to a man was equivalent to the Immaculate Conception (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That's the, that's the truth.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: This is a true story that sounds funny.  But he did, he really did I'm--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Father Benedict [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Father Benedict.  He really did so, no I never wanted no more than two children.
Story_ID: 523645
Speaker 1: So we were talking about your marriage.  You met Mr. Walker [Cecil Walker (ph.)], you all had a business [Tom's Kitchen (ph.)], and that marriage lasted two years?
Speaker 2: That marriage lasted, the marriage--
Speaker 1: The marriage lasted two years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were together really eleven years.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And do you rem- recall the year that you were married?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you worked in the business?
Speaker 2: Yes, all my children worked in the business, it was a family business.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The kids worked in it as well.
Speaker 1: And when did, where were you living at the time?
Speaker 2: At the same location, yeah.  The restaurant was in the basement and we lived upstairs in the apartment building.
Speaker 1: On 46th [Street] and Drexel [Boulevard]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where did your children go to school?
Speaker 2: Corpus, not Corpus Christi [Corpus Christi School, Chicago, Illinois], on 39th Street.
Speaker 1: Holy Angels [Holy Angels Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Holy Angels.
Speaker 1: And do you recall what church you were attending at the time?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh god, that's funny, I went, I tried to go to the church across the street, can't remember the name of it, and my husband didn't like it, and he said to me, he, he, he wanted me to stop, so I ended up not going, so I would just participate with the Catholic church.  You know, you had the, having children in Catholic school you had to, if you didn't, you didn't have to come to church every Sunday, but you had to come at least one Sunday out the month, until I left him, you know?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was it like being an only child and then suddenly having nine children?
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: What was the--
Speaker 2: --it was--
Speaker 1: --house like?
Speaker 2: --it was a gradual thing.  We've always had fun, but it was, it was not easy, it was not easy at all.
Story_ID: 523646
Speaker 1: So Reverend Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Maxine Walker], what was it like having nine children in the household after being raised as an only child?
Speaker 2: You know in the beginning Sasha [Sasha Daltonn], it wasn't, it was something that you just had to deal with 'cause it was there, but down through the years, we have become such a family and my children, we all enjoy one another, it's not like, we're friends but not the kind of friends like some parents are, they get friendly with their children and then they go out and party with their children, they couldn't, didn't, not that kind of friends okay?  But we're kind of, we are so close and one of the things that has happened, since my illness which was a prayer of mine, prior to my illness, was that they really learn the value of family.  And it's like my illness brought us closer together, everybody just jumped in with a totally different attitude and we have so much fun together.  We really have a lot of fun together, so I think that's key because that's missing in so many families.  I mean, and I, out of nine children, all of 'em, like my daughter's [Bernadette Wimberly (ph.)] in California, she calls me every morning.  I have a son right here in Chicago [Illinois], that calls me every night, then I have children that just really take care of me attentively, you know, and they just stop in and do different stuff, that is such a blessing and I don't take that for granted.  And like I said, the family, we have so much fun, everybody, people enjoy coming over just to be with my family and us, to see, you know?  So it's very, that, that, that's, I'm very grateful for that.
Speaker 1: Reverend Walker are your parents still living?
Speaker 2: No, no, neither of them.  My mom [Bernadette Turner Lucas] died from pancreatic cancer, and my father [Jack Lucas (ph.)] was kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what year was that?
Speaker 2: I can't remember, Sasha.  But I've been dealing with it for four years, I would say maybe about eight years ago.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Pre-1998--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --ninety-nine [1999]?
Speaker 2: About eight years ago.
Speaker 1: And what about your dad?
Speaker 2: My dad died from cancer, too.
Speaker 1: And do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: No I don't remember.  In fact (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that before your mom?
Speaker 2: --it was before my mom.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And we, my dad died from cancer, my mother has two brothers and her, her oldest brother died from cancer and her living brother now has cancer, you know?  So cancer seems to really run in our family.
Speaker 1: What were your mother's brother's names again?
Speaker 2: Milton Turner [Milton Turner III].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And George Jackson [ph.].
Speaker 1: And which one is deceased?
Speaker 2: Milton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that made me have even a smaller family because that was it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: She only had two brothers, so there.  And they, only one of them had one child.
Speaker 1: So you had the crew?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I replenished the earth (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh god.
Speaker 1: And where did the children go to high school?

Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So now we're in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 2: Yes.  Now, we're on--
Speaker 1: Now you're a--
Speaker 2: --Drexel [Avenue].
Speaker 1: --little bit on Drexel.  Did you move from Drexel to Michigan as an adult?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I mean from--
Speaker 2: Michigan--
Speaker 1: --Michigan to Drexel as an adult?  Did your family always stay on?
Speaker 2: --I, I moved from Michigan to Drexel as an adult.
Speaker 1: And the family still lived on, on 46th [Street] and Michigan?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your mom [Bernadine Turner Lucas] and dad [Jack Lucas (ph.)]?
Speaker 2: I think they, mom had gone back to school, dad was gone, you know, but my [maternal] grandmother [Mabel Turner] was there for the most part.
Speaker 1: So they were still on 46th and Michigan?
Speaker 2: They were there and we stayed there until I contracted tuberculosis.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And then what happened.
Speaker 2: I went in the sanitarium [Oak Forest Health Center, Oak Forest, Illinois].
Speaker 1: You went in the sanitarium--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but, but they, where did they live?
Speaker 2: They--
Speaker 1: They still--
Speaker 2: --lived there.
Speaker 1: --stayed there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: They still--
Speaker 1: --it was when you came out of the sanitarium and you went to college--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's so funny.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Ahhhhh.
Speaker 1: That you moved, or did you stay there also?
Speaker 2: No I never went back there, you're taking me down a different street. I never went back there.
Speaker 1: Okay, where did you go?
Speaker 2: At what point are we talking about now?
Speaker 1: When you came out of the, when you went to college?  When you came out of the sanitarium?
Speaker 2: I lived at 47th and Ellis [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: For about two years, to the Ellis Hotel [ph.] was the name of the place.
Speaker 1: And then you?  Got married?
Speaker 2: No.  Remember I didn't get married, but I began to date the guy [Cecil Walker (ph.)] and then we began to live together.
Speaker 1: For nine years.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And where was that that you lived?
Speaker 2: Forty--47th, forty--48th [Street] and Drexel.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were kind of still in the general vicinity?  The South Side [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Always on the--
Speaker 1: --area?
Speaker 2: --South Side.
Speaker 1: And you saw the community change?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I'd like to just go back, if I can to, how that area had changed from, from the time you were living there before you went into the sanitarium.  Did you notice any differences in the community?  Did you notice a different type of people moving in?  Were there some community organizations that you might remember that your parents were affiliated with?
Speaker 2: No this wa- the, the pan era was over with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At this period and during, for--on Drexel, it was a total different atmosphere, more of an adult atmosphere, real party atmosphere, clique-ish, but not arrogant and puffed up.  It was a--it was a total different genre.
Speaker 1: I know during that time, there were a lot of women social clubs.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Were you a part of any of those?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was not, no.  No, I, I've tried on some social clubs, I've always had a problem with people who have a program they say, but when you get involved in it, it really ain't a program.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's like a social club.  Well I really don't, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, I don't belong.  You know I sit on a lot of boards now, but I really don't, I, I, can't use my time.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, I understand.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter).
Story_ID: 523648
Speaker 1: I would like to go back to your getting very involved in the religious community.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm such a studier of the word, where a lot of people go into the church and the clapping of the hands and the music, you know?  It, it gets, it, I mean, that becomes church for them, it's always been deeper for me.  I remember we belonged to a church called Love Memorial [Love Memorial Church, Chicago, Illinois] and there was a lady, Sister Coleman [ph.] who always, whenever you came in her presence she'd say, "Praise the Lord, how are you doing?"  And that bothered me that she would always say praise the Lord, 'cause I wondered why I wasn't saying praise the Lord, we belonged to the same church.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We're getting the same stuff, you know?  And so I felt like, that if she was saying praise the Lord, I should be saying praise the Lord, either she shouldn't be saying praise the Lord--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --you know?  And so I've always tested stuff from that point of view.  And then, but my involvement has been the word, when I study the word, it takes me to a different place, and so I've always had questions, and of course, me being a bold person, I've always asked the pastors questions and then when I became, when I started publishing, the magazine first [The Platform], and always included the ministers.  And then when I began to publish the newspaper [The Spiritual Perspective], the same thing, that put me in a area where me and the ministers always had dialogue because that's really part of my workshop.  And so, being a female that's kind of uncomfortable for them, but I have a reputation where I've been able to dialogue with them, never ever none of their wives getting upset with me, never feeling out of place, never none of that.  But my dialogue has been so strong, they had to stop and listen to it and now the transition of the gospel is so prophetic, and especially with me going through my illness, I've learned so much more.  They, they listen, in fact, I have pastors who call and consult with me about their sermons, for the next day, and we have a good time on the, on the phone.
Story_ID: 523649
Speaker 1: There's a lot the church is missing, but I think that--
Speaker 2: Like--elaborate on that a little.
Speaker 1: That the church is missing?
Speaker 2: What you think the church is missing?
Speaker 1: Well, I think that they have allowed the music to tickle their ears, I think that they have been caught up in the finances.  And that keeps them from the real ministry, ministry is servanthood, it's serving mankind, and when you can't recognize that, you done lost it, you know what I mean?  That's, that's first and foremost before anything, whether they got money or not, and so I think that our churches have gotten caught up in how much money they can raise, I think they have got caught up in the, the music and, you know.  And the music is all good, I, I, the church I belong to, Valley Kingdom Ministries International [Oak Forest, Illinois], we are a praise church, you really, but Apostle H. Daniel Wilson, he's a word person and when he gets to, he really taught the word and you understand that he didn't spend a little time, he really studied to show himself approved.  So it's important that we began to serve the people, and so I think that more preachers and pastors, need to either seek out how to serve the people, and teach it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You went from participating in a Catholic church, a Methodist church, Catholic because of the children, to what denomination after that?
Speaker 1: Protestant.
Speaker 2: Protestant and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --what chur--
Speaker 1: And a Baptist, but it, Sasha [Sasha Daltonn] for me, I'm, I'm international, like I've, I've went to Israel and spent ten days with the Ha- Hebrews, I've, I love [HistoryMaker] Minister Louis Farrakhan, who is a Muslim, but I've never compromised Jesus Christ--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for any of them--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I went to Africa which was a total different, we have to learn how to respect each other's cultures and learn from them.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: There's so much that we can learn from the different cultures, I mean, even when you go to other countries like Jamaica, there's so much you can learn.  And I know when I was in Israel, I stayed down with the Hebrews for one week and then I stayed in Israel proper for another week and ther- there's a different, you know, you've gotta ask questions and you've got to--so in terms of who I am, I would have to say, I'm almost would have to say I'm nondenominational, you know?  I mean, in my own spirit--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I really am because I support and study all cultures.

Speaker 1: You mentioned that you went to Moody Bible Institute [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Several times--
Speaker 1: --a little bit about that experience and, and why Moody?
Speaker 2: Well, I think Moody was all I knew--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and when I went to Moody I loved it because, I loved their campus and I usually go out and study on their campus and stuff.  I did have a problem with the teaching, because it seemed to have been prejudiced.  The, the theory was good, but the teacher took time out to express personal opinions about denominations, I didn't think that was good.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But the theory was incredible, the books were incredible, I enjoyed and learned so much from Moody--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but I got mad the first time I went because of that and then after I finished that course, I didn't go back for a while and then I went back again.  You, you know, you have to learn how to intermingle with people.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 523651
Speaker 1: Your career, tell us how your career in gospel, in the gospel industry started and what some of the things were that you did?
Speaker 2: Well I'm, I'm a wr- I'm a writer just naturally so, and because religion was something I really was into, I started my own magazine.
Speaker 1: And the name of that was?
Speaker 2: The Platform was the first one.  It was a black and white magazine, pitiful (laughter) when I look at it now it was so pitiful--
Speaker 1: Why do you say that?
Speaker 2: Well it was, you know, it was a learning process--
Speaker 1: But that was--
Speaker 2: --that I--
Speaker 1: --you were one of the first people to have a, a--
Speaker 2: --I was--
Speaker 1: --gospel--
Speaker 2: I was, I was, I was so excited about it, but you know, when you look back, I think I have a, a copy, when you look back, you know, it was pitiful.  But I'm proud of the pitiful, but I'm just acknowledging (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --that it was pitiful.  And then--
Speaker 1: Do you--
Speaker 2: --we--
Speaker 1: --remember what year The Platform started (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't.
Story_ID: 523652
Speaker 1: Then from The Platform, I went to work for the Gatlings, it was a public relationship for all their entities and they wanted to do a magazine, and so I did.
Speaker 2: Can you talk to us a little bit about what you did at, at the Gatlings?
Speaker 1: I was a public relations person for all of their entities, and when I first came on, they were saying to me, "Reverend Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Maxine Walker], we want, we, we need to speak to Michael Jordan," and so I said, "Okay."  They said but I don't, "We been trying to get to him for over two years."  Well you know, I'm a person believe if, that if he here and he's made of flesh and blood--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --there's no reason why you can't get to him.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so, I sought a relationship with Michael and I, in fact, I formulated that relationship through his mother [Deloris Jordan], her and I talked on the phone and we fell in love over the phone and she came to the Gatlings, the morning that I was leaving for Israel, and I presented her with some roses, in fact the pictures in there on the wall, but she showed me how to get to Michael and so, you know, it was history from that point on.  But there's always, w- you know we, somebody has to teach us that all things are possible, God says it but we don't believe it. You know, so we don't function in it and it deteriorates whatever we stand for, because we say one thing with our mouth, and doing another thing with our body and I do understand that it takes time and a relationship, really a relationship with God to get to that place.  But it should be more teaching on how to get to that place.
Speaker 2: When you say that you were over the public relations for their entities, those entities were what?  I know they have a funeral home [Gatling's Chapel, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: They have a funeral home, they bought some property--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that was just phenomenal, they own a piece of property that's just miles and miles and miles that you can look at.  And on the, what would you call it?  On the, on, it's not a lease, but somewhat equivalent to a lease, I can't think of the right verbiage for it, but on the deed--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --it's written on the deed that this property should never be sold to a Negro, that's written on the deed.  And of course what happened was the man who put that on the deed died, and his sons took over the business, you know, and so it, when it, it took on a different--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know?  They didn't care nothing about whether a Negro owned the property or not, you know, it was about the money and so--
Speaker 2: And that property is here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Here in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Starting at 169th Street, or 159th [Street], but it's is, it's almost as far as you can see from left to right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It's phenomenal, I forget how many acres it is, but, yeah (unclear).  And then they had other, they had choirs and groups that sang and they traveled, you know, they had a lot of different entities and so--
Speaker 2: And you were the public relations person (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was the public--
Speaker 2: --for all of--
Speaker 1: --relations--
Speaker 2: --all of their enterprise?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then you started another newspaper, a magazine for them didn't you?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, and Mr. Gatling [Lafayette Gatling, Sr.] wanted a magazine and I did the, I, I started, I did the research and put it together.
Speaker 2: And the name of that was?
Speaker 1: Can't remember.
Story_ID: 523653
Speaker 1: I just wanna go back a little bit to The Platform, because I remember The Platform magazine and I don't remember another gospel magazine--
Speaker 2: There (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at that--
Speaker 2: --wasn't--
Speaker 1: --time.
Speaker 2: --there, there wasn't.
Speaker 1: So would we be correct in saying you were the first person--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to have a gospel magazine?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And then Reverend Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Maxine Walker], didn't you have a television show for a while?
Speaker 2: Yes, called 'Touching People' [ph.].
Speaker 1: And, and do you remember what station that was on?
Speaker 2: Channel 26 [WCIU-TV, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And can you tell us a little bit about that format and how you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That--
Speaker 1: --happened to--
Speaker 2: --that was--
Speaker 1: --get into that?
Speaker 2: --nothing but reaching.  You know, reaching to--it was a vision of my--and I learned so much, but I learned too late for the show, because there was so much, I was being trained in terms of body language and what you do, but I should have been more of me, than more of what someone was training me to do and be. But it was a vision to grow and, and to teach, my, and my, all, everything I'm involved with pertains to teaching and when I would get the pastors together for the different subject matters, it was a ma- it was open for dialogue, but the method was teaching.  And, then also, the purpose was intertwining the different denominations, you know, at one period, the Baptist only associated with the Baptist, and the--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Church of God in Christ only associated--you know, so it was, it was a teaching tool that was a, it wa- it wa- it was marvelous for the time--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that it existed.  Expensive because you, at least I didn't know at the time how to get the sponsors that you need to do, to keep something like that going.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So would you say that you were the first or among the first to have a gospel television talk show?
Speaker 1: I would.
Speaker 2: I wa--
Speaker 1: I would.
Speaker 2: --I have been trying to remember what else may have been on during that time and that was maybe in the late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  I would, and I never thought about that Sasha [Sasha Daltonn], but you're right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You're absolutely right.  We've done several first I guess in gospel and because that's, that hasn't been what I had looked at, I had a lot of people come to be and say, "You should do, dah-da-dah."  I've had people come to me and say you should write a book.  Well, you know, I've published a couple books, I'm writing one now, but you know, I--I was looking at ministry differently so a lot of that has not happened and I thank God to The HistoryMakers, because now you're, you're enabling me to get part of my history out, you know, where people can--because I have done some things and you know, not being an egotistical person, I don't think of life like that so a lot of things, I miss about, you know, me being--I'm not a person to go around and say, "I'm the first gospel, dah-da-dah," you know, that ain't, that's not my personality.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's not my heart.  And so, this is a great opportunity for me.
Story_ID: 523654
Speaker 1: Reverend Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Maxine Walker], I understand that you're a playwright also?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did.  I did, I forgot about that Sasha [Sasha Daltonn].  See there's some, I, I mean, I don't.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that part (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I don't--
Speaker 1: --of your career.
Speaker 2: --I don't remember that.  I wrote the play, 'Touching People' [sic. 'One Lord, One Faith, and One Baptism' (ph.)]?  Is that the name of the play?  I can't even remember the name of the play too, Sasha.  But I wrote it and I encompassed, that was, I wanted somebody white in the play, I wanted, different denominations in the play, we represented the Church of God in Christ, we represented, the Protestant church, we represented the mosque, the Hebrew, I, you know, we represented the person on the street that was laying on the park bench, it was just a ministry within itself.
Story_ID: 523655
Speaker 1: Reverend Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Maxine Walker], you had the play ['One Lord, One Faith, and One Baptism' (ph.)].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And if I recall it was at the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: It was first at, what's the college there?
Speaker 1: Kennedy-King [Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was first there.
Speaker 1: And it was a big success.
Speaker 2: It was a big success, it was, and then we launched out to the Regal and then we went on the road with it.  Yeah, we went to Detroit [Michigan], we went to St. Louis [Missouri], yeah, that, that's, that's a lot of doing however.
Speaker 1: Now, I know you don't like to, you just told that you don't like to talk about being the first, but I remember seeing your play, and if my memory serves me correct, that was in the early '90s [1990s], late eig- late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 2: Early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Early '90s [1990s], and there were not a lot gospel plays--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --going on--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --at that time?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So I would say that you were among the first to have a gospel (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --show and take it, the traveled, that toured the country?
Speaker 2: I, I can't, I can't remember if I was the first.
Speaker 1: Among the first.
Speaker 2: Among the first.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what the play was about?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know we talked, you said about different religions.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Integrating with one another from a positive perspective.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And the purpose of it, it was to show not only integrate from the different denominations, but we also wanted to show the man who didn't have a place to stay who was sleeping on the park bench and how, just like there's a biblical quotation, how the man passed by the man that was on the street, we wanted to see who would take up with the man.  And the first people to really take up with him was the Muslims. Because that's their--they were, their religion is based on going out and finding them, but was so many other people to have other denominations that we think got it going on, they passed them up. You know, that was the part of the ministry of it, so we can't really look down on the different denominations, like I said, we have to respect them and learn of them.  I remember just recently we did something at our church that involved the Muslims and, a--another guy who didn't believe in the Muslims.  But anyway, it ended up being that one of the things my pastor said, he said, "Well one of the things that you have up on me, you know the Qur'an [Koran], I don't."  So we have to study to show ourselves approved, you know what I'm saying?  So that we can speak the proper language, so that when we, you know, it's like when, what the Jehovah's Witnesses, they come and they hand us material that they want us to read, but if you turn around and hand them material, they won't take it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so I think that's unjust, and yet I think they have something to say.  You know?  But, it's all about teaching from the pulpits and, and it's our men and women of God that are in leadership that need to know what that real rol- role is--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and that's servitude.
Story_ID: 523656
Speaker 1: And when were you called to the ministry as a pastor, as a--
Speaker 2: Not as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) as a--
Speaker 2: --a pastor.
Speaker 1: --minister--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --as a minister?
Speaker 2: Ooh, I would have to say, maybe twenty, maybe twenty, twenty-five years ago.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were ordained?
Speaker 2: I was ordained recently.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: When I say recently, maybe about seven, seven or eight years ago?
Speaker 1: Maybe longer than that.
Speaker 2: Maybe as long as ten years ago, ordination paper's in there on the wall.  And that was because it wasn't for me, it wasn't no biggie, I was who I wa- you know, I, I've always known who I was in the Lord, and then the church took, that I belonged to at that time, which was St. Mark [St. Mark's Missionary Baptist Church, Harvey, Illinois], under the leadership of Bishop Willie Jordan, they had a ordination service.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And of course, being one of the lead ministers there.
Speaker 1: For the benefit of someone that maybe looking at this and may not know the difference and we just touched on it because we both know.  Explain the difference of being a minister, and being a pastor?
Speaker 2: Well, I can only give you my opinion--
Speaker 1: Your opinion.
Speaker 2: --about a pastor--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but, it's a, it's a, I've, I've never se- you know a lot of ministers, most ministers think that when they're called by God into the ministry, that that means that they're called to pastor, that is not so.  You know, every minister that's called to be a minister doesn't necessarily mean that he or she should pastor.  I personally have never received the call to pastor.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I'm happy about that because from what I see, it takes a whole lot.  (Laughter) It takes a whole lot and I think that's one of the problems in our industry, you know, is that men and women don't know that just because they're called through God and to the ministry, that is not necessary the pastorship.  I think pastors have a lot to do, a lot of responsibility because they have so much to do, many of them end up neglecting their home life, and when I say they have so much to do, when you have to study for your bible classes and for your sermons and when you have to be at certain meetings, you know for the clergy or whatever they're doing, when you have to run by the hospital and see somebody, and when you have to, and this is a time that you planned to be with your daughter and your wife, you get a call, you've got to go, that's what servanthood--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --is about, so.  Yeah, pastorship, I think God blessed them.
Story_ID: 523657
Speaker 1: We talked about your relationship at Gatlings [Gatling's Chapel, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] and starting their magazine, which was called the--?
Speaker 2: I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I don't remember the name of it either.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But then you started your own gospel newspaper?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I, I was moved to leave there and I was the owner of Pierre [ph.], owner of the mall at 115th [Street] and Halsted [Street], said why don't come over here?  Well I didn't have necessarily have money to rent the place, while I'm processing, but then the, the newspaper kept coming to me, I wasn't, I wasn't interested in the newspaper business, never thought and the newspaper kept coming and I would shake it aside, and it kept coming, I would shake it aside.  And so, one day I said, "Well let me, and this keeps coming let me look into it."  And the more I lo- looked into it, the more it became a part of me, and I made the decision that that was what I was gone do, ended up taking an office down at the mall and that's where the newspaper really began.  It was an interest, any project that I work on however, is interesting to me, because I work with a passion.  I don't work on things just to work on them. It's something I gotta feel.
Speaker 1: And the name of the paper is?
Speaker 2: The Spiritual Perspective.
Speaker 1: And it's, in it's--what, eighth or ninth year?
Speaker 2: Ninth year.
Speaker 1: Ninth year?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that is certainly one of the most popular gospel new- papers for the religious community.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah God has blessed the newspaper and he's blessed the news--he's blessed the vision of the newspaper.  At this point, it's not where it should be because of my health, I don't work on the same level that I was, but--
Speaker 1: But when you started it, what was your vision?
Speaker 2: --for the newspaper?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: First of all I didn't, I had to find out that there was a vision for me and then it became, it's all about educating people and about allowing them to know what's going on in the community.  There's so much that goes on in our community that our African American community does not know of, they know about what's going on in their church but they don't necessarily know what's going on in other--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --churches and why.  You know?  They don't, they know about the musicals, but they don't necessarily know what other people are doing in ministry.
Story_ID: 523658
Speaker 1: I would like for you to just talk to us a little bit about how you feel about your personal ministry and if you could focus in on what you think that is, if it's one singular thing, what would that be?
Speaker 2: Teaching.  Teaching, I have a passion to teach, I, in fact, this is a day that we would normally have a bible class here.  But because it was who you all are, we cancelled the bible class, but we have it every Saturday here.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Teaching is so important to me because I th- I see the lack of, in our churches, in our community meetings, et cetera.  So it's not, and it's not totally all about the Bible, it's about living, people have lost what it takes to live.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And it's--
Speaker 1: Why do you think that is?
Speaker 2: --I think it's because it's not being taught, Sasha [Sasha Daltonn].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I think that people come to the table, feeling that they don't qualify.
Speaker 1: What is it that you think it takes to live?
Speaker 2: Well first of all, from my perspective, it takes a God relationship, you can't live if you don't understand life, if you have a personal relationship, see we talk a lot of religion, but we don't live it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: If you have a personal relationship with God, then you really know, it's like for instance, the Bible says, "By his stripes you're healed," [Isaiah 53:5].  Well if I'm going around saying I'm looking for a healing, I call God a lie because the Bible says, "By his stripes you're healed," I'm already healed, you understand what I'm saying?  But what happens is you have to teach people how you get to that place, but the really, you can't do it without him.  It's like I have a very good medical team, just, I mean they really wanna see me live that have said th- that I won't live for two years, which I've passed that time, they really wanna see me live, I believe that and they're really good, but they're and they are, they put a band aid, they're trained to put a band aid, I mean the whole system is trained to make it stop hurting for right now, not to cure it, you understand--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --what I'm saying?  Is that, then so, they put a band aid and they've done an excellent job.  But only God, only he can do the healing and I'm a living witness of that because according to them, I should be gone now, and according to a report that I had just a few weeks ago that the cancer had metastasized from my liver to my lungs, but I'm doing well, I'm gaining weight, I'm doing well, you know?  I mean I have my good days and my bad days, but I'm doing excellent.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I will do, and how I'm doing excellent is because of my relationship with God, and not man, because there's so many things that man doesn't understand and so I have a burden for my people, I have a burden to teach what I know and what I have learned, I have a burden now to teach health.
Story_ID: 523659
Speaker 1: I'm writing a book right now, it's entitled, 'Ten Reasons Why You Should Not Use an Herbalist' [ph.].
Speaker 2: An herbalist?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, ten reasons why you should not and just to give you a little excerpt of it, when they open the book, they will also find a testimony from me of, that I believe in herbalists, I believe in the holistic doctors, 'cause I really do.  But there, it's according to your body, what's going on with you, as a given example, this new chemo [chemotherapy] that I'm taking, the side effects come with very, very bad diarrhea, and so normally the doctor said, we would tell you to eat vegetables and fruit, but because of the condition, to eat vegetables and fruit, wouldn't help me none, it would hurt me.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You see what I'm saying?  And so that's basically, just giving you a little of--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what the ten reasons would be.  And as there's so many people who just, when the doctor tells 'em something, it goes down like it's permanent, I mean, you've got to, you've gotta talk, you've gotta ask questions--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, the doctor said they gonna die, they go over in the corner and start to moaning and getting ready to die--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --and they usually leave here real quick, when they do that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know what I'm saying?  So it's that kind of teaching that I also wanna do other than just the religious piece.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Because we've gotta learn to live.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: We've gotta learn to live, and I feel as though that I have found the formula for living, I would like to teach that as well.

Speaker 1: Reverend Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Maxine Walker], just to back track a little bit, you had mentioned early on that your mother [Bernadine Turner Lucas] was a columnist?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, did you say that she wrote a book?  Or did--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --she write--
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Speaker 1: --a book?
Speaker 2: --she did.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about her book?
Speaker 2: The book is written, I can't remember what the terminology is, she was, she wrote poetry, she wrote lovely poetry.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But, it was written, like for instance, when she was a kid, she got her, some kind of way, she got caught on fire, and her back, her clothes was burning on her back and in this book she's able to put it in poetry form about that experience.  The building that she lived in, in Lake Meadows [Lake Meadows Apartments, Chicago, Illinois], which was one of the first buildings that that built in Lake Meadows, she writes about that; she writes about me as a baby.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Do you remember any of her poems from memory that you could recite one for us now?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I do have the book in there--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --for you and maybe the next segment, I can get Mark [Walker's son, Mark Walker] to bring one out.

Speaker 1: Reverend Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Maxine Walker], before going into the ministry, were you involved in any other businesses other than the family business that you and your husband [Cecil Walker (ph.)] had?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So, you went straight from that business [Tom's Kitchen (ph.)] to the gospel music industry, what wi- with the ye- with your years of being married and then your, the businesses that you've formed--
Speaker 2: I reckon--
Speaker 1: --what with this--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You reckon (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh gosh.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You reckon, okay that's good.  How many grandchildren do you have, nine children and--
Speaker 2: Ooh, girl--
Speaker 1: --how many grands?
Speaker 2: --don't embarrass me.  I think, I think maybe about sixteen or seventeen grandchildren and I have one, two, one-two, one-two, one-two, I have two children who don't have no children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But yeah, I got plenty of grands and I have plenty of great-grands.

Speaker 1: Your list of friends sounds like the who's who of America from Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] to Michael Jordan, how did you happen to become so associated and so well respected by such a--
Speaker 2: Sasha [Sasha Daltonn] I've (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) group of people?
Speaker 2: --always believed that people are people.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I've never gotten caught up in their name and what they do, people are people, and God loves us all and he affords us, it's what you feel and think as to how you move, and that's how I've always moved, with the favor of God.  I mean, I've been, had some wonderful experiences, I was with Minister Farrakhan, when the first time him and Winnie Mandela came back together, that was with Lionel Hampton, who signed his self out of the hospital, so that day, with a private nurse in a wheelchair, to roll up in there, he said he didn't wanna miss it, he, he wanted to be there while history was being made.  It's about what you want to do--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and what happens is, it's how you talk to people, you didn't go up to people--I have to use this analogy, which I hope I'm not mistaken, I would say with a Sambo mentality.  You know, that don't work.  And when you think a lot of yourself, and you as a human being, you don't have to take low because people have a name, you know, you have a name as well, and so you walk there in, that's, that's what happens and then that's when God gives you favor.  He, he, he, you know, he gives you favor.

Speaker 1: Reverend Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Maxine Walker] is there anything that you would like to tell us that we have not asked you?
Speaker 2: No, I think you're doing an excellent job of taking care of the questions.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You made me remember stuff that I'd forgot.
Speaker 1: Why did you wanna tell your story?
Speaker 2: Well I think that, first of all, I, it, it would be like a legacy left for my family.  It would be like a contribution to the gospel community.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: In terms of what we do, what we teach, what we think, where we go, how we go about it, but the main thing for me is the legacy for my family.
Story_ID: 523664
Speaker 1: If you could name five ministers that you felt were the most influential to you, or who've made the biggest impact in your spiritual growth, who would they be?
Speaker 2: Number one, it would be Apostle H. Daniel Wilson.
Speaker 1: And why?
Speaker 2: Because he, Sasha [Sasha Daltonn], he teaches a word, known like no other man I've ever seen teach.  That's including Jakes [HistoryMaker Bishop T.D. Jakes] and the rest of 'em and all of them have their place, you know, in terms of the ministry and being effective.  But he's an excellent word teacher.  You would have to experience him to understand what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: He's an excellent word teacher.  The next person would be, Pastor Meeks [James T. Meeks], I so respect him, I respect him not only because he's the senator, but he has proven to the community that he would not neglect his pulpit, and he has not done that, since his reign, plus he's such a giving individual, I mean he gives beyond what people know.  I think he is an attribute to the ministry and what we should stand for--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --as mighty men and women of God, that was the second person.  Let me see, who is the third person is.  I really respect Dr. Horace Smith [HistoryMaker Dr. Horace Earl Smith], I think Dr. Horace Smith has a level of ministry that reaches out to all mankind and I think that, I mean he has not, I mean we, we know each other and we've done somethings together, but in terms of who I respect in the ministry.  Naturally I respect Bishop Brazier [HistoryMaker Bishop Arthur Brazier] the difference in between Bishop Brazier and a Dr. Horace Smith, Dr. Horace Smith is a, is a little younger and has a younger vision for the community at large as well as Africa.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: How many have I named thus far?
Speaker 1: That was four.
Speaker 2: That was four?  There is, there's so many that I do respect, you gave me a very hard question, you gave me a hard question.  I would have to put down Bishop Willie Jordan, who was called the country preacher, who still is called the country preacher.  But, he's been very instrumental in my life, allowed me to grow at my own pace up under his ministry, which was basically, I was helping him.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That's, I could go on and on.
Speaker 1: All of those were men, give me three females.
Speaker 2: The Reverend Jimmie Pettis, Pastor Jimmie Pettis [ph.], who is a great friend who has walked the walk in terms of ministry and what she does.  I would have to say Reverend Princella Brady Lee is another person who has done a great job and Reverend Princella Gilliam [Princella Hudson-Gilliam], she has also--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --done a good job.
Story_ID: 523665
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life and what is really important to you?  I know you said teaching, is there anything else?
Speaker 2: I love at this point in my life, people think that I have this place here because I have money, because it looks like money and it is money.  But the place is really God's favor and so it was a wonderful place, God knew I would get sick, it was a wonderful place to be sick in, it has so many different atmospheres, that you can feel good about as you pass through.  But I enjoy sharing this place with people and to testify to them that this was, this is all God, every bit of it is God.  I don't lie, I really don't, and I think that it's so important for them to understand that this is God, and I can tell them how.

Speaker 1: Reverend Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Maxine Walker] you have done so many things in the gospel industry and the religious industry, it's hard to just focus in on one particular thing.  You've had, you're a playwright, you've had a successful play, the name of it, we were gonna, we were trying to remember the name of your play, was it One Lord--
Speaker 2: One Faith--
Speaker 1: --One Faith?
Speaker 2: --and One Baptism ['One Lord, One Faith, and One Baptism' (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Right.  And then you've been a talk show hostess and we didn't mention that you had a radio show.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I've had several of them, several of them down through the years.
Speaker 1: So you're a radio personality?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.
Speaker 1: And a publisher.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: S- so this is gonna be a kind of broad question.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: For anyone going into any of those areas that you've been in within the religious idiom, what advice would you have for them?
Speaker 2: First of all, I don't think they should go into it, not unless they have a passion for it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: If they have a passion for, it will work for them.  If they're going into it, I can't say it wouldn't work for them if they didn't have a pass- but if--my advice was to do research on it just find out what you gotta do--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know, how much time you gotta give up, give it a whole lot of thought, because to invest money into something that you're not sure about, is going down the beaten path, so, I would do research.
Story_ID: 523667
Speaker 1: What do you want to do that you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I like traveling, so that, I mean I could still do a whole lot of that, I love traveling, that's about it, I mean, I've lived a, I've lived a real good life.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you have already done that, looking back, maybe you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: I think there's a lot of things that I would have done differently.  Just like we talked about the TV show ['Touching People' (ph.)], I would have done that differently, even things pertaining to the spiritual perspective.  You know how you learn through trial and error--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so there's a lot of things that I would have done differently. I think the key thing is that when you find yourself in diverse kinds of places, that you investigate it, look at it and correct it.  It should be as much pleasure in correcting something as it is in receiving something, because if you, it, it, you've learned something if you're correcting it, you know--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you're moving further, so that means that you're going to make it better, you know.
Story_ID: 523668
Speaker 1: I used to also be a tavern owner, I mean, that I used to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Oh gosh, that was something else. I used to be a tavern owner and I used to be a fish market owner, I owned fish markets, our fish market was called Seven Plus One [ph.], at that time I had seven children plus one--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --and I--
Speaker 2: Where, where was that located Reverend Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Maxine Walker]?
Speaker 1: 75th [Street] and Exchange [Avenue], right across the street from the lounge.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: From the lounge that you owned?
Speaker 1: That I owned.
Speaker 2: And the name of the lounge was what?
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm trying to get there.  The fish market, I went and trained all my children, we went and we went down on Maxwell Street, and found us somebody and hired him, he came in and taught us how to scale them fish, how to cut 'em up.  And all my children learned the business and we scaled fish and cut 'em up, and then we also fried, we cooked it there, you could buy, it, it was like DiCola's [DiCola's Seafood, Chicago, Illinois], you could buy it raw or you could buy it fresh.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I sold the bar to Herb [ph.], just before he died, who had The Name of the Game [ph.].
Speaker 2: Herb, you remember his last name?
Speaker 1: Can't remember Herb's last name, but was (unclear) right across the street.  I've always been a people person, and of course, I did things differently, you know, I remember, like other people were selling Budweiser and Schlitz, and stuff, I didn't do that, I sold Heinekens and Lowenbrau, to keep the, the other element--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --out of the place.  We had live entertainment with Paula Greer and them, it was, it was, it was different, it was really--everything I've ever done Sasha [Sasha Daltonn] has been different.  But I, I wanted to project, the reason why I mentioned the tavern business and the fish market business, I don't want people to think that my whole life has been--now I've always been a righteous person, I, when I got of the tavern business, I went down and was gonna hone my skills and took an application down at the Chicago Defender, and I started working for the Chicago Defender, right.
Speaker 2: As a?
Speaker 1: As a, I was working in classified, so I worked as a classified specialist, ended up being the manager of classified, you know, it was just, that life has taken on so many different and that's who, that, that ha- all of it has helped make me who I am.  And because I'm, I, that, that has given me my versatility, you know, where I'm very versatile, that has allowed me to understand people.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You really never understand.  You have a man walk in a bar with a three piece suit on and an attache case, put a couple drinks in him and you'll see who he really is.  I ain't the man who walked in with the attache--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --case, you know?  And so all of those things help you in your skills that are forthcoming--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in life, but it's just so wonderful to be able, oh it's so wonderful to be able to see and hear now.  So many years you, in your quest to live and be and belong, you were deaf and you were blind and so now I'm on another segment of life where I see and where I hear very well.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And where I can share what has been happening with me down through the years.
Story_ID: 523669
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I'm excited about Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama]. I'm excited about him as an African American potential president because I think he brings another system, or a non-partisan system.  I think that he has for the world, is not according to race or denomination, I think he has a formula that's so different and so new, and so unique, and it's not centered around him being a black man.  It's a people thing and I think his message is so unanimous, I mean it, it has the, the people excited, the young people, our future, he has them excited and I think that's very important.  I have lived a good life and I do have something to contribute, but my contribution is to the young, to, to, to say something to them, to encourage them and to let them know that they are our future and that we're so dependent upon them and in fact, without them, we're lost, because it's, that's who's gonna run America, is the young people. And all these older politicians who've been in it, and it's business as usual, it ain't fixing to happen no more.  These young free people are calling for something different, I'm very excited about Barack Obama and, or when he wins, not if he wins, but when he wins.

Speaker 1: Did you work at all in the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: You know?  No, I didn't, just a little tiny ninchy [ph.] bit, which was with Metcalfe [Ralph Metcalfe], you know that goes way back.  I was young--
Speaker 1: He would have been your alderman, when you were--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, yes, ya--
Speaker 1: Did your, did your family have a relationship with him at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did, he was a great man, girl I lived during the era of Metcalfe, Two-Gun Pete [Sylvester Washington] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Remember?  Remember Two-Gun Pete?  (Laughter) Oh, that's funny.
Speaker 1: Did you know Two-Gun Pete?
Speaker 2: I knew him.  I knew him, yeah.
Speaker 1: What are your memories of him?  Did you ever, did you know him personally?  Was there a relationship there?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I knew of him, because he, he had two different roles.  Initially his role was, he would go, be walking down the street and he would tell people to meet him at the police station, that's how much it was, that's how--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --they was afraid of him, you know.  He would say, "You meet me at the police station," and they would do that.  And then later on, his role, he became old and cantankerous, and start doing things a little different, but they too, were a part of the history makers of our culture and what happened on 47th Street.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: 47th Street was live and well.
Speaker 1: And, Metcalfe, was there any kind of personal relationship, maybe, a relationship with your parents [Bernadine Turner Lucas and Jake Lucas (ph.)] with Metcalfe?
Speaker 2: No.  The relationship with parents was just with me personally and there's somebody else who escapes me, that was a, who would have been a part of that as well.
Speaker 1: Jesse Owens.
Speaker 2: Jesse Owens is one of them.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  But there's someone else that escapes me that really would have been a part of that era, but he was a, he was a won--he, he made you feel like Harold [Harold Washington] made you feel.

Speaker 1: --that was--when, when Harold first started, you know, he wanted to make sure that he had enough money to run, and so he didn't move until they proved, until they got out and went door to door and got them finances.  Then when he did that, one of his greatest statements to me was when he said, "You all want Harold?  You've got Harold, but now I need you."  What's what is it?  He said, "You can go out and eat all the chicken, but don't forget to bring the vote back home to me."
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I worked in the campaign, would, I can't remember his fiances name--
Speaker 2: Mary Ella Smith.
Speaker 1: Mary Ella Smith, very, worked very closely with her, she was working on, on his behalf.  We worked up until the ninth hour, or before Harold died, we saw, we were with him, and he was mayor at that time, w- we were with him about two weeks before he died and he had gotten so big, you--it look like if you stuck a pin in him juice would--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --come out of him.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know?  But yeah, I was--
Speaker 2: What do you think his greatest contribution was to the City of Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Beating Vrdolyak [Edward Vrdolyak].
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Oh gosh, he didn't, he was a master at asking questions.  Instead of arguing with them, he would say, "You said it."
