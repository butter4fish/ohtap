Speaker 2: Yes, James E. Bowman, same as mine.  I left the junior years ago.  And my mother's name was Dorothy Bowman, D-O-R-O-T-H-Y, Bowman.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when was your, when and where was your mother born?
Speaker 2: God, I don't remember.  I don't--any details about my father and mother so many, many, many years ago, I just don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you don't remember if they were born in the [Washington] D.C. area or not or in Virginia?
Speaker 2: I think my father was, I think that my mother was born in Washington, D.C.  I don't know, I have to--maybe my father too.  I just don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those are particulars that I don't collect.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have any idea when your father was born or how old he was, you know, when he died?
Speaker 2: Well, I have a vague, vague one, many, many years ago in the early 1900s, of course.
Speaker 1: Okay, does your family have any stories of what the family was doing during slavery or Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: No, un-uh, no, that's too early.  I have no stories whatsoever about slavery because they were not born slaves.  They did not have, you know, as far as their parents, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, during the period.  I realize a lot of people weren't slaves, but during that period, I guess, of time, in the middle of the nineteenth century, you know, you don't have any idea--
Speaker 2: No, have none, not whatsoever.  They never discussed it, not to me.
Speaker 1: Nothing about any of the occupations they held?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Nothing about any of the occupations that they held in those days?
Speaker 2: You mean during slavery?  They were not born during slavery.
Speaker 1: Well, not in slavery, but what occupations did they hold?
Speaker 2: Well, my father was a dentist, I know.  My mother was a homemaker.  And that's it.
Speaker 1: Do you know what dental school your father went to?
Speaker 2: Yes, he went to Howard University Dental School [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, and his father had gone to college before him?
Speaker 2: Hum?
Speaker 1: Had his father been a college student too?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't even know who his father was.  I have no idea.  I have never, I never collected these things (laughter).  Many people do like to go back, I suppose I could go back and find it, but I have not.
Speaker 1: Some people, you know, they do know their grandparents.  They've met them.  Did you have a chance to meet your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I remember my father's mother on the father's side.  And I remember my mother's mother on the other side.  But that's about it.  But I did not know, I didn't have, no idea of my other, of their parents, no recollection whatsoever.  And I never--I think they were dead before I even realized that I was here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 69334
Speaker 1: Alright, well, what kind of person was your father [James Bowman], and you know, did he ever talk about how, you know, how he came to become a dentist?
Speaker 2: No, whatsoever, it was just one of the things he wanted to do.  He never mentioned it whatsoever, un-un.
Speaker 1: He never told stories of having to walk ten miles to school or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, un-un, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He tried to, he tried to encourage me to be a dentist, but I had no desire to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what kind of a person was he?  Did you get along with him fairly well or did you have, you know, kind of a--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, it was fine.  He was very supportive in many ways or what have you, and when I decided to go to medical school, he didn't object at all. So.
Speaker 1: But he preferred that you become a dentist?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, yes, because, well, he had plenty others.  He had another brother who was a dentist, and I have a niece who is his--who is an oral surgeon (laughter).
Speaker 1: So there's plenty of them in the family?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What about your mother?  What did she do?
Speaker 2: She was a homemaker as far as I knew.  She took care of us.  There were six of us.
Speaker 1: Oh, well, where do you fall in the--
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest, I'm the oldest yes, and I have three brothers and two sisters, and two brothers and one of my sisters are dead.
Story_ID: 69335
Speaker 1: All right.  So can you take us back to, I guess your childhood and tell us what the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in [Washington] D.C. were?
Speaker 2: Well, we lived in, you know, in Washington, D.C.  It was during the time, of course, of segregation.  Washington, D.C. was segregated as far as schools were concerned.  The buses were not segregated, but if you went across to Maryland or Virginia, the buses were segregated.  But I had a very comfortable childhood, and I eventually graduated from Dunbar High School which was a very famous high school in Washington, D.C., an excellent, excellent--
Speaker 1: Right, and named after Paul Lawrence Dunbar.
Speaker 2: After Paul Dunbar, and we had excellent professors, just excellent professors there.
Speaker 1: But we're going too fast.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, I don't wanna go to high school yet.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right. You didn't mention that
Speaker 1: We can go back to childhood and talk about, you know, the neighborhood.  What neighborhood did you live in?
Speaker 2: We lived in various areas, two areas.  One was on "N" Street which was right near Dunbar High School.  And then eventually we lived on Thirteenth Street up on the hill.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And Dunbar High School used to be called, I think it's another, they had another name for it.
Speaker 2: Well, preceding it was called the "M" Street High School, but Dunbar High School was, it's a very famous one, it was excellent, excellent high school.
Speaker 1: What kind of things did you do when you were a little boy?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a bicycle, and I learned how to play tennis very early, and I, that was my main sport.  And eventually I became District of Columbia, single tennis champion.  Other than that, I had a very active boyhood.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that's something to become the tennis champion of the District of Columbia.  This is in high school or--
Speaker 2: Oh, this, oh, yes, when I was in high school, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you like to read when you were young?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, I read everything that I could.  And there was a public library not far from there, and I think there's a whole wall of books that I, that I read just all of them.  I read all of them.  I read mostly on weekends and read two or three books, had a wonderful time doing that, that I enjoyed.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember any particular books that you liked better than others?
Speaker 2: Oh, all of the other ones that you would think a young boy (laughter) would.  Remember, there were so many. All of them.
Speaker 1: What kind?  Can you remember some of the titles?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember.  There were, just practically everything you could think of, yeah.
Story_ID: 69336
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any favorite teachers at school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had excellent teachers at Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington, D.C.].  And I had an English teacher by the name of Tignor and a wonderful person.  And there was a mathematics teacher who was just very, very excellent.  And Tignor in English was just an excellent person, just wonderful.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that name?
Speaker 2: T-I-G-N-O-R, Tignor, just a (unclear) person.  I'll never forget once when we were, I read all of my assignments, but one night I did not read an assignment.  And it was about George Sand, the great French writer.  And he said, James Bowman, would you stand up and tell us about George Sand.  And I started up, and I said, I said "he".  And he said, sit down (laughter), and I looked and I wondered why everybody laughed.  He said (laughter), you did not read that, did you?  And I said, no.  I didn't realize that George Sand was a woman (laughter).  But he forgave me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Can he spell that for the transcription service?
Speaker 1: Can you spell the name?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: George Sand?
Speaker 2: Yeah, G-E-O-R-G-E, and S-A-N-D.  And then, I'll never forget I had a wonderful, Haley Douglass, which was the son of Frederick Douglass [sic., grandson], who taught us history.
Speaker 1: Haley Douglass?
Speaker 2: Yes, Haley Douglass, wonderful guy.  (Unclear), excellent teachers, the best of the best.
Speaker 1: This was at Dunbar High School.
Speaker 2: At Dunbar, yes.
Story_ID: 69337
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any other activities at school besides tennis?
Speaker 2: No, that was my main sport, no.  That was mine.  I concentrated on tennis, and I played, you know, most of my life I've played tennis, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you interested in science in those days?
Speaker 2: I was not necessarily.  I liked mathematics.  I liked biology and science, but not particularly, but I also liked the other subjects too.  But I was not necessarily, at that time, I didn't, no, not necessarily.
Speaker 1: Did you have much social life in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.  There were always dances and things like that.  Yes, there were the usual things that you would see in high school, and I participated in the cadet corp. and so I marched, you know, (laughter) as young people do.
Speaker 1: Like an ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corps]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, like a junior ROTC.  Yes, I was part of that too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you have any idea that you wanted to go into medicine when you were reaching graduation in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I thought that I wanted to go in medicine I think when I was in college.  And my father [James Bowman] kept, you know, I was surrounded by his friends who were dentists.  But for some reason or another, I chose medicine.  That was it.
Story_ID: 69338
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanna go back to this tennis championship again for minute.  What was that like and who else competed in it and was it easy to do that or what?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd been playing for a very long time, and I played with some very good people there.  I'll never forget one who was there was the son of Todd Duncan, the great singer.  And he and I were close friends.  And I used to play with his father and his son, and Althea Gibson, who was the, you know, who eventually became Wimbledon Champion or what have you, used to play there.  I used to see her play and some others that played.  And I played singles and doubles, and a wonderful time.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this tournament, was like a citywide or a school tournament?
Speaker 2: Yes, citywide, citywide, only for, in those days, for Negro children, not whites, un-un, completely segregated.
Speaker 1: And this is in the City of Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: In the City of Washington, D.C., yes.
Speaker 1: Just blocks from the White House?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Just blocks from the White House.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, of course, of course, of course.
Story_ID: 69339
Speaker 1: During those days, of course, we could not go down to the restaurants or to the movie theaters or anything.  All of the, all life was concentrated along "U" Street with the movie theaters and restaurants or what have you.  Of course, we went into any of the government buildings, but you were not allowed into the others.
Speaker 2: Now, this is during the Roosevelt administration too, right, I guess?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 2: I think people look back and, you know, they think of the Roosevelt administration as being like very liberal, you know, in a sense, but it's hard to imagine Washington, D.C. segregated like that.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, segregation did not end in Washington, D.C. until 1954, 1954.  And I was, at that time in the Army Medical Corp and my wife and I went to Washington, D.C. because I was in Denver, Colorado, but I had temporary duty at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.  And we arrived just when segregation ended, two weeks before, and we walked into a restaurant and just as if nothing had ever happened, into a hotel, nothing.  It was not, no longer segregated, and it was just as if Washington [D.C.] had been integrated for years (laughter).
Speaker 2: Which you knew was not the case, right (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yes, I knew that, I knew that. I knew that.
Story_ID: 69340
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what was high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington, D.C.] graduation like?  Did you graduate with honors?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I graduated and I was, yes, with honors, and it was a wonderful ceremony.  And I'll never forget that the year before, I think it was, Joe Louis, there was a fight, I think with Max Schmeling (ph.) or something like that.  And it was, the graduation was interrupted.  And we were at, I said, "Ah, hah, Joe Louis won" (laughter).  That's one of the things I recall.
Speaker 1: Now, you graduated in 19--was it?
Speaker 2: In 1939 from high school.  And then '43 [1943] from Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and 1946 in medical school because during the War [WWII], we went year around.  And we had two weeks' vacation, so we finished medical school after three years.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell me about Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Who was president of Howard when you went to school?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember (laughter) his name, and I know it as well as I know my own.
Speaker 1: Was it Mordecai Johnson?
Speaker 2: Yep, Mordecai, that's it, Mordecai Johnson.  He was a great man.  He really was.  He was a wonderful orator, really magnificent orator.  And he was very supportive of the students and what have you there, and I had a very marvelous education there too.  I didn't worry about it after, you know.  It was excellent.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and were you pursuing like a science, a bachelor's of science or a bachelor of arts?
Speaker 2: Biology, I had a degree in biology, graduated in (unclear) biology (unclear) (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 69341
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There are a number of notable teachers at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I believe--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.  There were, indeed.  Thurman, who was there was very famous, yes.
Speaker 1: Who was--?
Speaker 2: Dean Thurman, Howard Thurman, yes, he was very, very famous.  Many, many famous, and Logan there, Logan in history.
Speaker 1: Raeford Logan?
Speaker 2: Raeford Logan, yes, was one of my professors, and they were all excellent and they had been, you know, had obtained doctorates elsewhere, you see, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you have classes from E. Franklin Frasier or under E. Franklin Frasier?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, yes, I did, yes, I did, yes, I did.  Wonderful.
Speaker 1: What about William Leo Hansberry?
Speaker 2: No, un-un, never.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us about some of these people because I don't know of anyone, we haven't interviewed anyone--at least I haven't interviewed anybody who went to Howard in those days.
Speaker 2: 'Bout what?
Speaker 1: Well, it'd be good hear about your impressions of some of these professors.
Speaker 2: Well, Logan, of course, was an excellent professor.  And one of my professors was Ralph Bunche, who was excellent too in political science.  He was there for a short while.  And then, oh, I'm trying to remember all of the names on the spur of the moment (laughter), Eric Williams was one of the professors there, and he was--
Speaker 1: He was Caribbean.
Speaker 2: --and I got to know him very, very well because of colleagues, friends of his and, as you know, eventually, he became Prime Minister of Trinidad, which is now Trinidad, and--he was a graduate of Oxford [Oxford University, Oxford, England], and he had an English, English accent.  We used to smile a lot, but he was a wonderful (unclear) there.  So when you think of Eric Williams and Ralph Bunche and Raeford Logan and they were just great men, all of them were prominent in their own right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And Elaine Locke was, Elaine Locke was a professor, of course, a philosopher, and I took philos--(unclear) under Elaine Locke.  So we were quite fortunate.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd say so.  I mean that seems like a powerful faculty--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.  I mean afterwards a very powerful faculty because technically, they couldn't teach anywhere else but in a so-called, in those days, Negro university.  That's the way it was in, you know, Atlanta [Georgia] at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and all of the others and Lincoln [The Lincoln University, Chester County, Pennsylvania], had the best professors from all over the country who would go there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, at one time they were calling Howard the black Harvard, I think.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and we said a lot of nice things about ourselves (laughter).  It was once called the Capstone of Negro Education (laughter).  Yes, you know, but we said it, but I'm certain that the others said things, you know, the same thing about themselves, particularly, when you think of Morehouse, you know (laughter).  There's a story about the Morehouse men (laughter), you know, and they are, I mean they think that's the greatest school in the world (laughter).
Story_ID: 69342
Speaker 1: Okay, well, a lot of people do think of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in those days especially, as being like the best place, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, I had an excellent education there and also in the medical school too, yes.
Speaker 1: Now who were--in undergraduate, did you continue to play tennis?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yes, I played on the tennis team, yes, oh, yes, during the whole time there.  Yes, I played tennis, had a good time playing there, and we traveled a lot around, you know, to other universities, to other Negro universities, as we called them (laughter) in those days.
Speaker 1: So what are some of the other activities you engaged in, in college, I mean in the undergraduate school?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I made the mistake of joining a fraternity, and I thought that was a waste of time, and I did do that, yes.  But it was a waste of time.  But I continued until I graduated, but after that I had no contact whatsoever.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the fraternity will be unnamed as far as its name.  It didn't make any difference (laughter).
Story_ID: 69343
Speaker 1: So in--so when you went to medical school, was it like a given that you were gonna go to medical school [Howard University College of Medicine] after completing a degree in biology?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yes, yes, I went straight to it, after there.
Speaker 1: I imagine, I don't know, but I imagine you were a top student in undergraduate school, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I was good, but I had my foolish times too (laughter), you know.  We were all, we were young and what have you.  But I did all right.
Speaker 1: All right, well, tell me about medical school?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was an excellent time, and were always told that no matter what, that when you leave here, you'll be able to compete anywhere in the world.  And we would and we did.  And we believed it, and it happened.  We had excellent professors there too.  They were very, very tough, and many of them liked to flunk students out and it was tragic because it was during World War II.  And some of my colleagues who didn't make it were sent overseas and died.  That part was very tragic.  And it's sort of frightening because what we were, when we were in the, during those times, we had what we called the Army Specialized Training Program, and we were in the Army.  And we were Private First Class, and we were reminded by our professors that if you don't make it, you'll be out of here and be sent overseas, which they were. And I graduated as a First Lieutenant, and after graduation, we were supposed to go into the Army right away, from medical school.  But at that time, the Armed Forces had no desire, at that time, to have medical officers who were Negros, and so we were discharged from the Army which allowed me to continue on with my graduate work so I was very happy, internship, eventually fellowship in pathology.  So at that time, I did not have to go to the Army, but I had many friends who were white who were, our peers at other schools, and most of them were called into the Army (unclear), but the Negro medical officers were not.  So that was an advantage of being segregated (laughter).  I had no desire to go and fight (unclear) for anybody else (laughter).  And when I think of it, thinking back on it and all of that, I'll never forget the comment of Mohammed Ali when he was--objected to going to the Army, and he said that, they said, well, why don't you wanna go?  He said, "Nobody in that country ever called me nigger" (laughter).  That was a wonderful, very perceptive, very perceptive.  So I was fortunate, but eventually, I did go into the Medical Corp, but I did nothing but research; had a good time there too.
Story_ID: 69344
Speaker 1: Okay, let's go back to Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] for a minute.  I just wanted to ask if, do you think that Howard, I know the preparation was good, but looking back at it, do you think that Howard, did you think that Howard was as well equipped as a lot of other medical schools in those days?
Speaker 2: As far as I could see, it was well equipped.  We had excellent professors.  One of the most famous ones was Charles Drew, who was one of my professors there.  There was Montague Cobb.  They were excellent all over and everything, as far as I--and we had contact with other medical students who were not at Howard too.  As far as I could see, the equipment and everything else was equal to anything else we'd find.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I eventually went to predominantly white institutions to do resident fellowship, I couldn't see any difference, and I felt that my education was just like anybody else's.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did not feel deficient.  They were quite tough there.  I thought that they were little bit tougher probably there, and, but they would, they felt that the students, when they left, they should be able to compete anywhere--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that was the feeling.
Story_ID: 69345
Speaker 1: You said you did eventually join the Army Air--I mean the Army Corps--Medical Corps (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, I was in the medical corps, was while I was in, in medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  And then I was discharged into the Army of the United States.  And I thought I was in the Reserves.  And so I didn't worry about it when the draft came along and all of what have you, but I'd finished my training and everything else.  And I got a call from the draft board, and they said that, Dr. Bowman, you haven't volunteered for the Army.  I said, well, I think I'm in the Reserves.  He said, no, you're not.  You're in the Army of the United States.  He said you were discharged from that.  And I should have, you know, gone to the draft board.  He said, well, you can volunteer.  But by that time, I had finished my specialty and my boards, and I could pick and choose where I wanted to go.  And they said, well, they'd like for you to go to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology which was the best place to go.  I said, no, I don't wanna go there because I'll be looking at slides for the next two years, and that's--and so I wanted to do research.  So they appointed me to the Medical Attrition Laboratory which at that time was in Chicago [Illinois] which was very good because at that time, I was, when I was drafted into, I was head of the Department of Pathology at Provident Hospital after I finished my training at St. Luke's Hospital.  And then I was--then they moved the Medical Attrition Laboratory, which I was a member of, to Denver, Colorado, which was very nice, my wife [Barbara Bowman, HM] and I had a wonderful time living in Colorado.  I did nothing but research in the Army.  And it was a 9:00 to 5:00 day, and weekends, we would go to the mountains and relax and what have you.  So it was a very pleasant time, and I researched, and so the Army at that time was, I had no problems whatsoever.  I had no desire to be regular Army.  I was asked.  I said, no.  I said, not for me (laughter).
Speaker 2: It sounds like the best way to serve is what you did (laughter).
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: It sounds like a good way to serve.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, oh, yes.  Yes, and fortunately, since I had had ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corps] experience in high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington, D.C.] and then when I was in college, I was in the ROTC also.  So when I was finally taken to the Army, I didn't have to go through basic training or anything else.  I just went directly.  One day I was a civilian.  The next day I put on a uniform, and I went on to the laboratory (laughter), to do research.  So that was wonderful.
Story_ID: 69346
Speaker 1: Okay, now when did you meet your wife [Barbara Bowman, HM]?
Speaker 2: I met my wife in Chicago [Illinois].  I was at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  I was in my internship, and I happened to come to Chicago to an Alpha, Alpha convention, and I met her here in Chicago.  And eventually, when I went back and I graduated and I remembered seeing her (laughter), and I called up.  And so I started dating her.  At that time, she was in college during the winter, but in the summer she was at Sarah Lawrence College [Yonkers, New York] at that time.  And eventually, we got married right after she graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1950.
Speaker 1: Okay, so a kind of long-distance relationship?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes. Oh yes, oh yes, yes. So.
Speaker 1: In those days, you had to write letters a lot, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, but could make phone calls too.  Yes, I made phone calls, yes, for letters, the days of letters.  You know, no email or (laughter) anything like that, uh-uh.
Story_ID: 69347
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long were you in Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: We were there for about a year and a half, and then my wife [Barbara Bowman, HM] and I thought there was a chance, you know, should I go back to Chicago [Illinois] to Provident Hospital.  I was invited back, but I thought that I had had enough of that, and my wife and I thought that we're not very happy to living, even in that time, under segregated conditions.  And my wife and I said, and I said, well, it'd be nice to travel and have somebody pay for it (laughter).  And we decided to leave the United States.  And then during that time, it was during the McCarthy Era too.  It was not very pleasant.  And so I happened to be at a meeting in Washington, D.C., the International Geographic Pathology, and I met a friend of mine, who had been at Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and was head of Geographic Pathology.  And he said, what are you gonna do when you leave the Army?  And I said, well, I was thinking of going somewhere, and I was thinking of going to Africa or to India or some place.  And he said, what I heard about an excellent place in Iran.  There's a new hospital that's being built, and they want Americans and Iranians to open the hospital.  I said, now, that's a rare thing.  He said, and they're looking for a chairman of the Department of Pathology.  So he gave me the address, and I wrote, which was then the Iran Foundation, which was incorporated in New York.  And the members of the board of the Iran Foundation were professors from all over the country, and A. O. Whipple and Eastman from Har--from Hopkins and what have you.  So my wife and I were invited out for an interview in New York at a yearly meeting they have there.  And there was a large banquet, and my wife and I were circulated by members of the board.  And at the end of the dinner, they said, well, Dr. Bowman, we'd like to invite you and your wife to Iran.  So we said, yes, because everybody said, ah, that's the craziest thing.  You wouldn't do it and why would you go there?  And where is Iran and what have you?  And I said, (unclear) you know, opportunity.  And the salary wasn't bad, and it was tax free, so we thought we could make it.  So, we, in 1955, we arrived in Iran, and it's the best thing that ever happened because that is--my work in Iran and the research I did there was eventually, was the reason why I was invited to at--the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 69348
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: For six years.
Speaker 1: --What was Iran like in, and we have the image of the Ayatollah Khomeini [Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini] now and nowadays, an image turmoil over there.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  There's just as much turmoil in the United States, you know (laughter).  There's been a lot of turmoil, and we were not, we were there when a lot of things were going on in the United States and what have you.  It was very nice, it was very calm.  It was during the Shah, the Shah of Iran [Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi], and the hospital was neat, was quite modern.  And we had comfortable housing, and the hospital was, eventually, it was a place where the Shah used to bring dignitaries who had come to Iran to see this hospital.  And we met Ieve Hahn (ph.) of Pakistan.  We met [Jawaharlal] Nehru who came there, the King Hussein [King Hussein bin Talal] from Jordan was there.  We met the Queen of England, Elizabeth [Queen Elizabeth II] and her husband [Prince Phillip] there at gatherings and what have you.  And it was a large compound which most, practically all of us lived on the compound nice houses and what have you.  And then I became interested in a disease called favism which is when, it's from what we call the broad bean, and if those who are sensitive, develop hemolytic anemia where your blood cells get destroyed.  And so we worked on that.  And at that time, worked on this, which eventually, an enzyme deficiency named glucose-6 dehydrogenase [glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase].  This work was being done at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And I used to write back and forth to a Professor Alving [Dr. Alf Alving] who was head of a unit here that is in Chicago.  And we became friends by letter.  And so we, a friend of mine, Derrick Walker, who's a biochemist, we started writing papers.  And we wrote quite a few papers about favism and then I was--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Favism?
Speaker 2: F-A-V-I-S-M.  Favism.  But it was very fascinating because we had never seen it before.  Of course, the fascinating thing about Iran is that we saw many diseases that you'd read about in the United States, but you could see them right there, and things were there.
Story_ID: 69349
Speaker 1: But, so we worked on this enzyme deficiency.  And I went to an International Congress in Hematology in 1960, and I gave a paper on favism, work that we had done on.  And we had extracted a principle from a fava bean and gave a paper on this.  And this elderly gentleman stood up and said, Well, Dr. Bowman, he said, what you've done is rarely tried, but they failed.  He said, why?  I said, you'll have to ask the Israelis (laughter).  And so he invited me to dinner that evening had cocktails and dinner.  And at the evening, he said, you know, he said, if you come to Chicago [Illinois], I want you to look me up.  And I didn't think too much about it.  Then Dr. [Louis K.] Diamond visited there from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He was a very famous hematologist.  And he heard about the work that I was doing there, and he said, well, when you leave here, he said, and you shouldn't stay too long.  By that time, it was almost six years because I was interested in this disease and was working and it was fascinating.  He said, I think you should go to London [England] and study genetics at the Galton Laboratory at University College of London.  He said, I'll write a recommendation to the National Institutes of Health for support for that because he liked what we did.  He said, because you all are working out here all by yourselves, and this is the only place other than Israel where this work is being done.
Story_ID: 69350
Speaker 1: Now, just for the sake of those listening to this in the future who may not have a medical background, what is favism?
Speaker 2: Favism?
Speaker 1: Yes, can you break it down for somebody that knows nothing about--?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, of course, of course.  Well, there's a principle, there's an active principle in the bean.  And it is analogous to many other drugs that you find in this bean which is primaquine and sulfer drugs and what have you.
Speaker 1: Bean?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yes, it's a bean.  It looks about this large and what have you.  But in this bean, there's an oxidant in there that is like other common drugs which also will give sensitivity.  And it was discovered at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] that there's certain drugs that, one of them is primaquine which is used in malaria work, that about ten percent of African Americans, when they took this drug, they would have hemolytic anemia.  Their blood cells would start destroying things, that's for anemia.  And so that work was done at the University of Chicago, and it was found that it was associated with an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and that the enzyme was deficient when the person would develop a hemolysis as a result of eating fava beans and what have you. And this--
Speaker 1: So people in Iran were getting sick after eating beans?
Speaker 2: Yes, a certain proportion.  And so what we did, we did population studies to see what groups were sensitive because this work had been done by, on African Americans in Chicago, amongst Israeli's, particularly Sephardi Jews and also this work had been done on Christani (ph.) Jews and Southern Italians.  And so we decided to do this work in Iran to see if that was a cause, and we found that approximately, and it depended upon the population, about ten percent of the people had this enzyme deficiency.  And so if they took these fava beans, (unclear) these fava beans, they may get in trouble.  And it was a population thing.  And then we studied these Araspians (ph.) who were sort of the original inhabitants of Iran and went to them, and they did not have this enzyme deficiency.  And Armenians in Iran did not have this enzyme deficiency.  And so we started doing population genetic studies.  And so work there in Iran, which led to my work, looking at these same things in Mexico and Ghana and Nigeria and the Cameroon, Ethiopia, after I left Iran.  That's after I left Iran.  So it was a population thing.  And that, and so it was determined it was genetically determined.  It was "x" linked, what they call sex linked, but "x" linked, and so my introduction in genetics began in Tehran [Iran], and I've been doing work somewhat like that, at it ever since, and so I--.
Story_ID: 69351
Speaker 1: After I left Iran, I studied at the Galton Laboratory [University College London], which at that time, was one of the best countries in the world to study human genetics, there or the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], the University of Wisconsin [Madison, Wisconsin] and Johns Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And that's about it.  And so in England, so my wife and I had a wonderful time, but even more important, when we lived in Iran, our daughter [Valerie Bowman Jarrett, HM] was born in 1956.  We arrived in '55[1955], and she was born in 1956.  And so we have a daughter who was born in Iran, and we went back, at least three times after that to visit.  And, of course, my daughter has had some problems because she was born in Iran.  Quite a few years, about ten years ago, she was with her daughter in Paris [France], and as she was leaving Paris, she was, the customs official looked at her passport, and said, you were born in Iran.  She said, yes.  And she said, well, I'll have to take you off to this room and ask you some questions.  And his first question was, "Why were you born in Iran?"  And she said because my mother [Barbara Bowman, HM] was there (laughter).  So it started from there (laughter).  And then, and so he called, he said, after about fifteen minutes, he said, well, I'll have to call my supervisor.  The woman came, the supervisor, and she said, what's wrong?  He said, she was born Iran.  She said, she has an American passport (unclear), and she apologized and so she left.  But she had the same thing happen to her many years later, after that too, leaving Paris of all places.  She was with an entourage with the mayor.  There were a group of about ten that went to France, and she was one of them.  And as they left the country, she was singled out with all of her friends, and then they took her and started questioning her again.  But she had a wonderful life in Iran.  She left at the age of five, and lived on a hospital compound and it was wonderful.  It was just a nice childhood, and there were a lot of little animals around.  We had a small zoo there, around there.  And so we had just a nice--and then, in fact, the whole time we were there, she didn't get ill at all.  And the first time she had diarrhea in her life is we flew to England, and to drive back to Iran in the entourage of cars, and we forgot that the pastries in England were not necessarily refrigerated (laughter).  And our daughter, at the age of twenty-two months, her diarrhea, and then she didn't know what it was.  And she'd lived in Iran because they're very careful there.
Story_ID: 69352
Speaker 1: But that's nice. But I have many, many friends there.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: It was the best thing that ever happened to us.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's something.  That's quite a story because a lot of people don't have a story like that when they go (unclear)--
Speaker 1: No, no, it's wonderful.  I had excellent friends.  My friends are still my close friends.  Most of them are living in the United States now.  And many of my students, former students are professors all over the country.  And I was honored just this last Saturday, the Shiraz University Association, my former students and colleagues.  I was, there were two of us, and I was honored by them.  And I met some of my former students who I hadn't seen in thirty or forty years ago.
Speaker 2: I realize in those days, probably the ruling group in Iran was not, they weren't talking about Islamic fundamentalism and that sort of thing so much then, but--
Speaker 1: No, oh, no--
Speaker 2: --did you have to make any cultural adjustments at all?
Speaker 1: No, as far as we're concerned, most of the, there were women who had chadors, but that's covering and what have you, but they were not covered, but the women would walk around without them.  It was quite modern.  My, we had a Volkswagen car, and my wife was the first woman to get a driver's license in Shiraz [Iran].  The one before, she had an international license, but she actually got a driver's [license] and she drove there.  And she would drive in the car, and this woman driving around, and people would look and stop.  And she went to the gas station, of course, and all of that.  But that was not paid too much attention.  We were just, everybody was accepted.  The Iranians are very, very hospitable people, very hospitable, very hospitable people.  And now, they may, you know, rail about the United States or other things just like we talk about them.  But as far as individuals are concerned, and that's even in all of, wherever we traveled in the Middle East, to Lebanon to Egypt, Israel, we were, it was just everybody was just very nice.  And people are people.
Story_ID: 69353
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, what was England like for you?  You stayed there for two years, right?
Speaker 2: No, a year, a year there.  It was very nice.  It was excellent.  You know, the English are supposedly stand offish, you know, and what have you, but reserved and what have you, but very, very close friends at the University College London.  It was an excellent place to study.  Professor Penrose, who was in charge then, was excellent, and I had colleagues there from other countries, another one from the United States.  There were students there, studying genetics.  The professors were all gracious.  We went to their homes, and I have my closest friends who I met there who are still friends of mine, in England, yes, had a wonderful time.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you're on the ground floor of genetics studoes then, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I mean a lot had started, you know, long before that, oh, yes.  But we were, it was, it was very exciting in those days, particularly, it was exiting, I mean I liked the studies we did because in population genetics, we traveled a lot.  And we went to other countries and to understand other people, and that's the nicest thing about it because you get to, I mean we had friends.  We had friends in Lebanon, very close and in Egypt and Israel and Ghana, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Uganda, what have you.  And I still think of them.
Story_ID: 69354
Speaker 1: Now, when you left England, where did you go?
Speaker 2: When I went to England, that is, I said, well, you know, we were looking for something else to do.  And I remembered Dr. [Alf] Alving who was the, who initiated the studies on this enzyme deficiency that we were studying in Iran.  And I remembered what he said.  He said, now, Dr. Bowman, when you come to Chicago [Illinois], he said, I'd like for you to see me, talk to me, look me up.  And so I called him up, and he said, Oh, oh, I remember.  And he said, come over, I wanna see you.  So we started chatting and chatting and chatting, and then the next day, he said, you know what?  He said, he said, we'd like to invite you to be on the faculty at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  It just came out of the blue.  I didn't expect it at all or what have you.  And so he said, but, he said, the chairman of the Department of Medicine--at that time, the blood bank was in the Department of Medicine.  And since I was a pathologist, and I did all sorts of pathology, blood bank, he said, we need someone in the blood bank.  They had the blood bank.  And that was, oddly enough, was in the department of medicine, he said, but the chairman, the Department--of Medicine, Dr. Jacobson, is going to be at the International Congress of Hematology, and are you going?  I said, yes, I'm going there too, in Mexico.  He said, he'll, he'll see you there.  And so I saw him at his hotel, and he said, go out, he said, let's go out tomorrow, out to the pyramids.  And so he took me out to the pyramids, and so we talked and chatted all day.  And after we came back, he said, well, you know, he said, I'd like for you to be on the faculty, just like that.  I didn't have an interview or anything else.  Of course, I said, well, I said something about an interview.  And he said, well, you've been with me all day long (laughter).  He said, that's your interview.  So that's how I started on the faculty of the University of Chicago with a group that was called the University of Chicago Malaria Research Unit, and they were doing research.  And that was a unit that actually worked on and developed on prophylaxis for malaria and for treatment of malaria, right through that unit.  But these, this research was done at Statesville Prison, and they were doing other studies too.  So that's how I started at the University of Chicago.
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful story.  I mean very few people are just invited without having to apply (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 69355
Speaker 1: Well, you see I had been writing [Alf] Alving when I was in Iran, and he had ideas about malaria, malaria research and enzyme deficiency.  And so it was sort of, I said something.  He said, but, he said, a lot of people don't believe that.  But he did.  And so I suppose we became friendly, and then, but he was a very interesting person.  And then I met him in Japan and we chatted and what have you, but he also had seen my papers and had read them too before I went there.  And so he knew something about me, and I'm certain he asked around.  His friend, Penrose, who was my mentor at the University College London at the Galton Laboratory, he knew him.  So he knew.
Speaker 2: Can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 1: Alving, A-L-V-I-N-G, and first name is Alf, A-L-F.  And he was at that time, the head of the Renal Unit in the Department of Medicine at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], but he was the one who started the research there on malaria and malaria treatment and this enzyme deficiency was discovered, one of his colleagues right there by the name of Paul Carson, who discovered this enzyme deficiency which--and, of course, I was in Iran when I heard about the discovery.  And we looked at the association between the favism that we saw there, so that's how it started.
Speaker 2: It's just one of those things that...
Story_ID: 69356
Speaker 1: And I've been back to Iran, as I said, quite a few times, we took our daughter [Valerie Bowman Jarrett, HM] back three times because we wanted her to remember where she was born.  And I was there last, ten years ago, after the Shah [Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi] left, and during the time of the Ayatollah Khomeini [Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini], I was invited back to Iran to lecture at various medical schools.  And I was told that I was the first American to be invited back to Iran, which I had a wonderful time too.  Is time getting (unclear).
Speaker 2: Scott Stearns:  That's our two-minute signal.  He'll tell you.
Speaker 1: Yes, I had a wonderful time there.  When I walked into the country, into Tehran [Iran], the customs official looked at my passport.  He looked at me and he said, "Evrakyee" (ph.), which means American, and I "ballea" (ph.) which means, yes, and a look of shock came over his face and then a smile and he said, welcome to our country.  And this is during the Ayatollah Khomeini, and many said, oh, he's going to go there.  I said, I think I'll be safer there than any major city in the United States.  And I walked around purposely by myself in Tehran, Isfahan [Iran] and Shiraz [Iran] in the bazaars at night.  And people came back to me and found out I was an American and started talking to me, and said, well, are you--and then in Shiraz where we lived, there was a hospital compound.  There's a swimming pool, and there's a wall around the swimming pool, now, where only women are allowed to swim.  And on this wall, is written in big white letter, "Go Chicago, Bulls" (laughter), and then the (unclear) sign right next to it, "No, Boston Celtics are better," and it hadn't been touched.  It hadn't been touched.  And when I, after, when I came back, one of the times I came back to Iran, they put a plaque on the hospital, on the laboratory that I founded there, and my name was there in Persian and in English.  And even after the revolution, it's still there.  They didn't take it away.
Story_ID: 72175
Speaker 1: Many stories about, there's one--there's a book I'm going to write.  It's called 'Digging for Blood' in which (unclear)-that's--
Speaker 2: You said in the book you're gonna write?
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of the books I'll write is called 'Digging for Blood' in which rather than writing a scientific paper, the stories behind the story, what happens when you travel to various places and the things that you see that are absolutely marvelous, just marvelous.  Just like when we first went to Iran, we learned from the Iranians that our CIA [central intelligence agency] was responsible for overtaking the government of Mossadegh [Iran].  And we said, oh, no, how could that be?  And then years later, we learned, you know, it's supposed to be top secret.  It was open.  And, of course, the Iranians knew, and there are no secrets.  There're no secrets, so I guess (laughter).  That's one of the funny things about it.  Another time when we went to Lebanon to meet my mother-in-law in 1956 because she wanted to be there when our daughter [Valerie Bowman Jarrett, HM] was born.  We didn't know it was a daughter, whether it was a boy or girl at that time in those days, and we were in Lebanon.  And there was a party, and a woman who was a Russian, and she was married to a Lebanese.  And in the evening, she said, Dr. Bowman, I'm gonna tell you something.  He--she said, in the next two weeks, Israel is going to invade the Sinai Peninsula and England and France are coming to help.  That was two weeks before the sixth war (unclear).  And it was common knowledge in Lebanon and common knowledge--now, didn't we know about it?  I'm sure we must have known too (laughter).  We must have known too (laughter).  So there are many other things that happened like that, that we would, you know, learn within the country or going to a country, supposed to be secrets, but they were not secrets.
Story_ID: 72176
Speaker 1: There was another time when the King of Iraq [Faisal II] in 1958 was assassinated, and there was a coup.  I happened to be talking to the counsel for Great Britain who was in Shiraz [Iran] at that time.  And he was, we were at a cocktail party, and he'd had a couple of drinks, and he said, Dr. Bowman, we're gonna tell you something.  He said, during, when the King of Iraq was assassinated, two weeks before the American ambassador--I mean the British ambassador to Turkey sent a message under code to the British Ambassador to Iraq, and told him exactly what was gonna happen, the date that the King was going to be overthrown.  And the British Ambassador to Iraq sent a cable back to the British Ambassador to Turkey and said, "Mind your own business" (laughter).  He said, (unclear) stay out of my area.  So I said to the British Counsel, I said, something, anything that important you must have sent a copy to the British desk, to the Iraqi desk in London.  I said, so why didn't they do that (laughter) (unclear)?  Of course, you know, we learned that really the British were not, they thought that the King was, you know, causing too much trouble.  But there are many other stories like that (unclear) in that part of the world.
Story_ID: 72177
Speaker 1: We last, we first learned of the National Security Agency, NSA, you know, top secret.  I was in Ethiopia, and I was wandering there in Asmara and an Ethiopian colleague of mine was there, and I wondered what these radio polls were running around.  He said, oh, that's a national security.  I said, what's that?  (laughter)  And that was in 1979 (laughter).  I said, well, no, it's 1969.  I said, what is that?  He said, that's national, he said, that's top secret, and they're monitoring all over, radios from all over, you know, the Middle East and Africa.  He said, and in order to be a member of this organization, which is top secret, you have to be a born American, born in the United States, not naturalized, what have you.  And then about ten years after that, there was a book that was written, there was one of the books--I've forgotten the name, that was censored.  And it said, in the northern of Ethiopia, near Asmara, there is this blank, blank, blank, blank and they were talking about the secret area in there.  And it was censored in our book, but Ethiopians knew about it.
Speaker 2: Hmm. He had no way to find out, yeah --
Speaker 1: So the, I mean, you know, it so secret.  Many secrets that we have secrets here are secrets for the Americans, but the people in the country know.
Speaker 2: So you would think that it mainly was in--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: You would think on some level that if the people in Ethiopia knew, then--
Speaker 1: They knew, they knew.  I mean they told me.  They told me, they told me all about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: The other people in other countries, they could, you know if they just sent somebody over there (unclear) walking around (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure, I mean we knew, of course, and we knew what they were doing.  We were there.  And they were Americans there cause they were working with that, and only Americans can work in the National Security Agency.
Story_ID: 72178
Speaker 1: So you actually come back to Chicago [Illinois] and work, and you're hired by the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Did what?
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you were offered a job by the University of Chicago--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You actually did--you came back to Chicago and started work?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, yes, yes.  That's on the faculty, the University of Chicago.  And then I joined this unit [Malaria Research Unit], and they were looking, and they were studying, still working on glucose 6 dehydrogenase deficiency [glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency].  And then I started doing population studies out of this unit because we were studying populations.  And we went to Mexico, and I took my wife [Barbara Bowman, HM] and daughter [Valerie Bowman Jarrett, HM] with me and to Ghana and Nigeria and Ethiopia and Uganda and doing work on--and these were on research grants, population studies.  I began to do that and travel.
Story_ID: 72179
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me--
Speaker 2: --from the University of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of your travels in Africa?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: You told the Ethiopia story (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, well, we, our first trip to Africa was in 1976.  And we were on our way there to Nigeria because we wanted to look at this enzyme deficiency in Africans.  And we learned of a man who was there, called who was Sir Samuel Manuwa, a very, very famous Nigerian who was head of the public health service for Lagos.  And we heard about him.  And so I said we would like to come to Nigeria to do these studies and explain what we're doing.  And a couple of colleagues University of Chicago with me, and I took my wife [Barbara Bowman, HM] and daughter [Valerie Bowman Jarrett, HM] too there.  And so I wrote him this letter, and he answered right away.  And he said because, see the reason why I answered your letter was because you're the first American who's ever addressed me properly because I said, Dear Sir Samuel, not Dear Sir, Manuwa (laughter).  Well, I lived in England, and I knew that you say, when you (laughter), you know, the Sir, you're supposed to address them by their first name.  And so he said, of course, you can come.  And there I met, we were in Ghana, we were on our way to Nigeria, and we learned that [Aguiyi] Ironsi who was the head of state then, was, had been assassinated.  So we were offloaded in Ghana for about five days.  And then I tried to call my colleague who referred me to a man, his name was Alex Boyle, was professor of pathology there at Lagos, who was a graduate of Oxford [University, Oxford, England] and Cambridge [University, Cambridge, England], very, very, wonderful person.  We're still close friends today.  And I called my friend from Ghana, and in order to, in those days to call to Nigeria from Ghana, all the calls had to go through London [England] and back to, because during the colonial days, the British did not want (laughter), you know, they wanted to hear everything that was going on between countries.  And so I called him, and I said well, we got, he said, I said, we'll be there some time.  He said, yes, yes, when you come, he said, you know, he said, in the British way, he said, you know our men, and the army is a little busy these days (laughter) with the revolution going on (laughter).  And he said, but if they say you can go, it'll be all right.  So finally, they allowed us, you know, to fly to Nigeria.  And we were met at the airport by our friend, by this future friend, Alex Boyle.  And there were bullet holes all around the airport and what have you cause there'd been a big fight.  And so, as we were going into town in his car, and there were two cars for my wife and daughter and then another--no, there were three cars for the other friends, and I was with him.  And then along this road, she told me about how they had fire fights and people were still shooting in that area and what have you (laughter).  So we finally got into Lagos, but we had no problems whatsoever during the day.  They had a curfew at night, and things were still being mopped up and what have you.
Story_ID: 72180
Speaker 1: But my friend, [Alex] Boyle, was a marvelous, marvelous, marvelous fellow.  He's a graduate of Oxford [University] in Cambridge [England], and he told us a story about when Ironsi was assassinated, you know, there's a code in Africa and in the Middle East that if you're the guest of someone, nothing must happen to your guests.  They will protect you.  And so the story that Ironsi who was the head of state then, who was Igbo.  And he was visiting the Governor General Ibadan, and the Governor General Ibadan [sic, military governor of western Nigeria, Adekunle Fajuyi] was not Igbo, of course.  He was Yoruba, he was Yoruba.  And so he said that, he said what happened is that Ironsi was his guest, and some army officers broke the door, in his house then, and said, we're after President Ironsi.  And the Governor General Ibadan [Adekunle Fajuyi] said, but he's my guest.  He said, if you take him out and kill him, you have to kill me too, otherwise, they will think that I was, you know, along with you.  And that's what they did.  That's what they did cause they knew.  And the code is very, and it's very much in the Middle East.  When we were the guests of Khan's (ph.) of various groups in Iran, I mean they would, I mean they'd take very, very good care of you.  And no problem and nothing must happen to a guest.
Story_ID: 72181
Speaker 1: But that was fairly, fairly dramatic there.  And so we went on from there to Uganda, and we were, we didn't know that there was a curfew or problems in Uganda at that time, and we were met in Entebbe at the airport.  And we were told that there was a curfew, and you would have to proceed to Kampala [Uganda], you know, by car, went by car and that they met us with guns and what have you, and poking into the cars and what have you.
Speaker 2: Now, this is during the--
Speaker 1: After, yeah.
Speaker 2: --the rein of Idi Amin Dada, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Before that, before that, before that.
Speaker 2: He hadn't ascended to power yet?
Speaker 1: No, no, he hadn't ascended to power.  And so we ran into problems in Kampala but everything was nice during the day, but at night, you know, you could hear all sorts of things like that too.  So we were there. But--
Speaker 2: So Milton Obote was still--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, that's right, that's right, the president there, yes.  So we, we--it was very interesting (unclear) (laughter) and what have you.
Story_ID: 72182
Speaker 1: Yeah, so did you meet, now there was a famous doctor from Chicago [Illinois] that--well, you probably were there before he got there because it was during the reign of--
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: There was a doctor from Chicago who was involved in a, his wife was murdered, and it was blamed on him, and he took flight to Uganda.
Speaker 2: I know, I know--
Speaker 1: You know him?
Speaker 2: He was a good friend of ours.  And we know his wife, and we know all the circumstances about it, yes.  Oh, yes, we knew him.  In fact, he was, he was a physician to Idi Amin [Dada].  He was an obstetrician and gynecologist.  And he was the, and he was, he took care of the family, the women in this entourage because after this incident happened, he got out of the country and went to Uganda and lived in--years with Idi Amin.  Eventually, I think, for some reason, they brought him back to the United States, and then they put him in prison.  And he died in prison.  No, he was a very good friend of ours.  His wife was a very, very good friend of ours for years.  My wife grew up with them.  She knew them very well.
Speaker 1: It was kind of a tragic story.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Kind of a tragic story.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  No, a very close friend and we were very close with her, oh, yes.
Story_ID: 72183
Speaker 1: What others countries did you go to?
Speaker 2: Well, no, it was just, well, as I said, I said, Ghana, Nigeria, the Cameroon, Uganda, Ethiopia.  I did work in Ethiopia for several years in and out, not long, just two weeks at a time.  And then I traveled all over the country in Ethiopia from the northern Asmara all the way down to the southern part, Gambella [Ethiopia].  It was just, just wonderful.  You know, it was beautiful, beautiful country, just beautiful country.  And we were, and oftentimes we'd fly and we'd go by Jeep, by Jeep.  And every now and then, one time our car was almost waylaid by they call Shifter, the bandits.  They call em Shifter (unclear).  And it was right ahead of us.  We saw a couple of men chasing this man out there, and he was one of the shifters and they were taking him off to some place to beat him up and possibly to kill him.  But we drove all over, all over the country.  It was just, just very, very exciting, gentle people, just as all over the world, all over the world.
Story_ID: 72184
Speaker 1: Now, I think when we interviewed your wife [Barbara Bowman, HM], she said that when you all were away, the Civil Rights Movement basically was in full swing and when you came back things had changed, you know.  You wanna tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, yes, I suppose, yes, things, things had changed.  When we came back, well, when we came back, still there were things happening in the United States because we came back, we left in '55 [1955], and we came back in 1962, in 1962.  So there were still things going on.  You know, after '62 [1962], (laughter) very, very exciting things.  But, oh, it was the civil rights, it was not really, you know, it was not in its heyday really until almost--
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964] (unclear)
Speaker 2: Around '64 [1964'] but that was after we came back though, but one of the things that was very exciting, when we came because we arrived in September of 1962.  And just soon after we came back, they had the Cuban Missile crisis at that time (laughter).  My wife said, oh, we should have stayed in Shiraz [Iran] (laughter).  They would never drop atomic bombs on Shiraz (laughter).  I'll never forget when, and every now and then the United States and Russia would be upset with that, and my father-in-law and mother-in-law would write us letters and said, "Leave, leave, you know, get out of there."  I said, we're much safer in Shiraz then you all in Chicago [Illinois] (laughter) because they're not gonna drop anything on Shiraz on the Russians.  No, it was, no, but things were actually beginning to change then.  But, of course, when we left, things were quite segregated and when we came back, of course, it was not.  I mean things were quite open.  So that was a quite surprise to us, and when we lived in Iran, rock and roll came out and we didn't know what that was, the music (laughter).  And the things we heard, well, (laughter) what is this (laughter)?  But we got our news from the BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation] which was the best.  We got it from Voice of America, and in Shiraz, there was no TV, of course.  And we had, we got news from all over the world, from Russia, and all of a sudden in perfect English.  We wondered, well, what is this?  They're talking about how hot it is and what have you and how the Americans did this.  And they said, well, this is Radio Moscow (laughter), Radio Moscow.  And, oh, but when we were there, yes, the problems at Little Rock, Arkansas, and we turned on our radio and all we could hear, all the stations, Little Rock, Little Rock, Little Rock, in all sorts of languages.  And we're, what's going on?  What's going on?  (Laughter)  And then we learned from the BBC what was happening in Little Rock, Arkansas, so, yes, yes, some things were going.  I remember Little Rock, but it's odd to hear in all sorts of languages and then Little Rock, and so we know that everything we do in the United States, the rest of the world knows too.
Speaker 1: Now, some have said, and I think it's pretty much people kind of agree that the Civil Rights Movement here and the activity in the South, the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the clashes with the police in Birmingham [Alabama]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --And so forth, when they hit the national or international press, that's when a lot of pressure was put on the United States for change, you know, to change these conditions.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.  That, that, that was one of the main reasons why, eventually, the United States capitulated because we were, the rest of the world was looking at us.
Story_ID: 72185
Speaker 1: Looking at us.
Speaker 2: And the U.S. [United States], you know, took this leadership role in the world, and yet we have this kind of things going on.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, oh, yes.  Oh, yes, oh, yes, yes.  Yes, you know, we used to say, oftentimes, well, thanks for the Soviet Union, because if it hadn't been for the Soviet Union, we would still be segregated because we were made to look bad by the rest of the world.  And they would talk of us, you know, talk all over the world.  They would come into your--
Speaker 2: What was it like to hear that?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: What was it like to be out of the country and hear this--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes--
Speaker 2: --dramatic struggle being described by other people?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes, but at the same time, when you live abroad, you defend your own country and you don't like to hear foreigners (laughter) talking about you, all right, no matter what.  I remember, I'll never forget a story.  We were guests of friends of ours in Israel in 1961.  And I was doing work on this enzyme deficiency in Iran and they invited us to drop by there, and we stayed there for two weeks at Tel HaShomer Hospital.  I met a very wonderful person, Chaim Sheba who was the first general of the Israeli armed forces.  And he's now dead.  And the hospital Chaim Sheba [Chaim Sheba Medical Center at Tel HaShomer Hospital], hospital is named after him, but he was the one doing this work on enzyme deficiency and I was.  And the, at the end of the evening, there were about twenty people, it was a good-bye party.  And someone said, Dr. Bowman, we'd like to ask you a question.  And I knew something was gonna be, you know, asked and my wife [Barbara Bowman, HM] punched me in the side (laughter), you know.  I said, yes?  He said, "how does it feel to be a Negro in the United States?"  And my wife punched me again (laughter) cause she knew I was gonna let 'em have it (laughter), you know.  And so I said, I said, let me ask you a question.  I haven't seen any Arabs in Tel Aviv [Israel].  Why?  He said, what do you mean?  I said, I haven't seen any Arabs in Tel Aviv.  He said, well, Dr. Bowman, I mean after all, you wouldn't expect that?  I said, why?  Of course, I didn't ask the question, but I knew (unclear) the answer.  I said, now, suppose a wealth Arab, his son had been killed fighting on your side--they didn't know that I knew that, in the '48 [1948] War [1948 Arab-Israeli War]?  I suppose his son had been killed.  And this is a wealthy Arab, could he buy a house in Tel Aviv?  He said, no.  So I said, well, how dare you ask me how it feels to be a Negro in the United States.  Do you know what?  They didn't get it.  It was sad.  They said, how could you say that?  I said, but you've asked me a question.  It's the same thing.
Speaker 2: People just kind of look at their own little situation, I guess.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes-
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --of course, of course, you know, and we, when we were, we went to Jerusalem [Israel], and we stayed at the King David Hotel.  And we knew the history of that.  It'd been blown up by the Irgun, by the [Avraham Yair] Stern gang in there, and they were fighting.  I mean they were fighting for their freedom too, the same thing.  They blew it up and blew up quite a few civilians and what have you. So. But people just don't like to, just like we Americans do not, when we look abroad at other people, you know, we just--I mean they're different.  I mean, they're the same as we are, all over the world, everywhere we've been, to Moscow [Russia] and about forty countries we've been to.  We don't see too much difference, when you get down to it, when you talk to people.
Story_ID: 72186
Speaker 1: Did you kind of suspect that to be the case before you traveled--
Speaker 2: No, of course not.  It was a marvelous education.  I went with the usual prejudices, and that's the best thing about travel, to realize, to get to know people and respect them and understand their beliefs and why they believe what they believe.  No, uh-un, you wouldn't have to know that.  And when we lived in Iran, of course, we had a lot of work to do and all of that, but we read a lot.  We studied the history of the Middle East, the Koran.  We read everything that we could think about the country.  And it's useful too because it's, you know, you don't, you go there and you don't make, and you don't offend people either because, you know, if you offend someone, it could be quite dangerous.  I'll never forget.  Once I was in Saudi Arabia giving a lecture.  At the end of the lecture, a gentleman stood up, and he said, "Professor Bowman, in your lecture"--I was talking about anthropology and peoples, he said, "you never mentioned Adam and Eve."  Now, I'd read the Koran.  And Adam and Eve are venerated.  They are looked upon just like Jesus Christ and Mohammed and Moses, you know, and all of them.  Adam and Eve are venerated.  And I looked at him, and I said, you know, I'm very sorry, but we haven't been able to go back that far just yet.  That was my answer.  But if I had said to him, "What are you talking about, Adam and Eve?" I might not have gotten out alive, (laughter), you know, because I'd studied the Koran and they're venerated, just like Moses (laughter) and Jesus Christ.  Never, never to a real Muslim say anything against Jesus Christ because he's one of their prophets too.
Story_ID: 69369
Speaker 1: Okay, we're rolling again, and I just wanted to follow up on this question of diversity.  Now, we were discussing, I guess, on the macro level, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in terms of populations.
Speaker 2: Yes, well, Robert Murray and I wrote a book called 'Genetic Variation Disorders in Peoples of African Origin' in which we tried to evaluate the literature in our work and studies on human genetics and population genetics and peoples who are diverse.  And the thing that is sad is that genetics, just like everything else, you know, has been used and abused, depending upon the people that you look at and what have you.  But one of the things that, you know, we believe quite fervently is that we are diverse people.  And hopefully, we are because if we were not different, then humans would not be here because we are actually the product of genetics, but also environment too.  And our genetics allows us to live in certain environments and environment allows us to live too because a lot of this can be overcome.  But, unfortunately, it's been misused, you know, through the years, particularly against Africans and their descendants, but also when you do--through other countries too.  I mean Africans have their prejudices just like (laughter) Europeans and what have you too.  And so we're all different and unfortunately, for some reason or another, we dislike other peoples who are different from us because we do not know them or get a chance to get to know them.  And that's the important thing that my wife [Barbara Bowman, HM] and I have treasured from our travels throughout the Americas and through Europe and Asia, the Middle East and Africa.  And so that's been the great legacy that we've had from our travels and to understand people.
Story_ID: 69370
Speaker 1: Do you think, now, over the--I guess for as long as we've had people, there's been a debate over whether in some nature or nurture that makes a person?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's difficult and it's both, and they complement each other.  And as long as people have lived on this earth, you know, there have been wars, dislikes and prejudices.  And the only peoples that I know who have not started wars or initiated wars are the Eskimos and the Australian Aborigines.  And the reason why, because they never had the opportunity to have power.
Speaker 1: Not even in their own societies?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Huh?
Speaker 1: Not even in their own groups--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --They don't pursue wars--
Speaker 2: Did what?
Speaker 1: That they don't pursue wars in their own groups even?
Speaker 2: As far as I know.  We mean within?
Speaker 1: Well,--
Speaker 2: I'm sure there're, I'm sure within their groups, there are fights and things like that, but they have not been able to initiate wars or be so-called terrorists.  And one person's terrorist is the other one's liberators, you know.  But they never had the opportunity, but I can't think of any other people who haven't--
Speaker 1: Is this a good sign? I mean when you think about it, they have, Eskimos and Aborigines, in their own countries, share like a culture, I guess, that's an old culture in the same location--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that they've enjoyed for a long period of time.
Speaker 2: Yes, but, you know, before those, (unclear) the history for the Australians before them, and when the Europeans came, you know, they hunted them down like animals.  That was a sport, just like animals.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard that there's a real ugly side to the conquest of Australia, that's never (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.  And it's very sad because the, I mean Great Britain sent their convicts over there, and that was one of the penal colonies, and that's how the people start--started from there.  And the Australian Aborigines are, just, just, were just terrible.
Story_ID: 69371
Speaker 1: But I can't think of any other country or people who have not done equally bad things.  In fact, even in the United States, we talk about slavery, I mean blacks had slaves in the United States too.  We don't like to talk about it, but blacks owned slaves.
Speaker 2: You're talking about in the--
Speaker 1: Huh?  In the United States.
Speaker 2: Louisiana and North Carolina and (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes.  You know, and as far as reparations are concerned, that's often will come up about that too.  I once heard a story about an African American who went to Senegal quite a few years ago.  And he happened into a man out in the bush, and he was talking about, he said, you know, how slavery, how horrible it was and everything else to us.  And this native looked at this American and said, I wish my ancestors had been slaves in the United States.  He said, I wouldn't be here in this country.
Speaker 2: He didn't like Senegal very much, I guess.
Speaker 1: He said, you're lucky, but (laughter) we don't like to say that, but it's true.  We're the lucky ones, and as tragic as it was, when you think, inhumanity to others, in many other countries, are major problems.
Story_ID: 69372
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what about eugenics, you've written about eugenics.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is that and what's the problem with it?
Speaker 2: Well, there're so-called positive eugenics and negative eugenics.  Positive eugenics is to encourage the propagation of certain peoples, usually, of your own, you know (laughter) no matter who they are, you see.  And negative eugenics is to discourage the birth or propagation of peoples.  And in many days, in many, many, many years and years and years ago, it was quite fashionable to think of other people who were less, unfortunate, to say that they should be, not live or, you know, that they should not propagate.  And the strongest movements, actually, some of them have been, we think of Nazi Germany, but also in the United States.  The American eugenics law that was passed in the United States around 1926 or so.  There was modeled sterilization law against those who were blind, deaf, psychosis and many, many others.  This modeled sterilization law, it was passed in the United States.
Speaker 1: Was it in one of the states or was it--
Speaker 2: No, it was a federal, no, the Model Sterilization Law, and then [Adolf] Hitler saw this, and he applied this to his problems against Jews in Germany.
Speaker 1: Now, when was the U.S. law written?
Speaker 2: 1926, Model Sterilization Law, and then eventually--well, it sort of, it was never federalized.  It was state, but at least thirty states had these laws.  And about ten still have them, still have them.  And so--
Speaker 1: These laws are making it possible for government to--
Speaker 2: For the government to sterilize--
Speaker 1: --sterilize you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right, the blind, deaf or very psychosis, manic psychosis or what have, alcoholism, what have you, you see.
Speaker 1: There was a lot of latitude in it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, there was a lot of latitude, you know.  And so this was done.  But the ten, but and then around 1927, '28 [1928], there's a famous ruling called 'Buck v. Bell' in which these laws were recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court.  And the Justice [Charles Evans] Hughes, it was Justice Hughes then, was a fervent, was a firm Eugenicist himself. And this, there was a woman who was, had a child who was supposedly mentally defective, supposedly defective, and this woman, she, the group said, well, we'll have to sterilize her, and they sterilized her.  And the ruling was that enough.  And this, it was later learned that this child, that her child was not mentally defective and, but this was the ruling of 'Buck v. Bell.'  And that was, that is a model for, and it's still on the courts today.  And even if the states do not have such laws, one can be sterilized and quoting the ruling of 'Buck v. Bell.'
Story_ID: 69373
Speaker 1: So eugenics has been around for a very long time.  It was coined by Galton (ph.), Sir Francis Galton, (unclear) at the Galton Laboratory.  He founded the Galton Laboratory.  (unclear)  But eugenics has been in our history, I mean since the times of the Greeks.  The Greeks, those who were disadvantaged or deformed and what have you, they would take them out and kill them.  So Eugenics has been for a very long time.  And I, and there are many, many countries that have them, and some of the worse Eugenics laws were in the Scandinavian countries of all the countries, when you think that are most knowledgeable and what have you and quite, so-called civilized because of their healthcare system.  They said, well, if we have too many disadvantaged children or deformed, what have you, that will compromise our healthcare system.  And so some very severe Eugenics laws were passed in the Scandinavian countries too.
Speaker 2: And are they still--they've probably been repealed by now?
Speaker 1: No, most of them have been repealed in most of Europe, but not in the United States, but not in the United States.
Speaker 2: The laws are still on the books.  They just never really (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yes, but then interestingly enough, during the Nuremberg trials, for Nazis, our jurists were there, and there were jurists there, and they made the Germans to abolish the sterilization laws in Germany.  But the same jurists came back to the United States and said nothing about our own sterilization laws which had been modeled by Nazi Germany, for Nazi, Germany.
Speaker 2: That's incredible.
Story_ID: 69374
Speaker 1: Tell me about, now one of the most famous Eugenicists of the past few years, I guess twenty or thirty years ago, a guy named William Shockley came up.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: He became famous for his theories on what to do with black people in the United States.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.  Yes, he was a very, very famous scientist.  In fact, he was the discoverer of the transistor too, oh, yes, very famous man.  But, and no, he was, you know, he was one, and he believed that, you know, that the people who are so-called inferior, you know, should be done away with.  He was very open, very open about it, very open about it.  IQ and everything else, low IQ, you should not be able to propagate.
Speaker 1: And he probably wasn't speaking a lot in front of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: I said, he probably didn't speak a lot in front of black groups, I imagine--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --I mean these theories were probably at scientific gatherings where most of the people were like him (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, I don't know.  You know, there's some people who are very, you know, scientific, educated and what have you, and there're racists amongst all of us, you know (laughter).  Just because you are a scientist does not necessarily mean that you are not also a racist.  It's very sad, very sad.
Story_ID: 69375
Speaker 1: What did you think about that?  You know, he was engaged in a couple of debates.  I think Dr. [Frances Cress] Welsing who's a psychiatrist from Chicago, engaged him in a debate on television once.  I mean did you, what do you think of all that?
Speaker 2: Well, it's, you know, tragic, and I feel sorry for somebody like that too, I mean, who hates others and things like that because people who are disadvantaged, of all peoples, and there are many, many disorders and what have you in which, of course, that, I mean some are inherited and some are not.  And you think, for example, of manic depressive bipolar psychosis.  There is this study that was done by Redfield [Kay Redfield Jamison] from Johns Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland] Jamison, and she has manic depressive psychosis herself, and she wrote a study in which she showed about thirty to forty percent of artists have bipolar manic depressive and they're able to operate.  And actually, they do their best work during their manic phase, manic phase.  And she, herself, has it and she wrote it about.  And she was recruited from UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] to Johns Hopkins and the department, and the chairman of the Department of Psychiatry who is just a wonderful person.  And she told him, you know, I have manic depressive psychosis.  So he said, so what?  He said, of course, we'll hire you.  That's the reason.  He said because if we were to get rid of all in all faculty who had manic depressive psychosis, we'd lose some of our best faculty (laughter).  And so, you know, when we think of schizophrenia and manic depressive illness and what have you and want to eliminate themselves, oftentimes, we can look, sometimes we would look into our own selves in many things, our own families and we'd find ourselves eliminating ourself or members of our own family.  I mean who knows?
Story_ID: 69376
Speaker 1: So you--did you--go ahead.
Speaker 2: Downs, children who have Downs Syndrome, you know, so-called mongolism, which is not a good term to use.  It's called Downs Syndrome where children are born, and they have a short life expectancy and as far as their IQs are usually subnormal or what have you.  And someone said, well, I don't know of anyone who has Downs Syndrome who started a revolution or has gone after killing people like those of us who are so-called "normal" because once we begin to look at things like this among people, it's different than to eliminate themselves.  I mean we are in a very, very sad society.  As Professor Penrose, who taught me many years ago, he was utmost against Eugenics, even though he was a Galton [Laboratory] professor at the University of College, London, and he said that "I would rather live in an imperfect society than a perfect society."
Speaker 1: Well why is that?  Why would somebody say that cause don't people idealize a perfect world where everybody is--
Speaker 2: Of course, but--
Speaker 1: --a Baptist or a Muslim or--(laughter) whatever they want--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --they think they need to be or, you know, (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Everybody wants the, you know, the big perfect world, and, you know, some want us to be Christians.  They want us to be Muslims, Hindus and what have you.  Oh, no, but there's no such thing as a perfect world.  And, in fact, if we look at the history of religions, I mean some of the worst atrocities have been done by so-called religious people.
Speaker 1: In trying to make that perfect world, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, a perfect world, perfect world, but which is no such thing.  And any time, (unclear).
Story_ID: 69377
Speaker 1: I'll never forget that I was in a--I'm not religious as you can possibly tell.  And I often, from what I've seen of people in other parts of the world, is that many of those who believe that there's an afterlife and (unclear) and other people who are quite religious throughout history, have killed other people to send them a so-called afterlife, don't have much respect for life on earth.  And so I believe that this is it.  And that you must do the best that you can while you're here because there are no chances afterward, with afterlife.  And I can live with that, but when I think of the inquisition and what happened and throughout history, you see some horrible things.  It's very difficult to talk to--and I've seen many people who only talk to God.  So you can't argue with them.  This is it.  Well, God tells me to do it.  Well, what can you say to that (laughter).  Well, what, that is, that is a what can you say to that?  And it's, and it's very sad.  It's very, very sad.  I'll never forget, I was in a missionary school in Ethiopia many years ago.  And the students were rioting all over the country.  And their school was closed, and it was a American mission, Baptist, that came.  He was the head of the school, and he said, "I don't know why these children are rioting around here."  He said, "after all, if they're out there rioting, they are not able, are not reading and studying the bible."  And he said, "and the only thing that we're trying to teach them is the bible because there's no hope for them, that we teach the bible and that is it."  He said, "cause there's no hope for them, and we're trying to make them live in the next world, not in this world."  I mean he said to me, and I said to him, I said, "no wonder your students are rioting."  And I went to a mission school, a Norwegian--the next day--mission, and the students were there.  They were not on strike.  They came up to see us.  What are you doing, what are you doing, asking all sorts of questions and what have you.  And I was with them for two days, and I never heard the word, God.  And they were studying agriculture, engineering, farming.  Some were studying mathematics and other things.  Now, that was a mission.  I mean that was the type of work, and these were the Norwegians, but the others--very sad.

Speaker 1: What do you think about, you know, there's a lot of controversy today over genetic experimentation and so forth, you know, and religion is often brought in--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, oh, yes, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And we shouldn't tamper (unclear), I mean as it's been brought up in the past, why (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: But what do you think about some of this?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I think science will go on.  Discoveries are being made every day, and to those who would say that, I would say, okay.  Let us get rid of the wheel.
Speaker 1: The simple basic--
Speaker 2: The wheel.  I said, now, whoever discovered the wheel, let's get rid of the wheel because look at the harm that the wheel has done throughout history.  And I say, well, will you get rid of the wheel?  Oh, no, we can't.  I said, but whoever discovered the wheel did not know what the full potential would be of the wheel.  A simple wheel has probably killed more people (laughter), of many other discoveries, but, no.  So I don't believe that we should--and we cannot stop discovery because a person discovers something in one part of the world, and oftentimes, we do not know the full implications of what we've done.  And somebody else takes it on and does it for good or for harm, but that's the way it is.  And there have been attempts in the United States to do this, but there're quite a few scientists who have left the United States to go to other countries.  And we are arrogant to say that if we stop something it'll be not done somewhere else.  In Nazi Germany many of our, some of their best scientists came to the United States because they could not do their work in a free environment.
Speaker 1: [Albert] Einstein and Ober--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: All of them come here, you know.  And I mean, Germany, all of them came here and look at what treasure they had, they did for us.  And so if we're going to stop something here, you can't do it.  So it will be done and it will be done, not here, but elsewhere.  And I don't think that politics or religion or any other "ism" like that should, but it will.  It has throughout history, to say well, we're going to stop scientific discovery.  They can't do it.  I mean the church, you know, banned Galileo [Galilei] and finally, the Catholic church has just recently admitted that they were wrong about Galileo.  And so throughout history, we've tried, theologians, presidents, dictators and what have you, have tried to stop discovery.  And it will go on and there's nothing, but we must be able to live with our discoveries too, yes.  But, no.  I do not--religion should control or politics, and a lot of it is politics too.

Speaker 1: Okay, you had a story about Joycelyn Elders?
Speaker 2: Yes, Joycelyn Elders.  I introduced her several years ago at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] for a Martin Luther (King?) lecture.  And I'll never forget I read, before I met her, she made a statement about the Right to Life movement.  And she said, "Well," she said, "They have a love affair with fetuses, but after they're born, they don't give a damn about them." (laughter)  Now she was very (laughter) outspoken.  She said, those who do that oftentimes vote against welfare and everything else.  And the important thing is you have to look at what is important.  And I respected her for that.
Story_ID: 69380
Speaker 1: And a lot of the dispute today for embryo--stem cell research is mostly religious.  But as far as I'm concerned, and there's no doubt that one day it is hoped that this research will cure many diseases that we cannot do anything about.  And so, as far as I'm concerned, manipulating an embryo or stem cells, if that leads to the cure of Parkinson's Disease and others, to my way of thinking, I mean I would encourage it.  I mean that's my personal opinion.
Speaker 2: Is most of the opposition that we hear, like more political bluster than actual enforcement of stopping--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --people from doing this research or?
Speaker 1: Yes, I suppose, I suppose so.  I suppose so.  It's politics and religion mostly.  And it's very difficult to say, you know, because many of those who aspire for office are looking at their constituents.  I mean how can I get elected?  I would bet that deep down if they had a child or if they themselves had a particular disease could--that could be treated through embryo research or what have you, that they more than likely, way deep down, they would say, okay, yes, as far as I'm concerned.  But I mean it's very dangerous for us to be, what would you say, how should I say, to be very polite about the whole thing.  But religion and politics have their own interests.  And fine, but as far as I'm concerned, I would not, I would not, I would not--I mean I think it would be absolutely disgraceful if we were to ban these potential scientific discoveries and the applications, at least we hope, would be tremendous.
Story_ID: 69381
Speaker 1: What do you see as the future of, the future gains from genetic research?  You just talked about some of them, but what do you project--?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a very good question.  And I, if I could answer your question definitively, I'd be on my way to Stockholm [Sweden] for the Nobel Prize (laughter) because one of the things that we, at least I like to say about scientific discovery, hence many years (unclear).  We cannot predict the future.  I mean look back on the many fantastic discoveries that have been done in the past.  Many of these things just could not be predicted.  Many were accidental.  [Alexander] Fleming, he was actually a discoverer of penicillin.  I mean it was accidental.  He had a mold in a plate.  It was penicillin (unclear) nordicum and he looked at it, and he accidentally, it accidentally was contaminated a growth of the staphylococcus bacteria.  And he happened to look at it, and the bacteria had gone, the growth had been gone.  And it was only, the only thing left was penicillin.  And right then, he said, Ah ha, maybe.  And then later on someone isolated this (unclear) penicillin, but it was strictly by hypen--happenstance.
Speaker 1: Had he been a better housekeeper, he wouldn't have--
Speaker 2: Hah?
Speaker 1: Had he been a better housekeeper, he may not have discovered it.
Speaker 2: Of course, of course, of course.  And so discoveries are made every day by somebody, and all of a sudden, we say, "ah, ha", and somebody else comes along and makes an application of this discovery.  And oftentimes the person who makes the discovery, as I mentioned before, does not know the full consequences of his discovery.
Speaker 1: Like the wheel.
Speaker 2: Yes, as I mentioned, the wheel.
Speaker 1: Maybe I should rephrase the question.  Maybe I should say, what do you--not what do you predict in terms of what may come, but what do you see, what do you know about what's being developed that the average person does not know about in terms of genetic research that's--
Speaker 2: I couldn't say that because it's very difficult because the nice thing about it is, we have radio, we have TV and we have the Tuesday edition of 'The New York Times.'  And things come out before they get into the scientific journals.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: There are some wonderful things being done.  That, actually, my granddaughter [Laura Jarrett], many, many years ago--not too many years ago, and when Dolly, the sheep came out.  And I heard, read about it and read about everything else, and I was taking my granddaughter to school.  And I said, "Did you hear about Dolly and what have you?"  She said, "Oh, yes, we had it in our class" (laughter).  And she'd been, outlined how it was done and everything in a beautiful lecture (laughter) about Dolly.  And she was a, when was it?  About ten years ago.  She's sixteen years old now, and she knew all about it, explained it beautifully.  And that's the wonderful thing about today, and in this day and time, is information is not cloistered.
Story_ID: 69382
Speaker 1: Is there some potential benefit of genetic research that you would like to see happen in the future, some potential benefit, you know?  I know you mentioned the eradication of certain diseases.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, I mean I believe that, I think that cancer will be a disease of the past one day.  I mean there's spectacular things going on, it's not--not only the cures, but prevention also too.  There's tremendous amount of research going on this.  One of the books that I will not write will be called 'The Death of Death' in which people will no longer die.
Speaker 1: Well, not--
Speaker 2: Other, through, other by accident in our own crazy things that many of these diseases will be completely prevented or eradicated.  And then, of course, if we have the death of death, what kind of world would this be without death?
Speaker 1: Crowded, I guess.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  But we're being philosophical about it (laughter).  But one of these days, it'll happen other than by accident and murder and our own inhumanity to each other.  It will happen, yes.  And I think that that will be that we will, I mean after all, in my day and time, you know, there are many diseases have been eradicated, polio, small pox--of course, they may come back, you know, what have you and all of that, but there are things that would happen like that.  I did--have a, I saw smallpox in Iran, several cases of it, but you don't see it today.  And so why can't we conquer all of these other things too.
Story_ID: 69383
Speaker 1: Okay, let me switch gears a little bit and ask you what are your hopes and concerns about the black community?
Speaker 2: I think that if we can do something about education, poverty, our disgraceful healthcare system, all of those things, even amongst blacks, but poor whites too.  I mean some of these things are almost disgraceful in these United States, when we look at some of the Scandinavian countries or look at the health care system in France, for example, example
Speaker 1: You would be in favor of socialized medicine?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I don't look at that as a dirty word, no.  I think one of these days, we will have some form of generalized health service.  Whether you wanna call it socialized or what have you, it makes no difference whatsoever.  But I think that health is, it should be, in a country like ours, it should be a right.  And that doesn't mean that just because healthcare, it's gonna eradicate disease or problems because many of these things are environment, how we live, how we eat.  Poverty is the worst disease of all, but I would hope that--now, as far as African Americans are concerned, I think that progress has been.  I mean over, when I look, in my lifetime or the last twenty years, there are many things that have happened.  Those of us who are, as to be fortunate are, have access to some of the best schools, universities.  When I look in business, the leaders in business, look at American Express, AOL [America Online], when we think of other large companies, African Americans, you find them everywhere.  And I think that with education that many of these problems that we look upon today will be ameliorated, but as long as we look different, people are going to act different.  And that's the way the world is.  I mean I think that if he had wanted to be, I think that our Secretary of State, Powell [General Colin Powell, HM] could very well have been the President of the United States.  He elected not to go that route.  Well, that had been unheard of ten years ago.  I mean I, so I have great hope.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 69384
Speaker 1: Sir, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, the best thing I ever did in my life was to marry my wife, Barbara [Barbara Bowman, HM].  The next thing, my daughter, Valerie Jarrett [HM] and we are responsible, indirectly, for our granddaughter [Laura Jarrett].  And I think, as far as I'm concerned, that's the best legacy I can leave or have left.  I can think of discoveries and things like that, but they come and go and what have you.  But I think that's the most important thing, our family.
Story_ID: 69385
Speaker 1: Why do you think family is so important?
Speaker 2: It's necessary, and we're here because of family (laughter), and it's the future, I hope, (laughter) yes.
Speaker 1: That seems like a good answer for a geneticist.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: Did your, what did your father [James E. Bowman] think of your work when he was alive, your parents?
Speaker 2: Well, he died, he died in 1955, around 1955.  And I'd finished medicine, and I was starting off--no, it was nineteen fifty--around 1954.  And he was--
Speaker 1: You were still in (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --that I'm finished, you know, I was studying, coming along and what have you.  And he was, you know, he was very pleased that I was a pathologist and what have you.  And he was a dentist, and he was, I saw him two weeks before he died.  I saw him in Washington, D.C., and he showed me that he had a gun.  And I said, why do you have that gun?  And he said, somebody might come here and try to rob me.  I said, but, more than likely, they'll be young, and they'll take it away from you.  I said, why don't you throw it away?  He said, oh, no, I need it.  Two weeks later, a man and woman came to his office, and they were looking for drugs.  And he pulled his gun, and they had a toy gun.  He didn't know that.  They pulled the gun, took it away from him and killed him with his own gun.  And later they found that, a toy gun that was discarded outside, very sad.
Speaker 1: It is.  How old was he?
Speaker 2: Oh, God, he was about in his late sixties, yes.  He was still practicing medicine, I mean dentistry.
Speaker 1: And was your mother [Dorothy Bowman] still alive then?
Speaker 2: No, no, she was dead long before.  She died of hypertension quite a few years ago.
Story_ID: 69386
Speaker 1: Now, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  I think somebody else will have to write that (laughter), yes.  No, I wouldn't deign to do that.  I mean I've written things.  I've made, you know, discoveries and written books and what have you.  But I think that's for somebody else to do that.  Not me.
Speaker 1: Is there something--
Speaker 2: But I think a most important one recently, as I said, when we had, I was honored by the Shiraz University Association.  And I met many of my former students who are now professors all over the United States and doing very well.  Many of them came to me and said how they remembered me and my lectures and the influence I had on them.  And I think that's the best legacy, or that is, as my students, my former students, be they in Iran or at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess--
Speaker 2: I think that's the best, because I remember some of my old, you know, old professors, you know, and really I can see them right now, who I thought a lot of, yes.
Story_ID: 69387
Speaker 1: It seems like that would be a special feeling--
Speaker 2: Hah?
Speaker 1: I mean it seems like it would be, I mean it's a special thing it seems to me that you could be, you know, born in Washington, D.C. and raised here in the U.S. [United States] and then go over to Iran and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and teach people and make a contribution in some other part of the world--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --when in this country, people like you were, you know, were discriminated against.  And that in that sense, it must have a special meaning for you to be able to do that.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, very much so.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, it was a good part of our life and we, the friends who are friends are still our friends.  After the revolution, they're still our close friends, and I've seen them in Iran and we see them all over the United States.  And my wife [Barbara Bowman] and I plan to go back next year.  In the Shiraz University Alumni Association, many of them are going back to Iran to lecture all over the country.  And no matter what you might hear about the regime and what have you, quite a few of my Iranian friends are being invited back to work there and do research.  A very close friend of mine who founded the blood banking service in Iran, and then he had to leave the country during the time when the Ayatollah Khomeini, he was chased out of the country.  He had to leave.  And he went to Birmingham in England and started the National Trans- Service there, trans-infusion service there.  And he has been invited now to go back and forth to Iran and do research and help them out.  And he was the son of a former prime minister and minister of court.  And he almost lost his life, but now they've recognized that many Iranians who were there who are in Europe or in the United States are doing things and they want many of them to come back and work there again.
Story_ID: 69388
Speaker 1: Would you have, do you have any advice maybe for young people that want to pursue a career in medicine today?
Speaker 2: Well, just don't listen to everybody.  Do what you want to do and take a chance.  And don't be afraid to take a chance because you will be surprised more than likely that you can do it, yes.  Take a chance.  We did it.  My wife [Barbara Bowman, HM] had marvelous experiences in Iran, and a lot of the work that she did there led to be appointed the President of the Erickson Institute in the United States because when it was, as she told you, when she was there, she did many things in Iran.  She taught at the School of Nursing, psychology, in the medical school, psychology.  She did, she worked with the American Joint Distribution Committee in Iran which is a American Jewish Committee there in Iran, with their pre-school education there.  And so she learned many things while she was there in Iran living.  And everywhere she has gone, she has looked at daycare and problems all over the world.  And she has been invited, well, she knows she's, we've already been invited.  You know, she's been invited all over to many countries to lecture and to work too.  She's worked in China.  She's been in Czechoslovakia, to Poland.  We're going to Ireland in a couple days.  She's been invited there to lecture, and many of the things that she lectures are about daycare, childcare, international problems.  So she's an internationalist herself for traveling.
Speaker 1: Well, I thank you, very much.  It's been a terrific interview.
Speaker 2: Thank you, very much, thank you very much (unclear).

Speaker 1: This is a picture that was taken around 19--I suppose around '56' [1956] or so.  It's a house that we lived in Shiraz, Iran on an Nemanzee, N-E-M-A-N-Z-E-E [sic., Namazi], Hospital in Shiraz, Iran, and that was house.  It is very modern.  It had all of the, anything that you wanted to live in.  It was very comfortable, and that's house that--
Speaker 2: How do you spell Shiraz?
Speaker 1: S-H-I-R-A-Z, Shiraz, Iran.  That was the house we lived in.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of one of my closest friends.  His name is Narcey, N-A-R-C-E-Y, Firouz, F-I-R-O-U-Z.  And he's in front, and he is being greeted by the Governor General of Shiraz and I'm in the background.  And we had just won the Shiraz Doubles championships in Shiraz.  And that was around 1959.  Unfortunately, Narcey Firouz is now dead.  He's a graduate of Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], the University of Wisconsin [Madison, Wisconsin], one of our closest friends.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.

Speaker 2: Great, thank you.  Next.
Speaker 1: Oh, that is a picture of many years ago in Nigeria.  We had, there was an International Congress in Nigeria, but I think, yes, that's in Nigeria, and there're quite a few people there.  There's Louis Sullivan, who was former Secretary of Health and Human Service.  There's David Satcher right next to him, the former Surgeon General of the United States.  That's Roland Scott who was one of my professors at Howard University, and there are quite a few others.  There's me and Maurice Rabb and others in that picture.  That was in Nigeria quite a few years ago, around, oh, it must have been the 1970s.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 2: Great, next.
Speaker 1: Ah, now, there's a picture of me many, many years ago, and I'm trying to remember how many years ago (laughter), probably, it was probably, I was in my early twenties then.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: And that was a picture, of course, of my--excuse me.
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: That was taken of my wife, Barbara, in 1950 in her wedding dress.
