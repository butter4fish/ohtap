Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Ancestors on my mother side, well I can't go much further back of course then her father and her mother.  Now her mother was a very civic minded person who was quite active in her community.  Her work was always in the business area; she was always like the maid in that department stores downtown.  She acted as the maid in the department stores downtown.
Speaker 1: In Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: In Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was with Regenstein's [Atlanta, Georgia] and at times she would work privately in the home of the Regenstein's; that's what my grandmother, my mother's mother did.  Now her father was to me an unusual person because he was a contractor.  He built houses; he built the house that we all lived in. What was so amazing to me about it was nobody's been to school to learn how to build houses. He just built houses.  And in the same neighborhood where I live, there are at least three or four houses that I can point to that my grandfather built and that's what he did.
Speaker 1: Now what were your grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: Her name was Nellie Bryant, that's my grandmother; my mother's mother, Nellie.  And her husband was named Henry Bryant.
Speaker 1: And there's no--you don't have any--there aren't any stories passed down in the family as to where they came from or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, except it was just a little small town in Alabama that I--the name of the town that I gave you but I don't have any history on them in that town.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you don't know how your grandfather learned how to build houses or anything?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Okay, now any other any stories passed down through the family about (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About either one of them?
Speaker 1: Yeah, about their lives and, and things that they did?
Speaker 2: This is one outstanding story about my grandfather, and that is he was a good builder and as I said today there are several homes in that neighborhood that he built. But he had a sort of a tragic life ending.  He had escorted some people who came to visit with them back to the trolley line, streetcars and somehow or another involved in helping the people to getting on and off the streetcars.  The streetcar ran over him and drug him for several blocks; he was killed by the streetcar.  And of course, my grandmother received some kind of compensation from the trolley company, what I don't know.  But that's, that's the only story that I know about my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On my mother's side.
Story_ID: 306723
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Stella Bryant Smith] talk about growing up and what life was like for her here?  Now she grew up here in Atlanta [Georgia], right?
Speaker 2: Yes she did; she grew up in Atlanta and went to school in Atlanta.  And my mother--and went to the public school system here in Atlanta, Georgia.  And she had what you call a normal college education; a two-year college education.  And after finishing that normal college, she taught school for a while.  And then of course, when she married my father [Harvey Smith] she became a housewife.  And of course, she worked as a secretary in Atlanta Life Insurance Company [Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia], and that's what she did.  And of course, the family moved from Atlanta, Georgia to Albany, Georgia where my father became the pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church [Mount Zion First Baptist Church, Albany, Georgia].  And when he moved to Albany my mother continued her school work; she went back to teaching school again.  So that's what I've known about her; she was a housewife, a schoolteacher, and she was employed as the Atlanta Life Insurance company.
Speaker 1: Okay do, you know, where she went to high school here in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: I don't know the name of the high school I don't remember that  (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or the normal school?
Speaker 2: I don't know what it could've been at that time because I can--my memory goes back to Washington High [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia] and David T. Howard High School [Atlanta, Georgia], and she never mentioned neither of those.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't know about high school education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 306724
Speaker 1: Well can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Harvey H-A-R-V-E-Y, M-I-L-E-S Miles, Smith S-M-I-T-H.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I can't give him--my daddy's date of birth.
Speaker 1: Now on your, your parents--can, can you give us an approximate, you know, about how old were they when you were born do you think?
Speaker 2: When I was born?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When I was born (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were born in 1922.
Speaker 2: When my daddy--when my daddy dad died he was fifty-nine (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: And I--when he died I was like twenty-three, when he died so.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I suspect my daddy might have been forty, forty years old when--. When he died he was fifty-nine, and I was as I say about that time about twenty-three years old.
Speaker 1: So that's 1955.
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so he would've been born in 1896.
Speaker 2: Something maybe.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: I got all of that in my little family history thing that I brought with me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's born about 1896.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Crawford, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, Crawford, Georgia. Is that close to Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No, to Athens, Georgia. It's three, three hours from here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's a good way from here?
Speaker 2: Yes a good little piece.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side? How far back can you trace those ancestors?
Speaker 2: I can only go back onto my daddy's mother [Lizzie Smith] and father and then to his grandmother on his mother's side.  We called her Granny Kate [ph.]; that's as far back as I can get with the ladies.  Now on my grandfather--my daddy's daddy, he was a Henry too, Henry Smith. But he was a minister too; he was a minister. Dr. Henry Smith, was a minister.  And he pastored in Crawford and Crawfordville, Georgia, Crawford and Crawfordville, Georgia (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are they close to each other (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah they're pretty close to each other (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are they?
Speaker 2: They're pretty close to each other, yes, and he pastored.  He lived in Crawford, and he pastored both places, Crawford and Crawfordville.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was Reverend Henry Smith?
Speaker 2: He was Reverend Henry Smith.
Speaker 1: All right and your father was Reverend Harvey Miles Smith?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 306725
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that are passed down through your father's [Harvey Smith] side of the family about life during the time of Reverend Henry Smith or, or before (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really. If so, I just know that my father's father was very friendly with Dr. King's wife [Alberta Williams King]--yes Dr. King's wife's father was a minister.  Dr. King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], I'm talking about Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] daddy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His daddy's wife's father was a minister, A.D. Williams. And my grandfather, A.D. Williams were very close.  My grandfather, my daddy's daddy and A.D. Williams were very close, and A.D. Williams was Reverend King's wife's daddy.
Speaker 1: Right and he lived just, just two doors from here, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That's right, right here on Auburn Avenue [Atlanta, Georgia]; we're 515 now, and it's like right down the street.  Does he have any stories about Reverend Williams?  Now Reverend A.D. Williams had a pretty big church, right?
Speaker 2: Yes he was, and he was quite a person, I hear about him, he was quite a person.  And of course, Daddy King we all called him Martin's daddy and Daddy King, of course, married into the family. You know it was a big thing because A.D. Williams was such a big person.  I never knew A.D. Williams, course I knew Daddy King very well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you know him before he changed his name to Martin?
Speaker 2: Let's see now, now Martin Luther King (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When he was Michael King?
Speaker 2: --the civil rights leader that we're talking about; I'm talking about his daddy--
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: --when I say Daddy, Daddy King (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know.
Speaker 2: Now you're asking me did I know (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you know him before he changed his name to Martin?
Speaker 2: No I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, he changed, he changed both their names (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He did?
Speaker 1: His name was Michael King.
Speaker 2: Oh I see.  Oh, see I didn't know.
Speaker 1: He went to visit the sites of Martin Luther and then he decided to change his name so Martin Luther.
Speaker 2: Oh I see.
Speaker 1: Sometime in the '50s [1950S] there, you know.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm. I didn't know anything about that at all.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay but, okay so, so you--what did--was your father a, a Baptist (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Baptist, my daddy, he was a Baptist minister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: And what, what church did he pastor (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay my daddy--the church of--he first--when I first knew him as a youngster, he was pastoring a church in Charlotte, North Carolina.  And of course from Charlotte, North Carolina he moved to one or two places but where I really--where I really learned my daddy and spent a lot of time with my father when he became pastor of the Mount Zion First Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia.  And '30 [1930], that was probably like in 1930 yeah when he became pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I-that, that was my teenage years when I was growing up. Because I was--I finished high school [at Georgia Normal and Agricultural College; Albany State University] in Albany, Georgia in 1939.  And those were the developmental years of my life when I can remember my daddy the most.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 306726
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents [Stella Bryant Smith and Harvey Smith] met?
Speaker 2: How they met, if so I don't know, except that my father was a student at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And my mother was at, at-in, in some institution at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], my mother was. And they met like that because they were next door to each other in school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Do you know what year they got married?
Speaker 2: The year they got married--no I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 306727
Speaker 1: There are no stories passed down that you remember through your--about your father's [Harvey Smith] career as a pastor?  'Cause I know in the black community the pastor has to handle a lot of difficult situations a lot of times.
Speaker 2: Okay my daddy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: And my father also pastored a church in, in Georgia, out of Athens, Georgia.  Cannot remember the name of it right now, but he was pastoring a church out of Athens, Georgia.  And one of the deacons in the church passed, and they had decided to have his funeral on a given day, say like maybe the week that they were gonna have his funeral.  Now his boss, his boss man that he worked for, the people, the white people that he worked for, said, "Naw, we want his funeral to be on Sunday."  This is a story that I hear, the biggest story I hear about my daddy.  They want his funeral to be on Sunday, and my daddy said, "No it ain't gone be on Sunday.  It's gone be in the week when we set it," and they had in the week.  But after the funeral, they came to my daddy's house and carried him out to the woods and almost whipped him to death.  That's the story that I remember about my daddy that Dr. Martin Luther King's daddy [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], Daddy King told me that story.  That's how I got that, so that's the story that I really remember most highlights with me about my daddy.
Speaker 1: Your father never talked about that?
Speaker 2: Never, neither did my mother [Stella Bryant Smith]; neither one. It was just the people that told me about it. Daddy King told me about it.
Speaker 1: This is the kind of story that kinda dramatizes why we had to change things.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, work for change.  So the, the people he worked for didn't want the funeral during the week 'cause they didn't want the people to be off, right?  They wanted them to work.
Speaker 2: Well that possibly could have been it. I don't know why they did why they didn't want (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was thinking that might be the reason 'cause why else would they have a funeral--if they have it on a Sunday nobody have to miss work.
Speaker 2: That's right that's right that's probably--I don't know what the reason was, but that's probably what really happened.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's something that's something that's quite a story but did, did he stay there in Athens?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't. My father left there and pastored in Spartanburg, South Carolina; he was kind of freelancing from one church to another for a while.
Story_ID: 306728
Speaker 1: And that's when he [Smith's father, Harvey Smith] and my mother [Stella Bryant Smith] were actually separate, separated at the time.  When he was moving about. And it was some ministers in Atlanta [Georgia]. Reverend Miller [ph.] and one or two other guys got with my father.  And told my daddy, said, "We can get you a church, a good church in South Georgia, in Albany [Georgia].  But you gotta, you got to promise us that you'll get back with Stella."  And that was my mother. "And you'll take Stella and the children to Albany, and y'all to get together again."  So that's how we got together and went to Albany (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh I'm saying--that's, that's an interesting story.  The other pastors got together and put some pressure on him (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yeah, yeah the other preachers got together, told him, "We get you the church, but you got to go back to Stella."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I guess things worked out?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, oh yes. We stayed there in Albany, Georgia. My father pastored there had a good, good pastorship I guess I can--the only word I know to use.  And of course, my daddy was a hard preacher back in those days when you preach three, three sermons on the first Sunday.  And my daddy was not one of those stand-up lecturers. He was back and forth across the pulpit jumping up and all that.  But he had a, had a stroke yes he had a stroke, and it was bad. It affected his speech.  So he was unable to continue to preach, so one of the deacons took him into his home.  And he lived with Deacon Stroud and Mrs. Stroud for years, so the church continued to support him. But at the end of that time, they had to release him.  So when he was released from the church and had no church, paralyzed hardly able to speak he came back to Atlanta to live with my mother with her mother [Nellie Bryant]; with my mother with her mother who was a lady that was a maid in Regenstein's [Atlanta, Georgia] Peachtree Street stores.  And he came back to live there, then he became ill to the point that, he was a veteran, so he went to Tuskegee Hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System-East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama]. That's where he died, at Tuskegee's hospital.
Story_ID: 306729
Speaker 1: Okay, so he [Smith's father, Harvey Smith] was a World War I [WWI] vet?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: So did, did he ever tell you any stories of the war?
Speaker 2: Never did, never even talked about it.
Speaker 1: Where he went--did, did he go overseas?
Speaker 2: He never talked to me about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did, did he talk about much to you at all about anything? Did, did he ever--?
Speaker 2: He, he talked to me about--early in life he was--start talking to me about fraternities.  I don't know why he talked to me, but my father happened to have been one of the founders, one of the founders or the beginners of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  I was over there a year ago; me and Clinton Warner [HistoryMaker Dr. Clinton Warner] as sons of two of the founders of Psi chapter at Morehouse College. My father was one of them.  And early in high school, he would always sit me down and talk to me about, "When you go to college you got to be a Que." He just talked to me about the fraternity.  Hardly nothing else did he talked to me about except the fraternity.  And he often talked to me about what it was that I wanted to do in life.  What was I gonna do, was I gonna preach or what you know and, of course, I let him know real early in life that I wanted to be a dentist.
Story_ID: 306730
Speaker 1: I had of role model in Albany [Georgia], meaning somebody that I had met that had influenced me a lot.
Speaker 2: Who was that?
Speaker 1: Dr. Joseph Ellis.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the story behind me being influenced by Dr. Ellis.  In Albany, Georgia I had a paper route I used to--on the weekends, and I would sell Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], Chicago Defender, Norfolk Journal and Guide [New Journal and Guide], Atlanta Daily World. It would all come to Albany on the train, and I'd picked 'em up and sell 'em.  And this particular weekend, I would go of course to the black community, they're black papers.  And I would go to well in Albany they called it Harlem.  And back in those old days back there these little fraternal groups would build buildings; like for instance, the all black for instance, in Atlanta, Georgia, the Odd Fellows Building [Odd Fellows Building and Auditorium, Atlanta, Georgia], and in Albany it was the Supreme Circle building.  So if you go in there, that's where you find all the black professions.  Well, so I went in there one day to sell some papers, and I walked in and knocked on the door.  Lady came to the door, dressed professional like with a white uniform on so and I was trying to see if I could get them to subscribe to my paper.  While I was standing in the door talking to her, someone opened another door inside the office and stuck their head out to see what was going on.  And the gentleman that stuck his head out was a chocolate brown bald headed man with beautiful black hair, dressed in a white coat, a suit, a white coat, a white coat, beautiful shade, beautiful tie and he stuck his head out and looked around the corner.  So I said to her, "Who is that?"  And she said, "That's Dr. Ellis."  I said, "What kind of man is he?"  Say, "He a dentist."  And I said, "What he do?" Say, "He work on teeth."  That was the day and the time that I decided I was gone be a dentist, right then.  That was Dr. Ellis was my role model.
Speaker 2: So you decided right there on the spot?
Speaker 1: Right there, right there on the spot; it was never no change from that point on.  When I came to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], I came there and put on my entrance papers I came here to get ready to go to dental school.
Story_ID: 306731
Speaker 1: I want to take you back before we get you in dental school.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: And take, take you back to--now when--can you describe your parents' [Stella Bryant Smith and Harvey Smith] personality to us and tell us like who do you think you take after?
Speaker 2: My mother. She was a soft, kind of a very kindhearted, soft person, never abused anyone, never heard her speak loud, always had a constant steady welcoming smile on her face at all the time.  Very challenging, worked hard. Sometimes when I think about how hard my mother worked to raise the four of us, I just cry because I don't think I gave the respect that I should have given for what she did.  But she was--when my daddy was a little slack on the job she stood forward, she carried us home, my mama did.  And so my mother I think I take after her a lot because I developed a lot of her, her things about defeat and about people.  She was always helpful, always involved in something, always doing something, always looking good, and always dressing well. So I think more so than my father.  My father was an outgoing person, he was a good preacher but he, he would get over involved sometimes in a lot of things.  Would put him not in favor with the members and things like that, but he was a good person.  But my daddy wasn't one that you could depend to sit down here and be here for a long time.  He, he was a kind of a roamer like, but he was a good provider.  He looked after us very well while we were growing up in school in Albany [Georgia]. But answering your question I think I took after mama.
Story_ID: 306732
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory? First thing you ever remember what--do you remember? Do you have a memory like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a little fella going to Ashby Street School in Atlanta, Georgia; it's still there.  And there was a gentleman who used to--white man, Mr. Coleman [ph.].  He used to come through the neighborhood selling vegetables.  He had a wagon it was drawn by a mule, mule, and wagon and I always wanted to get a job with Mr. Coleman working.  And I pushed Mr. Coleman about just letting me work, and he would let me work with him with that mule and wagon.  When I got out of school--I was a little bitty fella then.  I was in the third and fourth grade I, you know. So when he come through my neighborhood when he get to my house I would jump on the wagon.  And ride with him so that when he got to a person house, and the people come out to the wagon they come out from the house to the wagon to buy their vegetables and things.  And they would take 'em to the house in a bucket or something.  And my job was to go to the house and bring the bucket back see, and I just enjoyed working with Mr. Coleman because I met so many different nice people.  And that's why I wanted the job so that I can meet all these people.  So I'd catch Mr. Coleman at a certain spot every day after I got out of school.  And then I would ride with him to a certain spot and he would let me off and take-'cause he kept the mule out in East Point [Georgia] someplace, right out in East Point is where he kept the mules.  And that was the thing about myself that early in life that I can remember.  How I used to like to work for Mr. Coleman, he would pay me fifteen cents a day that was big money, big money.  I'd save that little fifteen cents, I sure would. I'd save up enough to buy me a pair of shoes.  I get a pair of shoes $1.50, and I'd save that, that grocery money to buy shoes.  And then to help mama [Stella Bryant Smith] 'cause he also would give me some groceries and things and vegetables and things.  But that's what I remember about myself very early on really early; but I always stayed at something, had something to do.  Had some work to do when I got to Albany [Georgia] of course as I mentioned to you my big thing was my paper route.  But in those small towns like that, the farmers would come and get us. Like for instance, when time comes to harvest the peaches and to pick the peanuts, the farmers would come and get you.  Say like for instance they pick you up on a Monday that's when school is out now they pick you up on a Monday and bring you back on a Friday.  And we go to the farm, of course, we sleep in the barn, you know, in the shed or something like that. Pick peaches, shake peanuts.
Story_ID: 306733
Speaker 1: So you said that these trucks would come and get you to go pick peaches and peanuts, and you stay for a week?
Speaker 2: That's right stay for a week.
Speaker 1: Well where would you sleep?
Speaker 2: Sleep in the barn, sleep in the--where you, you know, where you putting the peaches there's always a barn with a lot of straw and hay.
Speaker 1: Okay, now young people today if they're not raised in the country I guess would find this kind of odd (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's true, of course naturally we gone be all men and all boys, you know and--
Speaker 1: I didn't know that until you said it either, that it would be all--so all men and boys, you know.
Speaker 2: That's right so we would--and this particular job I'm talking about we were picking peaches.  And of course, the farm itself was owned by Mr. Hades [ph.], who had the full leadership in town.  Hades farm that's where we were, and I, I picked peaches there for--I didn't pick 'em but a week because at the end of the week when it come time to get paid there was no pay for at least two or three fellas.  You didn't--the boss didn't leave no money for us we just didn't get paid.  And of course, I guess the straw boss was keeping the money, and that happened every week; somebody didn't get paid every week.  And I just assumed that he was keeping the money, but I quit (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You never got--you couldn't get paid?
Speaker 2: You wouldn't get paid no say well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There was nobody you could go to and say--?
Speaker 2: Nobody other than--he was the man he was the boss, he was our boss.  He says he didn't need--
Speaker 1: Well if somebody got angry enough to, to do something to him--I mean did anybody ever get that angry (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no not then not in them days you didn't get that angry (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) 'Cause you just didn't get that angry and jump on a white person in Albany, Georgia at that time out on the farm 'cause you had to leave there.  You had to take it and do as I did. I quit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got me a job canning then.
Speaker 1: Who do you think, think the, the straw boss (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The straw boss.
Speaker 1: He was just taking advantage (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's what he--that's one of his--
Speaker 1: He knew you couldn't do anything.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: The consequences if you did something; the stake was so high.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You, you could lose your life.
Speaker 2: That's right, so it wasn't worth it.  So, so we left that job and of course, oh yes I never shared--left that job and I started work for one of the deacons in my daddy's [Harvey Smith] church [Mount Zion Baptist Church; Mount Zion First Baptist Church, Albany, Georgia].  Back in those days most all of the builders, bricklayers, cement finishers, carpenters were black guys in my neighborhood.  I didn't see nobody else building houses but them, you know, so I got a job with a contractor.  A deacon in my daddy's church, he gave me a little job, fifteen cents an hour.  I made--that's how I came--that's how I left home and came to school on that fifteen, fifteen cents an hour; that was about five dollars and something a week.  But I went to, went to working for a contractor then, and at that time it was no sheetrock; everything was plaster was put on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The sheetrock you talking about what they call now, what do they call it now? They call it plasterboard or, or--
Speaker 2: Plaster with sheetrock?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that you all call sheet rock.
Speaker 2: Sheetrock yeah, yeah everything is sheetrock nowadays. Back in those days everything was plaster, it was mud we called it, see.  They'd mix it up, you know, and then the guys would put on the back of this and just spread it, you know.  I'm just looking at these walls to see if I could tell, but I suspect there's sheetrock, but I started working for a plasterer.

Speaker 1: Can you describe where you grew up and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Albany, Georgia; beautiful, clean city. Most of the street in the black neighborhood were not paved, they were sandy, pretty white sandy streets, but they were clean, and they kept the place clean.  So that there was nothing, nothing bad about what you saw and everything was always pretty because in the middle of most of the streets in Albany they had palm trees growing back in those days.  And of course, Albany supposed to be the pecan center of the world.  That's what they're known for. So we had beautiful pecan trees, and it was just a clean place; had big fat river that came through the town there, and there was a no older it was just a nice clean place.  When I left Atlanta, Georgia to go to Albany whoa, I left Atlanta, Georgia and when I left Atlanta it was Christmastime it was snow and ice all over the ground, all messed up (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Here in Atlanta snow and ice?
Speaker 2: Yeah surely that's something you don't see today but when I was a boy growing up it was snow and ice all the time.  You couldn't come out of your house sliding and slipping on the street and everything but anyway when we left Atlanta, Georgia to go to Albany, Georgia I left a city full of snow and ice.  And when I got to Albany, Georgia, the kids was playing in the sand in the street when I got there.  When it was a beautiful, clean place and still is, and there was no odors or anything and to sort like that.  So Albany itself was a very nice, clean place.
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful description of, you know, what I mean you, you're really painting a picture (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah it was always--
Speaker 1: I never thought of Albany--
Speaker 2: Yeah it was very oh yeah it's always been that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Always been a nice clean place to stay.  Yeah, so that's, that's the kind of environment I grew up in and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was, was the white side of town paved?
Speaker 2: White side of town was paved.  I lived on South Madison [Street], and the mayor lived the next block above me. I never shall forget that, he was a nice person.  It was paved right down to my street, and the end of rest of it was pretty clean.  They kept those streets pretty clean, but they were all sandy streets there was no paving in our neighborhood, sure wasn't, but  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now did you get any other city services that you remember I mean?
Speaker 2: Yes we got other--
Speaker 1: Were their streetlights?
Speaker 2: Had streetlights, had streetlights, we got all the other services people pick up your trash certain time. They had alleys in Albany, they look like just pretty and clean as streets, they were beautiful.  So I didn't, I didn't have an experience of growing up in a place that was not clean. It was a very beautiful place.  I enjoyed every bit of it, sure did, but I as I say I--who, who when, when I left Atlanta and went down there I left Atlanta, I was in the sixth grade.  And when I got to Albany--in Atlanta they had high six and a low six I don't know whether they have that now or not (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well what is that?
Speaker 2: High six and a low six I don't know, but when I left to go to Albany, Georgia I was in the low six (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh grade?
Speaker 2: Grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So when I got to Albany they didn't have high and low, they just had six.  So at the end of the year when it come time for me to be promoted I was promoted from the six to the seventh because they didn't have no highs and lows; you in the sixth grade got promoted.  So I went to the seventh, so I skipped a half a year.
Speaker 1: Okay so, so Ashby Street School [Atlanta, Georgia] was that in the Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's where you started?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started at Ashby.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went from Ashby to Ware Street School [Atlanta, Georgia]. Ware Street School is now a part of Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Now how do you spell the other school? I mean (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) W-A-R-E Ware.
Speaker 1: Ware, Ware Street okay.
Speaker 2: Ware Street School.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, that, that's in Atlanta too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And where did you go in Albany?
Speaker 2: I went to Monroe [Monroe Elementary School, Albany, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm, elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right what were some of the other-just--you described Albany so well. I mean was there any sounds and smells that you associate with in Albany?
Speaker 2: Weren't no smells and no sounds; weren't no smells and no sounds. Everything in Albany was fine just beautiful.
Story_ID: 306735
Speaker 1: There were some unpleasant things in Albany [Georgia].  We never in Albany, never in Albany. But I do remember as a boy growing up, a black man was lynched down in Baker County [Georgia]. That's just ten to fifteen miles down the road from Albany. They had a lynching down there 'cause it affected us all up there in Albany.  We knew about it all, but we didn't--nothing like that ever happened in Albany when I was there.
Speaker 2: Now about how old were you when that happen?
Speaker 1: I'm trying to figure it out. I was in the sixth grade [at Monroe Elementary School, Albany, Georgia].  So I'm just trying to figure about how old I should've been.  I suspect I was about maybe how old is sixth grade.
Speaker 2: That's about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wait a minute I was--
Speaker 2: --about eleven years old.
Speaker 1: Yeah I was nineteen when I finished high school [at Georgia Normal and Agricultural College; Albany State University, Albany, Georgia] there.
Speaker 2: It could be eleven or twelve.
Speaker 1: About twelve, that's right. About twelve years old.
Speaker 2: Talking about 1934?
Speaker 1: That's right '34 [1934], '35 [1935]. Yeah that's right, about 1934.
Story_ID: 306736
Speaker 1: So as I said, I stayed in school. That, that was in the public school system in Albany [Georgia]. And that was in Monroe [Monroe Elementary School, Albany, Georgia].  And then when I got promoted to the seventh grade, I changed schools.  That was a college in Albany; the name of the college was Georgia Normal [Georgia Normal and Agricultural College; Albany State University, Albany, Georgia]; normal meant two years.  Georgia Normal College and all of the colleges in normal colleges back then had high schools.  And I left the, left Monroe high and went to Georgia Normal that was over the river.  I had to cross the river to get to school every day.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the river again?
Speaker 1: Flint River.
Speaker 2: Flint River?
Speaker 1: F-L-I-N-T, I had to walk over that Flint River every day to get to school.  And I went to Georgia Normal two-year college and a high school.
Speaker 2: Now when you were in school did you have--what was your favorite subject in school or did you have one?
Speaker 1: Well my favorite subject has always been biology; always something about biology.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you knew you wanted to be a dentist right?
Speaker 1: Well I didn't even know nothing about the dentistry then, but I'm picking around with snakes and separating frogs and messing with crickets and all kind of stuff. I always likes biology; always did.
Speaker 2: So did you want to know how these creatures were put together?
Speaker 1: Yeah, all that kind of fun and thing when I was a little bitty boy. Even when I use to fish and catch lizards and legs and all that kind of thing I was concerned about that.  But Georgia Normal was a high school, Georgia Normal today is Albany State [Albany State University, Albany, Georgia]. They changed Georgia Normal to Albany State.  Made it a four-year college instead of two years. Cut the high school out; there's no more high school there now.  But I went to Georgia Normal High School; finished there in 1939.
Story_ID: 306737
Speaker 1: Now did you have a--did you like school?
Speaker 2: I've always liked school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've always liked school.
Speaker 1: Did you have a--were there any particular teacher that you remember who were especially helpful to you during--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) elementary school or high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah in, in high school my favorite teacher was Mr. Valentine [ph.].  And he was the music teacher; he taught us, he was the band, and I was in the band.  I played clarinet in the band. Mr. Valentine was my favorite teacher.  He taught me how to play clarinet, and I was on my way to learn to play a tenor saxophone 'cause that was my favorite. I had to have an instrument.  But I never got past that clarinet, so Mr. Valentine was my favorite teacher.  Then I had a Professor Heard [ph.], who was principal of the school.  Mr. Heard was, he too was a favorite teacher of mine.  And then Dr. George, Dr. Carrie George [ph.]. She was our homeroom teacher when I was a senior in high school.  Dr. Carrie George. She was a graduate of Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia], Clark College at that time. Came to Albany [Georgia] to teach us. She was one of my favorite teachers, and we stayed close until her death which was like two years ago.  But those were some of my teachers who were favorites, Mr. Valentine, Dr. George, and the other person Mr. Heard that I called. Those were favorite teachers at Georgia Normal High School [Georgia Normal and Agricultural College; Albany State University, Albany, Georgia]. I finished there in 1939.
Story_ID: 306738
Speaker 1: Yes I played in the band [at Georgia Normal and Agricultural College; Albany State University, Albany, Georgia]. And, of course, I went out for the football team. I don't know why but I went out for the football team.  And I never shall forget ooh-wee, the football team had to travel in Mr. Blalock's [ph.] truck. He was a local performer there, and his son was on the team, and he let us use his truck to take the team around.  And my first trip with the football team, believe it or not, I went to Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida] to play football. We all piled up in the back of that truck sleeping on them bales of hay in the car 'til we got down to Bethune-Cookman.  And I never did get a chance to go into the football game 'cause the coach, the coach would need a substitute for the position I called myself playing, and whenever he looked around for substitute I was so small he said, "Aw, I can't send you in there."  So I never got to play but I traveled with the team, with the football team, I surely did.  And as I said our transportation was the bus 'cause I'll never forget going to Bethune-Cookman--to that was also such a pretty place.  But it was, it was the band, and it was football that I participated in, and I didn't have any other extracurricular activities that I participated in, and my participation continued the same when I, when I came to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Now so, so you didn't, you didn't run for class office or anything like that?
Speaker 1: I was president of my senior class.
Speaker 2: Oh that's, that's important.
Speaker 1: Yeah okay. Yes I was president of my senior class and as president of my senior class I was able to negotiate a deal with the leading clothing store in Albany--was Rosenberg Brothers [Rosenberg Brothers Department Store, Albany, Georgia].  And being the president of the class, I was able to negotiate a deal with one of the salesmen there. And the deal was we got our graduation suit, our graduation shirt, our graduation tie, our graduation shoes and socks, all for twenty-nine dollars. That's what we paid for our outfit.  And the contact that I made with it was--the salesman that I was dealing with said to me, "You going away to school?"  I told him, "Yeah, I was going to college." He said, "Okay." He said, "I believe you can wear my clothes." He said, "When you get ready to go come see me." And I did just that. Ooh my gosh, when I got to Morehouse as a freshman I had five suits. All these clothes that he had given me, you know, that really did fit.  So, that, that was my only position; and it was that I was president of my class in high school.
Story_ID: 306739
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating from high school [at Georgia Normal and Agricultural College; Albany State University, Albany, Georgia] did you--I mean how did you choose Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: How did I choose Morehouse College?
Speaker 1: I know your father [Harvey Smith] went to Morehouse.
Speaker 2: That's right, my daddy was Morehouse. He played--he had played on the baseball team; he was known for his activity on the baseball team at Morehouse.  So when I finished high school, we got finished with high school and got in the truck and went to the little playground, had a little picnic, and when the picnic was over, we disbanded, and I went home.  And I walked into my house, my daddy was sitting up in the front reading or studying or getting his sermons together or something.  And I came to talk to him about, "Well now daddy I'm out of high school; I'm ready to go to college.  And I want to know to what extent are you going to help me, how are you going to participate?" And I said to him I wanted to go to Morehouse. And that's where he'd gone.  I thought he'd reach and get me and hug me and say, "Okay let's go." But he didn't. He said to me, "I don't think you ought to go to Morehouse right now.  I think you ought to stay over to Georgia Normal for two years, and if you can make it over there, then I'll let you go to Morehouse."  That didn't sit right with me. I didn't know he was thinking that way. I thought he'd be tickled to death to send his son right on up to Morehouse.  But when he made that statement to me, I went in the bedroom and took off my clothes and put on my work clothes, went and got in that alley, went down to the end of the alley where Mr. Son Hardly [ph.] was building a house, and asked him for a job.  And he had gave me a job hauling lumber and helping around the job at fifteen cents an hour, and that's the money I came to Morehouse on, that fifteen cents an hour.  I saved what I could. Of course when I, of course when I came up here [Atlanta, Georgia] I found other means to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so I'm sorry, are you saying you worked all summer, then you were able to go to Morehouse in the fall (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes I was able to go--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Course I had to work when I got here, but I--that's how I got there 'cause I wasn't gone stay home and go to Albany.  I wasn't gone let my daddy do me that way, 'cause I thought he'd be tickled to death to have a son back there at Morehouse.  You know, but he wanted me to wait there for a while.  I figured if I waited around there two years, I never would get to Morehouse. So I got there. Had some tough days (laughter).

Speaker 1: Now you've got like other siblings, right? We didn't talk about who they were but you--how many of you all were in the family?
Speaker 2: In the family.
Speaker 1: It's four children?
Speaker 2: Four children. My next--my oldest sibling was my sister, Georgia Nelle [HistoryMaker Georgia Dickens] her name. We called her Georgia N. She's Georgia N. Dickens now.  Her husband [Robert Dickens] dead, Dickey dead, but that was my oldest. Then next--now my sister is the oldest, then it was me, and then it was my brother C. Miles [Calvin M. Smith]. And C. Miles; he came along and kind of followed in my path. He too went to school at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And he too became a dentist. We were both practicing in the same town for quite a while.  And then my baby sister, Stella [Stella Smith Lewis], she became an educator. She taught school.  And at one time, her highest position was she was in charge of the Head Start program for the City of Atlanta [Georgia] in her education. Both my sisters taught.
Speaker 1: Okay, now your sister Georgia Dickens lives here in Atlanta, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: We interviewed her (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --the last time we were here.
Speaker 2: That's what she said (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I didn't know that you were related 'til now.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And they call her Gee Gee.
Speaker 2: Gee Gee, that's right.

Story_ID: 306741
Speaker 1: Now at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]--now you're in Morehouse and you're--well was, was--had, had you ever been to the campus before?
Speaker 2: No I hadn't. But I lived on Chestnut Street [James P. Brawley Drive, Atlanta, Georgia], and the Morehouse men did not--when I was--well at that time the Morehouse guys was not eating on Morehouse campus. They were coming down Chestnut Street to Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] dormitory. That's where they--that's where they eat every day; breakfast and whatever.  So I had the contact of seeing the students come by my house all the time, the Morehouse men.  I saw guys like W.B. Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] and the professors and all come by my house, just walking all the time.  I had been exposed to it, and I had a part of that in me somehow or another; that's why I wanted to come back.
Speaker 1: Now, now how did you know who Dr. Du Bois was at the time?  Did--was he--I mean did, did everybody know who he was? Everybody I knew who Dr. Du Bois was. He was so distinguished, you would have to know he was somebody. And I remember seeing him; he was your complexion with beautiful gray hair, distinguished guy.  And I learned that that was Dr. Du Bois and behind him I learned that there was a Dr. Braithwaite [Edward Ricardo Braithwaite], who also was an outstanding person.  And those people were walking, nobody had no cars, and they were walking by my [maternal] grandmama's [Nellie Bryant] house every day from up to the campus back to the dormitory, and that's how I happen to have known so many of those people.  But when I got back to Morehouse, I took the entrance examinations; as we all had to do, and I flunked it. I didn't pass it.   The man said, "Harvey [HistoryMaker Dr. Harvey Smith]," said, "I believe we got to send you back home 'cause you didn't pass the examinations." But the man lecturing to me and telling me this had been a classmate of my daddy's [Harvey Smith].  He said, "Well we not gone send you home, we gonna put you in the sub-freshmen class."  So they had a sub-freshmen class; that was about nine or ten of us in the sub-freshmen class.  And I stayed in the sub-freshmen class for a year until I worked my way out of there. And when I worked my way out of there, then I got to be just a regular student.  And I got back in line, but I had to go to summer school to catch up for a year or so.  I wanted to go to basketball, but I had to work; so I caught up, got caught up.  And of course, I was taking pre-med; never been on anybody's honor roll. I often think about that; never been on the honor roll.  I just was a good C student all the way through school.  I remember I made some Bs in a biology; that's the only course I made Bs in. But I went on through Morehouse and finished there in 1943.
Story_ID: 306742
Speaker 1: What was campus life like, you know, at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] did--was--Benjamin Mays was, was he there at that time? Was he here?
Speaker 2: When I first got there, Dr. Hubert [Charles D. Hubert] was acting president. Dr. C.D. Hubert, but Dr. Mays came shortly after I got there. Benjamin E. Mays.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of person was he?
Speaker 2: Oh man, I can't describe it. You ain't never met nobody like Dr. Mays.  He was just so dynamic and so beautiful. Everybody wanted to be--Dr. Mays could speak to you and say--and everything he said was--it was outstanding and classical.  You never heard it before; nobody else would probably ever say it. But, Dr. Mays just changed everything at Morehouse.  He, he brought us all up to men. I'm telling you, that Dr. Mays, I can never, never, never forget him.  And I thank God for letting me be there on the campus with him as the head of it.  And I had, I had--oh yeah, I sure did. I had a chance--I did some dental work for Dr. Mays.  I sure did, and he went away and went to Mayo Clinic [Rochester, Minnesota], and he came back and wrote me a letter and I got that letter. Oh, I wish I could've found it. I got the letter Dr. Mays wrote me.  And he was writing the letter to tell me that while at Mayo Clinic they had examined his mouth, and they wanted to know from him who did his dental work and he told them.  And I got that letter somewhere; I got a try to find it. But Dr. Mays was just a magnificent, wonderful, marvelous man.  The kind of man that you just enjoy being around. It was nothing funny about him.  He didn't tell no jokes and be laying around; he just was all intellect, but such a good person.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about him that you remember from, from those days?
Speaker 2: No sir I really don't have any stories (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now I've heard that he would come in the cafeteria or where the students were dining and stand on a table and deliver a lecture, you know, every now and then. And did you ever, did you ever--?
Speaker 2: Well I wasn't a campus student so I didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --have that real personal contact with him. I just see him on the campus and hear him speak.  Because what I liked about Morehouse at that time is you had to go to chapel every day, every day you went to chapel and somebody was speaking to you every day, you know, some outstanding person, you know.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other people, people that spoke to?
Speaker 2: Well Mordecai Johnson, who was president of Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Howard Thurman who was an outstanding theologian; he was speaking to us.  And who else was that used to come to speak to us--I've forgotten the gentleman's name, but he was president of the National Baptist Association [sic. National Baptist Convention], he would speak to us.  Oh and I never shall forget; it was a white preacher that was out on Posten Lane (unclear); he used to have him to come speak to us. But he was always having outstanding people to come and speak with us.  And I--as said, of the people Mordecai Johnson and Howard Thurman were some of those that stood out in my mind.
Story_ID: 306743
Speaker 1: You're at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] until 1946?
Speaker 2: No, from--to 1943.
Speaker 1: 'Til 1943.
Speaker 2: That's right and, and while I was there as I said I was in, in intramural football. I played as a--and, of course, I, I played in the band. That was my biggest thing; I played in the band for four years while I was at Morehouse.
Speaker 1: You still played the clarinet?
Speaker 2: Played the clarinet, I still played the clarinet. That's right. Joined Omega Psi Phi Fraternity while there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now were people aware that your father [Harvey Smith] was one of the founders?
Speaker 2: At that time no.  At that time no. I didn't run into that until after I got out and got into the graduate chapters and the guys.  Well, I didn't even know until, you know, some of the guys started talking to me about it. And as I said two years--last year, the, the Omega Psi chapter in Atlanta, Georgia; they don't make a--yeah they had a founders day.  And they had--as the son of a founder, just two of us around there, was me and Clinton Warner [HistoryMaker Dr. Clinton Warner]; his daddy was a founder too.  So they had us at the banquet. That's been just a year, a little bit better than a year ago. Uh-huh.  But as I say I was--joined Omega Psi Phi, and I played in the band at Morehouse and played intramural football (laughter); I guess that was about it.
Speaker 1: What position did, did you play when you played football?
Speaker 2: Played football, I had to be a running back; I won't be nothing else.  And I on the football--on the baseball team, I was a catcher.  I loved to catch. I couldn't catch a fly ball coming down.  I had to catch something coming fast with a lot of speed to it. I was a good catcher too (laughter). Yes sir, I sure did. I really did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--.
Speaker 2: Played basketball too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 306744
Speaker 1: Can you give us some stories about some of the teachers at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] that you (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some of the teachers--
Speaker 1: Or, or, who were your favorite teachers at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: I guess I'd have to say my favorite teacher was Dr. Samuel Nabrit [Dr. Samuel M. Nabrit].  Dr. Nabrit taught me biology at Morehouse.  And course Dr. Nabrit later got to be president of--it wasn't Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], but he got to be president of one of the other colleges.  I can't think of the name of it, but Dr. Nabrit was my favorite teacher.  He was head of the department of biology, so he was teaching me biology.
Speaker 1: Was he related to James Nabrit [James Nabrit, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: That's, that's his brother.  He was at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], was he not?  That was his brother. Uh-huh. A fine family of people. But Dr. Nabrit was one of my favorite teachers.  Another good-- favorite teacher of mine was Frank Forbes [Frank L. Forbes]; he was the athletic director.  Dr. Forbes was a good teacher of mine; Dr. Frank Forbes, Dr. Samuel Nabrit.  I shall never, never forget those two. And the other one--it was one of my favorite teachers who taught me in this sub-freshman course, Dr. Lindsay [ph.]; taught me English.  And they were my three favorite professors while I was in college.  Dr., Dr. Nabrit and Dr. Finley [Harold E. Finley], he taught me comparative anatomy. Those were my favorite teachers, Finley, Nabrit, and Lindsay, that's right. Those were the teachers that were outstanding to me.  Some of them, the names I forgot, but those were the ones--were my favorites especially Dr. Nabrit.  Dr. Nabrit just died; they buried him maybe like two years ago.  Dr. Nabrit not only taught you, taught you biology and comparative anatomy, but when you looked at him, he taught you what to look like. He was so well-dressed.  Sometimes I'd go to class to see Dr. Nabrit, see what he was gone have on.  So I got that from Dr. Nabrit you see, in addition to the biology that he taught me. He taught me that; sure did.  So those were my favorite college professors, they sure were.  Yes, sir (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think today, I mean, sometime you know, when you look at the world today, I don't know, I don't know if young people really admire their teachers the way they used to in terms of being a model of how to dress and act and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Do you get that impression?
Speaker 2: Yes I do, I do it's, it's bad too.  I, I don't know I hate that too, but I found it to be the same way.  The same way that respect that we had for our instructors and professors; Dr. Nabrit and all those other guys was something.  Of course, I guess that you just don't see anymore for some reason, and it bothers me a whole lot. I worry about that, yes sir.  But those were my professors at Morehouse that I admired so very much.  Dr. Nabrit used to always talk to me about what I was gone do.  And I remember, I never shall forget, I was taking this course from Dr. Huggins [Dr. K.A. Huggins]; he taught me organic chemistry.  And I failed it that year. I had to take it over.  So when I took it over, thought I had failed it again, but Dr. Huggins gave me a C.  He said he just had the confidence in me and figured that I had gotten the subject matter that year, so he passed me.  But I failed that doggone organic chemistry; yes gracious, that brings up a lot of memories about that teaching day, but that was about it.
Speaker 1: When you graduated your grades were, were good enough to go on to  (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they were. I was, I was a good C student with Bs in my major subject.  In biology, I had Bs but the rest of 'em were Cs.  I didn't have no Ds on my card because the one that I would've had was when I took that course over.
Story_ID: 306745
Speaker 1: I finished Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and went on to, to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] of course.  When I, when I did go to Howard and making a decision, of course, back in those days, all--the only words that you knew was Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee]. Everybody knew about Meharry; wasn't nobody talking about no Howard or nothing like that.  But when I got time to go to dental school, I had heard about Howard and learned about Howard.  I decided I was gone be different. I didn't want to go to Meharry, so I applied for Howard--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and I got accepted to Howard University.
Speaker 2: To the school of dentistry [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: School of dentistry.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I sure did, and I--when I was going to Howard I knew that I was not going to have money to stay.  And I knew my parents [Stella Bryant Smith and Harvey Smith] wasn't able to send me there. But it was World War II [WWII], I guess.  And they had established the Army Specialized Training Program [ASTP] in the colleges; Army Specialized Training.  So if you were in dentistry or medicine, if you got in medical or dental school and could get in the Army Specialized Training Program, they paid for your school.  So I went there knowing I wasn't gone be able to stay if I couldn't get in the Army Specialized Training Program.  And I got there; was doing fine; was living with Robert Smith [ph.], a friend of mine from Morehouse.  We both taking dentistry, and he got in on the Army Specialized Training Program first and looked like I wasn't gone get in--my money run out, I didn't have money.  And so I told Smitty, my roommate, I told him I said, "Smitty, I'm not gone be able to stay 'cause my money running out and I'm not getting in the [U.S.] Army.  And I just don't know what in the world I'm gone do."  Robert Smith was his name from Waycross, Georgia, and he grabbed me by the hand and look me dead in the eye and said to me, "You ain't going nowhere.  I'll take care of you 'til you get in the Army."  And he did; he paid my room rent there 'cause in about thirty days later, they inducted me into the Army.  They took me into the Army and from that point on there was no problem.
Speaker 2: Now what, what year was that when you were inducted into the Army?
Speaker 1: Okay let's see I went there 1943, see (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So that's in the heart of the war?
Speaker 1: Yeah, see it was in the in the summer of '43 [1943] when I got inducted into the Army and they kept us two years.  And they had enough dentists in the Army; they didn't need no more dentists.  So they put the dentists out of the Specialized Training Program all over the country.  And then I had to hustle to make it by myself then.  But I'd been there long enough to get established; got me a job at the post office working after school.  I'd get off in time to come, go to class, you know, so I made it all right 'cause the government had paid most of my way.  And I made it, made it through just fine. Dental school was not a problem.  But for me, I was doing all right; always a subject I have trouble with; didn't, didn't pass comparative anatomy.  I had to take that course over in dental school, but I finally got through with it. Never was on the honor roll there, just another student, just hitting it hard, yes sir (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So when did you finish, was that 1946?
Speaker 1: Forty-six [1946].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 306746
Speaker 1: I finished dental school at Howard University [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] in 1946, and I borrowed train fare from a buddy of mine.  He was working for the government then, he let me--Duncan [ph.], let me have money enough to come home.  And I came back to Atlanta [Georgia]; I was married.
Speaker 2: Now, now that's a big step now we have to go back and (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, how did you get married; what happened?
Speaker 1: Well I was--my girlfriend was of course a student at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], and we were, we were--I came home from dental school on September, and we got married.  I was in dental school, and I came back here, and we got married.  She was working Atlanta Life Insurance Company [Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia]. And she, she quit working Atlanta Life Insurance Company, and came to Washington, D.C. and got a job in the surgeon general's office [Office of the Surgeon General] in Washington, D.C., got a job in the surgeon general's office in Washington, D.C.  And she stayed there with me, and she got pregnant, and she had to come home. After she came home and had the baby; Jane [Jane Smith] was born in Atlanta.  Yes, she came home, but she didn't get pregnant until my senior year.  So the baby was born, oh yes, so Lavada [Lavada Johnson Smith] came there and stayed with me, and of course, she came home when she got pregnant.  And of course, I finished in 1946, and I came back to Atlanta.  And when I came back to Atlanta in 1946, I was the first black dentist to come to practice in Atlanta, would you believe it in twenty years.  The first one. The guy that came before me was twenty years ahead of me, and I don't know who that was, but I came back and opened up a practice on Auburn Avenue.  I came two months after the board was given, so I had a whole year I had to spend without a license.  So the dental supply man who was coming to my office where I was; I was with Dr. Reese [ph.] was letting me work in there with him.  And the dental supply man was a Mr. Holcombe from Nixon and Holcombe Dental Supply Company [Nixon-Holcombe Dental Company], and he knew that I didn't have a license but was trying to practice.  So he said to me, he said, "Well next week I'll be in Dublin, Georgia, that's where the president of the board live Dr. Darby [ph.]. And I'll tell him about you, Harvey [HistoryMaker Dr. Harvey Smith], and see if we can get you a temporary license to work until you can take the board." So I said I'd appreciate it.  So he went down to Vidalia [Georgia] and talked to Dr. Darby and told him about Harvey back up there in Atlanta, he don't have a license, he's practicing in Dr. Reese's office.  So it always was funny to me that what Dr. Darby's answer was. Dr. Darby told him, say, "Go back up there and tell Harvey to practice all he wants to, that I'll be responsible for him, I'm president of the Board of Dental Examiners.  I'll be responsible for him, but tell him don't work on no white folks."  I don't know why (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well that, we can--.
Speaker 1: --but I guess he, I guess he figured (laughter) I'd got in some difficulty with some white person he could hardly help me get out of it. That's all I ever figured.  But I came on in practice and took the board and passed the board and everything just went along real fine after that.
Story_ID: 306747
Speaker 1: But after I had practiced dentistry for a period of seven years [in Atlanta, Georgia], I had to go back into the [U.S.] Army.  I had to pay Uncle Sam back for the time that he sent me to school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.].  That was in the Korean War. Nineteen hundred and fifty-one [1951] was when I went back, 1951 to the Army.  And the Army by that time had integrated, and I was captain in the Dental Corps [Army Dental Corps] at Fort Stewart [Georgia].  Captain in the dental corps at Fort Stewart.
Speaker 2: Fort Stewart, where's Fort Stewart?
Speaker 1: Hinesville, Georgia just out of Savannah [Georgia].
Speaker 2: All right so you didn't have to go very far to serve, right.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: You didn't have to go--travel very far to serve.
Speaker 1: Well that's a long ways, that's a good little ride down to Savannah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Good little ride, it was long. But that's where I put my two years in, I put two years in the [U.S.] military down there, and I was--my rank was captain.  I went in as captain, and when I was discharged of course, I came back to Atlanta [Georgia] to continue my practice.  And came back at the time of integration. See when I started we could not be members of the American Dental Association 'cause we could not be a member of the Georgia Dental Association.  In order to be a member of the American Dental Association, we had to be members of the Georgia Dental Association.  But when I came back they would just in the process of integrating, so we integrated (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now what year was this when you come back from--?
Speaker 1: I guess it's '53 [1953]. I went in, in '51 [1951], I came back in 1953.
Story_ID: 306748
Speaker 1: So here, here in Atlanta [Georgia] they were actually, they actually integrated the Dental Association [Georgia Dental Association] in '53 [1953]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953], they in the process. We hadn't--we couldn't  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is that the American Dental Association or the Georgia chapter of it?
Speaker 2: Well, see, we couldn't get in the American until we could get in the Georgia.  We had to get in the Georgia Dental Association first.  Georgia Dental Association. Had to get in that first; we got involved in the process of trying to get in, and we got in without too much difficulty.  But I remember this. When I came out of the [U.S.] Army, I went to my first integrated dental meeting.  And at that time the dentists in the Georgia Dental Association were the white dentists, said, "They can be members, but they can't come to the social affairs, just the scientific." So when I came back, I started going to the scientific.  And then it wasn't long before they began to kind of break it in.  Wasn't too long before a little friend of mine was president of the--in Atlanta our, our recognized division was the Northern District Dental Society.  Northern District and then the Georgia Dental Association, then the American, you see you had to be a member of all two before you could get to the American Dental.  So when I got to be a member of the Georgia Dental Society--Association, they had a meeting and I could go to the meetings.  We could go to the meetings and my first meeting in the Georgia Dental Association I, I was on the executive council, then they put me on the executive council.  And my first meeting--they would have a little short cocktail hour before the meeting. And at the bar, I was sitting--standing at the bar looking around in the room, I was trying to decide when it come time to eat, who am I gone sit with.  You know, 'cause I knew that was a problem. When I was just out of the Army, that had been integrated.  So I looked to the side over there, and I saw a table with three white dentists, young boys over there.  So I said, "When it come down to sit down and eat, I was gone go over there and ask those guys if I could eat with them.  They are more likely to accept me than the older dentists would."  So that's what I did I--when it come time for us to eat, I went over there.  And I said to one of them, I said, "Is anyone sitting here? Would it be all right if I sit here?"  Well, they never answered me. They looked at each other, but they never answered, so I never sat down.  But way across the hall was Dr. Goldstein [ph.] who was watching every bit of it. I think he made it his business to watch it.  And he saw me having that problem and came to me said, "Harvey [HistoryMaker Dr. Harvey Smith], come on over here and sit down with us."  So I went over there and sat down with Dr. Goldstein, you know.  But I never had any problems in the Northern District Dental Society, it was just fine.  I was on the executive council of the Northern District Dental Society.  And enjoyed every bit of it. And after I had been in dentistry for several years, I got a fifty-year citation--course I brought that with me.  But I got a fifty-year citation from the Georgia Dental Society as a fifty-year member.  They honored me and three other guys at that fifty years.  And during my tenure in the dental organization, the Northern District, one of the things that I was very proud of and I have the documents in here about that too.  I was appointed by Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] as one of nine dentists on the advisory council to the governor about dental health in the state.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is in the '70s [1970s], right, seventy--?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah late '70s [1970s] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right.
Story_ID: 306749
Speaker 1: So you were the first new black dentist in Atlanta [Georgia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Atlanta now--
Speaker 1: --in twenty years.
Speaker 2: --yeah now that that was in the--
Speaker 1: Twenty years.
Speaker 2: I'm talking about in the black society.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I was the black dentist.  I was the first black dentist (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You opened on--?
Speaker 2: --to come to Atlanta in twenty years.
Speaker 1: You opened on Auburn Avenue.
Speaker 2: And I went down on Auburn Avenue looking for a place to work. I didn't have no money.  I just knew my wife's [Lavada Johnson Smith] pregnant, gone have a baby [Jane Smith], she had the baby in three months.  But so I just went down there looking for a job.  So I went to the dentist's office and knocked on the door and said, "Hello, how you doing, here I am."  Everybody say, "Well hope you do all right," until I got to Dr. Reese's [ph.] office.  And Dr. Reese said to me, he said, "Harvey [HistoryMaker Dr. Harvey Smith], it's not a lot of dentistry practice in this office' cause I don't like dentistry."  He--his son had finished medical school the same day, same year I finished dentistry. His son finished Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee]. He said, "I don't like dentistry." He says and, "A lot of people don't come through here."  He said, "But what does come through this office, I can share it with you if you don't mind coming here to work, and you want to have a place to work, come here."  And that's what I did. I caught a streetcar on Hunter Street [Martin Luther King Jr. Drive] at Amos Drug Store [Atlanta, Georgia] every morning. Rode straight to Auburn Avenue and got off there at the Herndon Building [Atlanta, Georgia] and worked for Dr. Reese.  And at the end of the week, he would come back--he liked to play poker.  So most of the time, he was across the street in the Odd Fellows Building [Odd Fellows Building and Auditorium, Atlanta, Georgia]; still down there right now.  At the Odd Fellows Building on the top floor, he'd be over there playing poker.  And I'd be in the office doing the work.  When Saturday come time to pay the office goods.  He would come to the office, and he sit down, and he had a little cup that kept a little money in, so he'd get the cup, and he paid Louise [ph.].  Louise made twenty-five dollars a week, that was her salary. He paid Louise. He say, "Harvey, I got sixty dollars left in the cup, thirty for you and thirty for me."
Story_ID: 306750
Speaker 1: And that's the thing I went along with, until across the street, Dr. Anderson, B.F. Anderson, had cancer in the arm. They had to cut his arm off. Dr. B.F. Anderson.  And he sent for me to come to talk to him and I went to talk to Dr. Anderson. And Dr. Anderson was on the second floor of the Hern--of the Odd Fellows Building [Odd Fellows Building and Auditorium, Atlanta, Georgia].  And when I walked in there he was sitting in the reception room with this arm in a sling; it had the cancer.  And the thing that was sad about that was he was working with his best friend, who was a medical doctor in that same--they had joined offices.  And Dr. Hightower [ph.] had been treating him for an ulcer for a year, and it was cancer.  Had it diagnosed at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], where he finished dental school. But anyway, I walked in that office, Dr. Anderson's office.  And he sent for me, and when I walked in the office he was sitting there--good-looking man, smiling.  And he told me what had happened him. He said, "Now you can have the practice, Harvey [HistoryMaker Dr. Harvey Smith]."  I said, "Dr. Anderson, I don't have to have the practice. I can work for you, I'll come and work for you until you get better. Then you come back."  He said, "Naw, I made plenty money, and I got plenty money. I don't have to work.  And I want you to have it." So what he did, he said, "Now go back there in the back, and it's a cigar back there in--box back there in the back.  And I want you to have all that gold in the cigar--he gave me a gold--a cigar box full of gold crowns and things.  Back in the days when people had gold crowns all over their teeth.  He gave me a box of gold crowns and gave me the dental equipment in there.  And this was the story that I tell about meeting him. It was Christmastime, my wife [Lavada Johnson Smith] had had a baby [Jane Smith]. I had no money for Christmas.  I was making twenty dollars--sixty--twenty dollars every week to--the government paid me for sixty-two weeks, twenty dollars a week.  They sure did. And that's what I was living off of. But when I walked in Dr. Anderson's office; this is a beautiful story.  I walked in, he was sitting in the chair and I came in, and I was standing up talking to him.  And behind me, twins came in, girls. They were twins. And he said, "Harvey." I say, "Yeah?" He say, "Turn around look at those girls."  I say, "Yeah." He said, "You see that girl that got that gold crown on that tooth right there?" I said, "Yeah."  He said, "Her sister wants one just like it on the same tooth."  Say, "I want you to go in there and get it ready for her."  So I took the girl in there and did what I needed to do, made her a little impression and all.  And when we came back out of the office, she paid him.  She gave him fifty dollars for that crown; that's what they cost back then. Now we're talking about seven or eight hundred.  But he took the fifty dollars from her and handed to me. He said, "Let that be the first money you made in dentistry." So that was it.  That was my Christmas.  And Dr. Anderson. So he gave me the practice. I stayed there for, for two or three--about half a year.  And then Dr. Reese [ph.], the guy that gave me the job to start with, he died; he was across the street.  And his son was in his office, and he got up and went to Auburn [Georgia], he told me to come over there and take his daddy's office, so that's what I did.  And I practice there from several years on Auburn Avenue, and then I decided I wanted to move on the west side--the university system, and I wanted to move, and I moved back on Chestnut Street [James P. Brawley Drive, Atlanta, Georgia].

Speaker 1: When your practice was going on, I mean, the, the Civil Rights Movement was going on here--
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: --in Atlanta [Georgia], I guess?
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And so did, did you know any of the people involved in--well I know you knew the Kings because your father [Harvey Smith] knew Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: I got a picture I want to show you before it's all over that--of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] at my house.  The Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC] had a show at the auditorium; a benefit show for money.  Raising money for the for the Southern Christian Leadership, and the artist was Lena Horne. She performed. Now the promoter had it so that if you bought a ticket to the Lena Horne show, if you bought a twenty-five dollar ticket, that entitled you to come to the after celebration so to speak.  And that was that, that after the celebration was held at my house, and I have a picture right here that I think is so dear to me with Martin Luther King, Lena Horne, my wife [Lavada Johnson Smith] and my daughter [Jane Smith], that was made.  And I just cherished it. And that was the night, listen to me now, that was the night that they killed them children over there in Birmingham [Alabama], Montgomery [Alabama] in that church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Birmingham.
Speaker 2: Birmingham in the church. That was the night. And they were calling Martin trying to get some direction.
Story_ID: 305639
Speaker 1: We were talking about the day in 1963 that the bombing [at 16th Street Baptist Church] occurred in Birmingham [Alabama], and you said you were at a fundraiser [for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)] here [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes in other words when, when this happened they were--they had, had the, the recital by Ms. Lena Horne and those who had the twenty-five dollar tickets were entitled to come to my house for an after-party.  And that's where we were, and as I said Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was there, so they were--that's where they got in contact with him.  And he and his little group of people there sat in the living room there and talked to the people in Alabama about what had--what they thought should be done.  I don't know about what was said, but I just know that he was there with his staff that night. And that was--as I said, right in the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement.  It sure was. And I never had any, I never had any more real direct contact with Dr. King.  My family was always friendly with his family.  But I, I never had--I never was personal with him. But he was such a beautiful person, but that was all it was to that situation, yes sir.  That was about what it was with Martin Luther King with me.  I had a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: I had an opportunity once when he was in Alabama.  He came home and came to me for an examination and I did an examination, but the greatest mistake I made was--oh, wouldn't it be nice if I had that exam card right now where I examined Dr. King's mouth. Oh, but I didn't, I didn't keep the card, but I did have an opportunity to see him, but he was such a nice man until--such a nice man.  Yes, I was--I happen to have been in the bank, Citizens Trust Bank [Atlanta, Georgia], in the lobby doing something.  And Mr. Milton [Lorimer D. Milton], who was president of Citizens Trust Bank, his office was right there on the same floor, off from the main desk, just push a little door and go back in there.  And Martin Luther King was in Alabama, but he was contemplating coming to Atlanta.  And I was sitting there in the bank and Martin's daddy [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], Daddy King came in, but somebody else came.  And the only thing I can remember was Mr. Milton who was president of the bank undoubtedly felt that if Martin Luther King moved himself to Atlanta, his operation here, it would interfere with the, with the business part of it all somehow.  I don't know how he had it figured, but the only thing I remember about that meeting was Mr. Milton was in his office Daddy King, Martin's daddy coming in the front door with one or two other gentlemen.  And they went through that door, and I just heard, I just heard Martin Luther King, Sr., I just heard Daddy King jump up and say to Mr. Milton, "Well, you can't keep him out of Atlanta; he's coming anyway. I'm surprised that you want to keep him out of here."  But the business people didn't want him to come, but his daddy was saying that he was coming anyway, and he did, you know.
Speaker 1: Now what were the reasons--what would you think the reasons were that the business people didn't want Dr. King here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I guess they figured with what Martin was doing that it upset the white folks.  You know, and that it would affect us some kind of way.  That's the only way I figure Mr. Milton could have--that's all I could see he was thinking.  And Mr. Milton was president of Citizens Trust Bank; a good person. Board of trustees at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  He was a good, a good person but Martin, Martin did come on and from that point on, you know, I--what his thing was. He did everything so beautiful.

Speaker 1: How did integration affect business on Auburn Avenue [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, now as I look at it as a broad picture, now, I look at it as a broad picture; segregated Auburn Avenue, woo man, was on every door from door to door was black business front door to the next one; black folks everything, everybody had.  You could stand uptown at Bell Telephone Building [Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph Building, Atlanta, Georgia] and look all the way to Boulevard.  Where are we now? This street right down here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, Boulevard, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, look all the way to Boulevard. Black business on both sides of the street.  But after integration, we start to lose and somehow all, all those businesses, we started losing 'em. And people talk about it; the guys my age that I know, now talk about the times they remember when black businesses flourished.  But after integration--see a lot of people say you never heard it I'm sure, but a lot of people say integration, oh Lord you shouldn't say that--say the integration didn't help black business at all.  They say it really kind of got rid of so much of it.  But I don't see it that way because the younger black people have--are into so many things that we never knew about, so I don't see how they can ever think that way.  But certain businesses that we had in the black community suffered on Auburn Avenue after the integration business came.  So it did affect it some; it got rid of a lot of the businesses.  And I can't think of them individually, but when it got where black people could go here and go there and do this, that and do that and blah blah, there were no need to do some things we were doing on Auburn.  So it did really affect the business; yeah, sure did.

Speaker 1: During those days, now did you go to church in Atlanta [Georgia] in those days? Did you go--did you have a regular church?
Speaker 2: Friendship Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, that's my church, and that's at Friendship Baptist Church and we had some real nice people.  Maynard Jackson's daddy [Maynard Jackson, Sr.] was my preacher when I joined; Maynard Jackson daddy was my preacher.  And he was a civil rights man all the way and a good person and then after Maynard Jackson,  then we had a Reverend Williams [Reverend Dr. Samuel Woodrow Williams] who was from the Morehouse School of Religion [Atlanta, Georgia] he was our preacher.  And he was the civil rights all the way and of course (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This Hosea Williams?
Speaker 2: Not Hosea.
Speaker 1: Not Hosea, okay.
Speaker 2: Sam Williams was his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His wife [HistoryMaker Billye Aaron] is now married to [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron.  Ms. Aaron was my preacher's wife at one time.  And as I said then of course, now we've got Reverend Guy [Reverend Dr. William Vincent Guy] that's [HistoryMaker] Jasmine Guy's daddy that's my preacher now.  So that, that was, how that part of it as well, yep.

Speaker 1: Now how has dentistry changed since you started?  Now when you--I'll tell you I remember when I was in high school, my father went to a dentist, and they pulled out all his top teeth and put false teeth in the very same day.
Speaker 2: Same day.
Speaker 1: Came back from the anesthesia; he was groggy.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm (laughter).
Speaker 1: And sort of looked like a real ordeal, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-hm, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: But they we don't do that anymore.  But how has it changed for you over the, over the years; now the days you were talking about people had a lot of gold teeth and (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, when I first started out, when I first started, you, you had to have a technique, you had to know the technique of preparing a tooth for gold crown because people would come to you with perfectly good sound teeth.  And say I'd like to get a gold crown put here (gesture), and you need you needed to know how to do that which was pretty simple.  Then I said to myself at one time I say, "Well I know that's gonna change; I'll see the day when that will not be the case."  And I never, I never--and right today what discourages me so much, I see so many young people--in the Waffle House where I go to eat every other day or so, it's a little girl there, perfect teeth; two golds here, one here, one here.  And it seems as if to me the young people, they're getting back into it. I thought surely I'd see it, you know, outlived.
Speaker 1: It doesn't sound like you liked it very much?
Speaker 2: I didn't, I don't. I wouldn't do it. See a youngster couldn't come to me and ask me to do that.  I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it, I know I couldn't.   And I know a lot of guys who don't do it and didn't do it, then I know some who do, and do a lot of it but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What is it that, that bothers you about it?
Speaker 2: Uh?
Speaker 1: What bothers you about it?
Speaker 2: What bothers me about cutting--they cut a good tooth out and put a gold crown on it.  And I don't--I just don't think, putting that gold in your mouth.  What you putting it in there for?  And you just cut out a good sound tooth to put it on there.  No, I never liked it, I never liked that showmanship.  And back in those days when I came on they were doing things like making a gold crown with a diamond in it. Making a gold crown with a moon or star in it; all that kind of thing.  And most of the guys I knew didn't get into that sort of thing.  But as I said, today it is just as prevalent as it was when I first started.  But your daddy with his immediate dentures, we were doing immediate dentures when I came.  You know, now taking all the teeth out and putting the dentures in, yes we were doing it that far back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The thing that is so entirely new and, and a lot the things; but implant is what's real new. You know, real new; the implants are real new.  And of course, that's a big thing that in dentistry today and which is big and which is entirely new to me.  And the guys are doing quite a bit of it successfully.  So, but dentistry, dentistry itself has changed. There's so much emphasis put on preservation of saving teeth rather than the extraction of teeth.  So much--when I first started practicing, you know, people would come to me sometimes, and they would say well I just got six teeth left in my mouth.  I want to take 'em out and go head make me a plate. People were just doing that.  You know, but nowadays everybody is concerned about trying to save their teeth, and there're many ways now that, you know, that they can be saved rather than taking them out.  And cosmetically making 'em look nice and look beautiful; there're so many, many new things that are going on.  So much so that if I decided to get back into a full dental practice today, I'd have to go back to school again to learn some of the new techniques.

Speaker 1: Well, you know, when you look at old pictures of people back in the turn-of-the-century, you know, you never see 'em smile.  And some of the photographers, some people, you know, have kind of intimated that because the photography process--the shutter's so slow they'd have everybody stand still. But I've often thought that it might be because people didn't--a lot of people didn't have all their teeth.
Speaker 2: Well that's true that could be it.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when you were coming along, I mean, was that like would--did you often see people with, you know, with missing teeth?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was it more then than it is now?
Speaker 2: Yes, a little more than I see now; a little more than I see now.  Surely was, because replacing, replacing teeth when I came along, basically, basically, the process was basically the same.  Like if a person had five teeth out across the front of the mouth, I'll put 'em back today like I would've put 'em back then.  Just an improved technique, you know, in doing it.  But the change has been in the, in the treatment of teeth or the gums so that you don't have to lose 'em.  You see the change has been in perio [periodontics] and treating the gums and treating the teeth.  And the implants, the procedures and the root canal therapies, all that stuff that used to be considered odd is just done by the average dentist on any corner nowadays.  So those that been some of the major changes. But the making of the false teeth is the same today as it was back yonder; very same.
Speaker 1: Now if--are there-I've heard like certain folktales about how people--I don't know how true they are; about people keeping their teeth cleaned by chewing charcoal and other such things I mean, do you--?
Speaker 2: I never heard about charcoal (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You ever heard--?
Speaker 2: I just heard of people using, of course, baking soda as a toothpaste to clean 'em.  And I've heard about some of the older people, you know, like some older people would chew those roots, you know, chew them roots and keep their teeth clean that way.  You know, chewing on those roots and the baking sodas. Course, the people in the old days who used to dip snuff and use snuff; I don't know how to say it, but that preserved their teeth better than anything I've ever seen.  All them old snuff dippers they'd have bad looking teeth where the teeth was all stained up, but they would have them.  Something about that snuff that kept disease out they gums.  Funny but that's way it was.
Speaker 1: Now that's interesting, so their teeth would, they would be stained but  (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They would be stained bad, but they'd have em. 'Cause that snuff would keep that pyorrhea, pus, germs from getting into their gums, causing their bone to dissolve and causing their teeth to get loose. Sure did, yeah we did a lot of that too, yep.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Story_ID: 305644
Speaker 1: Did black people go--well in Atlanta [Georgia], you're saying you were the second one in twenty years to show up.  Did people go to the dentist on a regular basis?  You know, usually go to the dentist if they had a toothache or tooth problem?  Or did the average person try to--I know at one time barbers use to pull teeth but I don't--?
Speaker 2: Well, as long as I can remember there's been an element of the people who kept regular appointments whether there was anything wrong or not.  They'd go to the dentist every six months as far back as I can remember.  But I can recall the time when it was not as important to people to save their teeth as it seems to be now.  Back then if a guy got a hole in the tooth say what--, "Sir I'm gone put you a nice filling." "Naw don't put no filling in, just pull it out; you gone have to pull it anyway," you know.  But nowadays it's real hard to take teeth out for people now.  They don't want to--, "What can you do?  Can't you send me somewhere where somebody--?"  So people are not as easy about losing their teeth as they used to be; they're more concerned about trying to keep 'em.  And thank God there so many new ways to, to keep 'em.  So we don't have as much of that taking all the teeth out and making dentures and things like we used to do.  Because as I said, some of the new things that are being done nowadays, you don't have to do that, yep.
Story_ID: 305645
Speaker 1: What were some other highlights in your career?
Speaker 2: Highlights of my career in dentistry; oh yes, oh yes.  When I first started in dentistry, Dr. Anderson's [Dr. B.F. Anderson] office he--one Sunday out of the month he would go to the country.  We would get in his car, and he'd have a chauffeur; we'd go all the way to Covington, Georgia, from Atlanta [Georgia].  And when would we get to Covington, Georgia he would go to a lady's house in Covington.  Get on her back porch and a barber chair and a cuspidor to spit in, and he would go there and take teeth out.  And no fillings of course, 'cause you wouldn't have the equipment, but he do extractions; basically that's all we would do.  Take teeth out, take impressions, make false teeth, make dentures.  But it's kind of funny about the, the thing that happened to me the first day I went with Dr.--I--no, no it was the second time I went to Covington, Georgia with Dr. Anderson.  And they had it set up so that the barber chair was on the back porch, the cuspidor we had for you to spit in the cuspidor.  And the patients who came up sat in the little chair in the backyard until time for them to come up.  And they--so I was there this particular day, and this lady had to have two teeth extracted right up in here.  And she sat down; all of these people in the backyard waiting to be served, and she was my first patient to pull a tooth out, and she sat down.  And of course, I was kind of showcasing a little bit. I was dressed neatly with a nice white coat on and had a little girl there to help me, she was dressed all good.  And then I got my little needle out and I gave this woman an injection to take this tooth out.  And back in the days when I started, all of the Novocain were not pure; every now and then you get some that was not pure.  And that was--must have happened to me with her, but I gave her an injection into her gums, certain kind to remove these two last teeth up here.  And I gave her the shot, and as I took the needle out of her mouth, I turned to put it on a table that was behind me.  And I heard somebody screaming saying, "Oh Lord, go get Bumpsy." I'll never forget that, "Oh Lord, go get Bumpsy."  That was the lady screaming out and she was calling for her baby child.  That Novocain that I gave her did something to her that kind of upset her, and she just got hysterical.  And that turned everything. When I looked around all them people that was sitting out there in the yard waiting to be served, they were gone, they got up and gone.  And of course, I had to look after her, so I got in my car, and I took her home (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So people heard her screaming; they took off?
Speaker 2: Took off, they heard her screaming, they took off.  And I got her in the car and took her home.  And when I took her home, and I opened the door and went in the house.  Her mother said to her, "Why did you go up there and do that?  Why didn't you tell the dentist that you had such and such a thing?"  "I don't know."  "Why would you go up there and do that?"  So it seems to me that she had done this similar kinda thing before.  And her mother knew that she had a medical situation that caused her to do that.  And she was just asking, "Why you didn't tell him," you know, because you really did mess up things for that particular day and what we were doing there.  But that was one of the exciting things that happened to me, in the beginning practice.  And in the beginning practice I learned a lesson even here in Atlanta, Georgia.  I did an extraction for young man and I took the tooth out; the tooth broke off and some of the roots were still up in there.  I had to go back and get some instruments to go back and get the roots out.  So he said to me, "Did you get the top of it off?"  I said, "Yeah." He said, "Well leave the rest of it in there now."  And I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Leave the rest of it?
Speaker 2: He came back in about a week for me to treat it. I treated it. I didn't see him anymore for about four, five months.  And he came say, "Remember that tooth you took out for me?"  I said, "Yeah." He say, "You know, I had to go into the hospital.  I stayed in the hospital a month behind that thing." And he said, "I just came down here to see if you could help me pay the medical bill."  Say, "I had a big bill." Said, "I just wanted to see if you'd help me pay it." That's when I learned something.  And I did learn, so I gave him a check to help him pay that bill.  You know, so then the next week I got the letter from the lawyer saying that in that you helped him to pay his bill you were saying to me that you were responsible for him being in the hospital.  Now we want the rest of the money for the hospital bill.  So that was a lesson to me about that I learned, I learned from that, but I did have to pay the rest of that money for that, for him.  That was a mistake that I made by leaving them roots in his mouth.  I learned not to never do that (laughter) again, of course, yes sir.
Story_ID: 305646
Speaker 1: The Ben practice in dentistry, I learned that in the Ben Massell Dental Clinic [Atlanta, Georgia].  That was a clinic that was sponsored by the Jewish people; they sponsored the Ben Massell Dental Clinic.
Speaker 2: How do you spell that?
Speaker 1: B-E-N, M-A-S-E-L [sic.], Ben Masell it was a Jewish--you didn't pay nothing to go there.  And it was a volunteer work, so we black dentists was volunteering to go on Wednesday.  That's the only day they would let us come; we'd have to come on Wednesday.  And the white dentists, of course, could go whatever day they wanted to give some time; say well I'll take off on Thursday, I'll give some time on Thursday.  But any rate, I never shall forget that Dr. Marvin Goldstein was the administrator of the clinic.  And one time I remember that the president of the Emory University School of Dentistry [Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia] came to visit in the clinic.  And he--Dr. Goldstein was walking him around the clinic introducing him to everybody, but when he got to me and Dr. Robinson [ph.], he didn't let us meet the good doctor, I guess because we were black.  But another thing I learned there, there was a white dentist by the name of Dr. Harris [ph.], who was a root canal therapist.  And he worked in there too, so they asked him, they wanted him to run the clinic to be in charge, to be the supervisor of the clinic, Dr. Harris, white dentist.  So they asked Dr. Harris; say, "Dr. Harris, would you be the director of the dental clinic?"  And he said to them, "Yes I would, under one circumstances, and that is that you let the black dentists come like we do when they can.  And when they can give the time and if you're--if you do that I'll be the director."  And that--he was an endodontist, root canal therapist, and I thought he was such a beautiful person; he stayed that way all during the time during my practice.
Speaker 2: Now what year was that?
Speaker 1: Ben Massell Dental Clinic; I'd come out of the [U.S.] Army then.  I would say it was in the, in the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's when that was, in the early '60s [1960s], yep.
Speaker 2: So he helped to integrate the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, he sure did.  He did integrate it.  Yeah, he integrated it, and it stayed that way; it's that way even till today and they still have a beautiful clinic.  Yep.
Story_ID: 305647
Speaker 1: And of course, one of my, my good times was being appointed for Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.]. I liked, I liked Mr. Carter; I think he's real man.  Of course, when he appointed me to the advisory council of the dental society was a highlight in my career.  I thought that was really nice being appointed to the advisory council.  I was one of nine guys to be appointed to the advisory council.
Speaker 2: The advisory council of (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Of the Georgia Dental Association.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I got an article about it over here in my little literature what I got over there.
Speaker 2: That's when Jimmy Carter was governor then, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Around about, about what year was it?
Speaker 1: I can't remember exactly, I can't remember exactly, but now that's a first-class man if you ever see him; 100 percent from Plains, Georgia.  But he's a man though he sure is that.  So the--and as I said, we went on, and I went on and got to be on the executive council of the Northern District Dental Society.  And that was an honor to me because I was the first person on the executive council.  Dr. Charles Goldman [ph.] was the first black man to be a member of the Northern District Dental Society.  And we went on from there, so I guess that's about it, young man.
Speaker 2: So how, how many years did you practice dentistry?
Speaker 1: Sometime you have to help me to figure it now, 'cause I'm not good at the figures. I started in 1946.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah now (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you got an award for practicing for over fifty years?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah that comes for anybody; a lot of guys do that, the fifty-year award.  But I've been there now I guess--'cause I still practice; I don't have my own business, but I still work some.  But I say that I retired so to speak in 19--let's see '79 [1979]--I retired in ninety--in 2001.
Speaker 2: Two o-one [2001], okay?
Speaker 1: Yeah when I retired but I still work.
Story_ID: 306752
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: One of my concerns; among one of my greatest concerns is some program to concentrate on the fate of the African American male, the men in the African American group.  I see so much of it in the kind of work I do as I walk through the streets, as I ride the streets I see so many of our young-- it seemed as if to me when I was a young boy coming along long years ago in Albany, Georgia, every black guy that I knew, had something in his mind that he wanted to do.  He wanted to be somebody, he wanted to do something, but I see so much now in the community of guys that appear to me that they aren't concerned about doing anything.  And I was trying to see if there was some kind of programs that we could start that would emphasize attention to young black guys, because if it continued to go the way that it's going, I don't know what it's gonna be like.  I, I shouldn't say it, I shouldn't say it, but I--in the days that I came up, we were taught to make a certain kind of appearance.  To look like something, to try to look like we're meant for something.  And as I see our kids today walking in the street, I don't mean it like I say it, but the way they are dressed and the way they present themselves it doesn't seem as they got anything in their minds like is something they, they would like to do.  So I'm concerned about emphasis being placed on young blacks so that they would seem to develop a desire to wanna be somebody and do something and try to keep so many of 'em out of difficulty.  What that is I don't know. If I had to give that one away I think that people that have the greatest equipment to fight that kind of thing are the ministers.  If all of the ministers would adopt a program of handling and trying to instruct our black youth, men.  So that is one of my primary concerns of some program to improve the livelihood of black males.  I just don't see much of it going on in the community so that would be my number one project.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That would be my number one project, trying to strengthen the position of the black men because as I look it, and as we all look at it down the line a piece, it's not much of a future.  It's not much of a future, so that was my primary (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --one of my primary things for black people. And I don't know, but as I look around in my communities I see so much, not necessarily of the women.  But there just seem to be a relaxation or a given up attitude about everybody say well forget about it.  Ain't gone be nothing no way, and nobody's trying to do anything, trying to be nothing, trying to look like nothing, all that slop and to be coming in the street with that on all them things.  It's just so discouraging to an old man like me 'cause I was not exposed to that.  I was exposed to a different kind of thing; having a job, trying to do something and trying to look like I was trying to do something, so that's it.
Story_ID: 306753
Speaker 1: Now tell, tell me when you look back over your life at all the things that you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I would almost, I would almost have to do things as I did them; but if I had to do some of the things over again, I would put more emphasis on the family structure.  I would spend more time with my children [Jane Smith, Ahmid Karim, Homer Smith] and more time with my wife [Lavada Johnson Smith] and trying to keep us all as a family unit.  All of us at some times in our lives have little times when we stray from the main course, and I'm guilty of that myself.  Where if I had to come back again, I'd come back with the thought in mind that the important thing is your family, it's the children it's your wife.  And I would make every effort that I could to do everything to see to it that my family unit was tighter than I had it.  I did somethings that I would not do again, but the emphasis should be on keeping the family together, especially the children. So that would be what I'd make an effort to strengthen, my family relationship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With my family.
Story_ID: 306754
Speaker 1: Now likewise when you look back over your life, what would you consider to be your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: Legacy now, now you got to do something for me. I may know the meaning of legacy, but explain to me what you mean.
Speaker 1: Well by, by legacy we're talking about what things do you think you left behind for future generations?  What things did, did you do that changed the--or may have left a contribution behind for others?
Speaker 2: In my community in the way I have lived, all of my life, I like to hunt so I've done a lot of that.  And of course, I'm a dentist and I've done that, and am a churchman, I go to church [Friendship Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], but the only legacy that I've got that I could leave, I haven't invented anything or nothing like that.  But I have so lived my life that I hope that somebody's been watching.  And that somebody in the community, some young people and some have told me, say, "I'd like to be like Doc."  I've tried to live in a fashion, to do things in a fashion, conduct myself around people so that somebody would say, "Sure would be nice to be like Harvey [HistoryMaker Dr. Harvey Smith].  You remember Harvey? He was a nice old guy; he didn't meet no strangers, didn't discriminate against nobody, never done nothing against anybody.  Never tried to hurt--he just kind of lived a righteous life." That's all I got, and that's what it is.
Story_ID: 306755
Speaker 1: Well can you tell us about your family just briefly?  I know you got a--your, your daughter, we're supposed to be interviewing her at some point, Jane Smith, but tell us about your family?
Speaker 2: Oh my family. I guess I got to talk about my wife. Lavada was an Atlanta [Georgia] girl born and raised in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her name?
Speaker 2: L-A-V-A-D-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Lavada Herson [ph.] Johnson Smith, She was born and raised in Atlanta finished school at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and taught kindergarten all of her life.  She didn't want to teach nothing but kindergarten, but she was a kindergarten teacher and a good one.  I've got several articles at home about Lavada and her teaching and of course when she retired.  Lavada taught school during the segregation days.  And when they integrated the public school system, they came to some of the black schools and took some of the teachers out to take 'em to the white schools.  And they took my wife was one of 'em from Heinen [ph.] School on Simpson Street and took her to Smith [Sarah Smith Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia] way up there in Buckhead [Atlanta, Georgia].  And woo she almost just lost it, she cried about it 'cause she loved working with her children.  But Lavada was a real good teacher, and when she retired--they, they showed her that. They gave her some accolades and some articles about her.  Then the oldest child, my oldest child is Jane, Jane Elaine Smith.  Jane was educated in the public school system in Atlanta, and finally ended up finishing Spelman.  And after she finished Spelman, she got married, married a fine young man, Dr. Larry Brown, who is a dentist.  But when she's finished Spelman she went to Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia] and got her master's [degree] in, in education and after that, she went to Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and got her doctorate in education.  And she has been a joy.  She's been president of the Atlanta Civic Council appointed by Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.]; she worked with him there.  She was president of the National Council of the Negro Women [sic. National Council of Negro Women] under Ms. Dorothy Height [HistoryMaker Dorothy Height].  She was president of the, the Business and Professional Women, USA [Business and Professional Women's Foundation].  And now she's in charge of a administrative alumni program at Spelman College under Dr. Tatum [HistoryMaker Beverly Daniel Tatum]; that's Jane.  She is now Jane Smith again with two fine sons and separated from Larry--divorced from Larry but doing a beautiful job at Spelman right now.  My next child was Harvey [Harvey Smith, III; Ahmid Karim], the little devil, the one that was in every Civil Rights Movement there ever was, was in school at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] and decided at the time, you know, how it was the college students were not liking the white teachers on the black campus.  So they decided one day they wanted to go over to Spelman and put two of them white teachers out on the street, and they did.  But the administration of the school attempted to punish 'em for doing it, they would not accept the punishment, so they dismissed from the school put them out of Morehouse.  So my son came out and enjoyed and got with some kind of group protesting and then one day he decided he wanted to go back to school.  He came to me and asked me about it. I spoke to my preacher, Dr. William [Reverend Dr. William Vincent Guy], he spoke to his friend at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  Harvey went on to Howard University. Got up to Harvard University, was doing well.  Called me one day on the phone, say, "Daddy I'm gone get out of school.  I don't need no more education. I'm gone get to be a Muslim. And to do what I want to do in life I don't need no college education."  So I suggested to him that he to go talk to Dr. Lani Shabaab [ph.] who was a Muslim that had taught at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And he was in Washington, D.C. and my boy was in Washington in Howard; say, "Talk to him."  So he talked to Dr. Lani Shabaab and Dr. Shabaab influenced him to stay in school.  But my boy joined the Nation of Islam, and if there is any such thing as being truly a Muslim, my boy is. He finished Howard University, got his degree in political science brought his degree to his mama and handed it to her. He said, "Mama this is for you, I don't need it.  I got some other work I want to do."  So he's been protesting all of his life and part of interracial groups trying to get things together and all.  And right now Harvey is a graduate of Howard University's political science, and he now owns and drives a taxi cab every day; that's my number two child.  My number three child was Homer [Homer Smith]. I took him handed him to my mom's [Stella Bryant Smith] when I walked up the driveway at my house fifty-seven years ago.  And when he finished high school, he didn't want any college. He wanted to go to New York [New York], and learn how to be a dancer, and so forth and so on. Somewhere along the way Homer got caught up in the crack cocaine thing.  And I spent I guess so many years of his life fighting the crack cocaine.  Visiting him in the jailhouse, riding all over Georgia to jail to see him when he get locked up.  And he finally was on probation some four years ago, and all of a sudden probation officer had told him if he got in any more trouble he had to go to jail again for two years.  And so he got in trouble and the police looking for him, so he told me, he say, "Daddy I'm gone turn myself in Monday."  And I said, "Okay." But Monday I didn't hear from him. I heard from him two weeks later; he was in California, and that's where he is. I talk to him all the time.  He took the cosmetology board in California, passed it--has a good job he--and seemed to be doing well.  He's not on the drug anymore. Has a nice living situation, and I don't know he just can't come back home 'cause he still got that pending situation.  So that was my three children, and that's just where they are.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Story_ID: 306756
Speaker 1: Now is there anything that we haven't asked you that we need to address or talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I have already discussed with you about my accomplishments in the dental society [Georgia Dental Association].  And that was being on Jimmy Carter's [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] committee and getting my fifty-year pin for having practiced in Georgia for fifty years.  That was about it I should have mentioned somewhere along the way that I am a Baptist.  A member of Friendship Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia] and I, I'm a good church member. I only go maybe once or twice a month, but I'm a good church member.  And other than that I think that's about it.
Story_ID: 306757
Speaker 1: Well the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I simply would like to be remembered with somebody say, "You remember Harvey Smith [HistoryMaker Dr. Harvey Smith]?" Say, "Yeah I remember Harvey." Say, "He certainly was a good guy.  He never met a stranger, never made any difference in nobody, everybody, he loved all people."  I'd just like to be remembered as a guy who cared about people and humanity.  In my practice, in my practice, most of the patients that ever got to be patients of mine were friends of mine.  They learn to like me for not my dentistry but for the kind of person that I was.  And I would just like to be remembered by all people as they sit down and think about Harvey, "Oh yeah, I remember Harvey. He was a real good guy; never did any harm to nobody." That's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's about it.
Speaker 1: Well thank you, sir, thank you for taking the time with us.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes sir thank you.
