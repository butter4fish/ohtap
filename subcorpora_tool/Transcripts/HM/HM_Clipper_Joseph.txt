Speaker 2: Oh--my favorite food?  I eat a lot of avocado, grapes.  It's a rare occasion when I don't have grapes before I go to bed at night. I'm beginning to observe that.  It didn't use to be that way, but I--you know, you shift your eating habits based on where you want to go.

Didn't know where it was going to come from, but I was going to get it--twelve years old you're not working unless you're selling papers, and I was selling papers, but not enough to buy a bicycle. But I got a bicycle somehow.  I don't know to this day how I got it, but I held the vision of the bicycle.

Story_ID: 5288
Speaker 1: Please tell me about your mother. What was her name?  Start with her name.
Speaker 2: Her name was Viola Whitby Clipper.
Speaker 1: Could you spell her maiden name?
Speaker 2: W-H-I-T-B-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay. And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Virginia.
Speaker 1: And where did she grow up and what do you know about her background?
Speaker 2: Well, she grew up in Bethesda, Maryland at a place we call River Road which is a name of the street, River Road.  And it was a black community at that time. It's now been refurbished in this high rise building where I was born and that's where she lived early on.
Speaker 1: And what do you know about her growing up? Did she have siblings and did she share any stories with you about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Well yes, and I knew both of her siblings. She had a brother by the name of [William] Billy Whitby, who died at an early age.  I was--I was still a teenager when he died, and then her brother, that she spent a lot of time with, his name was Charles Whitby, and they were very close. He called her "Sister."
Speaker 1: And did she share any stories about growing up with her brothers and what life was like back then, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Not really. None that I can remember.  I have bits of her at growing up at an early age, it just--it was probably not easy for them because they were in a rural country in a segregated society.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Well (pauses) I would say for the most part outgoing, outgoing. We as a family, and I'm talking about as a teenager because that's when most of my recollections come from--well we celebrated Christmas, Christmas Eve with a mass at twelve midnight, and then there was a party at her brother's house who's Charles Whitby, who was Uncle Charles to us, and that was, that was a ritual every Christmas, you know, as long as I can remember.
Speaker 1: What was your father's name, and--where was he born, and where did he grow up?
Speaker 2: His name was Herman Stanley Clipper, and he grew up again on River Road as his brothers did as well, and I never really met my father until I was twenty-one years old, and--because they divorced at an early age for me, and--but I heard a lot about it, and so arrangements were made for me to meet him and I was about twenty-one, and it was very interesting. He was a minister of a, a Baptist minister. So it was very interesting seeing us together and at the time, I had, had some interesting new thought religion, and it was very interesting for me to observe that him being a Baptist minister, and I was coming from a new thought perspective, how they came together.  And I was shocked really, and it was intriguing for me.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a lot about the religion and it was--religion was it for him.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And were you close with your uncles, your father's brothers?
Speaker 2: Well, again at an early age, on the other side, my father's side, he lost a brother at an early age.  His name was William Clipper, named after his father, and we called him brother, and he died at an early age during--Uncle Cleve [Cleveland], who was really very close to me, I was very close to him you know, from an early age. So he was really somewhat taking the father role, you know, for me and my sister [Blanche Viola Clipper], you know. And--he was very warm, very warm.
Story_ID: 5289
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors?  Do you know your family's origin, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well the name Clipper is a--I was told, we did a family--we had a family reunion back in 1981, so it was some history dug up at that time, and--the name is--was originally C-L-E-I-P-E-R, and then--through something. Whatever happened, it was changed to Clipper, C-L-I-P-P-E-R.
Speaker 1: So--at that family reunion, was it determined at all like when the Clippers arrived here, how they came here? Can you trace your ancestry back that far?
Speaker 2: Well I can't--oh maybe I should say I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, sure, no problem.  So tell me a little bit about your grandparents on your mother's [Viola Whitby Clipper] side.  Did you know them?
Speaker 2: My grandparents on my mother's side.  Most of the history for the grandparents was on my father's [Herman Stanley Clipper] side.  On my mother's side, her--she never knew her mother.  Her mother passed before she got to know her.  Okay. Then her father, he--I did know him, Charles Whitby, Sr., and actually you could say Charles Whitby. The Charles Whitby I spoke about early, his real name as was told to me was Jacob.  They called him Jake.  But nobody called him Jake. They--so that was--apparently at some time in his history, they changed the Jacob to Charles. So that's (unclear).
Speaker 1: And do you have any memories?  What about of your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I have memories of my grandfather on my mother's side, but very little.  He died--I was probably about fifteen or sixteen years old.  Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't see him often.  I didn't see him often, and--so I don't have a lot of history.  I have a lot of records on it, yes.
Speaker 1: Now what about your paternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well at an early age, when I first got here, I was living with my paternal grandmother.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: She was Blanche, Blanche Warren [Whitby-Gray], and then--she had married a man by the name of Eddie Gray, and so they were really my parents at that time, because my mother--I was not living with my mother and my father was away in Philadelphia as I was told, yes.
Story_ID: 5290
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Whoo!  One to go to High's Ice Cream Store, with--as my paternal--you may want to say step-grandfather, and we just called him my grandfather really. So it was granddaddy Bill [William Clipper] and the other granddaddy, which was, his name was Eddie Gray.  Going to High's Ice Cream Store and always wanted to go there because that was the biggest thing.  Keep in mind we were in the country, so going to High's Ice Cream Store was a biggie.  High's Ice Cream Store and the other excitement for me was to go to Sears & Roebucks [department store]. So those were the exciting things at that early age.
Speaker 1: And what other memories you have of growing up?  You shared with us a memory of Christmastime.  What other memories do you have and other special occasions and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, I had some cousins that lived on the hill above where we lived, and the exciting thing was always to get to go to plays.  I'm talking about oh, probably before I was ten years old.  6, 7, 8, 9, 10. So we would always play together.
Story_ID: 5291
Speaker 1: Why did you live with your grandparents? Why didn't you live with your mother?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Viola Whitby Clipper] was--had remarried then and so I was--so I guess it was a decision and I wasn't the decision-maker then, so that's why I was with my grandparents.
Speaker 1: And how long did you live with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well, let me--my grandmother [Blanche Warren Whitby-Gray] died and I was an adolescent.  So I stayed with--I'm guessing now I was less than 6--I was somewhere in the neighborhood of 6, 7, 8 years old when she died.  And then--of course I stayed with her husband who was 'Daddy' [step-grandfather, Edward Gray]. So I stayed with him and that went on through elementary school, junior high school and high school. So then aft-, and of course we relocated from Montgomery County [Maryland] at that time into Washington, D.C., so I'm really talking about 1953, when we moved from Montgomery County into Washington, D.C., where I attended--yeah, it was '53 [1953] where I attended [John] Francis Junior High School [Washington, D.C.], and [Samuel C.] Armstrong [Manual Training] High School [Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 5292
Speaker 1: Could you please give us your siblings' names and the order of their birth including yourself?
Speaker 2: Blanche Viola Clipper, her birthday is December 22nd.  Do you want the year?
Speaker 1: Just give their names in order, including yourself.  Was she the first?
Speaker 2: And then--she was the first. Then Joseph Daniel Clipper--December 3, 1937, and Shirley Virginia Jackson, and hers was March 5th.
Story_ID: 5293
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about growing up, the name of your street and what your community was like and just describe your neighbors, your block, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: I grew up in the country, rural area, no block, no sidewalks, no street lights, okay.  You're taking me back. That's good. Well, the people I played with--I lived in a mixed neighborhood, so we had [Robert] Bobby Money, these were white guys, Bobby Money, [James] Jimmy Money who--they were cousins. They were sons of two brothers, Raymond Monday--Money, and they had another cousin they called him [Thomas] Tommy Tucker.  Little Tommy Tucker, so I played with him, and then--these were the younger guys. And then later on, there were it appeared to me, and this happened several years later.  I matured maybe two or three years. And there were some black guys that were maybe a mile or two away.  I would say a mile at the most.  And--George Clagett, Leroy Clagett, Paul Branch, David Branch, [Richard] Dickie Faulkner. Those were black guys that lived south of where I lived. And then gravitating north, because I--the home was located between what we called Brookmont which was on Macarthur Boulevard, and then you would extend going north on Macarthur Boulevard, and there was another cluster of black folk. So you had the likes of Frankie McKinney, David Butler. Louis Kinslow who lived on the hill beyond my cousin, what we called 'Poupo' (ph.) and Jerry Branch who was Jerry Clipper.  It was very, very interesting just to see how we all came together.  And then going north on Macarthur Boulevard, there was another small cluster of black folk, Jerry Ellis and Rudolph Ellis and Jerry Ellis, Rudolph Ellis, and there was another one that--that we're missing the name.
Speaker 1: What was it like growing up in segregated Montgomery County [Maryland] in the 1930s?  What was that like?  Even though you lived in a mixed neighborhood, what was it like?
Speaker 2: Well, you knew, you knew there were limits and they never came in my house, and I never came in their house.  Even though I would want to have gone in their house, I knew that was off limits.  And it was, it was spoken, early on apparently it had to have been spoken for me to know I couldn't do it. That's my, my recollection anyway. (Pauses) Not that easy, not that easy.  You wanted to play, so you wanted to have someone to play with, those were the closest playmates.
Speaker 1: And growing up in a rural area, what kinds of things did you all play?
Speaker 2: Baseball, football.  Later we got to--when I went to my friends David Branch and George Clagett, Leroy Clagett, we had a little makeshift basketball court, so I could go to Brookmont and we'd play basketball there.  Only one basket, one hoop now, it wasn't two.
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, I lived south of Glen Echo Fire Department [Glen Echo, Maryland], so we could hear the fire truck coming up and down the road.  Here we could hear horns now and then.  I remember some sights that stimulate some thought where--we call him Uncle Jimmy he--Uncle Jimmy and Uncle Danny, they were the two elders in the neighborhood and they would always go fishing.  And something happened just recently.  It brought back memories of that, you know.  I could always see them going fishing in the morning, and coming from fishing in the evening.  And they always wore bib overalls, always wore bib overalls, I think he had, only had one eye and always had a hat, hat on and a, and a pipe.  So I remember those and you know, you always spoke to people when they passed your yard, you know. Even though they were thirty or forty yards away, you waved and spoke and say "Hello."
Speaker 1: Any particular smells that remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a ditch that ran parallel to the road, Macarthur Boulevard, and there were wet smells, damp. That's the smell that I remember, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what other memories do you have of growing up? And memories of what it was like to grow up in rural Montgomery County.
Speaker 2: It was cold and wet going to the outhouse.  Yes.  There were outhouses you know.
Story_ID: 5294
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your elementary school years.  What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Well I went to Phillips-Wormley [School] which is in Washington, D.C. in the Georgetown area, 36th Street and Prospect Street (pauses). No, that'd be Prospect and Bank Street Northwest. So we, we rode a--caught a streetcar and the streetcar took you from out south from Glen Echo [Maryland] to--from there to 36th [Street] and P [Street] and we walked from there to the school. And one of the things that came to my mind is that there were little cardboard cartons of waxed--cardboard cartons of orange juice. And they were always five cents. So it was touch and go to get the five cents for the orange juice.
Speaker 1: And were you ever sad that you weren't with your mother [Viola Whitby Clipper] and father [Herman Stanley Clipper] during some of the early years? What was that like for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, there were questions and sad times.  Yes, I would say so.
Speaker 1: And what kind of parents were your grandparents [Blanche Warren Whitby-Gray and Edward Gray]?
Speaker 2: Loving, giving, caring, you know, which I appreciated. I didn't particularly know the difference because it was always there.
Speaker 1: So in elementary school, were there any teachers that influenced you and if so, what were their names?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a Miss Brown who was my third grade teacher.  I don't remember that I was such a good student. I was always doing something I shouldn't have done, so I can't--any influence that was--was trying to keep me to do what I shouldn't be doing.
Speaker 1: In addition, you said you weren't a great student, but what kind of kid were you?  Were you a mell- [sic]--a well-mannered child?  What kind of child were you?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, I always wanted to play. I loved playing baseball so it was always--you know, ready for recess.  Always.
Speaker 1: And were you well-mannered or shy? What kind of child were you?
Speaker 2: Oh no, never a shy person.  Never a shy person, but always outgoing.
Speaker 1: What other kinds of things did you like to do during elementary school years?
Speaker 2: Baseball was a major, major part of what I was about.  Played baseball and softball in elementary, completing that on to junior high school [John Francis Junior High School, Washington, D.C.]. And obviously I did--I shouldn't say obviously, but I did do it in the evenings after school.  And then I played when we got to--well, got into high school [Samuel C. Armstrong Manual Training High School, Washington, D.C.].  I was on the baseball team there.
Speaker 1: And as a young person in elementary school, did you have dreams and aspirations at this time?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that.  I don't think that I--was going that--don't remember that at all.
Story_ID: 5295
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Attended church on Sundays only. And the church was in--we called it Georgetown [neighborhood of Washington, D.C.], but it was really outside of Georgetown on New Hampshire Avenue.  Better still close to the Watergate area. There was a little church there called Rock Creek Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.].  My memories of that was that it was always hot. They didn't have fans then, you know, the fans that you--those little manual fans, paper fans, cardboard.
Speaker 1: And did you see many of your friends at church? What was your experiences like at church?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think--I was too young to--see, I was living in two worlds. I was living in a world where I lived in Montgomery County [Maryland], and most of the people--I don't remember any of my relatives going--relatives and/or friends going to the same church.  So I never really looked at church as some place I really wanted to go back then. There was a lot of shouting and falling out and, and it was always hot.
Speaker 1: Did you go reluctantly?
Speaker 2: Yes, I would say I would prefer to have done something else, you know, at that early age.
Story_ID: 5296
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your junior high school years? What junior high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: [John] Francis Junior High School [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And who were some of your friends at Francis Junior High School?
Speaker 2: Ulysses Little, better known as 'Seeslo'. (laughs)
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about your friends.
Speaker 2: Roland Grimes, Henry Cook, oh my goodness.  Frank Prokes (ph.), he was good friend of mine, lived nearby, nearby the school. So it was fun.
Speaker 1: So what kind of things did you all enjoy doing and what kind of person were you at this time?  What kind of young man were you becoming?
Speaker 2: Oh, outgoing, friendly, happy go lucky.  I don't mean that in a dangerous way, I just mean it in a playful way.  Always playing some kind of athlete football, baseball--a lot of baseball.  Even I played basketball, I wasn't good at it.  I could never get that ball to go through that hoop for nothing in the world. (laughs) Always running and sweating, but never could get it to go down.
Speaker 1: Can you describe some of your experiences in junior high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, by that time, keep in mind when I left school which is in Washington [D.C.], going back to Maryland, there--on the side of the road, there was a little strip maybe fifty yards long, and that's where I used to start hitting golf balls.  And the guys--the older guys in the neighborhood, Leonard Harris, Werther Harris, Percy, they were adults to me. They would go caddy at, at Kenwood Golf Course [Kenwood Golf and Country Club, Bethesda, Maryland], and somehow I got a golf stick and found the golf balls and I would always--when I couldn't find the guys to play football with, I would hit my little golf ball.
Speaker 1: And what was that like for you?  I mean were your other friends interested in golf?
Speaker 2: Well yes, but they were not necessarily playing with the same place that I was you know. But it was very, very interesting for me and peaceful.  I was communing with nature as well because from where I lived, in the distance was the Potomac River.  So I could--"Oh, there's a river over there."  And that was always interesting to me.  And of course, I saw the river closer when I would ride the streetcar going to elementary school [Phillips-Wormley School, Washington, D.C.] and junior high school and I could see the river off to the right.  So it was always--you know, those snapshots were always being taken.
Story_ID: 5297
Speaker 1: So when did you start developing love for photography or an interest in photography, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well it was years later.  I went to Atlantic City [New Jersey] oh--maybe it started happening prior to that. What has happened is that while I was--I would say probably in my, in high school [Samuel C. Armstrong Manual Training High School, Washington, D.C.], I would ride the streetcar (pauses) traveling up and down U Street--Florida Avenue there was the Scurlock [Photographic] Studio and they always had luminaries in--from the black community in their windows.  Now on another track you had--I would ride the Number 40, I think streetcar going to Lincoln Park and that would take me past G Street Northwest--14th [Street] and 13th [Street] on G and there was a Harris and Ewing Studio. And in their windows, and I can see them right now, I could see President [Dwight D.] Eisenhower's portrait in the window.  Always black and white and they were 16" x 20", 20" x 24"s, and I remember [President] Harry [S.] Truman's portrait being there.  And so I get a feeling that all of those travel--where I didn't know where they were taking me--of these snapshots that I was getting that my mind was taking day after day after day, month after month, year after year.  I said, "Hmm, isn't that interesting?  Isn't that interesting?"  And then, I used to just enjoy looking at them.  Not that I wanted to take portraits--I was calling them pictures at the time.  And so it took years later before those experiences started to--have what you call an epithany [sic, epiphany].  "Ah-ha, ah-ha!  Now I know where this has been coming from!  This has been coming from--you remember I was riding the streetcar up and down G Street. And then I rode the bus up and down--or the streetcar up and down Florida Avenue, U Street?"  I say, "That's where this thing came from."  And it took years. I was--that experience was year after year and a lot of times day after day, week after week that was--and I just enjoyed them, looking at them. But it took years before I realized that first of all it had made an impression on me, and secondly that I was receptive to this impression that I enjoyed it.  I loved it.  So--I went to Atlantic City, oh, let's say for the sake of discussion, probably 1960, and I bought an Atlas [brand] camera.
Speaker 1: Is that your first camera?
Speaker 2: That I remember.  $13.00.  Isn't that something?  A camera for $13.00.  You can't buy film today for $13.00.  But it was a 35mm [millimeter] camera for $13.00--still not acknowledging that the interest was there.  But just saying, "Well I want to do something, you know."  And so it was--something happened, something happened--oh I know.  By this time I had been working at NIH [National Institutes of Health, Washington, D.C.], so we're really talking about 1958.  That's when I started working at NIH.
Story_ID: 5298
Speaker 1: What high school did you attend and what year did you graduate from there?
Speaker 2: Well I started at Armstrong [Samuel C. Armstrong Manual Training High School, Washington, D.C.] in 1953.
Speaker 1: And you graduated in 1957?
Speaker 2: 1956.
Speaker 1: 1956?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was high school like for you?  Who were some of your friends, what were some of the things you were interested in?
Speaker 2: Well I never really thought I was a good student.  But I should tell you this, my classmates voted me the president of the class. I don't know why they did that. (laughs) I must have had some kind of influence on them, so I was--I wasn't all bad.  I was a shirt and necktie. (laughs)
Speaker 1: And who were some of the people who were influencing you?  Any of your teachers at that particular time?  Do you remember some of your teachers?
Speaker 2: Shirley O. Brown. He was--he's a man--was a teacher, and--they were just trying to keep me in line.  I--the influence they had on to keep me from doing something I shouldn't have been doing. That was their influence.
Speaker 1: Well who else was influencing you at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm missing a guy's--I can't think of his name.  I can see an image of this tall guy, and of course, the name escapes--Mrs. Wells, I can see Mrs. Wells.  Mrs. Wells just happened to--she was my English teacher, not a teacher that--very nice and gentle. She is what I'd consider a sweet teacher. She was just sweet.  Very, very nice. But I never anticipated getting anything more than a D from Mrs. Wells. And I knew that was what I was going to get before I started the class, and that's what I got. I got a D from Mrs. Wells, but she--I just liked her. She was just a nice lady.  And then later I got to meet her son.  I was friendly with her son and still am today.
Speaker 1: And what kinds of things were you doing with your time?  What kinds of things interested you?  How did you spend your time as a young man in high school?
Speaker 2: Well keep in mind I was very, very skinny in school because I spent a lot of time playing sports.  And if it wasn't football or baseball--those took up most of my time.  Football and baseball and riding my bicycle to Cabin John [Montgomery county, Maryland] and to further on Macarthur Boulevard to--going what we considered to be Carderock in David Taylor's Model Basin [now the David Taylor Model Basin, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Bethesda, Maryland] which is still there by the way. So I, I was always so busy doing all these activities that I couldn't gain any weight, you know.  I was eating, but burning it up. So I would go anyplace to play baseball, football.
Speaker 1: And did you enjoy this time in your life, in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh very much so.  Oh yes, yes.  By this time in high school, I also got to play on the golf team. I played on the golf team in high school and on the baseball team.  And I was fast.  Yes.  I ran fast.
Speaker 1: And were you beginning to think about photography as a career or interested in photography at that time?
Speaker 2: No, absolutely not, absolutely not. But again, when we had--I started to think about, because I got to meet the person who owned the studio, Scurlock [Photographic] Studio.  And they took class pictures, class portraits.  And I often thought, I said, "Was that influencing me too?"  So I guess it was.
Speaker 1: And at this time, what were you thinking that you wanted to be when you grow up or what were you thinking that you wanted to do with your life?
Speaker 2: I didn't know.  I didn't really know and I didn't--I didn't have no one that I remember pushing me in any specific direction and I was just anxious to get out of high school and didn't know where I was going to go after that or what I was going to do, and--it was all good.  All good.
Story_ID: 5299
Speaker 1: Shortly after you graduated from high school [Samuel C. Armstrong Manual Training High School, Washington, D.C.], you met your father [Herman Stanley Clipper]--when you were twenty-one [years old]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, I met my father and--,
Speaker 1: What was that like for you?
Speaker 2: --very interesting.  A cousin of mine, Delores Jenkins, had had contact with my father, knew where he lived, and had made some contact with him and as I said he was a minister and he was coming to Baltimore [Maryland] to speak at a church, at a revival, I imagine that's what it was.  And that's where we met then. One night in the late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: And what was that meeting like?
Speaker 2: Well, you know--I didn't know what to anticipate, was very anxious and it was just good.  It was good.  I enjoyed that and we--you might say we just became friends. We started communicating more, you know.
Speaker 1: Why had there been no contact prior to that?
Speaker 2: Well things had probably happened during the separation and divorce of my mother [Viola Whitby Clipper] and father, you know. And then he went on to live another life.
Speaker 1: And he moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] you said?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's where he was, in Philadelphia, and from Philadelphia, moved to Plainfield, New Jersey.

Speaker 1: While you were still in high school [Samuel C. Armstrong Manual Training High School, Washington, D.C.] and about to graduate, did you know that you wanted to go to college at this time?
Speaker 2: No. I wasn't the kind of student that felt like I could get in.  I just hadn't thought about it, you know.  And keep in mind that the environment I grew up in there were not--no one that I knew in my community that went to college.
Speaker 1: Why did you end--how did you end up going?
Speaker 2: Well, well actually after I got out of--after I graduated from high school in--my mother [Viola Whitby Clipper] suggested I--there was a job for me at NIH [National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland] if I went over there, I could probably get a job.  And--well wait a minute now.  It seems to me, it seems to me prior to that happening, prior to that happening, I went to work--right after I got out of high school, I went to work--at the National Institutes of--no, no, no, National Zoo [Washington, D.C.], National Zoo for a short while, cleaning up stuff and cleaning out the--picking up trash, cleaning up the duck pond and I didn't like that, and I expressed that, so the guy said, "Well if you don't like this then you know you can leave."  And--of course I left, and didn't mind it, I mean it was just a--so I always felt like you know you--well I wasn't thinking that way at the time, but you know you--we all are destined for something and the--most of the time it's great, it's great, you know.  We just have to identify it.
Speaker 1: So--let's talk about the time you spent in the military. That was from 1961 to 1963, you were in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Well yes, but by this time I did--if we go back to NIH which precedes the Army, I was--my mother had suggested I go to NIH and there was a job there that she thought I could get, and this job was a nursing assistant. That's where you carried the patients to their appointments.
Speaker 1: How did you like that job?
Speaker 2: And part of it was working the bed pans and also swing shifts which meant you worked any segment within the 24 hours.  12 [A.M.] to 8 [A.M.], 8 [A.M.] to 4 [P.M.], you know.  I didn't like that 4 [P.M.] to 12 [A.M.].  So I didn't like that. But what I got out of that and what I realized is that what makes me think, you know, every--there's something good in every experience.  That experience may not be good, but there's some good in the experience. So--one of my jobs was to take patients to photography to have their pictures taken for whatever reason, and the reason varied.  And I noticed that when I went there, the nursing outfit that I wore was with khaki pants and a white shirt.  But now when I took the patients to photography, these guys were all--well some of them were in shirt and tie.  And whatever they had on, it wasn't a uniform like what I had on which was identifiable, that you knew that guy was a nursing assistant.  You could see this--the photographers and you would know whether he was doctor or a photographer. So I said "Oh boy," I said, "Those guys' job is much cleaner than mine. I think I like that."  This was talking to myself now.  I said, "Ooh boy, I like that."  And so I decided.  I said, "Wow, what I'll do is I'll start studying photography, so I can get into this, you know?"
Story_ID: 5301
Speaker 1: So I applied for photography class at the Agricultural Department [U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.]. I was accepted.  I said "Ooh boy, great."  At the same time I got--
Speaker 2: What year was this, Mr. Clipper?
Speaker 1: Oh, the idea came in 1961.
Speaker 2: And this was the year after you had already brought your first camera?
Speaker 1: Shortly after I bought that, yeah. I would say so.  Yes. But still not knowing where I'm going now.  I just happened to--it was just a happenstance that I bought the camera.  Then I saw this picture in front of me with these guys taking pictures, and it was clean.  I liked that.  So I applied for the Agricultural Department, was accepted by the Agricultural Department, and at the same time, it was a President we had back then that had just gotten to the White House.  His name was John Fitzgerald Kennedy.  He sent me a letter, and he said he'd like to have me in his Army.  I said, "Oh my God."  So I got married June the 3rd, went off to the [U.S.] Army in September.  So--but it didn't leave--the idea never left me, so when I got in the military, I started taking a correspondence course in photography. I took a correspondence course, and then I used to pull guard duty for the soldiers. And I would make money--ten dollars, twenty dollars, pulling guard duty for them. And then I would pull KP [kitchen patrol] for them.  And, and then--I was a real entrepreneur--so then I would take the, I would take the money that I made from the guard duty and the KP and then the guys, around the fifteenth of the month or sometimes sooner for some of them, they needed to borrow money.  So I would give them--let them have ten dollars, and at payday they owed me twenty dollars. And so this went on, and then to have some of the guys--those jokesters--would duck me when it came time to pay me my money. So then that ten dollars was the same as I would be lending them twenty dollars 'cause that would be tying the money up.  So anyway I was paid for that, you know.  But, but it always--which was good. I laugh about it today. There was a guy name Green, and Green had green eyes.  But that was really his name. And he owed me I guess eighty dollars, and I was looking for him--I'm in the State of Washington in the military. Looking for him, looking because he wasn't in my same barracks where I was.  I had go across the quadrant to get to him.  So I went over there to get--they said "Oh, well he's in the--I think he maybe someplace, I think he went in the men's room."  So I went in the men's room looking for Green.  I looked all around and I didn't see him. I was waiting--I think he owed me eighty dollars.  I looked for Green, and looked for Green and couldn't find Green any place.  The bathroom's not that large.  I happened to open one of the doors to the stall and there was Green perched up on the commode seat, crunched up.  I said, "Green if you don't come out of there and give me my money--"  But I laugh about that today. That was a great experience.  And so actually during that same time, as I said I had purchased a camera with the money I had made from pulling guard duty and KP, and my other business.  And bought a camera and I was taking, I was taking I thought--I called them pictures at the time which was portraits of all of my military guys.  And the portraits at that time, they were all black and white.  And I developed them on the base. They were only three dollars, three dollars. And that was fun. Fun, fun, fun.  So I went around the Army base taking portraits. I took the sheets off the bed and I draped them over the dividers and that was my background.
Speaker 2: And how did you do?
Speaker 1: It was fun. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was an experience that I, I just wish I had know that that's really where I was going, you know. I was going to be a portrait artist, you know?  But it was, it was a great foundation.  I took the portraits and the guys in the Army there. This was in Fort Lewis, Washington, in the state of Washington. I moved from there taking portraits in Tacoma, Washington and I also took some in Seattle, Washington.
Speaker 2: And so you spent two years in the Army?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 5302
Speaker 1: And then after the [U.S.] Army, did you go onto UDC [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] at this point?
Speaker 2: No, not that fast. What happened was I came back. I said, "I didn't want to go back into nursing."  So what I did, I got a job in glassware, washing glassware at NIH [National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland], because remember, I didn't, I didn't like the nursing, right?  So I went into glassware, I stayed there for a few months, went back to the Agricultural Department [U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.] to take some more classes--after I got back out of the Army, took some more classes. And then something happened, something happened, things started happening fast at this point.  I--and I can't explain. I got in the photography section.  I had applied for--to go into and work in the photography section.  I managed to get into photography. I don't know how that happened, but I did.  Okay.  So I worked there and--for a short while, then I encouraged them--I don't know how this happened, to let me take a sabbatical.  I took a sabbatical and by this time I had already joined a professional photography organization, The Maryland Professional Photographers Association.  They let me take the sabbatical for six months, went away to school in Vermont and studied there.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: We're talking about 1966, 1967. (pauses) Great time in Woodstock--South Woodstock, Vermont. That's where the school was. [John W.] Doscher Country School of Photography.  In the hills of Vermont.  Loved it.  No black people there at all. There were two besides myself.  Got to meet them once, saw them only twice while I was there.  I was there from--I started there in the school in October of 1961.
Speaker 1: 1961 or 1966?
Speaker 2: 1966 I meant to say.  1966.  Started in October 1966 to April 1967.
Speaker 1: And so at this point, did you know this is what I want to do for a career?
Speaker 2: I knew I was into something.  I knew I was into something, and by this time, when I came back out of Vermont. I came back to NIH, started working there, and then some things really started picking up. By this time, I had--I was part of the Maryland Professional Photographers Association.  Then we had speakers to come in monthly.  Professionals in a specialized area.  And one of the people that I studied under back then was [William] Bill Stockwell, and that was--he was teaching about weddings. And then one that really caught hold to me, really caught my interest, the name was Joseph Zeltsman, Z-E-L-T-S-M-A-N out of Marstown, Pennsylvania--Marstown, New Jersey [sic, Morris Plains, New Jersey].  And Joseph Zeltsman I like to tell people was a portrait mechanic and he taught me the mechanics of portraiture.  The posing, the lighting and I enjoyed studying with him. And I guess that was--that was the late 1960s. That could have been--that was probably 1967 as well.
Story_ID: 5303
Speaker 1: So Mr. Clipper you spent some time studying with Joseph Zeltsman and did that seal it for you? Did you know that this is what I want to do with my life?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I knew definitively that what I wanted to do.  I knew it, you know.  It wasn't a question.  As a matter of fact, I, I always thought I was a slow learner and people in the class [at John W. Doscher Country School of Photography, South Woodstock, Vermont], they went up and did whatever they were doing taking portraits. And I--but I never felt that I, I felt that I kept on easing away from them, easing away from some kind of--that was--at least that was my thinking.  I, I never voiced this, you know.  I had no reason to talk about it.  But I didn't see that they were doing the things that I was, that I was doing, you know, or commanding the--a portion of the market that I was commanding, you know.
Speaker 1: So how did you--how does the process work for you?  Do you visualize the image in your mind first, or how does it work for you?  How are you able to capture the perfect moment and capture these perfect, almost--portraits?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess there's several things really that comes to my mind. First--not acknowledging it at first, but I became aware of it in another epiphany--"Ah-ha!"  There is that inexhaustible source out there that's working for me, with me all the time.  And I didn't know it for a long time.  Once I recognized it, I said, "Oh, so I do have some help. Somebody is looking after me." (laughs) So, taking what I had learned from Joseph Zeltsman and--which was in 1967, and I had the dos and don'ts.  I had the feminine pose, I had the masculine pose, you know. And then I was a frequent visitor to museums.  I got to see and I studied with Paul Linwood Gittings at the--shortly thereafter.  And while--after--keep in mind I only studied with Zeltsman for a week. But I would go over and over and over and over the things that he taught me.  Not getting them right the first, second or third time. But I was tenacious. I didn't give up.  I knew I saw what I liked and I wasn't going to take not getting it the first time, then I wasn't going to get it at all.  I just kept on and I kept on and I didn't get it right the first time, second time or third time. It was much like when I was in the military.  I used to develop the film hoping and praying that I had something on the film and a lot of times there was nothing.  Nothing.
Speaker 1: So this is around the '60s [1960s] and--,
Speaker 2: I'm in the '60s [1960s].  Yes.
Speaker 1: --And you had the opportunity to take some ver-, what are now very famous photographs, portraits. Tell me a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Well I think--there's a little bit of background that goes into that. I think was the background was is that during the same time that I was studying with Zeltsman prior to that--prior to Zeltsman and even after Zeltsman.  Every lunch hour--keep in mind I'm still working at NIH [National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland] in the photo lab.  So every lunch hour, I would spend my time studying the books and I do mean books of Yousuf Karsh.  Yousuf Karsh was the international portrait photographer.  And I just thought his work was just fabulous. Great work.  Great work.  And so--in my mind's eye, I wanted to be a Yousuf Karsh.  And I had some clients--of course (unclear) Alexander's the one person who said, "You know, you're the black Karsh.  You're the black Karsh."  And I thought that was a great compliment to me, you know.  And keep in mind I studied this man's work every day in day out, week in week out, month in month out.  So I decided that, "You know, I'm going to meet this guy.  International portrait artist, doing what I want to do.  Had photographed all the [U.S.] presidents from [Grover] Cleveland to [Bill] Clinton. That's saying a lot. So I made arrangements to--I found out where he lived, it was in New York City [New York], had a studio on Madison Avenue, went to meet him. I don't remember the year I went to meet him--well I do remember the year.  The first visit I don't remember the year.  It could have been '68 [1968] as well.  And then he had a showing in Rittenhouse Square in Mr. [Frank G.] Binswanger's [Sr.] apartment on Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So I was there with all the big wheels.  So that happened right after the riots in Washington [D.C.]. So we're talking about immediately after April 4th of 1968.  Never forget it.  That someone complimented--I complimented someone, one of the guests about his neck ties--"Ooh, that's a gorgeous neck tie."  Keep in mind it's right after the riots. So he proceeded to take the neck tie off of his neck--I'm very young and naive now at that time.  So he took the neck tie off of his neck and started wrapping it around his hand, fist I called it.  So I said, "Oh my God, this guy's going to hit me upside my head with this--."  Keep in mind it's right after the riots, so I'm--that's where my thinking was.  So anyway, he gave the neck tie to me.  He said "In my culture, when someone compliments something that you have on, you take it off and give it to them."  So I said, "Isn't that nice.  Let me try that again and see if I find a guy that has a suit on that fits me." (laughs) Yeah.  So that was 1968.
Speaker 1: So--what was your wife thinking about all of this, this hobby that was perhaps about to turn into a career, and was she supportive?  What were things like at home?
Speaker 2: Well by this time I was, I was in my second marriage.  I was married to Grace Elizabeth Clipper and Grace was supporting me--did support me all throughout that.  She was with me when I went to my first visit with the Karshes. She was with me when I went to Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia.
Story_ID: 5304
Speaker 1: How did it come about that you ended up taking some very now-famous civil rights portraits?
Speaker 2: Well what had happened, I started--and I don't know where the idea came from. I don't take credit for it even though it might--may have been my idea, but I just don't remember now.  Well I started doing invitational sittings, and I would do invitational sittings of the diplomatic corps. Keep in mind many of the countries in Africa had only had their independence just a few years at that time.  We're talking about the early '70s [1970s].  On another track, I was taking invitational sittings of the [U.S.] Congressional Black Caucus members.  Now, this is where the tricky part comes in.  There were some members of the Congressional Black Caucus that then commissioned me to take their portrait.  I had already done their portraits on the invitational sittings.  Let me use just two for an example--well use more than that.  First, [U.S.] Congressman Charles C. [Coles] Diggs, Jr., a congressman from Detroit, Michigan, said, "I want you to take my portrait for [U.S.] Congress."  "Ooh, this is getting to be serious in there." So I took--keep in mind that this is the second sitting now.  I've already done one of the invitational sittings.  Now I'm doing something for a specific reason.  Some of these invitational sittings, the people did buy the portrait.  But now I'm being commissioned to do his portrait, so I did it.  So now this is where the story really starts.  The unveiling of this portrait, I mean it was just--it had just launched me into deep water.  Deep waters--unexpected deep waters.  And the likes of [Andrew] Andy Young. The Vice President at the time was Gerald Ford, who spoke--all these people, Thomas Eagleton [U.S. Senator from Missouri]. So it was a big--it was a Congressional activity. They made a book on the--on this unveiling, the unveiling of Charles Diggs, January 30, 1974.  So then after that, [U.S.] Congressman Parren J. [James] Mitchell [Representative from Maryland] then commissioned me to do his portrait for Congress.  I'm fast and moving fast and not knowing--I was going through this experience, but not cognizant of all the experiences I was having.  The impact of what I was doing--did his portrait, unveiled it. Then, later years, we're going into--.
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit to--how did you become involved in the civil rights portraits that you did, like the portrait of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], Stokely Carmichael [later called Kwame Ture] and Rev. Jesse Jackson.  How did you become involved in that?
Speaker 2: Well, my recollection of that is fuzzy because I didn't look at that--I was working on several tracks.  I was doing portraits over here and then I was doing weddings and perhaps events--things to make money.  How I got to do the portrait or the picture of Dr. King and Stokely and Jesse Jackson--that's sort of fuzzy in my mind because I was at--the minister's name was Jeff [Jefferson Paramore] Rogers.  My dear friend Doug--Rev. Douglas Moore, he probably remembers more how I got there, you know. It was a long time that I tried to find out what the date was, because I really wanted to get--have that article for my archives.  And I did find it.  I did find it.
Speaker 1: And what was the date?  It was February, 1968.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: That's just a few months before he passed.
Speaker 2: Right.  And at the time you took that photo, did you have any idea that this would become a world famous portrait?  That this would become a very famous photograph?
Speaker 1: There's nothing that I have done, period, that I have an inkling of where I was going or what I was doing.  I was just living this experience today, and it was all good. And so I'm really, I'm really trying to go back to now to get something. I say, "Oh my God,  I wish I'd have known what I was doing when I did it, you know.  I wish I had had someone to have taken some snapshots of me when I met Yousuf Karsh."  Yousuf Karsh is a world renowned portrait artist.  He's done all the presidents--[President of France] Charles de Gaulle--you name them, he did them.
Story_ID: 5305
Speaker 1: What portrait are you most proud of?
Speaker 2: Well, there are several.  The one, the mother and the baby which is on my, on my postcard.  It's--it speaks to me. The one of Charles Diggs, [U.S.] Congressman Charles [Coles] Diggs [Jr.] and I point to those two for two good reasons.  Number one--now people like to give me credit where sometimes I don't think I've really earned it and I think, as I said earlier, I think there's a source of energy that's working for you with you in spite of you.  You can't pose a baby 'til six months old to touch their mother's lip.  You can't do that. That doesn't happen, you know. So I set the stage and it happened.  That's that energy again that's working. That's the intelligence that's working for you and with you.  In spite of you, in many cases.  Okay. That's one there.  I like that.  The other one is Congressman Charles Diggs.  Congressman Charles Diggs's portrait where he's looking down.  I'd already taken a number of portraits, and I was really just about finished.  Had finished.  And he relaxed and he fell into that pose.  I said, "Ah-ha!"  Another epiphany and that's how I captured it.  I like the one I did of Pops Donaldson.  Pops Donaldson was someone that came out of what we called--it was called in as well, 'Resurrection City'.  And as you probably already know, Resurrection City came after the death of [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], after he was assassinated.
Speaker 1: And--did--was there any particular portrait that really put you on the map where the phone is just ringing off the hook one people saw that and they said "Oh, I have to get you to do my portrait as well?"
Speaker 2: Well I think--I didn't say any particular portrait.  I believe that people start looking at the work and a lot of things that people were thinking and feeling and experiencing, they did not verbally share with me. But would share it with their family members or their friends. They said "You know, that guy Clipper over there, you know he's good.  He's expensive.  He's good."  And I used to hear people say this you know, "I'm going to get me a Clipper.  You wait and see."  Or I've had friends that say, "I want a Clipper."  And it--for the longest time it didn't mean anything to me.  Or I didn't understand what they meant by what they were saying. They were saying this is something to, to have.  "If you really want quality, that is something you should own."  "If he's good enough to do it for [U.S.] Congress, he's got to be good."  "If it's good enough to do it for these embassies, all those ambassadors, he's good."  I'm saying those were unspoken communications that I think was going on.
Speaker 1: And--tell me a little bit about what--who you think has been the most famous person's portrait that you have done.  And why do you think so?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say that there are probably several on that same category.  Congressman Diggs--all the congressmen that I've mentioned thus far.  Congressman Diggs's portrait unveiled that.  And the unveiling is just an experience that it just makes you feel so good you know.  It's, it's an experience, if you haven't had it, you can't explain it. It's just one of those kinds of feelings, you know.  Congressman Diggs's portrait was very important.  [U.S.] Congressman Parren [James] Mitchell in order, in those orders, you know.  Then I unveiled Congressman [Ronald V.] Dellums's portrait. That was very, very exciting to me you know. I get so many good feelings from the portraits that I have done, you know, when I look at some of the family portraits I have done you know, for an example, let's take a Margaret Stewart, President, Stewart Funeral Home [Washington, D.C.], you know.  And I get people share back experiences, you know.  "I'm very glad I had that done, you know."  "That's so nice, you know."  And some of the people--none of us are here forever, you see.  We're not here forever.  So, so what I have done, and a lot of times I didn't know I was doing when I did it, didn't know the impact that it would have, the significance that it would have to the recipients of the portrait.  And not only the recipients, but the family behind that recipient, you know, children, or grandchildren.  Because I've done some families, three generations already, you know. So it, it's those kinds of things that make me so appreciative that--that that inexhaustible source have chosen me to show this expression through.
Speaker 1: So do you think in a way it kind of immortalizes a person or family?
Speaker 2: That's what they tell me.  That's what they tell me.
Speaker 1: Is that what you hope it does?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I just--I was just used as an instrument to make this contribution. So I've been chosen to--for this to come through, you know.  And I'm, I'm grateful.
Story_ID: 5306
Speaker 1: We've talked about many famous people who you've done portraits of or either photographed.  What about places?  I know that you were also very interested in places and you know capturing wonderful places as well. So tell me a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I traveled with a dear friend--[Rev.] Grady [E.] Poulard and Betty Yakes (ph.), they put on travel trips, going abroad.  In 1999, I went to South Africa with them and in Cape Town--at Cape Point in Cape Town, South Africa, we came into this mountain. That's where several oceans come together in the ocean--and the Atlantic Ocean come together.  And--so you have the mountain and this ocean coming into the mountain. That was breathtaking for me, so I enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: What do you enjoy most?  Places and inanimate objects or actual portraits of people?
Speaker 2: Well, as quiet as it's kept, portrait is my life, but these other areas of--the scenics--they play a role in my life.  And actually, that's through my, my grandfather being a river person up and down C & O [Chesapeake and Ohio] Canal [Washington, D.C.], you know, I feel that that's--that has played a role--that's in my genes. I find myself going to (pauses)--C & O Canal to a place we call 'Wide Water'--the C & O Canal and I photograph that.  I started photographing in that particular area in 1993.  The snow storm of 1993.  I don't want to influence you to make--to think that that's the first time I photographed the C & O Canal, but at that area.  I started, before I knew I was going to go into photography, taking pictures of the C & O Canal and the Potomac River, probably late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s] when I first started, but not the Wide Water.  So the Wide Water, I've done it probably every snowstorm since 1993, and that was a large snowstorm.  I go back to the same area and photograph it.  And they all are different.
Story_ID: 5307
Speaker 1: And what do you get out of it--in both of them?
Speaker 2: Ah-hah.  Ah-hah.  It's very, very gratifying, you know.  In fact, I've shared with people.  I would enjoy what I do, and I have enjoyed what I do when I didn't get paid.  I. I had an experience and this--and I really mean that, I've--there is a certain gratification that I receive taking a portrait of an individual.  You know, getting to pose them in a feminine pose.  Clothing them in what I consider the proper clothing.  Let me give you an example.  Let's say the lady's dressed in a blue dress. We have her in a blue dress, long sleeves, a V neckline. She has all the accessories to go with that to make her it.  And then I'll pose her in a feminine pose.  Then I'll light her, normally short lighting.  I like short lighting.  So all of this does is just brings out the beauty that's already there, accentuates her.  The V neckline sets the head right--it points right to the subject's face.  Which is very attractive to me.
Speaker 1: And how do you think photography and history are linked?
Speaker 2: Well I never thought about how photography and history are linked.  But as I see it today, it's that I can't imagine what it's--what the port-, what's the story that when I leave the legacy that I will leave, what the portraits will do.  People--what I'm getting at is people talk more about you--complimentary things in your absence than they do in your presence.
Speaker 1: But we've always had photographers who and artists who have captured images and that kind of thing that, that we all remember. And are you hoping that that's what people will say about you and that's how you'll be remembered?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I'm praying they will. (laughs) I'm praying.  Yes, yes.  I was put here, I'm an instrument.  I was put here to make a contribution.  All of us were put here to make a contribution.  I just thought that acknowledging that, you know--I didn't--they didn't--that inexhaustible source didn't have to choose me, so I'm grateful that I was chosen.
Story_ID: 5308
Speaker 1: You've done [photographic portraits] many members of [U.S.] Congress.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Any Presidents?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a good question. That's a good question.  In 1976, in 1976, in the--I think a picture was taken at the time of me.  I had a conversation with Andrew Young and we were discussing at this reception--no, I think it was the Pan Africa--convention. And we were discussing the details of getting to do then the current President Jimmy Carter's portrait. So I was in negotiation with the White House [Washington, D.C.] to do his portrait.  The answer, "Did I get to do his portrait?"  No I didn't.  I experienced or at least I thought I experienced that it was political, but Arthur Ashe's wife [Jeanne Ashe] got to do it.  I did have Mr. Vernon Jordan to write a letter to the White House to do the then President [William] Bill Clinton's portrait.  But it never came about.

Speaker 1: We were talking a little bit about just what you get out of it. How do you hope you'll be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well as a young black guy, my name is Joseph Daniel Clipper that did a lot of portraits, put a lot of life into--enjoying the people's lives because it captured the moment you know, and without what he did, some of us wouldn't have shared these experiences, would not have had them, you know.  No two people do the same thing the same way you know, so I bring a different energy to my work and so does other people.  You know, some people like the energy that I bring to my work, and thank God that they do, you know, and I'm just happy that I could do that.
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about--how do you feel that the way you lived your life and what is most important to you?
Speaker 2: Well right now, I can't imagine what I could have chosen to do or what could have chosen me to do that I would have had--could have had as much fun as I have had taking portraits of people around this country.
Speaker 1: And what's most important to you right now? Or, throughout your life, what's been most important to you?
Speaker 2: Being able to share the talents that have been given to me as a gift with others. That, that's important.
Story_ID: 5310
Speaker 1: And for people interested in a career in photography, what kind of advice do you have for them?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a career that you can make a good living at.  I don't look at it as--I just look at it as something that has been a gift to me and I know it's a job, but I have so much fun at what I do, you know, it's not looked at as a job to me.  It's not something I begrudgingly have to get up every morning to go out and do this, you know, as I did when I worked at NIH [National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland] as a nursing assistant.  I didn't want to go to work at 4:00 [P.M.] in the evening or 12:00 [A.M.] midnight, you know. It wasn't something that I looked forward to.  But when I have a sitting, I can't wait to get out to it, you know, to do it.  So you feel the difference?  It's not a job, it's a love.
Speaker 1: And what would you say to a young person who is interested in pursuing a career in this particular area? What would you tell them?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say this that first of all, they--it's important to get the, the workings of photography down.  Then the mechanics of portraiture, get that down.  And then--that's just a foundation. Then the other, the other is that I look at what I do. There's a spiritual side of what I do.  I think there is and I know I'm repeating myself, that there is an inexhaustable source that's working for me, with me because of me.  There's working for me--"When I'm going doing portraits?"  And because of that attitude, I think that there's always something that is helping me, where I need help, keep me propped up, and believe me I need to be propped up. (laughs)
Speaker 1: What's the key to being a successful portrait artist?
Speaker 2: Love for people.  Being open, receptive.  Just being embracing and loving people.  On--in general--obviously, all people are not the same.  They have good intentions.  It just doesn't come across that way all the time, you know.  So it's being a people person that's, that will be more--it's more important or it's just as important as the skill of your craft.
Story_ID: 5311
Speaker 1: Have you ever had someone who wasn't happy with their portrait?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's usually nothing to do very much with me, even though someone may have said that, but it's usually--in my experience, it's been about clothing and I give clothing consultations prior to my sittings most of the time--99 percent of the time, there is a clothing consultation.  It's rare that I, I'm in a situation where the person did not have a clothing consultation.  Now, even I just did a sitting for someone who just came from out of town.  I would probably sit down with them maybe ten, fifteen minutes. I did give him a clothing consultation, yes.
Speaker 1: And what do you do when somebody isn't happy?
Speaker 2: I'm always open and receptive to doing the sitting again.  And I do have sittings like that.  And I welcome them when I have to do it the second time.  It gives me an opportunity to be with that person for the second time, to share my love and to receive their love.  And it's really what happens.  I did, I did a sitting of the Dunmore family.  Dr. Lawrence Dunmore and Mrs. Gloria Dunmore and--in 2003.  It was very interesting.  The immediate family, their children, their children's husbands and then the grandchildren.  Well their first sitting, the grandchildren didn't know me and it didn't come off as well as what--we were left with to have come off.  So we had to do a second sitting.  So, that was a great opportunity for me to get together with them again.  And I look at it that way because that's really the way it is.  It really--if you have a love for people, when I say a love for people, I mean a sincere love for people, then you welcome those experiences.  You say, "Oh my God, I've got to do that sitting over again, you mean I'm going to have to go through that again?"  I don't see it that way.  I don't see it that way, you know because these are all loving people.  Now, I'm not saying all people come across as always being loving people.  That loving aspect of them resides in their heart.  And for some reason, it takes time. Whatever those barriers that are keeping them from sharing that love with you fades away.  Dissipates.  So I welcome the second sitting.  I don't remember when I've had a third sitting.  But if you look at it, some of these people, after the first sitting, after you deliver the portrait, you usually--you don't have an opportunity to get together that often.  Maybe not ever.  So I like it.  And so you, you get a feel from where I come from?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So I love it.
Story_ID: 5312
Speaker 1: Whose portrait have you not done that you'd like to do, that you'd still like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to do [U.S. President] Bill Clinton's portrait at some point.  There are probably others that--he's one that I, you know, I know that.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And is there anything that you've done already that you wish you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a good question. I say a good question because there's--I critique my work after I've done it, you know.  I say, "You know, I wish I had had the head turn this way a little bit."  Maybe, if it's a lady, I say, "Maybe I should have had it turned that way a little bit, you know, the eyes are looking down--I wish I would have had the eyes looking--it would have been so much brighter if the eyes would have been looking this way, you know."  So I'm always working and massaging my, my--what I do, you know. So I had not taken the perfect portrait.  The mother and the baby was just a, such a sweet tender portrait.  Probably could have been changed, maybe just moving the finger or something just a little bit because as you know, I didn't pose it.  It's just that it happened and I captured it.
Speaker 1: Any regrets?
Speaker 2: My regrets.  I had an invitation to go to Nigeria to take a portrait of this king--chief, excuse me.  This chief, he had several wives. He wanted me to go to Nigeria to take his--take some portraits of his wives.  And the logistics couldn't be worked out and I wasn't comfortable with it, you know, and like lodging.  I've never been to Nigeria before.  I've never been to Africa before at that time.  So I wasn't comfortable.  So I regret that I didn't--couldn't work that out some kind of way.  In the late '60s [1960s], this would have been prior to 1968, I was invited by the most successful portrait businessman in the country.  His name was Paul Linwood Gittings, Sr.  And Paul Linwood Gittings, Sr. and I took a class from him in Winona Lake, Indiana, and at the time he invited me to come to Texas to work for him.  And at the time I was dating a young lady, and she said, you know, "Well if you go to Texas, I won't be here when you get back."  Well, I didn't go to Texas. (laughs)  So I regretted that.  So those are regrets, you know.  I, I regretted that there was nothing on film that was captured of me and Yousuf Karsh when we were, when we met.  We met several times.  But nothing was captured--that I would have loved to have had that, you know, hanging on my walls.  Just is a snapshot of me and Yousuf Karsh.  Yousuf Karsh and his lovely wife [Estrellita Karsh], you know. And my other teachers too, because Joseph Zeltsman and Martha Zeltsman, they played a major role because they gave me the mechanics of dos and don'ts.  Masculine pose, a feminine pose.  I knew how to dup--to duplicate those, those poses.  And without that, I never heard anyone teaching portraiture on that level before that, or even after that.  And that's been some years ago.  So I regret that I don't have those.
Speaker 1: And when you look back at your life, what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: It's been a good ride. God, it's been a good ride.

Speaker 1: What message or lesson do you have for your children [Juana Danita Clipper and Hope Jannell Clipper]?
Speaker 2: Hold your dream.  Never lose sight of it, and there are ups and downs.  It's not necessarily an easy road, a smooth road.  But there's smooth spaces on the road. (laughs) Yes, smooth spaces on the road.
Speaker 1: And why do you think history is important, especially in the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, because there will be someone that will come behind me that's going to do bigger and greater things than I've done, you know.  So, and then they'll have--and could use this experience that I've had as perhaps a roadmap or something to give them some guidance, and that it can be done.  Anything's possible.  Don King says, "It's America!  Everything's possible!" (laughs)
Speaker 1: And what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Oh never, never lose sight, that we can always be better than where we are.  And if we look at history, look over our shoulders, we can see that we are now better off than what we were back then, you know.
Speaker 1: And would you like to see more African Americans taking this as a career path?
Speaker 2: Yes, I would, I would.  You know, it's--I think it hasn't been talked about that, you know, there's a lot of success that you can achieve in just doing portraits, 'cause that's all I do is portraits, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you ever wish that you would have done something more, like been a news photographer or something along those lines?
Speaker 2: I never thought of--after I got this bug, after it bit me and after I started to seeing the work of Joseph Zeltsman and studying the books of Yousuf Karsh, nothing else entered my mind.  Nothing else entered my mind.  There's, there's been so much gratification here, even when I did stumble and fall.  Still gratification, you know.  I've got to learn what not to do.
