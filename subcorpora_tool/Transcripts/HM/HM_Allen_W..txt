Speaker 1: Well there's our five icebreaker questions.  Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Probably fish.
Speaker 1: Any particular type?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  I love all of it.  But, and that's the great thing about fish.  There's so many varieties, you can eat it every day and rarely repeat themselves in a year.
Speaker 1: This is true.  Now you're making me hungry (laughter).  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: No?  Okay.  Special vacation spots?
Speaker 2: Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Do you go to Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, Vineyard Haven [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I've been going to Oak Bluffs, but the wife [Enid Meadows Allen] has changed five miles (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter)  Okay.
Speaker 2: --just to Vineyard Haven.
Speaker 1: There's only so much space on an island.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Probably summer.  I, being a native Floridian, I'm more comfortable with heat.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  That's fair enough.  And is there a particular saying that you have that people know you by?
Speaker 2: No.  Not really.  I don't think so.
Story_ID: 336759
Speaker 1: Well, let's jump into your family pool.
Speaker 2: Very well.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me your mother's full name--her maiden name?
Speaker 2: My mother's full--maiden name was Lessie Mae Williams [Lessie Williams Brown].
Speaker 1: L-E-S-S-I-E?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And do you know when she was born?
Speaker 2: She was born March 3rd, my birthday (laughter), 1920.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was going to tell you happy birthday, coming up in a few weeks.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's too funny.  And do you know where she was born?
Speaker 2: Sanford, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you know about her childhood?
Speaker 2: She lived in Sanford and attended school in Sanford.  Her mother died when she was about eight or nine years old.  Her mother's name was Charity Delancy Williams [ph.], and my grandmother died before my birth, but she was also born on March 3rd.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Really?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And so after she died, my grandfather Ben Williams married Mary Williams.  I don't know my Grandmother Mary's maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they all grew up there in Sanford.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where is Sanford in relation to here?  I just don't know Florida that well (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sanford is eighteen miles north of Orlando [Florida] on Highway 17/92 [U.S. Route 17 and U.S. Route 92].
Speaker 1: You are truly a native Floridian.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you mom's--your grandmother died when mother was relatively young.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So did she have other siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She had three sisters and three brothers.
Speaker 1: And did you know any of them?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I knew all of them.
Speaker 1: And everyone lived in Sanford?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  Well, my Aunt Stella [ph.] lived in North Carolina.  And my Aunt Laura [ph.] lived in Sanford, and my Aunt Viola [Viola Williams] lived in Sanford.  And my Uncle Henry [ph.] lived in Live Oak, Florida, and various other places.  He was a Baptist minister, so he traveled.  And then there was another uncle, Ham [ph.], that went to prison before--I think before I was born.  And so I never met him.  But my parents--my mother would go see him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was in some hospital up in North Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you know--what was her life like in Sanford?
Speaker 2: Well, Sanford was a segregated, little community; the area where we lived.  It was called Midway [Sanford, Florida].  And only blacks were there.  And we had a school, Midway Elementary [Midway Elementary School, Sanford, Florida], and Junior High [Midway Junior High School, Sanford, Florida].  And that's where my mother attended, elementary, up until the seventh or eighth; seventh--sixth or seventh grade.  I'm not sure.  She dropped out of school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--but the whole family grew up in Midway, the section of Sanford just east of Sanford, Florida; and it was really a black community with our black churches, and we had one grocery store there.  But most of the times you had to go to town to get real groceries.
Speaker 1: Had to go into Sanford?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Into the city.
Speaker 1: Does Midway still exist?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It does.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I visit there all the time.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: In fact, I'm going up there this weekend.
Speaker 1: Wow.  That's pretty cool.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what did your grandfather do for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was a farmer, and he had orange groves in or near Sanford.
Speaker 1: Well, now, was that typical for a black farmer?  Did he own his own land?
Speaker 2: He did own the house where we lived.  And he had an orange orchard that he lost during the Depression [Great Depression].
Story_ID: 336760
Speaker 1: What else do you know about your mother's [Lessie Williams Brown] childhood or young adulthood?
Speaker 2: Well, she attended Midway Elementary [Midway Elementary School, Sanford, Florida] and Junior High [Midway Junior High School, Sanford, Florida], the same school that I attended.  And she had a happy life.  She--after my grandfather [Ben Williams] married Miss Mary [Mary Williams], they were bonded, and they were very close.  And there were two children that were young when my grandfather married Mrs. Mary, the grandmother that I knew.  And Miss Mary reared Viola [Viola Williams] and Lessie, my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now what do you know about your--do you know any family history before your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a great-grandmother that lived in Northern Florida, that lived to be 116 years old.
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: And her name was Laura Delancy [ph.], and she buried all of her children, and she lived a long time.  She and my mother were very close.  And we would see her or after my grandmother and my grandfather died, before I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I never met him.  Interesting thing about him is that, he, after losing all of his money in the Depression [Great Depression], never really recovered.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And he died.  And during that time, blacks were not given medical care nor allowed to go to hospitals.  So he died at forty-eight years of age.  And on his death certificate, the cause of death is listed as old age.
Speaker 1: At forty-eight.
Speaker 2: At forty-eight.
Speaker 1: Wow.  That's very powerful.  That's very sad.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Forty-eight.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I hear these stories sometimes and it takes a little while for it to sink it to me, sometimes (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes.  But he never saw a doctor.  Never got any medical care other than home remedies all of his life.  And such was the case with my parents.  They didn't have a family physician until later on in life when a black physician came to Sanford [Florida].  And--Dr. George Starke.  And he came there, I think, in the '30s [1930s].  But before that, blacks did not receive medical care.  And it may have been in the early '40s [1940s] that Dr. Starke opened an office there.
Speaker 1: Like around (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In--yeah, around the '30s [1930s].  And I know he was there when I was young.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I can remember going to see him for various, you know, childhood illnesses.
Story_ID: 336761
Speaker 1: Now one thing I notice in interviewing people, they trace their heritage back to the Caribbean.  Now, is your family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  My family was from Florida.  And--well, my father, my natural father was from Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my stepfather was from Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my stepfather was from Georgia.
Speaker 1: Well, since we're talking about fathers, let's start--can you tell me your father's full name?
Speaker 2: Fletcher Allen was my father.
Speaker 1: And do you know what year he was born?
Speaker 2: No.  Didn't have very much to do with Fletcher Allen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was not a part of your childhood?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your mother [Lessie Williams Brown] remarried--
Speaker 2: Never married Fletcher (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Never married?  Okay.  So he's out of the picture, but you were saying your stepfather?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother and my father got married when I was about four years old.  So I guess about 1940.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was the father to me and reared me.
Speaker 1: And his name?
Speaker 2: Bruce Brown.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year he was born?
Speaker 2: He was four years older than my mother, so he was probably born in 1916.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or 19--well, yeah, 1916.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you know about your stepfather's family?
Speaker 2: He--his father's name was Mose, Mose Newman.  And his mother's name was Vannie Newman, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't know how Brown came in there, but--and her maiden name may have been Vannie Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he never used his father's name.  And, you know, I never asked him why.  But I know that he was Bruce Brown, and Mose Newman was his father or at least introduced to me as his father (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) His father.
Speaker 2: --and treated him like a son.
Speaker 1: Right.  Or maybe the same situation like you have.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Could have been.
Speaker 1: That's interesting you never had a chance to ask him.  So do you know--you said he was born--well, your natural father was born in Georgia?
Speaker 2: In Georgia.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my stepfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know where in Georgia?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Pineview, Georgia.  And my stepfather was born in Newnan, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Newna- or Newman [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Or maybe another Newman.
Speaker 2: One or the other.
Speaker 1: The Newman comes in.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, did he share anything about his childhood in Georgia?
Speaker 2: He grew up on a farm, no schooling; never had went to school a day in his life, and moved to Florida because his mother and his father were seeking work, and they were eking out an existence in Georgia.  And they came to Florida because farm work was plentiful and there was a need for a lot of farm workers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Sanford [Florida], which was a trucking--a truck farming area; grew a lot of celery, cabbage and beans; and it required intensive, backbreaking labor.  And so the people would come from Georgia, because work was plentiful in the winter.  And in the summer, they would all leave Sanford and get on the back of trucks and go to New York and Pennsylvania to work in the fields there, because work was plentiful (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --in the summer in New York and Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: So it--but not as hot up there as it is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not as hot.  Yes.  But what they didn't--they rotated the crops that didn't use the fields in the summer, except sometimes for peas and beans to kind of give the nutrients back into the soil.	 But usually, most of the people left or those that stayed there didn't have any real work to do in the fields.
Speaker 1: Now, you're born in '36 [1936].  So you're born after the Depression [Great Depression].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But your father's orange grove fields had failed.
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandfather [Ben Williams].
Speaker 1: Your grandfather's--they failed, and now what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he lost his money.  The banks failed.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The banks failed.  Not his orange grove.	And the banks took his orange groves.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because he--yeah, he lost all of his money in the bank.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was your stepfather a farmer as well?
Speaker 2: No.  He worked on the farms.
Speaker 1: He worked on the farms.
Speaker 2: Never owned any farmland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he worked for others and drove trucks in the farms--farming area to bring the produce to market, but never owned any farms.
Story_ID: 336762
Speaker 1: Now, Attorney Allen [HistoryMaker W. George Allen], do you have any siblings?
Speaker 2: My mother [Lessie Williams Brown] and my stepfather [Bruce Brown]--I was the only child of my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, my stepfather and my mother adopted a young man [Nicholas Allen] after I was grown.
Speaker 1: Oh, really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, let's start with you.  So you were born in 1936.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you born at home or in a hospital (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  A midwife, Miss Emma Claire that was, attended to me at birth at my house on Water Street in Sanford, Florida.  And at that time, my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Williams] said that she caught--Miss Emma caught me (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) 'Cause you were coming out no matter what.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, but I knew Miss Emma very well.  And we would talk about her.  My friend Percy Lee and I would say that, all midwives had to dip snuff, 'cause Miss Emma dipped snuff. And it was a course they took in becoming a midwife.  And we had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) They dipped snuff.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And one lady in the neighborhood that went through all the ritual, and Miss Emma taught her everything she knew.  But before she could become a midwife, she had to pass the snuff dipping test.  And Miss Alberta Walker [ph.] flunked snuff dipping and never became a midwife (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Everything else was fine but that.
Speaker 2: Everything else was fine.  She knew how to catch 'em and what to do and how to, you know, bathe them and cut the umbilical cord.  But she couldn't master snuff dipping.
Speaker 1: Wait, now.  My dad would talk about somebody dipping snuff, but what, how does somebody dip snuff?
Speaker 2: No, no.  You take it, the dry snuff, and you put it under your tongue, (demonstrates) and you would walk around like this with the snuff under there.  And they would spit a lot (laughter).  And they usually carried a cup.
Speaker 1: Right right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  And they would spit a lot.
Speaker 1: So, like, it's like chewing tobacco.
Speaker 2: It's like chewing tobacco, only snuff is the dry tobacco.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right.
Speaker 2: And they would just keep it under their tongue, and they would just keep nipping at it and putting more in.  And, but all the ladies would walk around with this big part of their lip (demonstrates), with all of this snuff in it.  And they would talk and spit (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Oh, that must have been a sight in a big way (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  In fact, my grandmother dipped snuff.  And she would send me to the store to get her Three Thistles.
Speaker 1: Three Thistles, like, how--what size is that?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  No.  The name of it.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: The brand name was Three Thistles and CCC [Samuel Gawith CCC], I think, was another one.  And I think it cost five cents for a cup of it.  And I would go to the store and tell Mr. Floyd [ph.]--it's only the black store in the community--that my grandmother sent me for a can of Three Thistles.  And, a little can like that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I'd go home, and she would break it open and put the dip in (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Wait.  My face hurts.  So, I just have this wonderful vision of all these, like, you know, gray-haired ladies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --or young women--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Sitting around and they're dipping snuff.  Yes.  It was quite the custom at that time.
Speaker 1: That is--that's a wonderful vision I have.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I like that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, and delivering babies with a mouth full of snuff, too, probably?
Speaker 2: Of course.  Of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  There was something about, you know, having a mouth full of snuff that--Mrs. Emma told me, I asked her, I says, "Why do you dip snuff?"  And she said, "It helps me not get nauseous, and I can stand the sight of blood if I have the snuff in my mouth."  So it made sense.  And so I guess that's why Alberta Walker flunked.  'Cause she couldn't stand the blood and all the things you do in the--
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: So the snuff had its medicinal value.
Speaker 1: I love it.  I love it.
Speaker 2: Yes--
Story_ID: 336763
Speaker 1: Miss Emma Claire delivers you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --on March 3rd, a historical date in your family.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was your very early childhood like?  What do you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember growing up in Sanford [Florida] and having a lot of support of family and friends.  And that it was a very small-knit community.  Everybody knew everybody.  And I can remember once I was acting up, and Mrs. Emma, the midwife, grabbed a switch and beat my butt and then took me home and told my mother, "Lessie [Lessie Williams Brown], I beat him, and he was out there cursing and shooting marbles."  And she said, "I beat him and I came home to watch you beat him."  And so I got a second beating.  And that's, you know, it was a--truly a village raising a child, you know.  Everyone took credit, and also were very disappointed when I did something bad like cursed.
Speaker 1: Cursing and playing marbles at the same time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 2: But, it was a very nice community.  We had our church not far from home that my mother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Progress Missionary Baptist Church [Sanford, Florida].  And my mother was very active in that church and my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Williams].  My father [Allen's stepfather, Bruce Brown] didn't go, but she made me go, and I became active in the church and joined the Sunday school; and I was active in--we call it BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union of America]--every Sunday afternoon we'd have to go to Baptist Youth Training Union [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we--and mostly bible study and stuff like that.  But I sang in the choir.  And it was not a large church, so you had a lot of duties.  And but, it was--I was active and it kept me grounded, I think.
Story_ID: 336764
Speaker 1: I was going to ask, like, how large was Midway [Sanford, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Midway probably had 3,000 population; 3,000 population.  Now, it was next to a place called Canaan City [Canaan, Sanford, Florida] that probably had a thousand.  So it was less than 4,000 in Midway and Canaan City, which was right next to each other.  And we didn't--it was not a city really.  Neither was Midway.  We got our mail at RFD [Rural Free Delivery] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, what was that, Rural (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Rural Free Delivery.  Route--and it's Route 2.  And our telephone--I mean, our post office box was Route 2, Box 24J.  So other people had 24.
Speaker 1: And you were 24 (laughter).
Speaker 2: We were J (laughter).  So, and the mailman would come and put our mail in a box, and we'd go by.  After school I'd stop by and get the mail.
Speaker 1: So, you know, I'm trying to think at that time, I guess, Florida was or is that area of Florida still pretty rural, you know, not like a vacation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's very rural.  Very rural, and the inland we were--Sanford [Florida] was on the St. John River [St. Johns River].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the St. John River was not used for a lot of commerce.  My dad [Allen's stepfather, Bruce Brown] told me that when he was young, the St. John River was used to transport vegetables, and that the farmers--there was a market on the river where the riverboats would come in and load up and take the produce up to Jacksonville [Florida].  The St. John River is probably the only river in Florida that flows north, so it kind of starts in Seminole County [Florida], where Sanford is the county seat.  And it went all the way up to Jacksonville and poured out into the Atlantic Ocean.  So produce would start down there in Sanford and then go all the way up to Jacksonville.  And my father said that the packinghouse and the wharf and the port burned down back in the late '20s [1920s] or early '30s [1930s], and the farmers would not allow it to be rebuilt, because they didn't, they were more in tune with railroads and trucks taking things out.  So it was never rebuilt.  So it never really became the market area that it should have.  It should have outgrown Orlando [Florida], but it didn't because the city fathers didn't have any foresight.
Speaker 1: They said--I was going to say no vision, like we won't use the waterway (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No vision.  Yes.  And it was a natural.  Still is.  In fact, I'm going to fish there Sunday.
Speaker 1: That explains the trip.  And what kind of fishing do you actually do?
Speaker 2: Actually, I'm going to go fishing for speckled perch and bass, and whatever bites.  But I also have to speak at the Jack Eckerd academy [Eckerd Kids].  It's an academy for young men who have gone afoul of the law.  And I'm going to speak there on Saturday, and then I go to Sanford Sunday.
Story_ID: 336765
Speaker 1: What are some of the sights, sounds and smells that you recall from your childhood?
Speaker 2: Well, in Sanford [Florida], we didn't have electricity.  So we had an icebox.  And my father [Allen's stepfather, Bruce Brown], in addition to working in the fields, was--he butchered and killed cows and hogs for other people; and goats and whatever.  And most of the people he butchered for that were white would give him the hog head and there were chitterlings and the feet.  So he would bring all of this fresh meat home.  And we, my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Williams] would make chitterlings and make, she would make hog head cheese, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hog head cheese?  Wait what is in hog head cheese?
Speaker 2: Hog head cheese, it's like a souse with all the ears and the feet and all these parts, and you cook it all up.  And then after it would cool, it would congeal.  And then you could cut it like, you know, like it's a lunchmeat.  But if you ate it hot it was, you know, it was like a soup.  But she would make all these things with the parts of the hog that these people didn't want.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And the liver we would get.  And so--and what we couldn't eat, my dad would give away because we hadn't an icebox, and so we couldn't store anything.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So we had fresh meat maybe once a week.  The rest of the times we ate bacon and sausage and things that did not require a lot of refrigeration.  But growing up there, the neighbors would help each other.  And if you had a garden, you would share the produce.  And when we go to the fields, especially in the summer when the farmers would plant beans and peas in order to enrich the soil, they gave the beans and peas away.  So we'd go out with baskets and pick what we needed and come home.  My mother [Lessie Williams Brown] would can some and we'd eat a lot fresh.  And I'd go to, down to the river and fish, and I'd come home with a lot of fish, and my dad would make me clean them and cook them, because I was an only child.  And so I started selling them on the way home.
Speaker 1: So you wouldn't have to clean them and cook?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I wouldn't have to clean them or cook them.	And so I would stop at some of these little old ladies with a lot of kids and say, you know, "Give me a dollar and take all you want."  If they took all of them, I had no problem (laughter).  I'd go home empty handed.
Speaker 1: But you had a dollar.
Speaker 2: Yeah, with a dollar.  And when I became, I guess, nine or ten years old, the bus started coming through Sanford [Florida] going into--Midway [Sanford, Florida] to go to Sanford, and it was ten cent to ride it.  And there was a theater downtown called the Ritz Theater [Wayne Densch Performing Arts Center, Sanford, Florida] that was upstairs and downstairs.  And the upstairs was for black folk and downstairs for white people.  And it was ten cent to go in the Ritz Theater, and you could buy a bag of popcorn for a nickel.  So, you know, to sell all my fish for a dollar, it gave me enough money to have a ball (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  All the penny candy and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So it was great.
Speaker 1: Well, I can--I feel like I'm sitting right there with you there, eating my five cent popcorn.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Don't you wish popcorn cost five cents?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now it's what, three bucks [dollars] or five bucks.
Speaker 1: Five.
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's awful now.  And it's not as good.
Speaker 1: No.  It's totally fakey.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 336766
Speaker 1: Well although you were an only child, I know you must have had friends. Did you have like a small group of friends or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had relatives.  My natural father [Fletcher Allen] had a brother that lived in Sanford [Florida], Uncle Willie Allen [Willie Allen, Sr.].  And he had two sons that were near my age.  Later his wife [Vivian Byrd Allen] had a daughter [Louise Allen Perkins] and another son [Robert Allen].  But so I had companionship with my cousins, Willie Allen [Willie Allen, Jr.] and Arthur Allen [James Arthur Allen].  And so we were all very close.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I would spend some weekends with them.  And I had a good friend that lived one street over, Percy Lee, who--his mother and--Nad Lee [ph.] and my mother [Lessie Williams Brown] were very good friends.  So we grew up together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was a year older than me, but we were, we played together almost every day and got in trouble together.  We would--he was mischievous, much more than I.  And we would steal his grandmother's chickens and cook them and eat them.  And I couldn't stand pepper, so he'd put a lot of red pepper on the chicken and I'd be crying trying to help him eat, trying to keep my portion (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --and he would say, "You know, you don't like some pepper," and I'd say, "Why you put it on here?"  He'd say, "I forgot," (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) All right.
Speaker 2: But we would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You guys would cook the chicken yourselves?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We'd fry the chicken.  And so I'd (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How old were you?
Speaker 2: We were about eight or nine or ten.  And so I stopped letting him cook, you know.  I says, "I'll cook it," 'cause I wouldn't put all that pepper on.
Speaker 1: Right.  But that is so fun--wait, now.  Who taught you how to cook--I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, being--he was an only child and I was an only child, and our parents worked in the fields.  So we learned how to cook at an early age.  And I guess after nine years old, I would go to school, come back, clean the house up, and I'd cook dinner.  And when my parents would come home, usually eight, seven--I guess eight o'clock at dark, I'd have dinner ready.

Speaker 1: You know what, I wanted to ask you, what games would you play 'cause since you had that time in between school and when your parents [Lessie Williams Brown and Bruce Brown] came home, what were some of the games you played?
Speaker 2: We shot marbles.  And, well, I started hunting at an early age and I'd fish.  We--yeah.  There were four girls living next door, and so I played hide-and-seek with them.  Sometimes it, one time, Miss Emma [Emma Claire] caught us doing something and told my mother and I got a beating because, you know, I was in love with all four (laughter).
Speaker 1: All four? (Laughter) A junior Casanova.
Speaker 2: Oh, lord.  We didn't--the Smith [ph.] girls living next door, we always had a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: That was too cute.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So right now you were speaking about your--off camera we were talking about your cousin--your Allen cousins.  Could you tell that story?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My--I was closest with--his name is Willie Lee Allen, Jr. [Willie Allen, Jr.], and he's my Uncle Willie's [Willie Allen, Sr.] son, but and his nickname was Big Joe, and he was two years ahead of me in school.  And we were very close, and I would spend weekends at their house, many weekends at his aunt--his mother, my Aunt Vivian [Vivian Byrd Allen] was her name.  We called her Aunt Tootie.  It was just a favorite.  And she would cook for us, and we would just devour huge quantities, and sometimes when Uncle Willie would get up on Sunday, there's nothing to eat.  She'd have to cook again.  You know, she'd say, "Damn, you boys ate all the biscuits."  But if anybody bothered me at school, I'd go get Big Joe, and Big Joe was the enforcer.  Nobody, nobody bothered his cousin.
Speaker 1: Now, how big was Big Joe?
Speaker 2: You know, now I'm a little taller than he is.  But then, I thought he was, you know, a big guy.  But (laughter), but he's not that big, but he was just two years older and was more mature and everything.  So, you know, I thought he was a big guy, but he's actually about 5'8" (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  After all it's all said and done.
Speaker 2: Or 5'9", maybe, yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I thought at that time Big Joe was a big guy.  And he was in my eyesight.  And he was--he protected me.  And everyone knew if you bother with George [HistoryMaker W. George Allen], you gotta deal with Big Joe.  So.
Speaker 1: I love it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: You went to Midway Elementary [Midway Elementary School, Sanford, Florida].  That was the only school--
Speaker 2: For blacks.
Speaker 1: For blacks.
Speaker 2: Midway Elementary and Junior High School [Midway Junior High School, Sanford, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about your school life.
Speaker 2: I started school at four years old, per- mainly because my mother [Lessie Williams Brown] wanted me out of the house.  An only child, you know, I talked a lot, in the way; so she started me out early.  And I progressed very well, I thought.  And then in third grade, Mrs. Johnson [ph.], my third grade teacher, held me back.  And I was mad with her for years.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: And all of my classmates went on.  And Percy [Percy Lee], my good friend, was also in that class.  So he was--he got ahead of me.  And I hated her for years.  When she retired about ten years ago from teaching--
Speaker 1: She just retired?
Speaker 2: --or maybe fifteen years ago, it was.  Yeah.  There was really some program in Sanford [Florida], and I went out.  They wanted me to speak.  And then when I'm speaking, she said, "You know, I never told you this, but now that your mother is not alive, I want you to know that the reason I held you back was because your mother thought you were very immature in third, because you had started school so early."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Oh.
Speaker 2: "And so I held you back, not because you didn't do the coursework, but because your mother asked me to."
Speaker 1: And so all these years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I says, "Why did you let me go through life hating you?"  (Laughter) She says, "You didn't really hate me." But she was a great teacher.  I loved her.  But when she held me back, I was devastated.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you thought that you weren't smart enough.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Not smart enough, you know.  What did I do?  I probably had passed all the coursework, you know.
Speaker 1: What, you must have been like six years old in the third grade.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In third grade.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Which is a smidgeon.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, but as I look back on it, it probably was the best thing to do.  But, you know, I didn't know, and my mother didn't consult me, so, you know, I was incensed.
Speaker 1: Naturally.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 335809
Speaker 1: Were all the grades in one room (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --or were you guys separated in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, no, no.  Each grade had a room.  And all the courses were taught by one person.  And we had a period when we did English and math and history, but it was all in the same room.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we went out for recess, and then at that--when we first started school, we didn't have a lunchroom.  So we would take lunch.  And usually we would take, you know, vegetables and cornbread and things like that.  And during the war, during the First World War [sic. World War II, WWII], I guess I was in third, fourth, fifth grade [at Midway Elementary School, Sanford, Florida], we all would bring, sometimes we would bring biscuits and syrup and bacon to school for lunch.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And then during the war, every now and then my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Williams] would get white bread, which you had to slice.  And on the days when she would make me a sandwich with light bread, I would go to school showing it to all the girls and say, "Hey, I have light bread today."  And Percy Lee would say, "You're lying.  You don't have light bread.  This is war.  You can't get light bread."  And I'd say, "You want see it?"  You know, I'd show it to him, close the bag up (laughter).  It was a luxury.  And I would just show it.  I wouldn't share it.  But I would show it.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Why, I didn't know.  That was one thing I did not know was a wartime luxury.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  It was a shortage of bread.  They would--we were making (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, did she bake it or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  She would get to buy it from town, and we would get surplus flour and surplus things, 'cause there was shortage of sugar and it was many shortages that we had to sacrifice for the war effort.
Speaker 1: Well, even in tiny, little Midway [Sanford, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Everyone.  And they--and for gas, my dad [Allen's stepfather, Bruce Brown] would get coupons.  You could get gas sometimes, if you had the coupons.
Speaker 1: Not even--
Speaker 2: If you got a coupon, they got gas.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This.
Speaker 1: So, you know, see--so you were, like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I guess--
Speaker 1: --ten in 1946.  So nine in '45 [1945] when the war ended.
Speaker 2: I was four in 1940.  So the war ended, I guess I was about ten.
Speaker 1: So, yeah.  Now, what do you remember about the end of World War II?
Speaker 2: Listening.  My--we had an old battery radio.  The battery was, oh, very (demonstrates).  It's like a car battery almost.  And we were listening to [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt on the radio.  And we also, when prize--when Joe Louis would fight, all the kids would come to my house, and my dad would let the window up.  And so we would sit on the front porch and listen to Joe Louis fight, and that was just a treat.  And we would hear--there were programs, the blues from Nashville [Tennessee] that we would listen to on the radio.
Story_ID: 335810
Speaker 1: But I can remember listening to [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman [President Harry S. Truman] on the radio.  And I can, I also, I would, I was interested in politics at an early age, so I would listen to political speeches.  And we had some very spirited campaigns in Florida.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was just going to ask you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) George Smathers ran against the senator, Claude Pepper.  And I remember hearing them speak and debate.  George Smathers beat up on poor Claude Pepper.  And he used the line that many of the people never understood.  FSU [Florida State College for Women; Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida] was a school for girls.  And Claude Pepper's sister attended FSU, and she majored in theatre and in speech and drama.  And during the debate, Claude Pepper winked his eye and said, "I hear on good authority that George, I mean, Claude Pepper's sister is a thespian."  And a lot of people not understanding what a thespian was, thought that was evil and thought that it, you know, that he was saying something else.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that it referred to her sexual proclivities, and a lot of people didn't vote for Claude Pepper because of that.  And he repeated it every--especially in the Panhandle [Florida Panhandle] in rural areas.  He'd go to North Florida and says, "His sister is a thespian."  And I can remember listening to all of that, when I was, I guess, maybe in ninth or tenth grade [at Crooms Academy; Crooms Academy of Information Technology, Sanford, Florida].
Speaker 2: I remember Claude Pepper as an elderly senator.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So I didn't know very much about his early career, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But he was--he came back as a member of the House [U.S. House of Representatives] and championed the social security issues of old folks (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: --but he was in the other house then.  But when he was in the [U.S.] Senate, he got kicked out.  He was being mentioned as a vice presidential candidate.
Speaker 2: What, for Truman?
Speaker 1: With Roosevelt.
Speaker 2: I guess he really was that old now that I think about it.
Speaker 1: Yes.  What a guy.  And his sister, the one that was the thespian, ended up teaching here at Broward County [Florida], and I knew her.  And Claude would come through (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Really?
Speaker 1: --and, you know, I'd see him at political rallies, and his sister would come out (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  No pun intended.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, would--as you just mentioned, I mean, that really speaks to the level education in its entire state, where somebody could say the word thespian, and no one had any clue.
Speaker 1: Especially in the Panhandle.
Speaker 2: The Panhandle.  Is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was always backward.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 335811
Speaker 1: Florida is almost like another world.
Speaker 2: Yes.  North Florida and South Florida.  There's always been that demarcation.  And the people in the north don't trust the people in the south.  South Florida don't trust the people in North Florida.  And it's always been that way.  It's--
Speaker 1: Why is, they're closest to the southern state, you know to Georgia.
Speaker 2: There was a time that, yeah, people thought that people in North Florida were very much aligned with Georgia and Alabama, and that the liberals were down in South Florida, and they didn't come in from the north and bought all these liberal principles and theories and thoughts.  But it doesn't work that way.  And a lot of these people from the Midwest that came in here, you know, it's, Florida is still (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or had a rude awakening.
Speaker 2: --a backwards state.  Yeah.  They're not doing what they should in terms of education or anything else.  And also, now with the influx of all the Hispanics and people from Caribbean nations and everywhere, it's just a hodgepodge and melting pot that we just don't have any clear cut philosophy that's Floridian, you know.  It's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A little of everything.
Speaker 2: --it's a little of this, a little of that.  And it's hard to get a consensus about what we are.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah.  Everything.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 335812
Speaker 1: So, school life at Midway Elementary [Midway Elementary School, Sanford, Florida], pretty interesting.  Do you remember any other teachers besides the one who held you back in third grade?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  All of them.  All of them.  In fourth grade, Peaches Smith [ph.] was my teacher.  And she was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Peaches.
Speaker 2: --yeah, she was very nice.  And I don't remember anything I learned in fourth grade.  But in fifth grade I had Mrs. Maddox [ph.].  And Miss Maddox was a disciplinarian and excellent in math, and I learned a lot.  And she was hard on you, but made you learn.  And I enjoyed fifth grade.  And in sixth grade, I had Mrs. Refoe [Shellye L. Refoe]; sixth and seventh grade.  And she was an excellent teacher.  And in seventh grade she started me to reading.  She had reading contests, and if you read the most books, she would give you a prize, which was another book, I think.  But, I won the prize in sixth grade for reading the most books.  And she taught me that one can travel all over the world with a book.  And that, you know, you have a book, you can live any life you want to and visit any place you want to.  And she, it taught me that one must question everything.  She would always say that: "An inquiring mind indicates one has a thirst for knowledge."  And so, and I asked a lot of questions anyway, but that--it encouraged me to ask more.
Speaker 1: Well, Emily Dickinson said, "There is no frigate like a book."
Speaker 2: No.  She's right.  And then in eighth grade, I had Mr. Refoe [Herman L. Refoe, Jr.], the first male teacher that I had ever had in my life.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: In eighth grade.  And it was the husband of Mrs. Refoe.  And so the two of them are very prominent in my life, that they taught me a lot.  And as a male teacher, he was a snappy dresser, and he bought his clothes at B.L. Perkins [Perkins Mens Store, Sanford, Florida].  And during that time, blacks were not allowed to try on clothes in stores.  If you wanted a pair of shoes, you got to point it to them, and guess your size.  And if you didn't, if you came out and they were hurting your foot when you got a chance to wear them, they wouldn't take them back, 'cause they said, you know, "White folks won't buy anything a black person's ever tried on."  So we would get our clothes from B.L. Perkins.  I couldn't afford this stuff.  Mr. Refoe wore argyle socks.  And I went down and I put a pair of argyle socks in layaway with a dime.
Speaker 1: How much did they cost?
Speaker 2: A dollar nine-eight.  And I put a dime on them.  And every week I'd go back and put another dime (laughter).  It took me twenty weeks, but I finally got them out, and they were beautiful socks.  They were yellow and brown argyles.
Speaker 1: And you had to have them.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  And I got a pair of Thom McAn shoes and I shined them.  And I had on those argyle socks and my Thom McAn shoes.  And I went to school that Monday, I mean, I was kind of looking like Mr. Refoe a little.  So, you now, I've always tried to dress like Mr. Refoe.
Speaker 1: Mr. Refoe.  Okay.
Speaker 2: His father was a tailor, so he didn't have to buy his clothes off the rack.  His father made them.  And--but he was sharp.  He was really sharp.  And he'd been in the [U.S.] Army, and he regaled us with stories of how he had won the war [World War II, WWII] singlehandedly.  And we all believed him.
Speaker 1: Fought Hitler [Adolf Hitler] and won (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Mussolini [Benito Mussolini] and Tojo [Hideki Tojo].
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was just a colorful character.  And after I graduated from Midway Elementary School [sic.] in eighth grade--oh, while I was there, he encouraged me to run for president of the student government, 'cause he said, "You know, you're a natural leader," and so I ran for president of the student government association in eighth grade at Midway Junior High [Midway Junior High School, Sanford, Florida], and I won.  So from that point, I showed some leadership ability.
Speaker 1: And always probably had a  cool pair of argyle socks.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  And, you know, maybe that's why they voted for me, because I had the best looking socks.
Speaker 1: See you hadn't thought about that.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Story_ID: 335813
Speaker 1: The elementary [Midway Elementary School, Sanford, Florida] is like that.  Is the high school also each grade to a classroom?
Speaker 2: Well, you graduate from Midway [Midway Junior High School, Sanford, Florida].  And I'm the first in my family to ever graduate from eighth grade, so my mother [Lessie Williams Brown] and father [Allen's stepfather, Bruce Brown] were very happy.  And then I went to high school at Crooms Academy [Crooms Academy of Information Technology, Sanford, Florida], which was about six, five or six miles near in town, in Sanford [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at Crooms Academy we caught the bus.  And the bus picked us up, took us to school; and picked us up from school and bought us home.  And there we had individual teachers to teach specific courses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was a lot different in high school.
Speaker 1: Now, obviously Crooms is, is it all black?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is it like a private school or a public (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: But it's just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.  It's a public school.
Speaker 1: --it's just called the academy.
Speaker 2: It is the--yeah.  It was called--the principal of the school, Professor Crooms [Joseph N. Crooms], and his wife [Wealthy Richardson Crooms] were, they ran the school.  And so he named it Crooms Academy.  And we always kid people, you know, especially since I've become a lawyer, sometimes they say, "You know, what do you account for your success?"  And I'd say, "Well, you see, I never attended a high school.  I attended an academy."  And some of them, you know, take this very seriously.  They think that that's, it is different.  It's not, but (laughter) I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter)  A rose is a rose.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And so I, the Crooms Academy.  But that was the genre in many of the cities in--I think in Fort Pierce [Florida], they had Lincoln Academy [Lincoln Park Academy, Fort Pierce, Florida].
Speaker 1: It does sound much more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And up near Ocala [Florida], there was a private school up there called Fessenden Academy [Fessenden Elementary School, Ocala, Florida] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fessenden.
Speaker 2: --that the doctors' children went to and (unclear), but--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, now, it's interesting to hear that story and hear you're just in a very small area, and just speaking to Dr. Dorothy Fields [HistoryMaker Dorothy Fields] earlier today, she said, "You know, there was no high school for black people in this area until 1927, and that's because in 1926 they blew up the high school."  And that's really interesting that despite it all you still had a school--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --even though in a major city.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, the Crooms family came and he became the pastor, the principal.  And so he named it after himself.  And the school was a very good school.  Mrs. Crooms taught English, and she was--she and her daughter, and she had attended Claflin College [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  And Mrs. Grace [ph.] taught me history.  And when she told me that, she made the assignment, we had to find out where all of our teachers graduated from college, and I said, "Let's start with you, Mrs. Grace.  Where did you go?"  She said, "I went to Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]."  No.  College at the time.  College.  And I laughed.  I told my friends.  I said, "Look here, she's not too swift there.  She went to an agricultural and mechanical college."  (Laughter) "Why is she teaching in history?  She should be teaching agriculture and mechanics (laughter) (simultaneous)."
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) What does she know?  Not history.
Speaker 2: And, you know, I, you know, I thought that that was all they taught there, because I'd never been to college and never knew anything about colleges, and nobody from my family, until one of fellas in my class whose parents taught school said, "No, fool, you know.  They teach everything at FAM C [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes]."  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh right, before FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 335814
Speaker 1: In high school, as you're, you know, making your way towards graduation, what are your hopes, your dreams for yourself?
Speaker 2: You know, I had gone all the way through high school and never been counseled, never, no one encouraged me or talked about college.  So I really had no real aspirations, because no one had ever said, you know, if there was a guidance counselor at Crooms [Crooms Academy; Crooms Academy of Information Technology, Sanford, Florida], they hid that person from me.  No one ever tried to encourage me to do anything.  I was elected president of the student government at Crooms the first, I was the first at Midway [Midway Junior High School, Sanford, Florida] and then the first at Crooms.  They didn't have any student government until my senior year, and then when I got elected.  And I was somewhat of a maverick.  I viewed myself as the person, spokesperson for the students.  And I'd go in and challenge the leadership and challenge the principal [Roy A. Allen] about food and about whatever ills the students perceived.  And he hated it because no one had ever challenged his authority, and so he purposefully made sure that the grade point average for high school would not be published.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: And he just announced that I was the--
Story_ID: 335815
Speaker 1: The principal was just adamant that I would never amount to anything, and then he would make sure that if I did, he didn't help it and he'd hurt it.  And so he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was wrong with him?
Speaker 1: I--he just didn't like me.  And this was not Professor Crooms [Joseph N. Crooms].  This was a guy named Roy Allen [Roy A. Allen] that came there and just--he had a son in school that he, in my class, that did very poorly, and perceived, I guess, that I was competing with his son.  But his son was no competition for anyone in the school.  And so he wouldn't announce what the grade point average was.  He just say, "George Allen [HistoryMaker W. George Allen] is the salutatorian," and they handpicked someone to be valedictorian, who punched out of FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] (laughter).
Speaker 2: So they appointed him to be--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Appointed him, this lady.  And also, at that time, we had the high school aptitude test that you had to take.  And I took the test, and so did everyone else.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: His son did poorly, and I did very well.  Well, I had the highest score, but he forbid anyone from publishing the outcome and the scores.
Speaker 2: Do you know, did you just keep tabs on this guy, like, what happened to him and his son (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.  He subsequently died, and I didn't go to the funeral and I didn't mourn him.  But he was not a nice person.  So therefore, I graduated from high school, and there was a, it's a Lewis State Scholarship that they gave to the person with the highest average in each class in Florida's high schools to the black students.  And I normally would have gotten that scholarship.  And when I went to him and I says, "You know, how about this Lewis State Scholarship?"  He said, "You don't want to be a teacher.  If you take that, you have to be a teacher.  And you don't want to be a teacher, do you?"  And I said, "Well, I guess not."
Speaker 2: (Laughter) If you put it like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But so I did--yeah.  And so I didn't take it, and then, you know, they gave that to someone who had been out of Crooms [Crooms Academy; Crooms Academy of Information Technology, Sanford, Florida] for three or four years.  And her dad was an undertaker that died, and she needed help to get to college, and so she got the Louis State.  She didn't graduate either.
Story_ID: 335816
Speaker 1: One of my friends whose parents had attended FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] recommended that I go there.  And he says, "I'll write your letter for you."  And he wrote the letters.  His name was Charles Merritt.  He was, he and I had been in first grade together [at Midway Elementary School, Sanford, Florida].  And now, so and his mother was our teacher.  And so and we kind of grew of together and attended high school together with, it was first grade and then high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he got a piece of paper out and just a little letter and wrote Crooms [Crooms Academy; Crooms Academy of Information Technology, Sanford, Florida] and said, "Send his transcript to FAMU."  And I think I sent, I sent in ten dollars with the application.  And so I mailed it out and he says, "Now go.  You just go on up there."  And he had a scholarship at Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] to pay football.  And so he went on to Clark, and I went to FAMU.  When I got there and I said "I'm here to register," and they said, "What's your name?"  And I said, "Willie George Allen [HistoryMaker W. George Allen]."  And they looked.  They said, "We don't have any IBM cards for you."  So the registrar came out and he says, "What's your name?"  I said, "Willie George Allen."  And he says, you know, he had the little letter in his pocket.
Speaker 2: Oh, right.
Speaker 1: He says, "I wondered if you'd show up."  He says, "This is no application to go to college.  You have to apply and fill out forms."  And he says, "But I have your grades and I have your letter and your ten dollars."  And he says, "I bet my wife you wouldn't show up (laughter)."  So, they had to, he took me inside and they did the formal application, and they did, they made up IBM cards.  And from, he was a favorite, I mean.  He was the registrar and he was a great guy.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Wait a minute.  That was just too funny (laughter).  Just showing up at college.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I showed up.  My friend wrote the letter.  I sent him ten bucks.  It was a money order.  I mean, what do they expect (laughter).
Story_ID: 335817
Speaker 1: But again, no problem.  You just filled out the forms and started class [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 2: Yes.  But then I got the shock of my life.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: They gave me a list of books I had to buy.  I only had enough money to register.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And so I said, "Books?  They don't give you books here like they do in high school?"  And they said, "No."  So I had to get money to buy books, and I couldn't, didn't have any more money, so.
Speaker 1: Right.  So what--did your parents [Lessie Williams Brown and Bruce Brown] think?  You know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They didn't have any more money.  They had given me everything they had.  So I went around and met some of the football players and they didn't read their books anyway.  They were just there to play football.  So I borrowed--befriended football players in the dormitory.  And so I borrowed their books.  They got new books free, because they were on scholarship.
Speaker 1: They didn't have to pay for anything (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They didn't have to pay for the books.  So--but they were not reading them anyway, so I borrowed their books, and I'd read.
Speaker 1: That--did you live on campus?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The first year.
Speaker 1: What--now how much was tuition then?
Speaker 2: For food, room and board was $137.50 for one semester.
Speaker 1: A hundred thirty seven (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I had about $145 when I got there.  So I was tapped out.
Speaker 1: That was it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did you have, like, a job on campus?
Speaker 2: No.  The first semester I didn't.  But there were a couple of football players that were doing real well.  And so one was from Pennsylvania, and he had a car.  And so I'd wash his car (unclear), I'd help him with his studies, you know, help him with assignments, write his term papers and stuff.  And I'd wash his car and he'd give me about five or ten bucks a month.  He got a check from home.  And, this guy was rich.
Speaker 1: Totally rich.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 360434
Speaker 1: Okay now what year did you start at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 2: I started FAMU in 1954; September 1954.
Speaker 1: And it was FAMU then.  It wasn't FAM C [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 2: It was FAM--no.  It was FAMU.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Florida A and M University.
Speaker 1: Well, so, now Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] had just been decided that summer.
Speaker 2: When I was in high school [Croom Academy; Croom Academy of Information Technology, Sanford, Florida], it was decided.  But, you know, the implementation was with all deliberate speed.  And the implementation had not come down even then, implementation, a decision that said--when they said when, came down after I was at Florida A and M University.  And when was with all deliberate speed, which it was an invitation to the South and to the North, to drag their feet.  And they did drag their feet.  And so we had no real integration in Florida for years, until Horace Hill [Horace Hill, Sr.] started filing lawsuits.  And he's a lawyer in Daytona Beach [Florida].  And he filed a lawsuit to try to get Virgil Hawkins [Virgil D. Hawkins] into the University of Florida law school [University of Florida College of Law; Fredric G. Levin College of Law, Gainesville, Florida]; won at every level and it was appealed in some of the worst decisions that ever came out of Florida Supreme Court, upholding the right of Florida to discriminate against blacks came out.  And they were reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court.  But they still wouldn't come down hard enough on the State of Florida to make them integrate the schools.  And the one decision won from the Supreme Court was that Virgil Hawkins can go to the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida], but he's got to be in a roped off area so he won't contaminate white people, and all this kind of craziness.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is from the Florida Supreme Court?
Speaker 2: The Florida Supreme Court are some of the worst bigots in the world.  And then they created a law school at Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University College of Law, Orlando, Florida].
Speaker 1: When was that?
Speaker 2: When I was there.  When Virgil started in the '40s [1940s] trying to get in, before Brown was decided, '40 [1940]--in '47 [1947], '40- '48 [1948] Virgil started filing lawsuits to get in the University of Florida Law School.
Story_ID: 360435
Speaker 1: The Florida A and M Law School [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University College of Law, Orlando, Florida] was in existence when I attended [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they were not doing very well, not turning out a lot of students, not recruiting a lot of students.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, but I knew it was there.  And I would, sometimes I studied over there, because after I changed my major to political science.  But it was not a school that would make one seek.  Very hard to get into.
Speaker 2: Right.  'Cause it closed.
Speaker 1: It closed.  After I entered the University of Florida [University of Florida College of Law; Fredric G. Levin College of Law, Gainesville, Florida] in 1960 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --my class--I graduated, I was supposed to graduate from the University of Florida in 1963, but I accelerated and graduated in December of 1962.  And the class that would have entered when I entered had one student.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Lorenzo Collins.  And I would--I knew him.  He and I had graduated from FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] together and I would see him sometimes.  And his nickname was Boo, and I says, "Boo, how you doing?"  And he says, "I'm setting the curve."  And I say, "What you mean, you're setting the curve?  You're the only student in your class."  He graduated but he never passed the bar.
Speaker 2: That's tough, 'cause I know now FAMU has reopened the law school.
Speaker 1: It is reopened.  Yes.  What happened is that the legislature and Florida leaders said that there was, there was no real need for a law school.  FAMU was not living up to its purpose.  And they only set it up as--in subterfuge.  And so they closed it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they said, you now, "We have enough law schools in the state."  Within three years or less than three, they had opened the law school over at FSU [Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida].  And they fully funded it.
Speaker 2: After--
Speaker 1: Well, after not fully funding FAMU's law school.  So they took FAMU's law school and gave it to FSU.  I spoke at, about five years ago I spoke at the--in Tallahassee, the Tallahassee Bar Association.  The president of FSU then was Sandy D'Alemberte, who was a couple of years ahead of me at the University of Florida law school, and we're very good friends.  So he found out I was coming to speak, and he asked them, "Just let me introduce George [HistoryMaker W. George Allen]."  So he introduced me.  My speech was about close-, no, not closing out FSU's law, taking FSU's law school and giving it to its rightful owner FAMU.  And after I finished, he came, he says, "I know you're not talking about taking my law school."
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Put him out of a job.
Speaker 1: Not a job.  He was president of Florida State University.  He had been dean of the law school at FSU.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: But they just took FAMU's law school.  So now it's kind of poetic justice that we now have a law school.  But they put it down in Orlando [Florida] so it wouldn't compete with FSU's law school.  It's in Orlando.
Speaker 2: Orlando.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So it won't compete with FSU.  Like it can't handle--there can't be two law schools in a single (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Two.  Well, that would be--it would be a waste of taxpayer funds to have a duplicate school in the same city.  And I thought the easiest thing to do was just rename it FAMU and, you know, it was downtown anyway, so.  Except B.K. Roberts [B.K. Roberts Hall]--it's named after B.K. Roberts, who wrote some of the worst decisions you ever read in your life about keeping Hawkins [Virgil D. Hawkins] out.
Speaker 2: Oh.  What, FSU's law school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Law school, yeah, building is named after B.K. Roberts, who was a racist justice on the Florida Supreme Court.
Speaker 2: But they didn't have any problem in naming a building after him?
Speaker 1: No.  He was a son of the South.
Story_ID: 360436
Speaker 1: We'll jump back to you at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  Now you started in '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 1: That's right.  We were talking about Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So I mean, obviously, at a historically black college [HBCU], integration is not, integrating the student body is not an issue, but what about life in the city?
Speaker 2: Well, life on campus and in the city was totally segregated.  One, I guess it was my junior year, we went down to the courthouse to watch a case where a black doctor was accused of murder, because he'd, according to them, had given an abortion to a white girl and she died.  And black folk had to sit in the gallery.  They couldn't sit down in the main courtroom with white people.  So, I mean, everything was segregated; the bus system was segregated.  My junior year, we organized boycotts, and we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, sit-ins and--
Speaker 2: --boycotted.  Yeah.  The sit-ins, and we helped to integrate Tallahassee [Florida].
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And a lot of us got arrested.  I escaped that because I'd always run.  But Tallahassee was totally segregated.  And there was very little interaction between white students and black students.
Speaker 1: Right.  But now, I mean, you grow up in a small town, all-black area, that you really don't have to be an activist in any way, shape or form.  You get to FAMU, you being in sit-ins, what--how did this occur?  How did you mature into that young man?
Speaker 2: You know, I think it was the atmosphere and also the teachings.  We had some very courageous professors that made us aware of the world and what was going on it.  It was the period.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was coming to town to speak at the Bethel Baptist Church [Bethel Missionary Baptist Church, Tallahassee, Florida], and a lot of the students were going to hear him, and C.K. Steele [Charles Kenzie Steele], who was the pastor of Bethel, a friend of Martin Luther King, was a very, a big activist.  And so, we knew a lot of people that were advocating for the overthrow of the old segregated system; my professors in political science--
Story_ID: 360437
Speaker 1: I went to college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  My mother [Lessie Williams Brown] wanted me to major in pre-med, and I did that for about three months, and then I came home Christmas and said, "I'm changing my major to political science."  And she says, "What?"  (Laughter) Said, "Lawyers don't go to heaven."  Then I says, "How do you know?  You know one that--you know any lawyers?"  And she thought it was heresy, you know, that I was being, you know, talking back and biggity and uppity and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Here it had been three months of vacation.
Speaker 1: --I'd been to college three months, and you come home like you know everything.  But any event--
Speaker 2: She actually said to you lawyers don't go to heaven?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.  Oh, she said that was the common thought, I think, that lawyers were liars; they don't go to heaven.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh okay.  So, right.  So these things, so you're in that crucible of change obviously.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.  And I had a term paper to do over the holidays, and I went down to the white public library and asked to use the reference books.  And they said, "We don't have a colored library."  And I said, "I don't want one.  I want to use your books, what you read.  I'm a taxpayer.  My parents pay taxes."  And then so I got a little loud and they says, "Go on, use the books."  So this was, this was in the Christmas holidays of 1954.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I came back bothering everybody.
Speaker 2: Just right off the bat.
Speaker 1: You know, had all this knowledge, and I'd been allowed to register, so I knew everything.  So they let me use the books.  And every time I'd come home, I'd go the library and use them.
Speaker 2: So they were used to you.  Now, in Sanford [Florida] you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In Sanford.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In Sanford.  I guess they said, "Here comes that crazy boy again."  And they'd let me in.
Speaker 2: Rather than have trouble.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Me get loud and everything.  They threatened to call the cops.  I said, "Well, you call them.  Call them.  I'm going to stay here and study (laughter)."
Speaker 2: And that's that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 360438
Speaker 1: Junior year you're leading sit-ins.  What, now who are some of the professors that were mentors to you?
Speaker 2: There's a--I guess, two of them were more prominent than others.  There's Dr. William E. H. Howard, who was--had a Ph.D. from the University of Amsterdam [Amsterdam, the Netherlands] in Holland [the Netherlands] that was just brilliant.  And--
Speaker 1: What did he teach?
Speaker 2: Political science and political theory and comparative law.
Speaker 1: Was he black or white?
Speaker 2: Black, from Macon, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Wow.  How did he get to the University of Amsterdam?
Speaker 2: And he had been in Ethiopia before that.  But he was just brilliant, and I think he got some, I mean a Fulbright Scholarship or something, and but--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --but he was just brilliant and thought provoking, and made us study and made us read.  And he read two papers a day, and Newsweek, and Times [Time], and everything.  And he'd come in teach from current events.  And he made us read.  And then there was another professor, Dr. Emmett Bashful [Emmett W. Bashful], had a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], I think.  And he was the head of the political science department; a very hard taskmaster; taught constitutional law and was as good as any law professor I've ever had.  In fact, when I entered the University of Florida law school [University of Florida College of Law; Fredric G. Levin College of Law, Gainesville, Florida], he called down and told a couple of the professors, "I'm sending you my best."  Said, "You won't flunk him out."  One black had interviewed at the University of Florida before me, George Starke [George H. Starke, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he lasted a year.  And he flunked out.  And so Bashful called the guys and says, "I'm sending you my best.  You won't flunk him out."  Says, "He's gonna to set the curve down there."  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that's 'cause you were the only student (laughter).
Speaker 2: And--no.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That--was Dr. Bashful black?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Black.  All of them were black.  All of my, every instructor at Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], every administrator, all the people, all the students were black.  It was a segregated, all-black university.  And it's about 90 percent like that now.
Speaker 1: 'Cause like my dad went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], but he had white professors and black professors, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  But we had none when I was there.  There're a few there now, but not a lot, and a few white students.  In fact, one of my secretaries who worked for me, she retired, had a--she's Jewish, Sheila Horwitz [ph.], and her son Mark [ph.] graduated from FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University], and he wanted to get a master's [degree] in business.  And I recommended that he go to FAMU, and he went, and Mark Horwitz was graduated from FAMU with a degree in--master's in business.  So it was a proud moment in my life.
Speaker 1: Who would have thought?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A Horwitz at FAMU.
Speaker 2: Yes.  He loved it.
Speaker 1: I bet.  Well, it's one of the top programs in the country. It's a hidden gem.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 360439
Speaker 1: You switched majors [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, from pre-med to poli-sci [political science], so were you thinking about law school at all at this time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  And Dr. Bashful [Emmett W. Bashful] and Dr. Howard [William E. H. Howard] encouraged me from the beginning to get a B.A. degree in political science.  And I got a minor in my economics.  But with a B.A. degree, I couldn't teach.  I had to go to grad school or law school.  And I figured that if I taught one year, I may not ever get back to law school.  So it was never anything except I'm going to go to law school, from after I changed my major in December of 1954, you know, come hell or high water.  If--well, I'd go to hell or if I don't, I'm gonna go, I'm going to go to law school.
Speaker 1: You're not gonna teach, but that's really interesting because, as you said, you're the first person in your family to graduate from eighth grade.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Where was this fire in you coming from?  It's really--
Speaker 2: I worked in the fields from fifth grade in the wintertime when it was cold.  They would close the schools in Sanford [Florida] for blacks because they needed the labor pool.  And that's not easy.  And I wanted a better life.  And I said, "I can do better than this."  And an education was the key.  I knew that that would get me out of that damn (unclear) field in the cold of winter.  And so, you know, I wanted an education.  In my senior year at Crooms [Crooms Academy; Crooms Academy of Information Technology, Sanford, Florida], we had a class play that we put on, and the name of it was the 'Case of the Missing Heirs' ['The Case of the Missing Heirs: A Mysterious Comedy in Three Acts,' William D. Fisher].  And there was a part of a lawyer that I begged for and they gave it to me.  And it was the leading part, and the lawyer won this case of the missing heirs.  And so I've been hooked ever since.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's great.
Speaker 2: And this was twelfth grade.
Story_ID: 360440
Speaker 1: Senior year rolls around 1958.  But you don't go straight to law school [University of Florida College of Law; Fredric G. Levin College of Law, Gainesville, Florida].
Speaker 2: No.  When I was at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], I needed help financially.  It was required to take two semesters, I mean, two years of ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].
Speaker 1: Oh.  For all boys?
Speaker 2: All boys.  I took my two years in order to go into advanced ROTC.  If you went into advance, it was elected, they paid you $27.90 a month; ninety cents a day.  And I needed that money.  So I signed up for advanced ROTC, and I attended the last two years.  And I went to summer camp in between my junior and senior year.  And then when I got a degree, I got my B.A. degree, I was also commissioned as a second lieutenant--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the [U.S.] Army, and they gave me a designation of Army Intelligence [U.S. Military Intelligence Corps], which was the first officer at FAMU to ever get commissioned with that branch.  And so I got orders to report to Fort Holabird in Baltimore, Maryland, which was the Army Intelligence School [U.S. Army Intelligence School].  And to my chagrin, when I got there, there were three southerners; one graduate from Mercer [Mercer University, Macon, Georgia]; one from the University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi]; and me from FAMU.  Three southerners.  Most of them were Ivy Leaguers:  Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]; and I was the only black.
Speaker 1: Out of that--
Speaker 2: And I had never competed with whites in my life.  And so I get there and I see all these white kids, you know.  And I'm twenty-two and all those--all of them are twenty-two, so they put us in these classes, and they said that: "This is the cream of the crop and we'll give you intensive studies for six weeks, and then we're gonna give you an exam, and the top 10 percent from this class will go on to become Army Intelligence agents with CIC [U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps]."  And so at the end of the six weeks we took the test, and I scored in the top 10 percent.  And so, they picked, selected me to go on to become a special agent.  And so I stayed in, you know, I went on.  And I, it was another ten week course.  And then they issued me a .38 and told me to report to California--Oakland, California, in civilian clothes.  You can't wear your uniform anymore.  Your rank is classified.  And I go into debt to buy these nice uniforms--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that were tailor made and everything and I hadn't finished paying for.  But it was an experience to compete with many of the people who were very smart and would read a lot.  And we would sit around and read books just to talk.  And some guy would say, "Have you read this book?"  "No."  And so we'd read it and then discuss about merits.  And we studied together.  And it was just, it was eye opening.  And I realized that not all white folks were smart, and not all white folks are dumb (laughter).  So, and that I could compete on that level.
Story_ID: 360441
Speaker 1: I suppose the things you worked on were classified, but can you talk a little bit about what you had to do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We did espionage kind of stuff.  We followed people.  When I graduated [from U.S. Army Intelligence School, Fort Holabird, Baltimore, Maryland], I asked the major, I said, "Where should I request a job assignment?"  And he says, "I don't think you'd go over too well in the South (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter)  And following people.
Speaker 2: --walking around with a snub nose gun following people and everything.  You'd stand out."  He says, "Why don't you apply for New York or California?"  And all the guys laughed, because they thought everybody wants to go to California, and I'd never been to California.  So I applied for California, and they gave me Oakland, California.
Speaker 1: All right.  Were you trained (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that was in 1950--I was sent out there in December of '58 [1958].  I got there early January of '59 [1959], and Berkeley, California, then was kind of a hotbed, and they were having antiwar protests.  And so we did a lot of spying on those students, you know.  They'd sign the petitions and send them to Washington [D.C.], and they'd send the list to us and (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Really?
Speaker 2: --we would, you know, start checking them out, checking all of them, watching them and--
Speaker 1: Interesting.
Speaker 2: But we had, you know, people that were alleged Communists that we were trying to ferret out and make sure they didn't contaminate our youth.
Speaker 1: Now did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And people that were against the war [Vietnam War], we checked on them; and espionage, sabotage.  We, there was a Winter Olympics in Reno, Nevada [sic. 1960 Winter Olympics, Squaw Valley, California], that, I guess, in that, that year.  I think it was '59 [1959], and so we send a detachment up to watch the Russians and stuff (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Those darn athletes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Really, and what's interesting, especially now, here we are in another war and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --people are complaining about being activists.
Speaker 2: There is--there is a great fear, so I--those who are worried now, they have cause to be.  At least there were some constraints then.  There are none now.
Speaker 1: This is true.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Well, did you like doing that or did you just do it because you had to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed it.  It was empowering.  And I scared a lot of white folk, you know; it was a black guy with a gun and a badge turned loose (laughter).
Speaker 1: Let loose (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: It was definitely something--a very different experience than you could have imagine.
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was.  Coming from the South, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right, because you get to spy on white people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So that scared the hell out of a lot of them.
Speaker 1: And so, now you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'd walk in and says, "I'm Special Agent Allen [HistoryMaker W. George Allen]."  (Laughter)  And they would say, "What?"  And I'd say, "Yes. I am."  And I had this badge that I'd pull out.  I mean, you know, a black guy with a gun and a badge.  I mean, you know, that's dangerous.  Heresy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: "You have the right to arrest me and question me?"
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's, I was going to say so, there were no constraints on you in terms of dealing with white (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) None.  No.  No.
Speaker 1: --suspects?  Like you can't arrest the white man.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Now, you did this for just two years?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: What happened?  Did you transfer (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you had to commit to two years active duty; two years active reserve; and two years inactive reserve, unless you signed up to go regular [U.S.] Army and make it a career.  The higher ups at Army Intelligence [U.S. Military Intelligence Corps] headquarters tried to encourage me to go regular Army, and they said, "You've never been to Europe," and they--we would have these affairs every now and then where our wives would come, and they'd try to talk to my wife [Enid Meadows Allen].  My wife's from Alabama, Birmingham.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so they would tell her, you know, "You guys have never been to Europe?  If you get your husband to sign up, I'll make sure your first assignment's Europe."  And she was, you know, "Let's go to Europe."  And I says, "No, no. no. I gotta do my two years, get out and go to law school."
Story_ID: 360442
Speaker 1: What year did you get married?
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958]; December of '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we were married before I went out on--in between graduating from Fort Holabird [U.S. Army Intelligence School, Fort Holabird, Baltimore, Maryland]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and going to California, I got married.
Speaker 1: And what is your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Enid [Enid Meadows Allen], E-N-I-D.  And, incidentally, Dr. William E. H. Howard, my favorite professor, we got married in Tallahassee [Florida] at Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University], he gave Enid away, because her daddy didn't come up there.  We got married real fast there.  And so I asked Dr. Howard to give her away so.
Speaker 1: So he's very special.
Speaker 2: So the kids call him, called him--he died two or three years ago--but they called him grandfather, because he gave Enid away (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: But he was always there, you know, for the kids and everything.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: He would come to their affairs and graduations and things.  But he was just a marvelous fella.

Speaker 1: But in any event, we got married.  We moved, I moved out, but she had not graduated.  She was in nursing education at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At FAMU?  Okay.
Speaker 1: And so she graduated in June of '59 [1959], and then joined me in California.  By that time, the black George Starke, Jr. [George H. Starke, Jr.], was from Orlando [Florida], but his father [George H. Starke, Sr.] lived in Sanford [Florida].  He had entered the University of Florida law school [University of Florida College of Law; Fredric G. Levin College of Law, Gainesville, Florida] in, I think, '59 [1959], '58 [1958], and lasted a year and punched out.  And then there's a girl, a Regina Langston [Regina Langston Staggers], from Orlando, and she, 'cause she had attended Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]; she was admitted into the University of Florida medical school [College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida] and lasted less than a semester and said it was just too strenuous and stressful, and she quit.  So in 19--in June of 1960, both of them were gone, and there were no blacks at the University of Florida in any department.
Speaker 2: But now, is the University of Florida in--
Speaker 1: In Gainesville [Florida].
Speaker 2: Gainesville.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I started applying to law schools in June of 1960, and I applied at the University of California at Berkeley [UC Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California]; I applied to Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]; I applied to Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University College of Law, Orlando, Florida], and I applied at the University of Florida.  I lived in Berkeley, California, at the time I applied; so the first school I heard from, and I was accepted at University of California at Berkeley.  My wife [Enid Meadows Allen] was, by that time, working as a nurse in Oakland [California], so she wanted to stay in California, because we had enjoyed a better style than we'd ever lived.  Both of us working and we were doing very well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's not that segregated.
Speaker 1: --so she want us--yeah.  And it was just nice out there.  And we'd never lived in that, in a desegregated environment before, so both of us were happy.  And I said, "Well." She said, "Let's stay.  Let's stay."  I said, "Well, let's wait."  And about two weeks later, I heard from Harvard that I was admitted.  And she says, "Well, if we have to go, it's cold, but I can see, yeah, Boston [Massachusetts].  We go to Boston."  And I said, "We gotta wait."  And she says, "What are we waiting for?"
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.  That's the cream of the crop.
Speaker 1: About three weeks later, I had heard from the University of Florida, I got admitted.  So I said, "Babe, we're going to Florida."  And she says, "Why?"  And I said, "Didn't you read Ebony and Jet?  I mean, you know, there are no blacks in Florida.  That school must be integrated?"  And she said, "But why us?  Let someone else do it."  And I said, "No.  I gotta do this."  So I called my professors and I told them I had been admitted, and they said, "You can do it."  So, when I arrived in Gainesville, I got out of the [U.S.] Army in July, and I went to Gainesville and worked--when I got there, I didn't have a job.  But I looked around and there were no jobs for someone with a degree in political science and a minor in economics and (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) And desperate tears.
Speaker 1: --and experience as a special agent.  And so the unemployment office told me, says, "Well, we'll just sign you up and give you a check."  And my wife says, "You can't accept a check."  And I said, "Why not?"  And she says, "That's like welfare."  I said, "Hell, no.  I earned this.  You know, I worked.  I worked all my life (simultaneous)."
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They took money out of your check.
Speaker 1: "I've never had an instance where I will--you know, where I had to--I could get unemployment.  And frankly, after law school, I'm never gonna be in that position to ever do it."  And she says, "You should leave that for people that need it."  And I said, "Hell, I need it." So she said, "No.  Go back.  I'm sure they can find something for you to do."  So I went back to the unemployment office, and I said, "Okay.  Forget my qualifications.  What do you have?"
Story_ID: 338725
Speaker 1: You've been accepted at the University of Florida law school [University of Florida College of Law; Fredric G. Levin College of Law, Gainesville, Florida] after Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], after Berkeley [UC Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California], and you say, "Honey, we're going to Florida."  And she [Allen's wife, Enid Meadows Allen] said, "Why?"
Speaker 2: Yes.  We're ready?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I told her that, we were in a position to influence the integration of schools, and it was the thing then.  Everyone was talking about trying to integrate higher education.  And we've been fighting that battle for years.  It was obvious that Virgil Hawkins [Virgil D. Hawkins], who filed the lawsuit back in the '40s [1940s] would never be allowed to go to the University of Florida.  And no black had ever graduated from a formerly white institution in the State of Florida.  And I knew I wanted to be a lawyer, and I knew I wanted to practice in Florida.  And I perceived, after consultation with Dr. Howard [William E. H. Howard] and Dr. Bashful [Emmett W. Bashful], that in order to be successful--people at the University of Florida were the leaders in this state, and they were the ones that were in charge of industry in this state.  And if one wanted to be a player in this state, going and getting a degree from the University of Florida would be the best route.  I promised my wife that anytime she wanted to come back to California after I got out of law school, that she could come.  And she has held me to that.  And we visit it often.
Speaker 1: But you didn't move.
Speaker 2: No.  We came back to Florida, and we, I couldn't find any work.  And I was about to tell you that.  So I went back and my wife says, "Go get anything."  So they gave me a job mopping floors as an orderly at Alachua General Hospital [Gainesville, Florida].
Speaker 1: And where was that?
Speaker 2: In Gainesville [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We'd moved there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right.  This is before school starts.
Speaker 2: Before school started.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And so I mopped floors and cleaned bedpans eight hours a day at Alachua General Hospital.  And my wife was happy that I didn't get a check.
Speaker 1: Get no unemployment check (laughter).
Speaker 2: And the ironic thing is that I made less per week (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Working eight hours.
Speaker 2: --than what I would have gotten had I gotten the unemployment check.  The only good thing that came out of it was, one day I was mopping the floor in this room and this lady was sitting there reading a book by Dostoyevsky [Fyodor Dostoyevsky].  And when I asked her if she'd please move her chair in order for me to mop under her husband's bed, who was in the hospital and she was just sitting there keeping him company, she said, "Oh, no," and she moved.  And so she put the book down, and I said, "Do you enjoy Dostoyevsky?"  And she says, "What do you know about Dostoyevsky?"  I said, "Well, you know, he died young, and he had very few."  And I said, "What are you reading?"  And she says, "I'm reading 'Crime and Punishment' [Fyodor Dostoyevsky]."  And I said, "Oh, have you read 'The Idiot' [Fyodor Dostoyevsky] and 'The Brothers Karamazov' [Fyodor Dostoyevsky]?"  And she says, "Have you?"  I says, "Well, yeah.  I read all of his stuff."
Speaker 1: The orderly.
Speaker 2: And says, "What are you doing working here?"  And I said, "I'm waiting for school to open.  I'm going to be entering the University of Florida law school."  And she says, "Would you come back?  What time you get off?"  And I said, "Four."  She said, "Would you come back before you leave?"  And I says, "Okay."  So I come back and her husband's awake then.  And she said, "What's your name?"  I said, "George Allen [HistoryMaker W. George Allen]."  She said, "This is my husband.  He's Professor Hale [Lester Hale], and he's dean of students."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) At the university.
Speaker 2: At the University of Florida.  And so I met him, and says, "Now, you've been admitted?"  I said, "Yes, sir.  I've been admitted to law school."  He said, "Where did you go to undergraduate school?"  I said, "Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]."  And he said, "My wife told me that you read all of Dostoyevsky's books (laughter)."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) The minute he woke up, I'm sure.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  And so we chatted, and he says, "Well, when you get there, you need anything you call me."
Story_ID: 338726
Speaker 1: I applied for faculty, I mean stu--I mean for married students housing.  My wife [Enid Meadows Allen] had a son who had cerebral palsy, and I had two boys.  And so we put our family together and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --showed up in Gainesville [Florida] with three kids and no place to stay.  And I had all of my furniture shipped to Gainesville, and it was on a--in a, this big moving vans, and we had finally found an apartment.  And so we cleaned and cleaned and then my wife says, "It's not clean enough to put our furniture in and the kids in."  So we had to go back and clean it a third, three times before she would let us come in, and sprayed it for roaches and stuff.  And so finally we got in this apartment.  But I had applied for married students housing, and they said that, "We don't allow colored to live in married student housing.  It's only for white married students."
Speaker 2: So even though you were an admitted student (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A student [at University of Florida College of Law; Fredric G. Levin College of Law, Gainesville, Florida].  They wouldn't let coloreds stay in the housing.  So after I registered, I went looking for a house.  And they were building some houses for $250 down.  And it was a three bedroom, one bath.  And so I went and put a down payment on it.  And I went to find Dean Hale [Lester Hale].  And I said, "Sir, you told me to come see you."  Said, "They wouldn't let me stay in married students housing because I'm black.  So I spent my money, and I put a down payment on a house, and it's gonna be finished in two months and I can move out of this apartment."  And he says, "Well, how do you know you're not gonna flunk out?"  And I says, "That's not an option.  (Laughter) You know, I've got my family here, you know, I'm buying a house (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Going to have a mortgage.
Speaker 1: --and they grade on the curve."  He said, "What do you mean?"  And I says, "I'm gonna flunk some of them out.  I'm gonna, you know, I had them.  I will not fail."  He said, "Well, what can I do for you?"  And I said, "I need to borrow two hundred fifty dollars, 'cause I spent my money (laughter)."
Speaker 2: (Laughter) On the house.
Speaker 1: So he laughed.  He said, "You'll do well."  So he found a loan fund that would loan me two hundred dollars, payable back right after I graduated.  So Dean Hale was great.
Speaker 2: And that's right.
Speaker 1: So my wife says, "See.  Working in that hospital [Alachua General Hospital, Gainesville, Florida] helped (laughter)."
Speaker 2: (Laughter) This is true, 'cause you could have been sitting at home.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You would have never met him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I would have never met dean.
Story_ID: 338727
Speaker 1: As a, well, second black student at University of Florida law school [University of Florida College of Law; Fredric G. Levin College of Law, Gainesville, Florida], what was happening in Gainesville [Florida]?  Like, how was the press responding to it?  'Cause, you know, I think of James Meredith (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, James Meredith entered my senior year in law school, the University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Oh, right, right.
Speaker 2: The press, Newsweek, Look, Time called, and I refused to give interviews.
Speaker 1: Oh that's why I couldn't find anything.
Speaker 2: I didn't, I have a few little articles when I graduated.  And I let them print that.  A lot of the rednecks in Florida didn't know I was there.  And I didn't want to bring notoriety to my being there and have them marching and acting crazy.  I did get death threats.
Speaker 1: Right.  From the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And they would call me up and say, "Nigger, we're gonna kill," and I'd say, "Kiss my ass," and hang up.  And also, you know, and my dad [Allen's stepfather, Bruce Brown] had taught me how to shoot from an early age.  And I'm a hunter.  And I would go out and practice with my rifles, and I taught my boys how to shoot.  So, and I said, "If anybody comes in the neighborhood, you know, we're not gonna go (laughter)."  "We may have to take somebody out."  And then some of the, a lot of the students would ask me, 'cause Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was marching everywhere (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --and they were asking me, "Are you nonviolent?"  And I'd say, "Hell, no.  I'm violent.  You bother me, you got a fight."  And the first--the second semester, the beginning of the second semester, I knocked one guy out named Ralph Paul Douglas that called me a boy and tried to get in front of me to register for courses.  And just, you have to stand in line and wait to get your courses.  And he just comes to the head of the line after I'd been in line and says, "Get out of the way, boy."  And he's getting ready to get in front of me, and I hit him and knocked him cold.  And I stepped over him.  And this professor had his head down and he never looked up.  And this guy thump, hits the floor, and all of the students were looking.  And so I stepped over him, and I said, "Profession Renrock [ph.]"--he was German--I says, "I'd like these courses."  And he said, "Of course (unclear) (laughter)."  And he signs me up in these courses.
Speaker 1: And this guy's still on the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And Ralph Douglas is on the floor, you know.  And I get my courses.  I look at it.  I said, "Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  I got everything I wanted."  And I stepped back over, then when I go to the law library to study, so they stopped me.  They revived him and everything.  And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I love--
Speaker 2: --nobody said a word, the dean, no one in the law school ever said, "I mean, why did you hit him?" or anything.  But then everyone knew, they says, "He's crazy, and he's not nonviolent like Martin Luther King," (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And I told them, I says, "If you bother me, you got a fight."  And I said, "I don't play that nonviolent shit."  And they all knew that.  So I didn't have a lot of problems after that.  However, about ten, twenty years later, I go to Palm Beach [Florida].  I'm representing a guy up there.  And I walk in the courtroom.  The judge is Ralph Paul Douglas.  And so I look at him and I says, "Oh, shit."  	So he looks up and says, "Should I duck?"  And I says, "Only if you insult me."  And he says, "How have you been, George [HistoryMaker W. George Allen]?"  I said, "I've been fine."  He says, "Everyone tells me you're doing well in Fort Lauderdale [Florida]."  And I says, "Yes.  I didn't know you had been elevated to the bench.  Congratulations (laughter)."  He just, "What can I do for you?"  I said, "Oh, I got this case here, and I got a motion," and I went through everything.  And he says, "Granted (laughter)."  So I walked around, and my client said, "What was that all about?"  And I says, "I knocked him out once," (laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, you may have had a great second life as like this, not even standup.  You should--the comedy coming out of you is like slaying me over here.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, that's good.  He appreciated a fine, like, what?  Left hook, right hook?
Speaker 2: It was a right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a right.
Speaker 1: He understood the power of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It reverberated for another twenty years (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  It kept me there (laughter).  His memory was intact.
Speaker 1: This is, the fact that you walked over him and continued to register (laughter).  So--
Speaker 2: He was interfering with my registering.
Story_ID: 338728
Speaker 1: And you had to, you know, you had to kind of get in line to get the courses you want and the professors too.  Some of the people that I met at the University of Florida [University of Florida College of Law; Fredric G. Levin College of Law, Gainesville, Florida] my freshman year kind of pulled me aside and grabbed my coattail and said, "Look, you don't want to take this guy, you don't want to take this guy," you know.  And so some of the professors were to be avoided.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so--and I trusted the people that came to me and pulled my coattail and, you know, I felt that they had my interests at heart, some of them.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Some of them wouldn't talk to me at all.  And some of them shunned me.  But then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Well, you don't have to worry about those.
Speaker 1: --a few of them grabbed me and said, "Look, let me help you."  One of the--a guy named Mark Pearlman [ph.], who was a Jewish fella from Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], gave me his notes, and says, you know, "Here are my notes."
Speaker 2: Now, yet, I think of other firsts at universities, and they're completely shunned.  No one would speak to them.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: As you said, you know, or getting roped off inside of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the class.  What do you think made the difference for you that you didn't have that same type of experience?
Speaker 1: I was a, I would, I had been in the [U.S.] Army, I was more mature than someone just getting out of college and going to law school.  And also, I had a family.  I was, you know, I had to do well.  And my wife [Enid Meadows Allen] was working at the J. Hillis Miller Medical Center [J. Hillis Miller Health Science Center, Gainesville, Florida] at the University of Florida.  And so, and we were very serious.  And I studied all the time.  Guys would come in, and I'm the first guy there and the last to leave.  And I was afraid that, you know, I can't fail, yeah.  Too many people are depending on me, and I got a family, and where would I go (laughter).  If I fail, I mean, what am I going to do?  And so I just, it was just too much at stake to take it lightly.  And I, a lot of the students kind of saw that, you know, this guy is very serious.  I did an article for the, a literary magazine at the University of Florida that first year about why I came.  And, yeah, I had a right to be there.  I can't find that article.  My wife is looking for it.  She had it, you know.  I'm here because I'm a native of Florida.  I have a right to be here.  And I'm not coming here to integrate.  I'm coming here to get a legal education, and I'm entitled to a legal education.  I'm entitled to pursue any career I want to do.  So I'm not asking for a handout.  I'm gonna earn the degree, but you can't deny me that degree.
Speaker 2: So as you said, you know, you're not granting interviews to the press.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: You're just working 24/7.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 338729
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite courses?
Speaker 2: All of law was just hard, and some of the, I guess, negligence, criminal law, constitutional law, and I'd had a lot of familiarity from undergraduate school [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] with constitutional law.  And although the cases, you know: civil rights cases, Dred Scott [Dred Scott v. Sandford, 1857], and all that; all these kind of cases, they were fascinating still; but just the discipline of having, they'd give you enormous amounts of work, yeah.  I'd sleep every other day my first semester [at University of Florida College of Law; Fredric G. Levin College of Law, Gainesville, Florida].  I wouldn't, you know, I'd just study all the time.
Speaker 1: And how old were your children at this time?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were seven, five and six.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they're active (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Four, five and seven.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Active, they need attention, and full of energy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so--yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're up.
Speaker 2: And then all I did was study.
Speaker 1: Do you actually remember their childhood at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, you know, I'd, once a month I'd pack them in the car and we'd go to the segregated theater, drive-in theater and park on the back row; 'cause that's where black folk could park.
Speaker 1: Oh.  So you couldn't even park--
Speaker 2: You, in the drive-in theater, the back row was reserved for colored people.  But it was a dollar then for the whole car, and we'd make a big thing of lemonade and put ice in it, and we'd make our own pop, pop our own popcorn.  We'd take our own food there.  And my youngest, when the advertisements would come with hot dogs and hamburgers and everything, he says, "Dad, I want a hot dog."  And I says, "Well, no you can't have a hot dog.  That's for white people."
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Like the little dancing hot dog that jumps on the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.  And he would always say, "I want me a hot dog."  And I says, "You can't have that.  That's for white people."  You know, we didn't have any money (laughter). . (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yeah, we didn't have any money to buy it, that's why we popped our own popcorn and brought our Kool-Aid.  But he once said, "I want a real Coke [Coca-Cola]."  And I says, "You can't have that, man.  That's for white people (laughter)."
Speaker 2: That is naughty.  That's for white people.
Speaker 1: Well, we didn't have any money (laughter).  See, we had the one dollar to get in.
Speaker 2: And that's it.
Speaker 1: And we're good.  That's right.  And we'd pack our lunch.
Speaker 2: That is actually the best part about being in a drive-in anyway.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Bringing your own stuff.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah--
Story_ID: 338730
Speaker 1: So, con law [constitutional law], torts those--any of the professors then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Practice court.  Practice court was a favorite.  We had to try cases.  That was great.  Professor Hayford Enwall taught practice court.  And he's also kind of the placement person that helped students find jobs.  And, my senior year, he helped me do my resume, and he says, "Who do you want me to send this resume to?"  And I said, "What do you mean who?"  And he says, "Do you have a list of black law firms I can send it to?"  And I said, "No."  I said, "Number one, Professor Enwall, I don't think you understand.  There are no black law firms (laughter)."  I said, "Where did you send my classmates' resume?"  And he says, "I send them to all the law firms."  I said, "Well, hell, send mine to all of them."  I mean, what's this?  You gonna discriminate against me (laughter)?"
Speaker 1: After all of this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So he said, "Touche. You're right."  He said, "I apologize."  And he sent them to all of them.  And I got two offers, one from a black lawyer.  It was going to, two of them were going to go together and hire me for thirty-five [dollars] a week.
Speaker 1: Thirty-five dollars a week.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had left the [U.S.] Army making six hundred dollars, over six hundred [dollars] a month.  And gone through all the rigors of law school [University of Florida College of Law; Fredric G. Levin College of Law, Gainesville, Florida] and my first offer was one hundred forty [dollars] a month.
Speaker 1: So if you'd remain an orderly at the hospital [Alachua General Hospital, Gainesville, Florida], how much would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) More than thirty-five [dollars] a week.  But--
Speaker 1: Interesting.
Speaker 2: --and then I got an offer from a white law firm in Miami [Florida]; Orr and Kaplan, seventy-five [dollars] a week.  So I took the job with the black, the two black guys for a week.  And they were not good practitioners.  And one guy believed in voodoo and hoodoo.  He was spending more money on bring 'em-in-oil and bags of--and things around his neck to ward off evil spirits, and he was paying me.  So I said, after one week, I told my wife [Enid Meadows Allen], I says, "I gotta get out of here before I catch something (laughter)."
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  You're not even telling the truth.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  So I left there and I went home.  And then I said, "Well, I'm going down to Miami, and I'm gonna check on this other law firm.  So I drove down there and interviewed and they hired me for seventy-five [dollars] a week.  Orr and Kaplan.  And they had a big thing in the paper, "Your first integrated law firm south of Washington, D.C."  A big brouhaha, seventy-five [dollars] a week (laughter).
Speaker 1: You also would think the distance between Washington, D.C. and Miami is rather great.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so I stayed there six months.  And I went in for a raise.  My wife was taking care of the family.  She was making seven hundred fifty dollars a month as a head nurse at a Christian hospital, a black hospital in Miami.  And I was making three hundred [dollars], bringing home sixty-eight dollars a week, you know.  And I says, so I says, and we were doing big business at that law firm.  They had turned over all the property work to me.  And I didn't like property, but, you know, they made me the property specialist.  And I did all the real estate closings and mortgages.
Speaker 1: What was a white associate making?
Speaker 2: Much--no, no.  There were two partners and myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, so no other associates?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I worked--and I was bringing in more than them.  I was the first person there, and I've always been self-motivated and a work, a workaholic, they say.  So I would arrive before everybody.  And I would go through all the records.  And then everybody would leave and I'd be the last to leave.  So I'd go through all the records.  I knew what I was billing, and I knew what I was collecting.  I knew what they were billing and what they were collecting.  And so I went in and says, "I got to have a raise."  And Jack Orr said, "I can't give it to you."  And I said, "Why not?"  And he says, "Business is slow."  And I said, "Jack, do you realize what I'm bringing in to this firm?"  He said, "No.  What are you bringing in?"  And I said, "It's your client.  But I am billing and collecting five thousand [dollars] a month.  And you're paying me three hundred [dollars]."
Speaker 1: Not even 10 percent.
Speaker 2: I said, "Now, you're making a lot of money off of me.  So I am not asking for a raise, I'm telling you.  If you don't give me a raise, I'm gone."  He said, "Well, I can't give you one."  I said, "Fine.  You got two weeks' notice."  And he says, "Well, how much did you want?"  I said, "I don't want anything now.  I'm gone."  He said, "Where are you going to go?"  And I said, "That's none of your business.  I'm gone from here."

Speaker 1: I had been offered a job in Fort Lauderdale [Florida].  I was in Miami [Florida].  And so I called the guy and I says, "You know, I'm available in two weeks."  And he says, "Fine."  So I came here as general counsel of a construction company named P.M. Construction [P.M. Construction, Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Miami].  And I represented a Jewish fella named Martin Fridovich, and he introduced me to all of his friends, and so my Jewish clientele was very heavy.  And so I had to go out and do some free work with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in churches in order to get some black clients, 'cause my clientele for the first three or four months, you know, was totally Jewish.
Speaker 2: Now, that's interesting.
Speaker 1: So I had to go out and find some, I had to integrate my work.  So I volunteered for a lot of stuff and built up a practice and a following in both communities.
Speaker 2: What were some of the things that you were volunteering for?
Speaker 1: Oh, the first day in Fort Lauderdale, I rented a house from Martin.  Martin had developed a lot of properties.  And I asked him to give me a list of his houses, and he says, "Well, you know, let me make a list of all the houses in the black communities."  I said, "Wait a goddamn minute.  I'm your general counsel, and you of all people, you're gonna give me a list of houses in the black community?"  He says, "I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Won't ever happen again."  So I got his list, and I moved into this house that was in kind of border line within a white area.  And I went down to cut the water on at city hall, and I saw this black fella talking and had a lot of black people in the city commission meeting room.  And so I went in and sat in the back.  It was about eleven o'clock, and I didn't have anything to do, so.  And they were trying to get the city to close down the city dump in Fort Lauderdale.  It was principally in the black community.  It was in the black community.  And they were not doing well.  And the spokesperson they had was not doing a good job of selling the city commissioner about what they wanted to do.  And so about that time they were breaking for lunch and I introduced myself and, you know, I said, "I'm a new lawyer.  I'm moving into town.  I got here last week, and I'm moving my family in next week."  And I said, "I noticed that you are having a little difficult here.  What's the issue?"  And they says, "You're a lawyer?"  And I says, "Yeah."  So they said, "We take you to lunch?"  And so, they took me to lunch to a place called Tasty Luncheonette [Fort Lauderdale, Florida].  The owner's nickname was Sissy Willie (laughter).  And he was a hell of a cook.
Speaker 2: Sissy Willie.
Speaker 1: Sissy Willie.  He was Deacon Freeman [Willie Freeman], but, you know, everybody called him Sissy Willie.  And he owned the Tasty Luncheonette.  And so they took me over there for a good soul food lunch.  And they brought me up to speed real fast, and one o'clock we went, and I said, "My name is [HistoryMaker] W. George Allen, and I represent these homeowners."  And--
Speaker 2: Just like that.
Speaker 1: --I was their spokesperson.  And eventually, I had to file suit.  But we won.  They, we closed it down.  But that was my first black client in Fort Lauderdale (laughter).

Speaker 1: I want to go back to law school [University of Florida College of Law; Fredric G. Levin College of Law, Gainesville, Florida] just for a hot second.  So you attribute your--and I'm not going to say that it was smooth--but the lack of physical violence towards you, the lack of shunning towards to, your decision to not deal with the press and being more mature and a dedicated student, I can understand that part.  But why do you think the professors and some of the students responded to you in a positive fashion?
Speaker 2: I think the professors and the students were much more sophisticated than most folks thought.  And they accepted me as a student.  After the first year, I got active with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and especially the youth.  And I started organizing them to do sit-ins.  The mayor of Gainesville [Florida] at that time was Byron Winn [Byron Winn, II] that owned a restaurant downtown called the Primrose Grill [Primrose Inn and Grill, Gainesville, Florida].  And he had been nice to the black community; contributed to the NAACP.  And I organized the youth group of the NAACP, and convinced him that we ought sit-in, and the first place we sat in was the Primrose Grill.  And Byron came to me and says, "George [HistoryMaker W. George Allen], I've been your friend.  I supported you and the NAACP.  Why would you come sit-in my restaurant first?"  And I said, "Because, Mr. Mayor, if you integrate and if we come and sit-in in your restaurant and force you to desegregate, no one else will bother us."  And he said, "I understand."  He integrated.  And then it was easier to go to Woolworths [F. W. Woolworth Company].  Worst food, but an easier place to integrate.  And then we went to the theaters and started.  I had by that time changed my old raggedy '51 [1951] Chevrolet and bought a Biscayne Chevrolet.
Speaker 1: A Biscayne Chevrolet.
Speaker 2: And I parked it in front of the theater and had the students go buy tickets to go in.  And somebody, some white guy spit all over my car and broke the antenna.
Speaker 1: That's really, like, ridiculous.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I made sure that I started at my second year of being an activist and helping the community.  My third year, I had gone to summer school real fast, and I needed ten hours to graduate in September of 1960.  And that's when Meredith [James Meredith] entered the University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi].  And Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Holmes--[HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault entered, and Hamilton Holmes entered the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia].  They were freshmen starting out when I was a senior at the University of Florida.
Speaker 1: And you were how old?
Speaker 2: I guess, at that time, twenty-seven.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And father of three.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so the State of Florida NAACP had a big program in Tampa [Florida] and invited Hamilton and Charlayne and James Meredith to come down, and they gave us awards for integrating higher education in the South.
Story_ID: 335836
Speaker 1: So now we'll jump back to you as a young attorney here in Fort Lauderdale [Florida].  Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you're working diligently to integrate your solo practice now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Because clearly your white firms are not gonna give you the pay that you, obviously that you deserve.  And as you said, I guess there were no black firms for you to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --align yourself with.
Speaker 2: There were two black lawyers in Fort Lauderdale when I came here; Raleigh Rolls [ph.]--the oldest was Thomas J. Redding, Jr. [ph.], and he was practicing by himself; and the other one was Raleigh Rolls, who was practicing by himself; both in the black community.  Fortunately, when I had my first office with P.M. Construction [P.M. Construction, Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Florida] and Martin Fridovich, he had his office in the black community.  So I knew and kind of operated in the black community.  After six months, my practice was so big, Martin Fridovich got a little worried.  Although we had the same office, I had the right to practice and I had my separate secretary and my separate filing system.  And I was doing all of his work; his foreclosures; I did, I negotiated all of his mortgages and closed them; and I had about thirty files of his that I kept on, right on top of his, I did his work first.  But then I was very busy doing a lot of pro bono work and representing private clients.  And so after about six months he kind of saw that I was doing well, and I was doing well.  So he had his secretary count all my files, and he says, "You know you got thirty-two for me, and you got about fifty private files."  You know.  "I says, wait a minute.  My private files--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, they are not for you to peruse or anyone else to peruse.  I mean, you are out of line."
Speaker 1: Attorney-client privilege.
Speaker 2: "You are out of line.  How dare you go through my files?"  And so I quit.
Story_ID: 335837
Speaker 1: And I called Alcee Hastings that attended Crooms Academy [Crooms Academy of Information Technology, Sanford, Florida] with me in high school.  And he was at FAMU's law school [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University College of Law, Orlando, Florida].  So I called him and I says, "I understand you took the bar and the boys say you passed."  And he said, "Yeah."  And I said, "Well, I'm getting ready to go out on my own.  Why don't you come to Fort Lauderdale [Florida]?  Do you have anywhere to go?"  And he says, "No."  So he came to Fort Lauderdale, and I showed him all my cases, and I says, "You know, I got about a hundred files, active files, and I'm, you know, doing well with making money.  And it's enough for two."  And he says, "What are you offering me?"  I said, "Full partnership.  Fifty, fifty."  And he says, "Got a deal (laughter)."  So we became partners.  And then we went around Fort Lauderdale looking for a place to put our office, 'cause Alcee says, "I'm not going, I don't want to practice law in the black community."  And I says, "You know, you're right, Al."  So we went around looking, and we went to a commercial, a realtor that was the biggest guy in town.  And we walked in, and the secretary, the receptionist said, "May I help you?"  And I said, "Yes.  We'd like to rent office space downtown."  And she got up and says, "One moment, please."  Went in the back, shut the door and never came out.  So Alcee says, "I'm calling a press conference."  And he called a press conference and blasted everybody.  He said Fort Lauderdale was prejudiced, wouldn't allow two black lawyers to rent space downtown.  And it hit the paper.  And this was Friday.  Saturday morning I get a phone call from this guy, says, "Are you one of the black lawyers that says that the whole town is prejudiced?"  And I said, "Yeah."  He said, "My name is Charles Rich.  I'm a lawyer here.  And I have space downtown one block from the courthouse."  And I said, "What are you doing now?"  He says, "I'm just having coffee at home."  And I says, "How long would it get you to--take you to get to the office?"  And he says, "I can be there in thirty minutes."  And I said, "Fine.  Meet you over there."  So I called Alcee and I says, "This guy has some space.  Come by or I'll come by and pick you up."  And we drove down one block from the courthouse at 325 Southeast 6th Street.  The courthouse is at 201 Southeast 6th Street.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We looked at the office.  And so I said, "Good set up," with the reception area, I mean a waiting room and a reception area, and then private offices and he had a library.  And I says, "We're going to need two offices and space for a secretary."  And he said, "You got a secretary?"  And I said, "No.  We don't have a secretary (simultaneous)."
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause you don't have any space.
Speaker 1: We had one, but Alcee didn't like the young lady that I had been training.  He says, "Oh, she--we need somebody that's professional and knows what they're doing.  You're training her."  And I'd write out everything.  So he says, "My wife's a legal secretary."  And he says, "She, until you find one, she'll take you guys on, and she'll do my work, your work."  And I says, "If that's okay with her."  So we made a deal on how much we were going to pay her.  And we chose offices, and we moved in that Monday.  And we practiced law with him and had a great relationship.  And then Alcee and I--oh, the building was sold.  Some guy called me and said, "Is that building you in worth $60,000?"  And I says, "Hell, yes."  "Is it for sale?"  And he says, "George [HistoryMaker W. George Allen], without looking,"--this guy, Shelby Dale [C. Shelby Dale], white lawyer; he said, "George, without looking at it, I'm taking your word because I know you're a good businessman."  And he bought it sight unseen.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) At sixty grand?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That is wild.  So now, how long were and Judge Hastings were, well, I know he wasn't a judge then.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: But how long were you--
Speaker 1: Three years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we were so successful, success made us part (laughter).  We were making, we were doing all well.  Everything that happened in this county [Broward County, Florida], we had right of first refusal; anything happened.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Accidents, you know, the criminal cases, yeah; all of the civil rights stuff.
Story_ID: 335838
Speaker 1: What was becoming your specialty at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I was still doing a lot of property.  And I started getting a lot of personal injury cases.  And that was where the money was.  So I kind of cultivated in that practice.  And I started doing probate and doing very well with probate.  So I kind of gravitated toward administrative law, personal injury and probate; litigation and probate.  And but I did a lot of criminal law, too, and a lot of, some domestic relations, divorce work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't like it, still don't like it, but I still do some that people make me do.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Your face is like it just had a (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, well.  It's--see now, when people get, you know, they, I get so emotional about property and kids.  And divorce work gets nasty sometimes.
Speaker 1: This is true.
Speaker 2: And it's just not--most times you walk away with two people mad, your client and the other side.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Very true.  So, I guess, you just explained really what your practice covers now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 335839
Speaker 1: Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson] wanted me to ask you about Willie E. Gary.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your relationship with Willie Gary.
Speaker 2: Very good.  When Willie started practicing law, he would call me and ask me to send him a complaint, you know, one of the divorce cases.  Send him a complaint.  And so he was, I was kind of a mentor.  And I, you know, we're still friends.  And he obviously has done very well, and I'm very proud of how well he's done.  But I remember when he was starting out.  Well, you know, he would (laughter) he didn't know how to do anything.  And then but all of us in the legal profession help each, black and white.  It's kind of a fraternity, a sorority where all of us try to help each other.  And when you're in court being nasty to a lawyer one day means you may meet him tomorrow and he's nasty to you.  So being civil and being professional ensures that you get along and you go along.  And you live a better life, and you don't have to look over your shoulder.
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When people ask me, "Look, I can't file an answer on this case, don't get a default against me.  I'll do it next week."  And if I say, "Yes," they know that my word is good.  And that's what you have to be in this practice.  So, but and Willie has just taken the practice of law to another level.
Speaker 1: Now, does he lend you his jet or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).  But he's invited me on it.
Speaker 1: Wants you to fly it?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  No I don't want to.  But I don't like small planes.  And, you now, if I die in a crash, I mean, it's gonna make big news 'cause I'm gonna be with a lot of people. I don't wanna die (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're not going alone.
Speaker 2: --with a small group (laughter).  I want, you know, it should be monumental.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't think anybody could really forget you at all.
Story_ID: 335840
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about you being this child of farmers in a little town [Sanford, Florida] in Florida; and now looking in your very snazzy suit and your own law firm.  How did that guy, that little kid, get from there to here?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm surprised.  I never knew I would be as successful as I have been.  And much of it is my wife [Enid Meadows Allen].  She's a, the motivating force and kind of the anchor that kind of keeps me straight and keeps me from believing all the hoopla.  And I've always had a strong family that were behind me, and I've been supportive of, too.  Yeah.  So it's a combination of family and ambition, and the ability to work hard.  And I enjoy what I do.  I like helping people.  And I like being paid for it.  And I like the rewards.  I've, yeah, I enjoy a good life, and I don't apologize that I live good, but I work hard and I earned the right to live good.
Speaker 1: What does it--I mean 'cause your mother [Lessie Williams Brown] said, "Lawyers don't go to heaven."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did she ever change her mind on that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She thinks that I did good. She thinks I may make it.
Speaker 1: Maybe one more pro bono case, that'll (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --put you over the edge.
Speaker 2: But she kind of realizes that there is a measure of good in what we do: integrating schools; that I did the Broward County [Florida] school and the Hendry County [Florida] school; and I sued (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --to get medical care for farm workers out in Hendry County; and closed down labor camps and got affordable housing built out in Hendry County and Clewiston [Florida].  My church, I negotiated and put together an affordable housing package with Mount Olive Baptist Church [New Mount Olive Baptist Church, Fort Lauderdale, Florida].  Almost forty years ago, we built Mount Olive Garden Apartments [Fort Lauderdale, Florida] for low and moderate income families, sixty units that the church, a church corporation owns.  They got a forty-year mortgage they're gonna be, they're gonna be paying it off within the next three years.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And so, all of that kind of good.  And my mom saw that, you know, "Perhaps there is hope for you."
Story_ID: 335841
Speaker 1: Talking about all of these things, it leads me to the question of what legacy do you hope to leave others.  And not, you know, you obviously don't have to be dead to have a legacy.  But what are some of the lessons in your life that you hope others will learn from?
Speaker 2: That to whom much is given, much is required.  And we have to share our talents and our wealth and our abilities.  And I've shared.  I've hired a lot of lawyers, trained a lot of lawyers.  I've given back to the community, to my church [Mount Olive Baptist Church; New Mount Olive Baptist Church, Fort Lauderdale, Florida], to my school; and I'm still giving back.  And I enjoy what I do, and I think that most folks will kind of look back and see that, I mean, I just didn't take cases that paid me.  I did a lot of pro bono work, and I continue to do so because I have the ability to help people, and I have the ability to kind of champion causes that some other people don't do.  And there are very few people that do criminal and civil.  And most of the people that are doing the big work now, they don't do the little work anymore.  They don't get involved with little people and their little causes.  And I still do.  I have some very good clients, but I still will take a traffic case every now and then, and I'll take a divorce case from people that can't pay and--but they need help.
Story_ID: 335842
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was, you know, one question that slipped my mind earlier: how did the dearth of black lawyers negatively impact black people just across the board?  What is your assessment?  'Cause even still, black attorneys represent, what, 1 to 4 percent of all the attorneys in the United States.
Speaker 2: We are not, our numbers are not high enough.  And we're doing that.  That's one of the reasons we're trying to keep--we're trying to revive FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] as a law school, and we're pushing for, you know, Howard University [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] has educated a lot of our black lawyers.  And so has Texas Southern University [Thurgood Marshall School of Law, Houston, Texas] in Texas (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: But the black law schools and the black medical schools have educated the black professionals.  And that's been, and that's the same thing with the black, the historical black colleges and universities [HBCUs].  Most of the kids go there are black.  And so we are educating leadership.  So and we have to push for more black schools, and we have to send our kids to them.  Many of us, because, you know, because, get successful then we insist that our kids go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  We--if we fight for FAMU to have a law school, let's send our kids there.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, now, I find that interesting, because, you know, you integrated the University of Florida [University of Florida College of Law; Fredric G. Levin College of Law, Gainesville, Florida].  You--now, did you feel like you were just--you were doing it because it was, as you said, it was important you earned the right, you were a resident of the State of Florida, and you had a right to go there just as much as you had a right to go to any other state school or was a part of it also, I just want to have opened doors that have been closed?
Speaker 2: All of that.  You know, I wanted to open the door.  It so happened that I had four children.  I have one daughter and three sons.  One of my sons graduated from FAMU and went to the University of Florida law school.  My daughter graduated from Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: What year did she graduate?
Speaker 2: I can't even remember.  She's thirty-eight, so I'm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, my God.  She's part of my class.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Amy Allen.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  This is too much today.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, anyway, she attended the University of Florida law school and graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of my kids went to black schools, undergrad because I insisted.  And I told them that's where I was sending my money.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So you could follow (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And if they wanted to join up with my money, they had to go to a black school, undergraduate.  After then, you know, wherever they wanted to go to school was fine.  But I think it's important that we support our institutions.
Speaker 1: So that--okay.  Because, I mean, as a trailblazer in integrating a school, I find it interesting that you say how important that is as well.  So I wanted you to explain that, so.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 335843
Speaker 1: But just jumping back to the lack of black attorneys specifically and its effect on how black people deal with the civil and criminal justice system, what impact do you think that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, we have now, I bet, I told you I was the third black lawyer in Broward County [Florida].  Alcee [Alcee Hastings] was the fourth.  Now there are over two hundred.  So although the population has grown, the number of lawyers grew exponentially.  So we have more lawyers and they're doing more things.  The county attorney in Broward County is black.  The attorney for the property appraiser is black.  I mean there is nothing black about those jobs.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's just that they are good lawyers.  And my clientele has always been heavily white, not because I'm black, but because I'm good and I deliver, and I work hard, and I get good results.  So and I've never wanted to be a black lawyer; quote black lawyer.  I wanted to be the best lawyer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause it
Speaker 2: --in this community.
Speaker 1: In your mind, what is a black lawyer?  I know what I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, someone who's, you know--and then some lawyers would say, you know, "I'm the best black lawyer in this town."  And but, I've never wanted to be, and I've never couched myself in those terms.  My clientele comes to me because I can deliver and I do deliver, and I work hard.  And they know that I'm gonna be in there fighting for their cause.  So, you know, and when, every now and then when I was first starting out, I'd have black people suing my clients, who were white.  And I'd show up representing a white person.  And they'd have a white lawyer representing them.  And those are the cases I worked hardest on to beat up on them.  One guy was from Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], probably the dumbest lawyer in the county.  And all he said was "I graduated from Harvard Law School."  But he was so dumb.  Everybody beat him.  I don't think the guy ever won a case.  So going to Harvard doesn't mean you're smart.
Speaker 1: Well, that's interesting (laughter).  Yeah, that means you get a seat on the [U.S.] Supreme Court, but doesn't mean that you're smart.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  That's not all of them (laughter).
Speaker 1: This is true--
Story_ID: 335844
Speaker 1: Before I ask my very last question, is there anything that you wanted to talk about that I didn't specifically ask you about?
Speaker 2: No.  You've covered the gamut.
Speaker 1: I did a good job?
Speaker 2: You did a great job.
Speaker 1: Oh, thanks.  I appreciate that.
Speaker 2: All you need to do is learn how to dip snuff (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You are so naughty.  Well, I was going to ask you how you want to be remembered.  I think maybe that's it, like, if you dip snuff, everything will be okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But, yeah.  And some people, you know, may find that question, like, "Oh, I don't want to think about myself after I'm gone," but--
Speaker 2: Well, no.  I have no illusions about dying.  And I know I'm gonna die.  But I think my friends know that I've lived a long and good life.  I'm gonna be seventy next month.
Speaker 1: Really?  On the 3rd?
Speaker 2: And I travel a lot.  We live good.  My wife's [Enid Meadows Allen] happy, I think (laughter).  She and my kids are good.  So, I've a very happy life and a good life.  And it's not over yet.  I'm gonna continue to have fun, live good, and help others.  And that's a bonus that I'm making some people happy.  I make some unhappy, too.  But that's part of the game.  That's what I do for a living.
Speaker 1: Well, I want to thank you very much.  And I think you came in under our time limit for you today too.
Speaker 2: Very good.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you so much.  This has been an absolute pleasure.
Speaker 2: Good.
