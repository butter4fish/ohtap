Speaker 1: Our HistoryMaker guest today is Mr. John Carlos.  The videographer is Scott Stearns.  Visiting--observing is Mr. William Wright and Miss Gina Embry [ph.].  Welcome, Mr. Carlos.
Speaker 2: It's good to be here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's begin by asking you some very easy questions.  And the first one is going to be where is this interview taking place today?
Speaker 2: At this particular time, we're at Palm Springs High School, Palm Springs, California, in my classroom, Room 906 or Bungalow 906 at approximately 2 PM--
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: --On the 29th of--what is this, March?
Speaker 1: Twenty-ninth of March.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You anticipated--what year?
Speaker 2: 2006.
Story_ID: 137145
Speaker 1: Alright, you anticipated my next question.  We've gotten that.  Now, I'm going to ask you five People magazine questions.  They'll be easy, but they say that this will relax you.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food, probably black beans and rice.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Black rice, squid.  Some food my mother [Vioris Lawence] used to cook for me when I was a kid.  Some Cuban dishes.
Speaker 1: Alright.  How about--what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Green.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You're the second person who said that, in a row.  What is your favorite vacation spot?
Speaker 2: My favorite vacation spot, probably anywhere in the world I can find some peace.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, some solitude where I can get away.  It's no particular spot as much as me just finding a spot that I can live where it's calm, well, so to speak, hiding out from the world.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your favorite saying or phrase?
Speaker 2: "See ya. Hate to be ya."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's a favorite of a friend of mine.
Speaker 2: That's what I tell the kids--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --That don't want to get no education.
Speaker 1: That's when you'll kick him out of school?
Speaker 2: That's what I tell 'em.  No, I don't kick 'em out, but I tell 'em, I say, "Man, remember this, 'See ya. Hate to be ya.'  So when you're sitting on the curb and you got your head down and you wondering why God dumping on you, you just remember, you can't tell God that didn't nobody tell you because Mr. Carlos is here to tell you now that he let you know."--
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: --"That's why I'm stepping off.  I don't want to be you.  You don't want to be nothing in life.  I'm trying to climb to the top of the mountain."
Speaker 1: Alright, good.
Speaker 2: So I'll leave them with that phrase.
Story_ID: 137146
Speaker 1: We're going to go back in your earliest memories of what your family, mother [Vioris Lawrence] or father [Earl Vanderbilt Carlos] may have told you or--how far back can we take you to what you know about your mother's family and then we're going to try to do the same thing with your father's family.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother's family, I never got a chance to meet my mother's father and mother.  They were born in Cuba in Havana, Cuba.  My mother's raised in a little country town there in Cuba called Joaquim [ph.].
Speaker 1: How do you spell it?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really couldn't spell it for you.  I can hardly pronounce it.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Okay?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: My mother came to America in 1927, I think it was. '26 (1926), somewhere around there.  She was engaged to a fellow that became my stepdad later.  She was engaged to this guy. He was a New York City policeman at the time.  He stepped down from being a New York City cop and decided that he wanted to pursue his cooking career, and he became a merchant sailor, a merchant marine, a cook on the ship.  And as I said, he and my mom was engaged and he went off on the ship.  By the time he got back, my dad and mom was married.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: And, show you how life goes, you know. My mom and my dad had a wonderful life together, beautiful family.  And then when my dad died, I think the next week after my dad died and was buried, here come Big George walking down the street and saw my mother.  And, he started talking to her and she said, "Oh, Earl just passed, blah, blah, blah."  So, they caught up for lost years, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're going to take you back a little.  Back then I skipped a few things that I want to get into them.  First of all, I'm going to ask you to give us your full name and to spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Yes.  John Wesley Carlos, J-O-H-N  W-S-E-L-E-Y (sic, W-E-S-L-E-Y), Carlos, C-A-R-L-O-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your date of birth?
Speaker 2: 6-5-45 [June 5, 1945].
Speaker 1: And your place of birth?
Speaker 2: New York, New York.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Good enough.  And now, let's go to your mom.  Give me her full name.
Speaker 2: Vioris, V-I-O-R-I-S.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: You want her maiden name or--
Speaker 1: Maiden name.
Speaker 2: Maiden name was Lawrence.
Speaker 1: Okay, and her place of birth was Havana, Cuba?
Speaker 2: Let's say Cuba because I'm not sure about, whether it was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Havana, but Cuba for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We'll leave it there at that.  And that--that date of birth for your mother?
Speaker 2: I don't know my mother's date of birth.
Story_ID: 137147
Speaker 1: Let's go to your dad and his place of birth.  His name first?
Speaker 2: Earl Vanderbilt Carlos.
Speaker 1: E-A-R-L?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Vanderbilt?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: V-A-D--V-A-N-D?
Speaker 2: Right.  Same just like the old Vanderbilts you used to know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Used always wonder whether they was my father's uncles (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) could have been.
Speaker 2: With that name, right?
Speaker 1: Could have been.  You've got an inheritance sitting around someplace.
Speaker 2: Right, my dad was born in Camden, South Carolina, in 1895.
Speaker 1: Any more details other than that or just--month or day?
Speaker 2: December 23, 1895.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay.  Good enough.  Now, how far, I'm sure your dad and your mom [Vioris Lawrence] talked to you when you were young about some of their parents and so forth.  How far back do you remember them telling you about family, their family?
Speaker 2: You know, to be honest with you, we never discussed their families.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I'm the youngest son out of three boys, and I had three sisters as well, two older, one younger.  We never really had any discussions about our grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, my mom and dad was hardworking.  My mom worked as a domesticated worker when she came in from Cuba.  I don't know whether you would know what that entails, cleaning people's houses, and then she used to go clean the abortion offices, all the doctors in New York that was giving abortions.  My mother worked from there and decided that, hey, I don't want to do this.  So she went to school and got her a degree for a nurse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she became a nurse in Bellevue Hospital [later Bellevue Hospital Center, New York, New York].  My dad--my dad was a shoemaker, a cobbler.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, okay.
Speaker 2: He had his own business for as long as I could remember, from day one of my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My dad was always independent, had his own business.  And I remember when we was kids, the Asians came in. The Chinese used to come into America at that time and they had no social life.  So what he did, he started a social club for the Asians--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --And, as a matter of fact, my father was the president of the association, my mom was the secretary, and me and my brothers, we were board members.  And that's probably what led me into the business world in terms of what my father did and how he did it, and he worked something with the Savoy Ballroom [Harlem, New York, New York] where they could come in there and have meetings, and at the same time had their little dances or whatever.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: In there as well.
Story_ID: 137148
Speaker 1: Now, do you--do you remember where that his cobbler shop was located?
Speaker 2: 626 Lenox Avenue [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Right down the street from the Savoy Ballroom.  When I say right down the street, I'm actually meaning a half a block from the Savoy Ballroom.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I could open my window and hear all the jazz every night, all night.  And I remember they had the Golden Gate [Ballroom, New York, New York] where a lot of kids from the community used go up in the Golden Gate and have activities, recreational activities, and competitions, and so forth.  The Savoy Ballroom used to put on a big gala Christmas affair for every kid in New York that could get there, for primarily the kids that didn't have anything.  But I remember they used to have for a kid, the requirement for a young man to get in there was to have a tie. The requirement for a young lady was to have a dress.  The ladies couldn't do what the guys do with the tie, because we only had one tie. We'd all use the tie and go to the bathroom and throw it out the window for the next guy to come in.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But at the end of the day, it was such a wonderful activity for all the kids because everybody came home with something special, Schwinn bicycles, Spalding basketballs, baseballs, Lionel trains, any type of toy that they had for kids at that particular time, they were donated to the Savoy to have this big Christmas deal every year and it's really a shame because they don't do things like that anymore.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they sure don't.  But I do remember those days--
Story_ID: 137149
Speaker 1: Let's, let's visit--now, I'd like to get your siblings, and if you could from the oldest down to the youngest.
Speaker 2: My siblings or my brothers and sisters you talking about?  My parents' siblings?
Speaker 1: No, no.  Your--
Speaker 2: My siblings?
Speaker 1: Your siblings. I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Alright, well, my oldest is Kimme.
Speaker 1: K-I- --
Speaker 2: --M-M-E.  She's my oldest. She come into the world in 1940. Not 1940, 1965.  Okay.  Then my next one is Malik.
Speaker 1: Spell that for us.
Speaker 2: M-A-L-I-K.  And there's Carlos as well, and he came in the 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hold on a second.  (Pause).  Well, I asked him that.  That's what he said he wanted now, the kids, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, these are your siblings?
Speaker 2: These are my siblings, right.  That's what I was asking him about that when he said it.  He said siblings, and I asked him which ones is he talking about, my mother's--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Those are mine.  You want my brothers and sisters?  Let me give you them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because that's what I was a little confused about.  You know, it sounded like you wanted my kids--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --But I thought it was my brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.  My oldest brother's name was Earl.
Speaker 1: Earl?
Speaker 2: Is Earl.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Earl Vanderbilt Carlos, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay?
Speaker 1: And date of birth for him if you remember.  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: March 19, 1942, '41 (1941), somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's close enough.
Speaker 2: I think he just turned sixty-five. I think he just turned sixty-five, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there was Andrew.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He came in 1943, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: '44 (1944), '44 (1944.
Speaker 1: The month for--
Speaker 2: November
Speaker 1: November?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Earl was in March. Andrew was in November.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think his is November 3rd [1944].
Speaker 1: Third, got you.
Speaker 2: Forty-four.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there was--
Speaker 1: There was John in '45 [1945].
Speaker 2: And John came in '45 [1945], right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a younger sister that came--I'm 45 [1945]. I'm sixty. She's fifty-four.  So what would that be?
Speaker 1: She's--
Speaker 2: Fifty-one?  Yeah, around fifty-two I think. She's fifty-two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think her and Charlene came--
Speaker 1: And what was her name?
Speaker 2: --Hepsey.
Speaker 1: Spell that.
Speaker 2: H-E-P-S-E-Y.
Speaker 1: "B" as in "boy," S-E-Y.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was the date?
Speaker 2: No. H-E-P-, P.
Speaker 1: Oh, "P" as in "Paul."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, she was born--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --July 7th--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --1952 I believe.
Speaker 1: '52 [1952].  Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I have a stepsister, Doris.
Speaker 1: Doris.
Speaker 2: And don't ask me the date because I can't get it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was--my old man [father, Earl Vanderbilt Carlos] had her pretty early, so--
Speaker 1: Good to know.
Speaker 2: --I know she's up there in age.
Speaker 1: Alright, and this was a child born to your mother [Vioris Lawrence] and your stepfather?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: This was a child born to my mother--my father and I guess one of his former wives, or his former wife.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright, good to know.
Story_ID: 137150
Speaker 1: Alright, let's--what are your earliest memories growing up there in Harlem [New York, New York] there on Lenox Avenue?
Speaker 2: Man, I can take you all the way back to when they used to put me in the drawer.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You think I'm kidding?
Speaker 1: No, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: This is a year old--when I was a kid--
Speaker 1: I bet you don't remember the address that you lived on Lenox.
Speaker 2: 626 Lenox Avenue [Harlem, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: 626?  Okay.
Speaker 2: 626 Lenox Avenue.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: See, my old man [father, Earl Vanderbilt Carlos] had a shop and it was a shoe shop up front, a candy store, and then in the back was the apartment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, right there on Lenox Avenue.
Speaker 1: What was the cross street there on Lenox and--
Speaker 2: Well, 141st Street, 140th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  You know where Colonel Young Park [143rd Street and Lenox Avenue, New York, New York] used to be, right?  Right there at 145th?
Speaker 1: Oh, I lived out by 140th.
Speaker 2: Well, alright.  You were right there at Colonel Young Park.  You know where that is?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's where I grew up, at Colonel Young Park before they even put--remember they used to have them houses out there where that big lot was?  And they tore all the houses down?
Speaker 1: I don't remember--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right there on 100 and--what is it 140--I guess it's about 43rd, 44th somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They had these big apartment buildings around there, and they decided they were going to tear them down, because this is when they first started talking about putting up projects and this and that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I remember they tore them projects down, and tore them houses down, but they left them open.  And I used to go in there and they used to tell you about the bad luck, "You know, you going to get bad luck," and I'd say, "Let me tell you about bad luck," and I'd go there and break every mirror.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, just to show them, you know.  I did run into some bad luck, and I thought about that many years.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but basically, I can remember back to the drawer when they used to take me and put me in this drawer. You know, wrap me up in the blanket and stick me in the drawer.  And I remember when the first time my father came home with this crib.  And I remember them setting the crib up.  And at that time, it was--I used to call it the penitentiary crib because it wasn't a wooden crib, and it wasn't no aluminum crib. It was that heavy steel crib.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, when they had the thing where you can drop.  Well, I used to climb out of the crib regularly, okay, and crawl into the kitchen and pull myself up to the table because my mom [Vioris Lawrence] would cook breakfast every morning and put the sausage and the eggs and bacon, the fish or whatever she put up there, and I used to go up there and steal it. Reach up and pull it down and stick it in my diapers--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) right.
Speaker 2: --And beeline it back to the crib.  And I'm always in the crib, like, working on my muscles and so forth.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I ripped this sliding piece of the crib that you slide up and down, I ripped it out one day and took it and just threw it on the other side of the room.  And my brother and my mother, they were all in there and they was like, "My God, what happened.  Is my baby alright?"  And my mother runs in there, and she's excited and concerned, and they was in awe because they saw this piece of the crib on the other side of the room, and they trying to say, "How can Johnny do this?"  Nobody else in the room, so it had to be me, right?
Speaker 1: Right (laughter).
Speaker 2: But my brother, Andrew, he was so shocked, but he wasn't shocked about me throwing that to the other side of the room.  He was more shocked by the fact that he saw all the bacon and all the grits and eggs and everything in the crib.  Because my mother used to fire him up every day--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Thinking they was doing it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I wouldn't really do no whole bunch of walking.  They would get me up to walk. I would always get back down and crawl or I'll take two steps and go back down and crawl.  So I must have been maybe, before I started walking, walking, I might have been maybe two and a half years old before I would seriously walk.  I would just crawl everywhere.
Speaker 1: Were you a heavy baby or--
Speaker 2: No, I would say I was an average sized baby.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's just that I wasn't ready to walk and they wanted me to walk, and I just wasn't ready.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As it stands, I was a breech baby.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They used to move me around, turn me back to come the right way and every time they would move me, I would move myself back to the way I wanted to come out.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, and they would move me back, and I move back.  This happened maybe three or four times, my mother said.  And then the last time, the doctor told my mother it was near, "Yeah, we're going to do this one more time."  But time I came, I come out feet first again anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, so it had--it's like my life ran almost like it was just a road being built right before my eyes.
Speaker 1: But you remember that in much--great detail don't you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  You can go to my mother. She'll give you the same details.  She remember it too.
Story_ID: 137151
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Now, were you born--
Speaker 2: Oh, you know something.  I have another brother too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mark.
Speaker 1: M-A-R-K or C?
Speaker 2: M-A-R-K.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay and put down Carlos.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His name wasn't Carlos until some time.  I remember when I was a kid, I remember I might have been nine years old, eight years old, and there was a situation, you know, where this woman had tried to accuse my father [Earl Vanderbilt Carlos] of raping--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Her daughter.  But actually, my father and this woman had this little love affair. Her and--him and this young lady.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the girl got pregnant.  And when she got pregnant the mom found out about it but she tried to put a rape charge on my dad.  They went to court and so forth.  And I'd forgotten about this, actually.  And one day I was home and I get a call on the phone and said, "Hey, man.  What's going on?"  I said, "Yeah, how you doing, buddy.  Who is this?"  And it's Mark.  He said, "Man, I think you're my brother."  So I hear people all over the years tell me, "I think I related to you."  "Alright, man.  Send me a picture."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And when he sent me the picture, he looks so much like my brothers until it was kind of scary.  And then I said to him, "I'm sorry man, how old are you?"  And when he told me his age, and it backed down to nine years--I was nine years old, relative to the age that he gave me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, I knew he was my brother because I remember the whole incident.  I remember everything that was going down in the house, the whole shot about what had gone down, and how it had gone down and, you know.  It was just unbelievable.
Speaker 1: And how old were you when you met Mark?
Speaker 2: It's been about two years now.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Since I just--since we just got together with the family.
Speaker 1: Well, that was just recent.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Right.  Now, as a matter of fact, I think he told me that his sister-look like all them girls, he had sisters, and all them knew what was going on.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: About who his family was, this, that, and the other.  And one day I just happened to be on TV, and she looked at him and said, "That's your brother."  And he said, "What?"  She said, "That's your brother."  So he had a lead as to where I was--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Who I was, but he didn't know how to get to me.  And then it's took him about, I think he said two years, and he finally tracked me down at the school here--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --And called me one day.
Speaker 1: That's a great story.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a good story.
Story_ID: 137152
Speaker 1: Let me ask you.  Were you born in a hospital because, I mean, it's not uncommon--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --To be born at home.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was born in Lincoln Hospital [later Lincoln Medical Center, Bronx, New York, New York] in the Bronx.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know of Lincoln.  I went to P.S. 139 [Frederick Douglass Junior High School, Harlem, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: I went to 139 too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  You know, they took--did you see they took it and made it a senior citizens' home now?
Speaker 1: No, I did not know that.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Frederick Douglass.
Speaker 1: Frederick Douglass.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: I used to always jump on them and say, "How could Frederick Douglass be a black man and the school is named after him, but I don't see a picture of him in the school nowhere.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And I know they didn't have no picture up when you were going there because you went before me.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: All we had was that little bronze plaque outside, and it was like a little sketch of him.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I used to say, "Well, wait a minute.  Where is Frederick Douglass?  Where is his father or his mother or somebody," because I didn't see nobody that represented me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, this is probably what set me off to where I am today, before you right now.
Speaker 1: Because that's--
Speaker 2: Oh, that blew me away.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, and in grade school, I remember I used to ask my mother [Vioris Lawrence], I would go home and ask my mom, "Say mom, how come I don't see black people on TV?"  And my mother looked at me kind of like, you supposed to be too young to be asking questions like that. And she said to me real quick, she said, "Well, son, you know, black people are not the main characters in the movie."  And I shot right back to her and I said, "Well, does that mean that we shouldn't have to walk down the street or we couldn't be sitting in a restaurant or coming out the restroom?"  I mean, if we ain't in the movie, that mean we ain't in life.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And my mother looked at me like, whoa, son, you just way ahead of yourself.  But things like that kind of like--
Speaker 1: She was right, you know.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: She was right.  You were way ahead of yourself.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know nothing about that, man.
Speaker 1: Because there're a lot of black folks who weren't asking those questions.
Speaker 2: Well, I think they had them in their heart--in their heart and their mind, but just didn't have the basketballs to step up to the plate.  My whole life is like this.  When I did something, if my old man [father, Earl Vanderbilt Carlos] got wind of it, I'm going to take that ass whipping.
Speaker 1: You would take it?
Speaker 2: Not so much that I deserved it as much as he think I deserve it.  But I did what I did because I thought it was the right thing to do.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, you know, my whole philosophy about that, you know, "Dad, I love you.  Mom, I love you," say, "But the only one I'm really truly committed to is God, and I have to answer to him for what I do."  Anything that I have to ask for down here, I can handle this.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, and that's been my philosophy all my life.  Now, it's probably got me in a lot of trouble over the years, but that's it.
Story_ID: 137153
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about--because you have an excellent memory.  Those--did you go to pre--any preschool?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or you started at kindergarten at--
Speaker 2: Started at kindergarten at P.S. 5.
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you was it P.S. 5.
Speaker 2: P.S. 5.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Right, the old P.S. 5.
Speaker 1: The old--
Speaker 2: Not the new P.S. 5.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I remember going to P.S. 5 and, you know, I wasn't a learning student.  I had learning disabilities.  I couldn't read, I couldn't write.  And then, if you remember at Frederick Douglass [Junior High School, Harlem, New York, New York], at that time you was just a dummy.  It wasn't about you have a learning disability.  You can't read. You just a dummy.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they would put you in corner, put that dummy hat--write dummy down the center of it.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, you know, I had to go through these changes in school.  It wasn't a question of whether I could learn something as much as it was, make me understand the necessity to learn it.  You know, it's about making money, I'm making money, you know.  But, make me understand where this education going to get me any value.  Okay?  Because I noticed that I didn't see no whole bunch of black people that had a suit and tie on going nowhere.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then when I did find one guy used to stay clean every day.  I mean every day he had his shoes shined, suit looking good, tie, crease in his pants every day.  And I say to myself, I say, "God, there's a man there.  He must be the president of a bank or something."  And me and my partners cut out of school one day--we was at Douglass, and we went--you know, we used to go sell our blood, go by our wine, catch our blood count again, and go to the movies.  This particular day we got out of the movies and we saw the hotel, so we stopped at the hotel.  I just wanted to see what a big hotel lobby looked like. So we go up in there--
Speaker 1: Was this the Theresa Hotel [Hotel Theresa, Harlem, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Naw.  This is way downtown.
Speaker 1: Oh, way downtown.
Speaker 2: Way downtown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And lo and behold, the guy that I saw in the suit every day, he was he elevator operator.  So, you know, like I was happy that he had a job, but I was disappointed, too, because I thought that he would actually be maybe the manager of the hotel or the CEO [Chief Executive Officer] or something at a hotel.  And it never dawned on me a guy can be that clean and be the elevator operator.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Back to when I was a kid. I used to chase junkies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know what junkies are, right?
Speaker 1: Yep, I do.
Speaker 2: I used to chase a lot of junkies, not chase them. When I say chase them, meaning that I used to roll with them a lot.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And my father [Earl Vanderbilt Carlos] used to be upset.  "Son, what you doing running around with those junkies?  If I catch you with them junkies, I'm gonna break your neck."  And my old man was a stern individual.  But I had to go with the junkies because there were voids in my mind.  I would see certain things like--I remember when I was a kid they had King Kong [drug].  You remember King Kong, right?
Speaker 1: I remember.
Speaker 2: There was King Kong. At that time was like modern day PCP [drug, Phencyclidine].  They drink it, man, they go to the roof, think they could fly.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So every month, somebody done jump off the roof, kill their self as a result of this.
Story_ID: 137123
Speaker 1: What I want to do is take you back, going into elementary school [at P.S. 5, New York, New York]. First of all, let me address your brothers and sisters.  Now, you must have been more than a pound and half for them (laughter) because it sounds as if you were far ahead of everybody in thinking--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --About conditions.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did your brothers and sisters take you as this precocious child?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, for good or bad.  They took me because I was family.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know I was blood. You know, I did just what I had to do.  If I felt like somebody was bullying my brothers--because my brothers wasn't no fighters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, if they were bullying them, even though I was the littlest one out there, I would go out there and deal with whoever was bullying them.
Speaker 1: Even if it were an older brother?
Speaker 2: It didn't matter.  My oldest brother [Earl Vanderbilt Carlos, Jr.], I remember when a kid broke a stick over his back, and I'm telling him to fight the dude, and he wouldn't fight.  And it kind of annoyed me.  "You mean you going to let a guy break a stick over your back and wouldn't fight?"  So I made him go home.  "You go home."  And then I went and dealt with the dude.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, you got to do things like that.  At that time in the day, too, I guess.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, when I went to grade school, the first time I remember going to grade school at P.S. 5, I'll never forget this, I had ringworm.  Okay, remember, when we used to have ringworm, they used to always give us this medication. It was practicing on us, just to see if it worked.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So they would make us wear a stocking cap, and then they would always go get us a [U.S.] Navy hat, like a sailor's hat--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --To put on.  And I was starting kindergarten that day, and I talked to my mother [Vioris Lawrence] and my father [Earl Vanderbilt Carlos], and I told them, I say, "I don't want to take my hat off."  And I said to my mom, "Did you talk to them people?"  She say, "Don't worry about it.  I talked to them.  Everything is good.  You don't have to worry about it."  And I go to class and I ain't in the class ten minutes and the teacher tell me, "Take your hat off."
Speaker 1: Oh, boy.
Speaker 2: And I'm looking at the teacher like, my mother spoke to you about this.  And before I could actually get it out my mouth to say this to the woman, another student [Cleavy Davis ph.] ran behind me and grabbed my hat.  And when he did that, we fought like two dinosaurs in that room.  And I don't know whether you remember the little desks they used to have, the desk low to the ground--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --And like six kids would sit at the table--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Three on each side?  Well, we was picking those desks up, slamming each other across the back with them.  I mean we was fighting, fighting-fighting, you know.  And, I remember I got suspended the first day.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And my mother had to go up to the school to make them understand that it was an understanding that he would be able to keep his hat on based on the sensitive issue that he had to deal with.  Okay.  Then I remember as time went on in school because I would question--I would question like, if you was the teacher, you don't seem like you the smartest teacher around here.  You know.
Speaker 1: This was your kindergarten teacher?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's a grade school, right.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it's was like--you know, yeah, I did prank things, you know.  I go with the girls, I put the mirror on my foot and be looking up the teacher's dress.  I was just a little kid, you know, doing kid things.  But it was so many other things that I noticed right away in the school that I had a concern about and people was acting as though I shouldn't had no concern, I didn't have no right to have a concern.  And I would just deal with the issues, you know, you know, at a very early age, questioning the teachers about, you know, "You can't read, you can't write.  How you get to be a teacher.  And most of all, why you teaching us?  We the ones that need it more than anything."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: "Look like you didn't make it."  And this has built over the years.  If I ask a teacher, I say, "Well, you know, why you messing with homeboy?"  I say, "He got glasses so thick, he need to be right up on the board to see it, and instead of you trying to help him, you pushing him to the back of the room."  So it kind of made me think, are you trying to let him learn something or are you trying to prevent him from learning something?  So, this type of attitude was going on for a long duration of time.
Speaker 1: This was in your elementary grade?
Speaker 2: This is grade school, right. Grade school.
Story_ID: 137124
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, as time went on, they began to look at me and say I was out of the norm.  You know, like, you so much out of the norm until you may be crazy.  So then they would have me go speak to this psychiatrist or psychologist or whatever.  You know, send you down right there on 145th [Street]--not 145th.
Speaker 1: You mean 25th [Street]?
Speaker 2: 140--I think it was 143rd [Street] and Edgecombe [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right there on the corner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They used to have a little church there and they had this psychologist used to come in there, and I used to go up in there and woman used to ask me, say, "Well, how you like your mom [Vioris Lawrence]?"  I say, "My mom is cool with me.  I love my mother.  How you like your mother?"
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: "Now, I asking the questions."  I say, "No, we asking the questions."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: "You asked me about my mother.  I want to ask you about your mother."  "Okay, well, how you like your dad. How you like your brothers."  "(Unclear) I don't have no problems with them."  And then I would tell them, "Now what I do have problems with," you know, and things I would tell them about--
Speaker 1: Now what, what grade level are we talking about approximately?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Maybe the fourth, fifth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, and I would have problems to the point where I would ask them, you know, "Why is that when the white firemen come in, they go to a black home and it might be somebody burning some rice and some beans on the stove," and you know how the apartments were in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, you got six or seven bedrooms back there.  And they would go back there and chop every piece of furniture up or put the water hose on every piece of furniture in there--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --And throw it out of rooms that the smoke didn't even get to.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I was annoyed by that.  I mean, I was seeing it happening in my neighborhood [Harlem, New York, New York] day in and day out.  I was concerned about--
Speaker 1: There were no black firemen in those days.
Speaker 2: Not at that time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We only had two black cops.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, Mr. Lester and Mr. Bryant [ph.].  I'm sure you remember them.
Speaker 1: I do.
Speaker 2: Okay?  They were the only two that showed any, let's say, ethnic-ticity [ph.] relative to us in the neighborhood because that was the things I was concerned about when I saw on Lenox Ave. If they had winos.  We didn't call them transients. We called them winos at the time.  There's a white wino, and it's a black wino.  A white wino would be laying right out there on the island, right out there on Lenox Avenue, and a cop would walk up and he would tell the guy, "Hey, get up."  If the guy don't move, he'd take the stick and tap it on the ground.  If the guy still don't move, he'll take the stick and he'll poke him.  "All right, guy, get up from there and move on."  And I remember sitting in my father's [Earl Vanderbilt Carlos] store in the shoe shine stand and looking through the window and seeing this constantly, but the difference--there was the distinct difference in how they woke the black people up.  They would go over there and they would bang the stick on the ground, "Wake up."  And if you don't move, and you laying on the ground, your feet laying sideways, or if you lay on your back, your feet laying straight up like this.  He would take that stick like it was a baseball bat and hit the bottom of my man's shoes.  Now, I don't know whether you ever seen anybody laying down sleep, and when they get hit they levitate off the ground.  When they come back down they on their feet running.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I seen this day in and day out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know--I know it look like a lot of people might have accepted that that's just the way it is, but I could never accept it then and I can't accept it now.  You know, I just couldn't get with that.
Speaker 1: And these were the things that really shaped you for what was to come.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, that and the fact that my old man used to tell me about what things were like for him in World War, the first World War [World War I, WWI]. You know, to understand what a black man had to go through in the war while he's trying to fight to represent this country [United States of America], and then something even greater than that when he return home--how he was treated when he came back.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, you know, it's--it was just like everything was a big plan, and the plan was to hold us back until they need us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then, you know, it was my old man talked about the war, as I began to learn about the Olympics, then I began to realize the Olympics was another means of war.  Understand, we go up--we win the medals and so forth, we come home, we all glorified for fifteen minutes, and then right after that, we back in the backseat again.  You know, so these things I had an opportunity early in life to experience.
Story_ID: 137125
Speaker 1: Now, one of the things that intrigues me is that your siblings, your brothers and your sisters--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --They did not have that same fire burning within them to change things, to question things.  And I imagine your mom [Vioris Lawrence] and your dad [Earl Vanderbilt Carlos] are the same way.  They did not have that burning fire--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --To change--
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: --To wonder about things.
Speaker 2: --My dad, my dad had it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My dad was a fiery man.  I mean, you know, he didn't get out there--
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of those episodes.
Speaker 2: --My dad didn't get out there like I did in terms of being on a podium or something like that.
Speaker 1: He had more to lose than you did, of course.
Speaker 2: Well, you know--
Speaker 1: I mean he--
Speaker 2: --When you sit back, you look at it, man, the biggest thing you can lose is your manhood, you understand?  That's the biggest thing you can lose.  Because if you're a man, you ain't going to let your family fall.  But if you lose your manhood, you ain't got nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And that's why so many young guys went to drugs.  When I say that King Kong [drug] left and that heroin came in--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Because--not because I want to have a socio-high [ph.] as much as I'm--I don't like the guy in the mirror.  I mean, I ain't no father. I can't get a job.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, I ain't no husband. I can't get a job.  You know, I'm not the breadwinner because I can't get a job.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'm starting to lose respect for myself.  My wife done lost respect, and my kids don't know what to think.  And now all of a sudden, boom, here it is. Drugs are here.  Oh, you mean I can escape from who I am?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that's how the drugs became plentiful.  That's why my old man told me, "Don't roll with those junkies."  But I had to roll with them because I had to ask them, "Man, you know, you see what happened to your father or what happened to your sister or your brother?  Why you shooting this stuff?"  And my old man told me, "Did you put that on me?"  And the junkie would tell me, "Naw, son, rest assure."  Ain't no junkie going to give you his drugs.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You have to get your own drugs.  So I learned that that was a fallacy.  Okay.  But then I asked him, I say, "Well, I got a couple of questions.  Why do you always have those shopping bags rolled up with rubber bands on them stuck under your arm?"  He say, "Well, this is how I feed my habit."  "What do you mean, 'your habit'?"  He say, "You mean you don't understand?"  He say, "Man, we don't go take drugs because we want to. We take drugs because we have to.  We're addicted."  Say, "In order for us to feed our addiction, we have to have money every day to buy these drugs."  So he said to me, he say, "So opposed to going through the neighborhood's house and robbing people who didn't have no more than what I had, I had to go downtown and rob Macy's, gotta rob Gimbels or Bloomington's [sic., Bloomingdale's] or one of them places."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So he said, "And I'm always high when I go because it might be the last time I go in a while if I get caught."  So they always made it a point to get high.
Story_ID: 137126
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So I'm looking at these things [drug addiction] real early, and I'm going through school with this.  And I'm saying now like, you know, "If we don't have no promise by people in the wall that we can look at and say, 'Well, this man here did something or this woman did something,'" just like that poster I have there.  You know, you sit back and you say, "Oh, I can say all right.  These individuals accomplished something."  Look at Jack Johnson.  He was a boxer, but not only was he a boxer, he was an inventor too.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Or I put these collage up here on the wall because I want kids to say, "Hey, man, yeah, all ethnics groups played a role in this society in which we live."
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: We can't pick and choose.  And I grew up under that.  My old man [father, Earl Vanderbilt Carlos] let me work things on my own to the point where if--if a guy at the candy store would come in and bring sodas. Now most times my old man be in there busy.  Okay?  Or my brother shining shoes. So when the guy would bring the sodas, we wouldn't count them right there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But after he's gone, we count them.  We might be four cases short.  And it had been going like this for a long time.  And I'm telling my father, I'm telling my father, and this particular day the guy came, and my father say, "Go count them sodas right now."  And I'm thinking he wasn't paying attention.  But he say, "Hey, man, I'm just too busy.  I'm trying to get these people's shoes ready for when they come home from work."  This particular Saturday he say, "Go count them sodas."  I went and counted them, say, "Daddy, we're four cases short."
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And he went back there and he told the dude, say, "Hey, man, come on here."  He say, "Count these cases with me."  And the guy got kind of like, you know, disrespectful.  And when he got disrespectful, my old man say, "Whoa, you ain't got no rush.  I been buying this shit from you for a good while.  Let's count these sodas."  So when the guy count them and the sodas came up short, and I told my father, say, yeah, me and my brother, we say, "Daddy, they short all the time like this."  And when my father questioned the guy about it, the guy got kind of huffy, like, look at my father like, "Boy, don't question me."  And when he said that, I remember the hairs rolling on my neck.  You know, my old man wasn't no young man.  He calling him boy.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But my old man dealt with him right there on the scene, on the spot, and it was a big scene in the neighborhood [Harlem, New York, New York], and--
Speaker 1: What did your father do?
Speaker 2: Whipped his ass.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's--
Speaker 2: Whipped him from one end of the block to the other.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, and you know, even though he was whipping this man, I had pride.  Not so much that he was whipping the man as much as I had pride for the fact that he wasn't going to let this man just take advantage of him, steal his shit, and then talk shit to him too.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: From that right there, it kind of like woke me up, you know, in terms, not so much to say that you're going to whip everybody, but you can deal with any situation irregardless--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Of what the color line is.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I remember one Christmas we was going over to, right there on the 145th Street Bridge, okay?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we went over there, and if you remember, they used to sell all he Christmas trees down there for Christmas.
Speaker 1: Okay, I--
Speaker 2: And my old man was getting on in age, and he goes down there and asks for a tree, and we--ain't nobody there but us.  Some white folks walked up and he tell my father, "Well, boy, you going to have to wait."  And this guy's thirty-something maybe.  And you look at my father. My father is in his sixties now.  "Ah, you have to wait, boy.  You boys going to have to wait."  So, my old man didn't say nothing.  He waited.  And I asked him when the guy came around to us, I say, "Look, let me ask you a question.  How old you have to be to be a man around here?"  I say, "That's my father.  He look like a boy to you?"  So my old man telling me, "Naw, Johnny, be cool."  Now I was--I mean I'm steaming.
Speaker 1: Right, how old are you approximately?
Speaker 2: Thirteen, fourteen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I go back with my old man, I don't make no scene, but I left and I went and got my brother. Told my brother, said, "Come on."  He say, "Where you going?"  I say, "Man, just come on.  We got to go do something."  He say, "What?"  I say, "Man, I got to go teach somebody something."  So I burned up all his trees.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I burned them all up.  And I let him know.  I say, "Hey, man, it's just based on the state of mind that you in.  Everybody's not a boy and everybody's is going to not accept you calling them a boy."  I say, "Remember this, next person you come to, maybe you'll have a little more kindness in your heart."  And he didn't know whether to run after us or run to put his fire out.  We got on out of there.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And you know, things like this get me in trouble.  You know, like my old man used to tell me, say, "Son, you got forty-eight hours to give me an explanation as to what you did and why you did it."
Speaker 1: Talking about the burning of the Christ--
Speaker 2: Talking about anything that I did.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I was just--
Speaker 1: Forty-eight hours?
Speaker 2: --Forty-eight hours.  "You got two days to get it together in your head as to why you did what you did, and make me understand it."
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: So, I grew up with the same premise.
Story_ID: 137127
Speaker 1: So, as I'm going through school, and Haaren High School [New York, New York]. You familiar with Haaren High School?
Speaker 2: Ah, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Haaren High School is on 59th [Street] and 10th Avenue.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay?  I'm going to school there, and we in school and this a high school. We in school, and you know, back at that time they used to feed us chicken.  You know, that's what the poor people ate.  I mean, we ate chicken in my house every day.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Chicken.  You know, my mother [Vioris Lawrence] would cook it up different ways, you know, based on her culture.  So, when we go to school, we got chicken too.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, we don't mind the fact that we had chicken.  We were grown to eat chicken.  But we wasn't grown to eat chicken with the hairs in it or the feathers in it as they call it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay?  So I went to the principal one day because we was having a discussion around the table, say, "Man, they feed us chicken every day.  We eat chicken soup, chicken salad, chicken sandwich, chicken this, chicken that, but you can bite into any part of the chicken and you got feathers in your mouth."  So I went to the principal and I said to him, I say, "Hey, man, we got a problem."  He say, "What's your problem?"  I say, "Why is it that we have to eat chicken with hairs in it every day?"  And he looked at me, "What are you talking about?"  I say, "Well, man, we buy chicken. Every day we eat chicken.  We don't mind eating the chicken, but can't they clean the chicken?"  And he's telling me two things at the same time.  "Get out of my office, and it's too much chicken for us to clean."  And I looked at him and I told him, I say, "Hey, man, my mother clean it every day."  My mother, you know, when she cut the chicken up and fry it--put the chicken over the fire.  So I say, I know they can clean it.  So I say to him, I say, "Man, you got forty-eight hours to take care of it."  And he said--
Speaker 2: You gave him an ultimatum?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: "You got forty-eight hours to take care of it."  He said to me, he say, "You threatening me?"  I say, "Naw, that's like a money back guarantee."
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: "It ain't no threat. It's a promise."  So, we waited forty-eight hours, nothing happened.  I ain't going to burn up the cafeteria or nothing.  But I had enough power in that school to make--get all of them students back off from buying lunch.  You understand?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because I found that they got to fix the lunch anyway, irregardless.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I told them, I say, "Nobody is buying lunch."  The only guys that decided they was going to buy lunch was the Jewish kids, the Jewish kids.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They coming in and they to the point where they saying, "Hey, man, we want to eat."  I say, "Man, listen.  No disrespect to ya'll.  But we just trying to get a better quality of food for everybody."  So they wouldn't listen.  They come around, and then they had a problem when every time they went around the corner, somebody accidently bumped into them.  After they hit a dead end, then they said, "We brown-bagging with ya'll."  So two weeks went by--
Speaker 2: Nobody was buying chicken?
Speaker 1: --Nobody buying no food.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, so, you know, we had stores around the school.  So everybody start brown-bagging or they going out to buy it.  They wasn't buying in the school.  So, two weeks later I go to the principal, talk to him, the principal tell me, "Naw, we ain't changing nothing."  So I walked out of his office, and I'm making the statement, "Well, I guess we'll have to let the press know."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, when I said, "Let the press know," his antennas went up like Doberman Pinscher ears.  And he said, "What did you say?"  I said, "We gon' just going to call the press and let them know what's going on."  Then he called me back into the room then.  Now, we can negotiate because irregardless of what my thoughts were, he didn't want my thoughts to be in the paper for other people to have their opinion about how we were being fed.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So right away, let's talk.  So we get that taken care of, everything is fine, the strike is over.  We got good quality food coming in.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, I got a bad name with them, but the people that was eating, they felt that I was the best thing since gumdrops.  Other things happened.
Speaker 2: And you're what, a high school freshman, sophomore?
Speaker 1: Freshman, yeah.
Speaker 2: Freshman [at Haaren High School, New York, New York].
Story_ID: 137128
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: You're just starting to be--cause trouble, just starting there.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  You know--here's another thing.  In my neighborhood [Harlem, New York, New York], man, it wasn't no whole bunch of fathers in the house.  Many of them been junkies for years.  So they ain't--they absentee parents.  The mom might be in the house, and she might be still junking.  They didn't have no whole bunch of clothes or food coming into the houses.  You know, just like you go to some people right now where they got crack cocaine, and you look in their box and they don't have nothing but the light bulb.  Or back at that time, man, it wasn't crack cocaine and it wasn't no whole bunch of drugs, it was just pure "D" unemployment.  Unconcerned.  People didn't have no concern for them.  I saw a kid--as a kid I saw on TV this guy in this green suit, Robin Hood.  Robin Hood impressed me.  That movie impressed me so much because here's a guy that thought like I did.  He said, "Man, I'm not concerned about man's law.  I'm concerned about God's law."  And that's the same philosophy I have.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I liked the fact that he didn't worry about the sheriff from Nottinghood [sic., Nottingham] and the King [John] and this and that.  He did what he had to do to feed the people.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay?
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: And I looked at that in terms of where the churches are back and then.  Because the churches wasn't doing what they should have been doing.  Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.] was doing his thing, but when you sit back, you see every other one was doing it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Which they weren't.  So then, I went back over to the freight yards right out in front of Yankee Stadium--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --And I started busting those seals on them freight trains.  And I'm looking--at that time I think they had just started making succotash, frozen foods and stuff. They had clothes in there.  So I would go back and monitor them trains, and I told my boys, I said, "Man, we going over there and we going to start hitting the freight trains."  And telling me, "Oh, we going to make a lot of money."  I said, "Naw, fellows.  This ain't about the money."  I said, "We ain't making a dime on this.  We going back to try and help the people in the community."  Okay?  And they say, "What are you talking about?"  I said, "We going to help the people in the community," and saying, "You need food in your house, you going to have it too."  I said, "But this ain't about our pockets."  So we went over there and we hit the freight trains.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now, when we hit the freight trains, you know, the first thing in the front of my brain is Mr. Lester and Mr. Bryant [ph.].  And they know my mother [Vioris Lawrence] and father [Earl Vanderbilt Carlos].  So I go up to the guy on the bridge.  You know, they used to have that little box there where the guy would open the bridge.  And I knew just by living in Harlem, Harlem River Houses, because after we left Lenox Avenue, we moved up to Harlem River House on 153rd [Street]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --And Seventh Avenue--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: -On Edgecombe.  So, I go straight to the guy in the booth--in the box and I said to him, I said, "Hey, buddy, how you doing?"  He said, "What are you doing?" I said, "Man, I'm just trying to find out how you doing?"  And he looked at me, he said, "Ah, I'm okay."  I said to him, I said, "You sit in this box every day, all day?"  He said, "For eight hours I sit in this box."  I said, "What's your job?"  He said, "My job is to make sure that if the tugboats was to come and they got a high mast on it, to open the bridge, a ferry come, whatever.  My job is to open this bridge when it's necessary."  So I said to him, I said, "Well, how much money they pay you?"  He said, "They don't pay me enough for the work I do."  And I said to him, I said, "Well, how would you like to have some extra food?"  And he looked at me, he said, "What are you saying to me?"  I said to him, I said, "When, you see us run across this bridge regularly." I said, "We going to hit these freight trains," I'm saying, "And the police going to come to you one day and tell you to open this bridge up."  I said, "Man, all I ask you to do is give me ten minutes."  He said, "I could never give you ten minutes."  I said, "Give me seven minutes, and every time we come across the bridge, we'll drop you food for your family."  And he was in agreement.  So we started hitting the freight trains, and we bring it back and we give it to the people in the community.  I mean, hey, here.  This is for you guys because you ain't had nothing.
Speaker 1: How old are you at this time?
Speaker 2: At that time, I'm still around thirteen, fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 137129
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Okay?  But I ain't get to my dream yet, and that happened when I was young.  I'm just pulling out of my head right now.  Before that time I had a dream.  You could say it was a vision. I don't know how to describe it.  I know I was asleep.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And all of a sudden, this picture appears before me.  It's a picture of me. Got my face and I'm up on some kind of stand or something, and all these people was just like applauding, "John Carlos," and they just going crazy.  And in a split second, it changed from glory to agony and hatred.  Okay?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It blew me away so much.  I mean, it scared me, you know, so much.  And I remember going to the dinner table that night because we used to all eat the dinner together.  And I remember going to the dinner table and I told my father [Earl Vanderbilt Carlos], I said--I said, "Pop, I saw a picture."  And he looked at me and he said, "What do you mean you saw a picture?"  I said, "I saw a picture, a movie and I was in it."  And my old man said, "What do you mean you saw a picture?"  I say, "I saw something on the wall and it was a movie and I was in this picture."  He said to me, he said, "What were you doing?"  I said, "I don't know.  I was on this box and a whole bunch of people was applauding crazy, and then all of a sudden they seemed like they got mad at me, and they just started spitting and cussing and throwing things, and talking nasty."  He could see I was shaking.   He said, "Well, son, don't be afraid.  It look like God got something special in mind for you, and we going to have to wait and see."  That's exactly what happened in Mexico City [Mexico, at the 1968 Summer Olympics].
Speaker 1: In 1968?
Speaker 2: In '68 (1968).  And when was that, like, ten years later.  Okay?  Because I must have been--now, about fifteen years--fourteen years later.  Somewhere around in there.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Because I was about eight when this happened.  Okay?  I'm just here, man.
Story_ID: 137130
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this question because there have been the religious references that you have made.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Were you a regular churchgoer at that time or when did you start becoming a regular churchgoer there in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't used to go to church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I did so many things in my life and early in my life, I'm looking for something to fill the voids, you know, when I can't put my hand on something as to what it is, I needed a higher power.  Somebody to make me to be able to understand these voids.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, I went and found a church.  I think it was a Presbyterian church.  And my family didn't go to church, and I felt like we needed some religion.  So I found this church and then I went back to my family and said, "Hey, I found a church. We should all go."  So we started going, and as I got older and then it became not so much about the religion as much as about paying your spiritual dues and tithes and so forth like that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So it wasn't about if I was a Muslim or if I was a Baptist or Protestant or this or that with me because it's about having spirituality period.  So, we left that church and we went to the Catholic Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to the Catholic Church solely for the reason that we should get up in the summer once and go to six o'clock mass. Seven o'clock, we on our way to the beach.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So we can pay our spirituality right there, and it didn't take all day like a lot of churches, want to have me all day in there, eight collections, and this and that.  I wasn't about that because look like they was pimping more than preaching.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I couldn't express it at that time that way, but that's probably the terminology I had in my mind in terms of what they were doing.  It looked like they was more about pillaging the people than they were about spreading the gospel.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I just wanted to go get my religious thing taken care of, and then go do what we had to do.
Speaker 1: How long did you stay at that Catholic church?
Speaker 2: Well, we started at Resurrection--not Resurrection, but Saint Charles [Church of Saint Charles Borromeo, New York, New York].  You know, where Saint Charles is? It was downtown, right on 140--I think it might have been 142nd [Street], 143rd [Street]--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --Between 7th [Street] and Lin--7th and 8th [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we moved from there, and we moved up to the Harlem River Houses.  So then we went to Catholic school after they kicked me out of high school [Haaren High School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: You left out that part.  You need to tell us about them kicking you out of school.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, yeah.  They kicked me out--
Story_ID: 137131
Speaker 1: Okay, there came a point when at Haaren [High School, New York, New York], you did have some problems there, but you were successful in leading a revolt there--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --On the food, food issue.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but--
Speaker 1: But there came a time when you did get put out.
Speaker 2: Well, it came a time--what happened was, at the time, we used to have fire axes in the school.  And the kid that I had a fight with in grade school [at P.S. 5 in New York, New York] in kindergarten was going to school there as well--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --At Haaren High School, a kid by the name of Cleavy Davis [ph.].  Now, Cleavy and I, from the time we had that fight in kindergarten, we became like brothers. We was the best of friends.  Between me and Cleavy, if I told him, I say, "Man, I stumped my foot on that rock."  Cleavy'll go get a sledgehammer and break that rock in pebbles.
Speaker 1: Spell Cleavy for me.
Speaker 2: Cleavy.
Speaker 1: C-L--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --E-A--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  C-L--
Speaker 1: --E-A--
Speaker 2: --E-A--
Speaker 1: --V-Y or V-I-E?
Speaker 2: I think it's V-Y.
Speaker 1: V-Y.  Okay, Davis.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it's right.
Speaker 1: Good to know.
Speaker 2: Now, what happened was, my mom [Vioris Lawrence] had gone to the school, something had happened, and the Dean of Students, Mr. Shapiro, he called my mother to the school.  Now, my mother was always a tall, proud woman, you know, always held her head up high.  And this man called my mother into school because he felt that I was doing something, which I--I was doing a couple two or three things, you know.  But he called my mother in the school, and it more like he called my mother to embarrass my mother about her kid.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'll never forget in this meeting, and he just kept pouring it on, and pouring it on.  And my mother started boo-hooing.  And--
Speaker 1: She started crying then--
Speaker 2: Just--I mean--
Speaker 1: --Just from--
Speaker 2: Yep--
Speaker 1: --His interrogation?
Speaker 2: --From the way he was putting her son down--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --And, you know, he was making his thing like he was God, you know, and he had the right to do this and do that.  And he was so hard until I just stopped the meeting.  I told him, I say, "This meeting is over."  I told my mother, "Come on.  We gone."  And I took my mother home.  And he told me, he say, "You're not going to school here no more.  You're expelled from this school."  I just turned around and looked at him.  And my mother was telling me, "Naw, you going to go to Catholic school."  "Naw, Ma.  We'll talk about that later."  So, we went on home.  And the next day I got up and I went to school.  He got word that I was in school, so he comes up to the class where I was.  And he comes in the class, he get me and my buddy Cleavy was in the class with me, and we go outside and he told me, "I told you that you expelled from school, and you can't go to school here no more."  And he grabbed me.  And when he grabbed me, I jerked away from him.  And when I jerked away, I looked up and Cleavy done went over to that glass where they used to have that axe--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --And broke the glass and pulled the axe out.  And he went around to the dean. This guy was the dean of students.  He went around chasing him with the axe.  Now, the dean was a heavyset dude, too, right?  He running down the hall, Cleavy running behind him, and I'm running behind Cleavy--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --Because I'm trying to stop him.  I don't want Cleavy to kill this man, right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, then after we got everything stopped and got Cleavy calmed down, they kicked both of us out of school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So then it was a question as to whether I was going to Catholic school, or whether I was going to go to the regular school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 137132
Speaker 1: Well, they sent me to Catholic school.  You know, my mom [Vioris Lawrence] and them was telling me, she say, "Well, Johnny, you know, maybe you can go to Catholic school. It'll be a little more concentrated effort in school, and this and that."  So I went, and it was more concentrated effort.  But yet and still, you know, they was more into teaching you about spirituality and commitments to God than they was teaching me about education.  And then, a couple--two, three things used to go down.  And the sisters had a tendency, they would make their little lanyard keychains, but they'd make it to be a whip.  And, you know, I didn't appreciate nobody whipping on me.  And I remember the mother superior hit me one time with the whip because somebody was smoking in the classroom.  You know, the sisters would normally go out, and somebody smoking a cigarette, and she asked me was I smoking.  And I said no.  She said, "You know who was smoking?"  I said, "Yeah."  "Who was smoking?"  I said, "I can't tell you that."  "Oh, you going to tell me."  And I say, "I can't tell you that, Sister."  And she grabbed that lanyard out, and at first she took out a ruler because she had this ruler with the rubber bands, about four, five rulers together.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She started hitting me with that.  That didn't do anything.  Then she went and got her lanyard and came back, and she hit me all in my chest with it.  And when she went to hit me, I, like, pushed her off a little bit.  And she went into the board and her habit turned around on her head, and this and that.  And then they told me, said, "When you go home, don't come back."  And I was there in school, maybe, a year, maybe two years, I don't know.  One day, they wanted me to walk a little better.  They was talking about the way I walk.  And I know I have a unique walk, and I liked the fact that I had this unique walk.  But they didn't like it, you know, because every year for graduation they put this big play on so they can make their money.  They didn't want me walking in the play that way.  So they told me, "We going to put you in this class to teach you how to walk."  They going to put a book on my head and tell me to walk, and I told them, I said, "I'm not going to do that."  I said, "Ain't nothing wrong with me.  I ain't no sissy.  You ain't going to make me put no book on my head and walk."  So, "You going to do this."  I say, "Naw, I'm not going to do it."  So, one day we was going home for lunch, and, you know, they have us all waiting in the yard, you know, where the Resurrection is--the little yard they used to have there--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We waiting there, and then we go for lunch.  So, the mother superior walk up to me and tell me, "When you go home, don't come back."  Just casual.  "You go home, don't come back."  I said, "Okay."  So, I went on home, do what I had to do and got my lunch. I'm coming back.  We go get in line to get ready to go back in the school, she walks up to me, she say, "I told you don't come back here.  You don't go to school here anymore."  Now, that really--when I say pissed me off, that really pissed me off.  And the reason it pissed me off because, as I said, my father [Earl Vanderbilt Carlos] was a shoemaker.  All the shoes that he fixed for the nuns and for the priest, he fixed them for free.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Never charged them a dime and they never went in their pockets and say, "Earl, take some money anyway."  You understand?  So look like they knew whatever his sins was or his past aggressions were years ago, he's trying to get repentance for giving them free shoes or fixing their shoes for free.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In their minds, based on the way I saw it, "No, we just got somebody here that we can pimp."  So they just took advantage of him.  So when they were telling me about going back to school, I told him, I say, "Naw, Dad and Mom, I'm not going back there."  I said, "And first of all, Dad, you fixing all them people's shoes for free," I said, "they don't care about you fixing their shoes for free.  They ain't never try and give you a discount when it come time for you to get us in school.  They ain't never did nothing for you.  You doing everything for them, and you want--I'm not going back there--"
Story_ID: 137133
Speaker 1: So then they took me down to Haaren High School [New York, New York]--I mean, to Machine and Metal Trades [High School, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That's when your parents [Vioris Lawrence and Earl Vanderbilt Carlos] took you down there?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right, got you.
Speaker 1: Right.  And I got to Machine and Metal Trades. They found out that I could run track, and they kind of invited me to the track program.  And what happened was, when I was in Frederick Douglass [Junior High School, Harlem, New York, New York], you know, we used to always fill out our high school that we anticipate going to.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And after I had filled the paperwork out, it's another day that you come back and you check everything, make sure everything is right.  Well, that particular day I wasn't in school.  And my boys knew that I could run track, and they wanted me to go to Haaren High School, okay?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I'm telling them that I want to get in the swimming program.  I--track wasn't my love, swimming was my love.  So I want to get in swimming, "Oh, no.  Haaren High School got a swim program, don't worry about it."  I got down there. They didn't have a swimming program nor a pool.  Okay, so then when I finally--
Speaker 2: What school did you want to go to first of all?
Speaker 1: I wanted to go to Machine and Metal Trades, MMT.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: That's the school I wanted to go to originally.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And when they changed the paperwork up because they trying to get me to go down there to Haaren High School, then what?  So when I got back to Machine and Metal Trades, and I looked at what was going on there, they had a track program, and they wanted me to get on the program.  And I got involved in track merely because one of the guys came to me and said, "Hey, John, we looking for another runner."  Somebody on the team was hurt.  This guy is named Stanley.  Stanley came and he had his arm in a cast.  And I looked at him and I told him, I said, "Well, hey, man, you ain't do nothing but break your arm."  I say, "You can go on and run."  He said, "I'm still running."  He said, "Victor, Victor broke his leg."  A Puerto Rican kid.  He said, "He can't run."  I said, "Alright.  I'll tell you what.  I'll run."  Now, I wasn't into no practicing and training and all that stuff.  You know, I let them do their thing, you know, and they didn't have a track.  They used to run in the hallways.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All up through the cafeteria, open the door, and go back down the other end of the hall.  So--
Speaker 2: So, you never had any great desire to be a runner in high school at--
Speaker 1: It's two desires that I had as an athlete.  One was to be the first black swimmer to represent America, and the second, to be the heavyweight champ of the world.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I was good in both of them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my dad told me early that I wasn't going to be able to be the swimmer based on race.  And he was quite articulate the way he made me realize this.  He said to me, he said, "Son," he says, "you know, I hear you talking about you want to go to the Olympics and this and that, but, yeah, you have to find another way out."  And I looked at him, I say, "What are you talking about?"  He said, "Well, son, where you going to train?"  He said, "You can't go to the Harlem River.  You lose two or three of your buddies every year."  He said "You can't go to the ocean," he said, "the water's too rough."  He said, "You can't go to the public pool," he said, "because it's too crowded."  And I'm thinking, "Well, club"--and he said, "And you can't go to the club either," he said, "because they don't allow your skin color in the club."  And I'm looking, I'm saying, "What are you talking"--he said, "Naw, they don't allow you in there."  And then he said to me, he said, "Listen," he said, "you remember you used go up to Highbridge pool?"  You remember where Highbridge is, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He said, "You used to go up to Highbridge pool."  He said, "When you and your buddies used to jump in the water, what used to happen?"  It wasn't long before you sit there and you close your eyes and you could see it.  Soon as we hit the water, white parents would get their kids--"Y'all get out that water.  Get out that water."  And I'm sure it happened to you when you were going through that.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it dawned on me that my dad was one thousand percent right about that so I wasn't going to make it in swimming.
Story_ID: 137134
Speaker 1: I was the New York City Golden Gloves Champ, boxing.
Speaker 2: You were citywide?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What class, lightweight?
Speaker 1: I don't even know--lightweight, it had to be featherweight or something.
Speaker 2: Featherweight.
Speaker 1: But Eric Griffin and I went in together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, and we was good boxers, and just when Eric was getting ready to turn pro, they wanted me to go turn pro too.  But my mother [Vioris Lawrence] stepped up, my mother said to me, she said, "Son," she said, "you my baby boy."  She said, "You're a good-looking kid.  Promise me that you won't box."  I'm saying, "Mama," I say, "what are you talking about?"  She said, "Promise me you won't box.  I want you to promise me right now that you wouldn't box."  And, man, I could see my adam's apple was sticking out like this far, you know, when you get so emotional about something because this was something I really wanted to do.  And she said, "Promise me."  And I kind of bit my tooth, and I promised her, I said, "All right, Mom.  You don't want me to box, I won't box."  And I said to her, I said, "But, Mom," I say, "but you know, I'm not boxing for the sport.  I'm boxing to make the money."  I said, "If they--if I make a million dollars, they'd have to spend a hundred million."  (Pause).
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  We're at a quarter after.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we got to break.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want you to finish that sentence though.
Speaker 2: Okay, but, I said to her, I said, "Mom," I said, "I'm not interested in boxing to show how good I am.  I'm good enough to get in there and make some money."  I said, "If I make a million dollars, I know how to make money."  I said--I said, "They would have to spend a hundred million dollars or fine me to get me back in there."  I said, "The reason why we don't never have nothing is because we never had the startup capital."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my mom told me, she said, "Naw, I don't want you to box."  So I let it go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mr. Lester and Mr. Bryant [ph.]--we'll stop at this.  But Mr. Lester and Mr. Bryant, those two detectives, they're the ones that got me involved in track and field.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: As a result of what was happening--we'll finish this up, and then we can go--as a result of me breaking in the freight trains. See, because they used to see me, chase me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Then all the cops, you know, in uniform and detectives used to chase me.  And I used to run in the alleys and, you know, our alleys--the utility poles out here is what we used to have back there in the alley for the clotheslines.  And I would run, get away from them so fast, and I'd climb the clothesline and by the time they come in, I'd be done pushed from the pole and maybe jumped three feet, and turn around and grab the fire escape.  So, when you see these pictures of kids running through somebody's house--
Speaker 1: Right,
Speaker 2: --That was me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of them knew my father [Earl Vanderbilt Carlos].  "Boy, what you do this time?"  So, one day they came to my father, they said to my father, say, "Earl, we think your son Johnny, we think he's doing a lot of break-ins over at the Yankee Stadium, and you need to have a talk with him."  My father said to him, said, "Naw, I think you guys need to have a talk with him."  So, in the meantime over at Macombs Park [Bronx, New York], which is the park right across from where the stadium was--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --We used to go over there, and that's where they used to have all the PAL [Police Athletic League] track meets, you know, where they weigh you and, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Going, so my thing wasn't to go and get involved in the track meets.  But everybody had them Converse sneakers.  So a lot of people didn't have Converse sneakers, so we would steal the sneakers from them.  You know, they'd roll everything up in their pants.  So we'd go through there and get their sneakers.  And then we give them to kids in our community who didn't have them.  Well, this particular day, Mr. Lester and Mr. Bryant got reinforcement, and they circled the whole park so we couldn't get out.  And they rolled up on me and they said, "Hey, we need to talk to you, Johnny."  And I looked at them like, "Yeah, what's up?"  Say, "You, know, it's been a lot of break-ins.  We think we know who's doing it.  But we can't do anything until we catch him.  And, by God, rest assure, we going to catch him."  So, I'm listening to them.  I say, "Hmm."  "Say but let me tell you something else.  You have a talent."  And I looked at him, I say to him, dead serious, "What kind of talent do I have?"  And they said, "You a runner."  And I looked at him and I laughed.  And Mr. Bryant--Mr. Lester told me I was a runner.  Mr. Bryant--you remember, Mr. Bryant was real big looked like he was about 5'7"--I mean, 6'7", this big--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --And he hit me man, he hit me upside the back of my head and I could see stars right now.  And he said, "Boy, ain't nobody playing no joke with you.  This is serious."  And I said, "Oh, I wasn't being jokeful.  I wasn't being disrespectful."  I said, "But, Mr. Lester said that I'm a runner and I'm a special runner."  I said, "Mr. Bryant, if a woman got her purse snatched in this neighborhood, she going to run the purse snatcher down to get her purse back.  So everybody's a runner."  He said, "Naw, you're special."  And he gave me a number and told me to call up Ed Lee-[Joseph] Joe Yancey and [Edward] Ed Levy at the New York Pioneer Club [New York Pioneers Track and Field Club, New York, New York].  And that was the start of my career in track and field there.
