Speaker 2: My mother's maiden name is Ruby Lee Gilmore, R-U-B-B-Y, R-U-B-Y, L-E-E, G-I-L-M-O-R-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Mom was born September 17, 1921, and she was born in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're not sure if it was Eufaula or not?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not sure--not without looking it up.  I do have it all written down in my ['Our] Baby's History Book.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what do you know about her branch of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on that side--how far back do they go?
Speaker 2: I chronologically cannot give you dates or anything as far back as I know in our family.  I have a vague remembrance of my grandmother and my grandfather, her mother and father, Jessie and Grover Gilmore.  I do know that Jessie was a cateress, and she was also a mulatto.  She had traveled a lot in my mother's youth.  And when we would go south after moving to Detroit [Michigan], when we would go south to visit her, she would delight us with a lot of, of her beautiful cooked specialties.  She had a way with desserts and there was always a snack in the kitchen.  So I remember her culinary artistry.  My grandfather, Grover Gilmore, was part Indian.  And they say that it was the Blackfoot tribe.  He was sort of a rascal.  He had a corn liquor still, and he also farmed.  He was in the World War [I] and was a celebrated veteran.  He had been awarded a fee and was owner of his own ranch or farm, his own farm.  He had horses, cows, and pigs, and chickens, and--.  One of my experiences that stick out most in my mind was the time that I was told to sit on a, a little large jar in the backyard to eliminate myself and being spurred by a rooster.  Granddaddy chased that rooster and cut his spurs off and grandmama was protesting saying, "Don't kill my rooster.  My hens won't lay eggs!"  So I got a quick education of (laughter) how animals and farms operate on, on the far-, on the farm.  We would visit every summer, and I wouldn't wear shoes from June to September except when we went to town, which was a exciting occasion in the back of that horse-drawn carriage, if you could call it that.  And when we went to church, we would wear shoes.  But, I remember playing in red sand and clay and enjoying every minute of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was in Eufaula or near Eufaula?
Speaker 2: They lived in Abbeville [Alabama] near Dothan [Alabama], yeah, near Dothan.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh, Abbeville, okay, near Do-, okay.  All right.  Did they ever tell stories about the past and about their grandparents or their parents or anything like that?
Speaker 2: We had loads of hours because I'm the generation before television.  And on occasion we'd sit and watch the radio.  But I remember not doing anything other than getting our bath in the number five tub on the front porch on summer nights and listening to all kinds of stories--some that were--you could half believe and some that you would just say, well, somebody made that up.  There was a, a story that I was reminded of in my book when I would, was making my autobiography and trying to get started in it where my uncle had an occasion to have a fight at a crossroads.  And it was wi-, with a white man.  And he had cut his neck, and my uncle called to him and said, "Come here.  I got something to tell you."  And as he leaned down toward him, he cut his neck.  And they were found one on top of the other at the crossroads.  And that crossroads was named after them.  So that, that's, that's somewhat, it's an e-, it's just an example of what stories we could hear.  Granddad told stories of the war.  Grandmother didn't talk very much.  I had an uncle--he, he was a junior, Grover Jr., but we called him Uncle Junior.  He would tell stories of his escapades with women.  He was a good-looking man and had several wives during his lifetime.  They would talk of times when they lived in colonies as opposed to having their own individual house and how the different men and women were mated.  They would choose your mate and hope for a stronger descendant--they would pair off people with, people their sizes or heights or whatever.  And they talked a lot of s-, illnesses and diseases because of n-, they had no, no medical care and improper sanitation.  Wonderful stories.  Most of it was surrounded with music, though.  My grandfather played banjo, and he would tell stories in between his banjo picking.  My dad [Elijah Joshau Reeves Jr.] courted my mother with guitar.  So whenever my parents were in a happy state or good frame of mind, dad would take his gui-, guitar down from the wall and play songs that he learned as a child--blues songs that spoke of imprisonment and struggles with heartbreak, the blues.  And that's m-, that's my background.  I think I got my singing talent from both parents.
Story_ID: 19255
Speaker 1: I remember, my dad [Elijah Joshau Reeves Jr.] was the one who woodshedded with John Lee Hooker, who was exposed maybe to professional show business but not wanting to be a part of it.  He wouldn't let you record him, and he wouldn't let you tape him.  But he could really play the guitar and sing.
Speaker 2: John Lee Hooker--didn't he come to live in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 1: Yes, and my dad and he would get them jars of illegal moonshine and play all day.  We recorded a song as, as the Del Phi's behind John Lee Hooker because of my dad and his association.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did your dad know Howard Armstrong?
Speaker 1: He probably did.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he came here later.
Speaker 1: There were some surroundings that he would never allow us to be in.  When he left home he would say, "I'm going to play with John Lee Hooker."  And that's all of the knowledge I had of it.  I never heard them play together.  I was never in the area that they were.  So I wouldn't know anyone other than the fact that he went to play with John Lee Hooker.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Your dad played the--.
Speaker 1: Guitar.
Speaker 2: Guitar, okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right.  You said your grandfather [Grover Gilmore] played the banjo.
Speaker 1: Banjo, that's right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do you have a favorite song from those days that they would play or is there any--?
Speaker 1: My dad used to put me on his lap--and I don't know how he managed to play the, the guitar, but he would play the guitar and sing "Good Evening [sic, Morning], Little Schoolgirl" to me.
Speaker 2: Do you remember how that goes?  Can you sing a little bit of it?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  Sure I can.  (Sings) "Good evening, little schoolgirl.  Good evening, little schoolgirl.  Can I go home with, can I go home with you?  Tell your mama and your papa.  I'm a little schoolboy, too."  And he played--in between there he played some beautiful guitar strumming.  Taj Mahal comes very close to how my dad's style was.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--you know, Taj Mahal made a career of recycling the music from the country blues, I guess you would call it.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) His music touches my heart because he's so much like my dad.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did your father play the steel guitar?
Speaker 1: He had that s-, that one that had the, like, like the microphone in it.  But I guess it was a classic.  And we couldn't keep it after he passed away.  Someone took it and--I don't know what they did with it--but it was one that would, would sound a little louder than most guitars.  It was sort of heavy and it had a voicebox in it.  And, it was a joy to hear him play that.
Story_ID: 19256
Speaker 1: Give us your father's full name and spell it for us, too.
Speaker 2: My dad's name is Elijah, E-L-I-J-A-H, Joshau, J-O-S-H-A-U, Reeves.  He's a junior.  His father was the Right Reverend Elijah Joshau Reeves of Metropolitan AME [Zion] Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Metropolitan AME [African Methodist Episcopal], that was in Alabama or--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No.
Speaker 1: --here?
Speaker 2: It was right here in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: In Detroit.
Speaker 2: My family moved here after the invention of the cotton gin.  All the jobs that they held were taken by that gin.  They no longer were required to pick or mill or even sharecrop.  Jobs got, got very, very scar-, sparse for black people in Eufaula, Alabama, Abbeville [Alabama], Dothan [Alabama], and Birmingham [Alabama].  So my father's oldest brother, Sylvester [Reeves] and his father, Elijah Joshau Reeves, moved to Detroit and sent for all of the other brothers.  Dad had three brothers and four sisters, and they were all eventually moved to Detroit and Chicago [Illinois] from Alabama and Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He's--his birthday is September 27, 1917.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the family were moved when--is it--you think about around 1930 or what, by what time (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It must have been around that time--'35 [1935], '36 [1936].  We--might have been later than that.  Well, if they moved here when I was eighteen months old, my, my father, then his brothers moved maybe in '38 [1938]--'37 [1937], '38.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thirty-(unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) He followed them--.
Speaker 2: Yes, he followed them.
Speaker 1: --in around '42 [1942] or so.
Speaker 2: And I was the baby and my two older brothers, Benny and Thomas.  But we talk--some of, somehow they can remember a little bit of moving from the South to the, to the North.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I didn't ask you about your father's side of the family.  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Well, I can go back as far as my grandfather's mother.  Her name was Sally.  And we've recently sat with my oldest aunt living, Aunt Gertha Lee Morris.  She's now ninety-seven.  And she showed us pictures of our great grandmother.  Of course, Elijah Joshau Sr. was a renowned minister and moved his ministry to Detroit around the same times that his sons migrated here and held a position as pastor of Metropolitan AME for, until he was no longer able to preach.  And then he just stayed here in the city with different children, different--he stayed with Sylvester for a minute, he stayed with Elijah, with us, for a minute, and then he secured his own residence and remarried his fifth wife.  He, he, he married again his fifth wife and was eulogized here in Detroit.
Speaker 1: So he was, there's, he was able to come from Alabama, establish a church, and stay an AME minister--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --here in Detroit.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, does the church still exist?  There's such a--?
Speaker 2: No, it's torn down.  It was a family church.  We basically had maybe three families in all in the church storefront.  It was small--at DuBois and Leland here in Detroit.  And it's been torn down now for a good thirty years or more.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did your, did they on your father's side pass down stories about your great grandmother, Sally, and what life was like for her?
Speaker 2: I imagine if I were to sit with my Aunt Gert, she would give us stories.  I do know that there's a, one Hattie that lived with my grandfather who was none of their mothers because it seemed that as children were born the wives passed away.  There was Sylvester and Ella, with one wife, and then she passed away.  Then there was Adrian and Lorena--this, then that mother passed away.  Then there was Addie and Elijah, my dad, and then their mom passed away.  Then there was Rose and--no, Gertha, and Elijah.  Then there was Addie and then Thomas and their mother passed away.  So Hattie basically lived with my grandfather and raised them.  And they're very fond of her.  When they speak of her, they speak well of her.  At--and a minister all the time, at the whole time he was preaching and, and, and sustaining the church.
Story_ID: 19257
Speaker 1: Well, what did your parents tell you about growing up in and around Eufaula [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Well, they spoke a lot about mean straw bus-, straw bosses, who, if you didn't bring your crop up to a certain supply or amount, then you'd lose your farm.  And their biggest interest was in growing their crops and coming up to par so that they might stay where they were living.  Mom [Ruby Lee Gilmore] had one chicken, and she would say there were times when between the four of them--my two older brothers [Benny and Thomas Reeves] and my dad [Elijah Joshau Reeves Jr.] and she--they would have one egg to s-, to share, and how she could scramble it and add milk to it and make it stretch.  She was a good provider.  I'm one of twelve children.  I have two older brothers and then I'm the oldest girl and mama's help.  And she had lots of stories to tell about growing up in, in the South with Jill, Juanita, and [Grover Gilmore] Junior, her siblings, and the good times they had and the mean aunts and the castor oil--you know, the stories about giving the castor oil every, every Monday no matter what.  Walking to school--she got as far as the eighth grade before she was married.  My dad was taken out of school in, in the third grade 'cause he had to work in the fields.  Lots of wonderful stories about farming--association with different animals.  They had a, a goat named Billy you couldn't turn your back on.  It's a lot of wonderful stories, warm things.  No struggles other than to stay clear of racist situations and avoid the Klu Klux Klan was very, very prominent in, in the society.  And the black and white signs on the fountains and toilets and things li--she made us aware of that and I had a few encounters going to the store in the South.  I was told I couldn't go anymore to pick up light things that Grandmama [Jessie Gilmore] needed because I refused to say, "Yes sir."  I would say yes and no the way that I was taught, and was disciplined and threatened if I didn't say what was expected.  Wonderful, wonderful revelations as to how you could appease and satisfy people with just a little gesture, a little--it's a, you know, simple consideration or compromises, if you could call it that, and the ability to continue life and to avoid any attacks or any brutality and their way of life.
Speaker 1: Okay. So they--did they have any stories about that kind of brutality and activity in Alabama?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll give you an example.  I don't know if it was right or not for my grandfather [Grover Gilmore] to have a still.  But he on one occasion was photographed and then arrested and called to the mat for moonshining.  And I was out in the field one day as we were gathering the peanuts.  And he pulled his pants down and exposed his, his rect-, rectum to the sky.  And I asked mama what was he doing (laughter).  And she said the revenuers had photographed him before, and he wants them to take a picture back and know whose behind that was--you know, silly little things.  My family had a great sense of humor, and laughter was a part of our life.  And I thought that was hilarious, and we always joked about it.  But he had a habit--he saw a plane flying low, he would pull his pants down (laughter) and expose himself.  It's a silly thing, but it, it actually happened.  Nice, nice, warm stories--just getting along in the South.  People walking--the houses were miles apart--people walking by and speaking for about ten minutes--"How you doing?" as they walk by.  "I'm fine.  Where you going?"  "I'm going to Sue's house.  Be back in a little while."  "Okay.  Take it easy.  Everything all right here," you know, as they walked by--wonderful times.  You know, you could notice them walking by and ten minutes of, of salutation and they walk on for miles just to visit with baskets of food.  And sometimes they'd, you know, have the horse and the wagon and other times they wouldn't, but you know.  And dust everywhere, no grass--lovely times.
Story_ID: 19258
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind about how your parents met or did they know each other from just childhood or--?
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly how they met.  It might have been in school--I don't know.  My father [Elijah Joshau Reeves Jr.] being a minister's child, it might have been in church.  However, when he would come to visit when they were courting, mom [Ruby Lee Gilmore] being fourteen, maybe fourteen and a half and dad being all of eighteen, he would have to keep the guitar going on the front porch.  If he would stop playing, then Granddad [Grover Gilmore], Grandmama [Jessie Gilmore], Uncle [Grover Gilmore] Junior, Juanita [Gilmore], and Aunt Jill [Gilmore] would stick their head out of the door to see why the guitar stopped.  So they were married at the age of fifteen and nineteen.  But that's how they courted, and I thought that was the cutest thing.  Mom made it a point of letting us know that, if that guitar stopped, someone would come out and find out why, and they were very closely watched.  And they couldn't leave the porch.  They had to sit in that porch swing, and I thought that was romantic.  And they stayed together forty-seven years, so it must have been the right way to do things--watch, watch the youngsters until they were married.
Speaker 1: Now, what were your parents like and what do they do for a living here in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: My parents have both deceased.  I lost my mom in '96 [1996].  I lost my dad in '83 [1983].  My dad worked for Bud Wheeler when he first came from, from Alabama.  His first job was with the wheel-making people.  He went from that job to Packard.  He worked for Packard Motor [Car] Company.  After that he went to work for Ford.  I think he had a bout with Ford.  And then someone informed him that the city was hiring.  He took a test and passed it to be a pl-, employee of the city water department.  And we, he retired from that company.
Story_ID: 19259
Speaker 1: What was his [father, Elijah Joshau Reeves Jr.] personality like?
Speaker 2: Dad was a--he was a sweet man.  And he had very strict rules.  I remember being twenty-one in his house and making hit records and traveling all over the world but being told I couldn't come in his house after twelve o'clock.  He had so many children until he couldn't remember our names, so he'd call about five before he got to yours when he called you.  He worked all the time.  He knew how to repair things without actually being educated to do them.  He could take refrigerators and cars apart and put them back.  He constructed porches for people and there's w-, on the house, street from his house remains--there are several houses where you can see his handiwork where he's made screened-in porches and additions to houses.  He was very handy with his hands.  He knew how to fix everything and was called on a lot to assist other people.  He didn't talk a lot.  He was part Geech--is what they say.  I don't know the correct word for it, but--
Speaker 1: Geechee--where it comes (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, they were rice eating, high-cheeked, fast talking people.  Once angered, you couldn't understand a word he was saying.  And you better hoped you could because you don't know--he had a little streak of, of, a little violent streak.  He would, he would reach out.  I was never hit by him, but I was threatened quite a few times--that was enough for me.  He didn't have to hit me (laughter).
Story_ID: 19260
Speaker 1: He [Elijah Joshau Reeves Jr.] and mom [Ruby Lee Gilmore] were such lovers--they fought a lot, too.  And whenever they'd make up, you would have to talk to them through a door 'cause they'd get together for two to three hours and you'd have to just wait--or two or three days and you'd just have to wait for them to surface and come back into the fold.  But they--if you told one something, you--it was like telling the other 'cause they were that close.  So some things I told mom I thought were sensitive to women and the next thing you know dad was giving me advice.  So I know that they had a, a relationship and a, and a togetherness that's unlike any that I see today or any that I've ever been able to obtain in my relationships.  They had a very close relationship.  My mom was a workaholic.  She, having twelve children, knew how to handle all of us.  She gave us all special duties to do and made sure that we did them.  She would stand us up in a row as, as the little children, to find out who was the one that stole the money or ate the cake or broke the dish or whatever 'cause she didn't know who would do it.  So she'd line us up and say, "Okay, which one of you?"  And that taught me a lesson about unity.  We had one brother, Thomas [Reeves], who's about two years older than I am who helped raise me.  He would be the one to volunteer to keep the confusion--"Now, okay, mama, I did it," so we could all get back to whatever we were doing (laughter) 'cause the one, whoever was guilty would never admit (laughter) that they did it.  Just a, a happy family.  We, like I said, we didn't have television.  We listened to the radio on occasion.  And most of the time we would sing.  We were making music.  We had songs that we sang in church as a family.  And we could still sing them and remember them today.  I think music helped us get through a lot of the poverty that we suffered with just dad working.  Mom never had a job.  And they made ends meet.  She would be able to make meals with very little, having had to experience it in the South.  Most of our food was soul food as people called it--the greens and the beans and the cornbread and potato pies and the, the things that are now delicacies that you have to pay big money to get--she could cook it at a whim.  I remembering my parents and getting tearful because they're in heaven and I miss them a whole lot, but we had a wonderful and happy childhood.
Speaker 2: Now, where did your family live here in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 1: They lived on the East Side.  I'm an east side person.  I think that's why I named my group Vandella because it was after Van Dyke, a street on the East Side.  I was among the only artist at Motown [Records] who could say they were from the East Side.  And there's always been an East Side/West Side war.  In California they wear red and, and blue scarves.  Here, if a person heard you were from the East Side, then you were the opposition.  But I dare go to Hitsville USA on the West Side and obtain a career, so I'm very proud of that.  And that's why the name Vandella is dear to me.
Story_ID: 19261
Speaker 1: Do you have a first childhood memory, an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have a first childhood memory.  I remember being three years old at my grandfather's [Elijah Joshau Reeves Sr.] church [Metropolitan AME Zion Church, Detroit, Michigan] singing with my two older brothers, Thomas and Benny [Reeves], and actually winning the talent contest and being awarded some chocolate-covered cherries.  They made me captain of the candy and I wouldn't give them a piece unless they were nice to me.  I remember that very clearly.  And I also remember going to the Paradise Theatre.  My godmother, Beatrice--mom [Ruby Lee Gilmore] never got a chance to go anywhere with all those children.  But I had a godmother named Beatrice who wanted to take me to see a show at the Paradise Theatre, which is now our Orchestra Hall.  The Paradise Theatre was a beautiful, beautiful theatre--bigger than anything I'd ever been in.  And the lineup was featuring Cab Calloway and his big band, Count Basie and his big band, Louis Jordan and his seven-piece band, [Clayton] Peg Leg Bates, Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis, and this beautiful woman named Lena Horne.  I remember sitting there and seeing this lady who looked a lot like the little fairy-tale fairy godmothers that they showed you in books.  And she was in front of this screen with people with umbrellas running about and singing the blues.  (Sings) "Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky, stormy weather."  And I said she's so pretty--why would she be sad?  And she touched me in a way where I wished that I could be a singer or be anything like her--never knowing that that little dream that I had as a child would become real.  But I held on to that little dream--the feeling that she gave me.  I wanted to experience it again and maybe to be able to do that to someone else--that charisma that I felt she had--and at that early age.  Mom taught me to sing songs, and she taught me to retain lyrics.  And that's always been an asset.  After seeing them, she would teach me songs and I was featured everywhere we went.  If we visited relatives, she'd put me on a table and have me sing the song she had taught me.  Everywhere we went I was called on to sing.  And, and it happened to be just a habit that everywhere I've gone all my life people have asked me to sing.
Story_ID: 19262
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of the neighborhood when you grew up?
Speaker 2: On Illinois I remember mama's [Ruby Lee Gilmore] cooking.  I remember my brother talking about the oatmeal so that he could get my portion.  I remember Christmas and pudding with candy and oranges--in that little tiny house.  Three families lived in that house.  And we lived in one room.  When the number of children got to be six then we moved around the corner.  But it was a two, two double beds and a baby bed.  And I occupied that baby bed when there were four brothers and one girl.  Then when we had another sister join us then she got the baby bed and we moved (laughter)--thank God.  I remember on that house on Illinois, a riot that broke out into the city of Detroit [Michigan] and we were hurried down to a basement that had like three feet of water in it, and my brother had to carry me on his shoulders.  And we went and looked out of a window as a rat swam across the water, the top of the water--we went and looked.  We weren't afraid of that rat; we were afraid of the tanks that were passing by.
Speaker 1: Now is that the--?
Speaker 2: It's 1945.
Speaker 1: Forty-five [1945], okay.  Is that the riot that was started on the Belmont Bridge?
Speaker 2: Belmont Bridge, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, tell us about--what do you re--I know you were real little when that happened--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I was little.  I was only five years old.  I remember that, though, 'cause he didn't want me to walk in it.  Well, I couldn't have swam.  And when he picked me up we went to a little porthole, a little small window, and peered through that.  And I'd never seen a tank before and I thought we were going to die.  We heard the loud noises, the gunshots.  There were people running and screaming.  And we were safe in that basement--a water-filled and nasty and s-, moldy as it was.  It was a relief from what was happening up, up top.  And we stayed there for maybe two hours and then everything was cleared and we could go back, back upstairs to the house, in the house.  But I remember that as a child.  I remember going to school and the first day of school being told that we were going outside, not knowing that school had a recess.  I walked home.  And mom was so surprised and upset with me.  She made be feel real bad.  She hollered and screamed.  She called me silly and took me back.  She had the lady next door watch the children that were still at home, and she took me back to school and gave me back to that kindergarten teacher.  I had no idea there was a recess in school.  Little revelations like that, and I remember them very clearly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: How did I get home, though?  That's the thing.  I must have remembered that you walked to the corner, looked both ways, then you walk across the street--'cause I was only five.  That was kindergarten.
Speaker 1: And you had never been to the school before or--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I had not been to school.  My brothers took me and they told me to wait for them when I got out of school and they'd come and get me.  But, I didn't see them.  And she had let us outside, so I went home (laughter).

Speaker 1: What grade school did you attend and what grade--?
Speaker 2: Russell Elementary [School, Detroit, Michigan] is now defunct.  Where we used to live now has a Pepsi bottling company on top of it.  Our street Rypell and Leland is no longer there and neither is Russell School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Russell Elementary--.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Did--so was that the only grade school you attended in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Russell Elementary.  And they had a program for malnourished or ill children.  And I must have suffered with, with rickets or something, a deficiency, because I was removed from the regular school in the fourth grade and I put in, in what you would called a fresh air program.  We had one teacher, Mrs. Keyes, who taught the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh--no, fourth, fifth--yeah, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grade.  And if she had us all in rows, and we would sit and listen to her.  She would tutor the other rows.  We'd have a rest period.  We'd have a lunch.  They'd give us a s-, snack for breakfast.  And they gave us milk three times a day for the five hours that we were in school.
Speaker 1: Now did you think that--at the time did you think that your family really had it rough, or did you, what do you figure or did you have any thoughts about that, I mean--?
Speaker 2: I just knew that I wasn't a well child, and all the rest of my brothers and sisters were.  I thought it was something maybe that just affected me.  It had nothing to do with poverty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause everybody else was healthy.  And we always had enough to eat.  It was something that the city did.  They schooled the children and I was chosen as one.  We were called all kinds of names from the other students.  We were out on the patio with the, the bars up to them.  We could play ball out there but then some of the youngsters--it was like a four-story school.  Some of the other children would shout up things about misfits and deforms, you know, 'cause we had all kinds of illnesses that we had or might have caught, we had a epsil-, epileptic students, we had--polio was very rampant in my generation.  We had tuberculosis, rheumatic fever, blind, is it, you know, visually and hearing chal-, challenged.  We were all put up, put up in that one area and treated sort of mean as if we were the mutants of our school.  But we learned more than the other students.  Mrs. Keyes was a great teacher.  She was quiet spoken and she wore the same clothing every day, the same navy blue suit with the ruffled white blouse.  And she was always correct.  She was always--her every hair in place.  And she always gave us a good lesson.  And, I grew to admire her and the way that she taught and her discipline.  She was one of the first influences in my life to let me know that you've gotta study.  You've gotta learn the, your, get your education.  You must be educated.
Speaker 1: Okay, now her name was, again, was Mrs.--?
Speaker 2: Keyes.
Speaker 1: Ms. Keyes, all right.
Speaker 2: K-E-Y-E-S.

Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little girl?  I mean, what were you like and what did you--I mean, what did you like to do and what would other people see?  How did others see you?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was a little girl that mom [Ruby Lee Gilmore] called Motley, remember?  She would make my clothing.  We didn't have money for, for new clothes.  So she would sit at, with the, you know, the, the rocking Sing-, Singer.  She had a rocking Singer, and she'd sit there sometimes all night and make fabric, take fabric that she'd bought from Sam's and make us dresses.  If I had a bodice of one fabric, my sister would have a skirt of the other.  And she'd make pockets so that when you saw us in school, you'd know that we were brothers and sisters.  I was thin; not very tall--not short, but not very tall.  I always thought my hair was never right.  So I was always ready to take aloose the braids mom would put in and undo the ribbons that she'd decora-, decorate us with.  Being from the South, she used a lot of ribbons and a lot of little things that you put in, in the, the little, things you--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Barrettes and things.
Speaker 2: Barrettes and stuff that you put in the hair.  She, she'd overdo it, I thought.  And she'd make zigzag patterns with the ribbons in the top of the head, and I spent most of my time taking that aloose (laughter).  But I always excelled in my classes.  I got good marks.  Upon graduating from Northeastern High School, I had quite a few credits behind my name in my yearbook.  I was captain of the cheering team.  I was a lead soloist in the choir.  I was secretary of the (unclear).  I was treasurer of the Seventeen Club.  I was with the Mask and Weights Club.  And I was with the Honor Society.  I got good marks.  Well, you had to have good marks to be a cheerleader.  And very popular in school.  I didn't attend my own prom, though.  I wasn't popular with the guys.  I guess--.
Speaker 1: You were unpopular with the guys?
Speaker 2: Right.  I gue-, I guess I was more into my books than I was into, into people.  So--.
Speaker 1: That's hard to believe.
Speaker 2: It's true.  I didn't, I didn't attend my own prom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My brother took me to his.  So I did get--.
Speaker 1: Nobody asked you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: That's, that's very hard to believe.
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't that friendly, and I had brothers who would beat anybody up if any guys tried to talk to me.  I had a couple of flir-, flirtations in school, but they always wind up being, turning out negative.  Was this one guy liked me enough to squirt ink on my white blouse.  And when I went home and I didn't want take a whipping, so I told on him and my brothers beat him up the next day.  So that--you know, there goes my opportunity for a boyfriend.  No, I wasn't very popular with the guys.

Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: My favorite subject, subject in school was composition and music.  I'd, I'd tolerate everything to get to choir rehearsal, to get to my music classes.  And I was featured doing [Johann Sebastian] Bach's Aria at my graduation.  Abraham Silver was a teacher at Northeastern [High School, Detroit, Michigan] who also taught Mary Wilson and [Robert] Bobby Rogers and Florence Ballard.  They all were under his instruction in the choir, Glee Club, or whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay, in the same high school?
Speaker 2: Same Northeastern High School, yes.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) It was North-, okay.
Speaker 2: And I was chosen out of eleven girls to sing the lead soloist, first soprano solo of Bach's Aria.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you singing in church during this time, this period (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, I've always sang in church.  I stopped attending church on a regular basis when I turned about eleven 'cause I just got sick of it--I mean, going every Wednesday and Thursday and Sunday and, you know, and the choir and usher board, teaching Sunday school, all that.  So I, I didn't go as much between the ages maybe of eleven and seventeen--I didn't go a lot.  And didn't sing in the church, just sang in groups.  I was then singing in the school courtyard at Northeastern after school with a group called The Fascinations.  They went on to record with, with Curtis Mayfield.  I decided I didn't want to be a part of that group after I couldn't get along with a couple of members.  And then later maybe at the age of, of nineteen joined the Del-Phi's.  The Del-Phi's were the group that was in need of a first, a second soprano and a, and a second lead when one of their members moved out of town.  I joined Gloria Williamson, Rosalind [Ashford] Holmes and Annette Beard in a group called the Del-Phi's.  We recorded one record  on Check-Mate and after graduating high school the record didn't sell.  We all found jobs and went our separate ways.  Then I became Martha LaVaille.  I started singing as a solo performer in nightclubs.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in high school, when you were in high school were you singing in these groups, I mean, in high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  We were The Fascinations.  I was a senior.  You asked me if I was singing in church.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I wasn't singing in church, I was singing in groups.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Singing with other girls and spending my evenings after school in somebody's living room or somewhere singing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did--I wonder, did--now did your family encour-, was it still encouraging you to sing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh yeah.  Mama [Ruby Lee Gilmore] always taught me to sing the best I can when I--at the moment, and I'd never have any regrets.  So I always put my heart and soul into singing.  And, as teenagers we used to sing at the different Mason halls, YMCAs [Young Men's Christian Associations]--anybody had a birthday, we'd sing for them for no compensation whatsoever, but just because we could sing good together and it was a good hobby.  It was a good recreation for us--kept us out of trouble.  And, our parents welcomed it.  They loved it when we rehearsed at different houses.  And we'd have Kool-Aid and Ritz cracker sandwiches and (laughter) and we'd have good evenings of just singing, and we could sing good.  We could really have--we had good, good harmony and we had a good sound.
Speaker 1: It seems, though--it seems to me that, I guess, in a lot of black households during that time period, the time period that when you came of age and as a teenager a lot of people were doo-wopping in the neighborhood and singing and with a dream of becoming, you know, of having a record out and that sort of thing.  And I know my brother is the same age you are--his friends did the same thing.  They'd come over the house and they'd sing.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: My generation didn't do that (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they would come over and sing--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) But you know that's also the joy of freedom.  Because there was a time before my generation when you couldn't gather together and sing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we were enjoying that freedom of being able to get and just sing as loud as our little hearts desired.  That's where doo-wop was created.  Where if you didn't hit the right note, somebody would wop you.
Speaker 1: Doo-wop.
Speaker 2: That's when the doo-wop was created--in our houses.
Speaker 1: When you described the Kool-Aid and all that it sound so familiar.  I mean, you know, for that, you know, they make the Kool-Aid, and everybody would come, they'd sing, they rehearsed, you know, with the hopes of--.

Speaker 1: Did you have any idols in terms of pop stars in those days that you were--?
Speaker 2: My idols were Dinah Washington.  My brother joined the military and brought me a lot of Nancy Wilson records.  So I'd spend my time listening to her thirty-three and a thirds.  I loved Ella Fitzgerald with "A-Tisket, A-Tasket."  From that very moment I heard her voice and then after with, you know, aging a little bit and finding out her history, I know why I loved her.  Sarah Vaughan I thought was a saxophone of voices, and I'd listen to anything anytime.  I could recognize her voice, and I appreciated and loved Sarah Vaughan.  Gloria Lynne.  When I was about seventeen my brother gave me a, a, one of Yma Sumac's records.  She has five octaves and she said she's an Inca Indian.  And I used to emulate her voice and do some of the things that she does.  It's fantastic singing.  Morgana King, names that you don't hear about anymore, but people that have really influenced my life.  Peggy Lee--she had a style and a uniqueness that was--oh, I could go on and on.  I'd, I really listened a lot to, with the recordings and to the styles of the different ladies that I've mentioned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were my influences.  Mahalia Jackson--the Caravan.  Shirley Caesar, names like that.  Clara Ward.  I listened to a lot of the male vocalists, too.  Soul Stirrers and Sam Cooke--they were--my brothers, all of them tried to sound like Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers.  My brother Benny [Reeves]--and still sings--he's the oldest.  He had a group called The Mi-, Motorcity Travelers.  They did a capella gospel, and they could rock any church.  There were five members of them, and they were my first idols bus-, in the music business.
Speaker 1: And there's a Alabama influence in popular music that's, I mean, the music that comes out of Alabama, the church music and--is real unique.  And I don't think there's anything like them to me--the harmony and so forth--in the United States.  Did you, did you--wow, like could you speak to that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I can't really speak on the Alabama influence.  I just know that the Alabama Blind Boys [the Blind Boys of Alabama] are still, they're still singing.  And they were just recently given the Music Hall of Fame in Alabama.  I was also inducted into Alabama Hall of Fame.  My dad [Elijah Joshau Reeves Jr.] certainly was influenced and, and had a sound that was so unique you could identify it with, with Alabama.  They must have just been some great singers.

Speaker 1: When you graduated from high school did you consider going to college or did you think about that at all (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, okay.
Speaker 1: You're a good student and you were popular.
Speaker 2: I was a great student and my, my counselor in democracy at Northeastern High School [Detroit, Michigan] was this man by the name of Graves.  Mr. Graves actually had me take the test.  But my education wasn't enough for entry into Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan].  So evidently our, our education was not of standard at Northeastern.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So even though you did well at Northeastern--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Did well.  I wasn't good enough, right.  Wasn't good enough to--I graduated with a B average, but it wasn't enough to entitle me to college.  And there were no such thing as grants at that time.  So I had to find another way of, of getting through life and find another career.  My first job was a telephone solicitor--on the phone trying to sell construction to people who didn't want you to even call them that time of day.  Then I went from there to selling door to door for Stanley Home Products.  I wasn't very good at selling brushes.  I could talk them into buying some of the merchandise, but when it came time to pay, no one had their money.  So I got stuck with a lot of product and aced out as a door-to-door salesperson.  Then I tried day keeping, housekeeping, cleaning houses, and catching the bus for the eight dollars a day in carfare, and babysitting.  And that wasn't quite my cup of tea, especially on one occasion the lady gave me a dress.  I went home and altered it and wore it back to work.  Her husband seeing me in it remarked, ooh, that dress looks better on you than-, on her than it did on you--and there went my job.  So I said, okay, there's got to be something else.  So then I started working for Citywide Cleaners.  I was the exchange girl.  I rose from just a regular counter person to someone who went to the different places or locations on off days--checked the books, checked the stock to make sure that the girls were keeping in line.

Speaker 1: Took a chance on singing, after the Del-Phi's, singing in nightclubs as Martha LaVaille.  My name my Aunt Bernice gave me when she pierced my ears.  She said, "You're gonna be famous.  So when you get famous, name yourself Martha LaVaille."  She spelled it for me, L-A-V-A-I-L-L-E.
Speaker 2: Now why Martha LaVaille?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  That was Aunt Bernice.  She tau-, she also taught me to crochet.  So I, I spent hours thinking about her and just remembering, and remembering what a, a test it was to get my ears pierced with that thread and that needle and that cork (laughter).  It was scary.  But while she was doing that, she's talking and she said, "Okay, you're gonna be famous.  And when you become famous, name yourself Martha LaVaille."  So after the Del-Phi's and I wanted to go into the nightclubs and sing I was The Sound of Martha LaVaille by William Stevenson at the Twenty Grand.  I'd just finish on happy hour.  That was because my dad [Elijah Joshau Reeves Jr.] wouldn't let me in his house after twelve o'clock.  So I had to sing between maybe five and ten-thirty and get out of there and make it home before twelve.  And William Stevenson approached me and said, "I'm William Stevenson from Motown's Hitsville USA.  You have talent.  Take this card and give me a call."  I thought he was getting ready to hit on me and be my Prince Charming--you know, ride off in the sunset on the white horse.  But then I said, okay.  I took the card, went back to the dressing room and looked at it and realized--that's the company where Smokey Robinson had been discovered.  Smokey Robinson and a group called The Miracles had a record out called "Get a Job."  And all the girls would say he must been the finest person that they ever seen in their life.  They were screaming when, when The Miracles went on stage.  They were really acting crazy like--the same as people act when they hear Elvis Presley or, or, you know, or the likes.  He was our first Elvis Presley--I'll put it that way.  And, there was a girl at, at the same company named Mary [Esther] Wells.  She had seen Berry Gordy at a audition for [Marvin Earl] Marv Johnson.  He had a record out called "You Got What it Takes."  And sang a song to Berry Gordy right on the spot.  (Sings) "Well, you know you took my heart.  You told her I didn't love.  Well, bye-bye baby," you know, and then he said, "Okay, I'm gonna make you a singer--you're not gonna be a songwriter on my company--make you a singer.  I'm a make you the biggest number one vocalist in the world."  And that he did.  So that was the company.  I was hearing about all these new acts--a man named Barrett Strong singing a song called "Money."  "Woa, we all need some money."  And that record hit number one in Detroit [Michigan].  And w-, I said this is the same company where all these black entertainers are getting over.  I got to go there.  So I went there the next day (laughter).  And Mickey looked at me after I was let through the, the door after asking for William Stevenson and being buzzed in.  He said, "What are you doing here?"  Oh, no, oh my God, I've done the wrong thing again.  I said, "Don't you remember giving me a card and asking me to come to this company?"  He said, "Yeah, but you supposed to take the card and call for an audition.  We audition every third Thursday.  You suppose to call for an appointment."  And I wanted to just disappear, sink through the floor.  I want to cry.  I want to run.  But he says, "I'll tell you what.  Answer the phone.  I'll be right back."  And he did it.  But his "right back" was three hours.  I sat in that office--I could've answered the phone one time and went on home like a good girl.  But I said, no, I'm a wait till he comes back 'cause that's what he asked me to do.  And the phone jumped off the hook.  This was a little tiny room with no windows and only one way in, and it had a desk, a telephone, a, a clock and a file cabinet, and a piano.  And all these guys kept coming ask me who I was and what was I doing in there.  And it was like fourteen writers on staff.  The A & R [Artists and Repertoire] assistant, Clarence Paul, who was so good with the work with Stevie Wonder, came in here.  Actually he asked me who the f- I was (laughter).  I had to explain to him William Stevenson said to answer the phone.  He'd be right back.  And then he said, you mean, Mickey?--'cause that's what everybody called him.  Yeah.  Answering the phone, "Hello.  A & R secretary.  May I speak to--may I help you?"  "Who?  There's no A & R secretary.  Who is this?"  "Martha Reeves, A & R department.  May I help you?"  "Well, where is Mickey?"  "Mr. Stevenson said he'd be right back.  May I take a message?"  And I did that for like--I'd stayed three hours before he came back.  He was somewhere planning a session.  In the meantime they were having all kinds of confrontations at the door.  There was supposed to be a session across the hall in Studio A.  They hadn't paid the musicians on the last session.  So they wanted to fight for their money or they weren't going to go and record the st-, songs schedule for Hattie Littles that Clarence Paul was gonna produce.  I had to get on the phone to the Finance department, get these guys money before they would start.  I was right in the middle of the mix, and it was only three hours.  But I knew how to take control of the situation.  I knew what had to be done, and I did it on pure instinct, 'cause I'd never been in a record company before.  And I had a little bit of office training in high school, but never in, you know, it was like one on one with people that were asking for ques-, asking questions and wanted answers.  I even answered a memo 'cause at that time it was a memo on the door system.  And you have to check things and write things and send them back 'cause the messenger would be standing right there.  Oh, I had a, had a ball.  He finally came back and I was indispensable.  He asked me to stay the rest of the day.  Asked me to come back the next day.  This went on for three weeks until my dad said, "Hey, you're not making any money with that company.  You quit your job, get you another job, or make them give you a salary."  I went back tearfully and William Stevenson came up with thirty-five dollars a week for me.  That was big money.  It was enough for transportation back there.  And I augmented it by doing sessions, singing with anyone, anyone that wanted a fourth or fifth or third voice, snapping fingers 'cause there are no synthesizers, stomping on floor, clapping hands, just making any little noise that Berry wanted to put or the producers wanted to put on their music.  And nine months later I got on a tour bus.  That's after bringing the Del-Phi's over to sing behind Marvin Gaye--"Stubborn Kinda Fellow," "Hitch Hike," "Pride and Joy."  With Berry hearing our vocal ability and saying, hey, we'll put the, put this record, that demo record that Martha made for Mary Wells--put this out.  Put those girls in the back of it--'cause he liked my voice on the song.  I only sang a demonstration record for Mary Wells because the union made a surprise visit and Berry was told, for some reason, that he had to have an artist on the mike whenever he recorded 'cause he was out of hand.  The union would, union was trying to control him.  He was recording twenty-four hours a day.  It was his house.  No record company was doing that.  They'd close at a certain hour and they were--they had res-, you know, rules and restrictions.  Berry was just recording music as if it were a factory.  And, I was called out of the office one day when the union man made, not--made the surprise visit.
Story_ID: 19269
Speaker 1: Now are you telling us this--you're right--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm in, I'm in the, in the A & R [Artists and Repertoire] department minding my own business answering the phone and this was like three months into my employment.  I worked nine months as a secretary.  And this panic was stricken at the front door.  "The union man's coming!  The union man's coming!  Martha, go in the studio and sing this song."  "What song?"  "Sing this song."  "What's the name of it?"  "I have to let him, let him go," and he sings a little bit of it for me.  So I have to go and place myself on the mike.  They play the music and the union man takes his time so I have to sing it maybe one or two times to get to know it.  And, this is all because Berry [Gordy] had been given rules that he could not record any music unless there was an artist on the microphone.  And the union man made a surprise visit trying to catch Berry off guard.  Maybe they'll shut him down or maybe, you know, just catch him off so he could fine him or some kind of way involve the union.  And, I did a good job--to the point where when Berry heard it he said put this out on her.  She sounds good on it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was, so that record came out as the first--.
Speaker 2: Yes, it did, called "I'll Have to Let Him Go."
Speaker 1: --as Martha Reeves.
Speaker 2: Martha Reev-, Martha and the Vandellas.
Speaker 1: Martha and the Vandellas, okay.  So the backup singers were there.
Speaker 2: I had called Rosalind [Ashford] and then had--and Gloria [Williamson] in to sing behind this drummer.  My boss, Mickey [William Stevenson], had told me that they were going to record this drummer who was on the list maybe fourth down.  And, he had been going on the road playing for Smokey Robinson.  And, he was always disguised.  He would wear a hat on his head, pipe in his mouth, glasses on his eyes, even had a beard one time.  And he didn't know him, but when Mickey said he was going to record him we were all surprised.  So I called The Andantes--Jackie Hicks, Louvain Demps, Marlene Barrow, who were the regular girls that sang behind everybody, and they were in Chicago [Illinois].  They weren't supposed to be in Chicago.  They were supposed to be at Motown's beck and call 'cause they were under contract.  So instead of busting my girls, I called in people that I knew I could sing with, the Del-Phi's--Rosalind Holmes, Annette [Beard] Helton, and Gloria Williamson.  Gloria Williamson decided in the first of negotiations that she don't, didn't want to be on Motown, that she ne-, was going to keep her job with the city.  So she didn't continue us, with us when the group changed to the Vandellas.  But as Del-Phi's we sang behind Marvin Gaye, "A Stubborn Kinda Fellow," in the days of four tracks.  That was all the singers were recorded at the same time on one mike.  When this man pulled that hat off of his head, those glasses off his eyes, and that pipe out of his mouth, we looked at somebody who was as fine to me as any movie star could ever be.  He even reminded me a little bit of Sam Cooke, who I met briefly before he was killed--very good-looking young man.  And he could really sing.  We didn't know he was a s-, I didn't know he was a singer.  I just thought he was a drummer, session drummer.  And then Marvin Gaye was discovered.  Couple months later he married Berry's sister, Anna.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we heard Marvin Gaye the drummer first.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, he was.  Yes, he--he, he was a drummer at Motown because he could do that, he could play drums.  But he came there with Harvey Fuqua to be a singer.  He just had to wait his turn to sing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So tell me about the Vandellas now.  I mean, the--okay, now who are the other two and how did--you knew them from the Del-Phi's?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were the Del-Phi's.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when we came to--when I called them to do the session with Marvin Gaye, which was my job to call the different artists and the singers, Mickey liked our harmony right away and considered us as artists for the company right away.

Speaker 1: What was your first big hit as Martha Reeves and the Vandellas?
Speaker 2: 'Come and Get These Memories' was written by Holland-Dozier-Holland.  That was our very first big hit.  They had--Eddie [Holland] had been on the road with 'Jamie.'  'Jamie' was the number one song that went to the top of the charts for, for Eddie as a solo artist.  And after traveling on his first promotional tour he came back very discouraged.  He had done a good job, but he didn't like it.  He didn't like show business.  He didn't like the girls pulling on him.  He didn't like the drafty dressing rooms.  He didn't like getting up making those planes.  He didn't like none of it.  He didn't like people making demands on him, having to sing when he didn't feel like it.  A lot of things that most artists overlook and just, okay, that's part of the, the dues you pay--but it was sort of something that Eddie didn't desire to do.  There's a lot of good artists who decide they don't really want the fanfare and the traveling and all of the hoopty-doo that goes with show business.  And, he would--came back to, to the A & R [artists and  repertoire] department and started writing with his brother, Brian [Holland], and Lamont Dozier.  And Martha Reeves and the Vandellas received their first compil-, composition collectively.  'Come and Get These Memories' was the first song that they wrote as a team.
Speaker 1: That was quite a hit.  I remember that.

Speaker 2: Sometimes it would stay in there.  Sometimes it would come right out.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Sometimes you had the disk you pop in there--.
Speaker 2: There you go!
Speaker 1: --yeah, to hold that forty-five converter on it.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, 'cause the machines--most of the ones in the community I saw were--I mean the, the record players were made for seventy-eights, you know.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You got to get that converter to play the forty-five.
Speaker 2: That's right, you did.  Yes, you did.
Speaker 1: And, you'd listen to the latest one.  And most of the cities didn't have radio stations that played the music.  You'd have to hear it in the record store and word of mouth, which carried it through.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.  You got Joltin' Joe Howard and, oh, quite a few of the artists--Joe Butler and--I'm trying to think of all of the guys who helped us.  It was so many.  Butterball Junior played our music and made us famous.  Oh,--.
Speaker 1: Now did you have the black radio station in Detroit [Michigan] then playing--?
Speaker 2: WCHB.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: WCHB.  We, we got a little bit of play from WWG-, WJR, WWJ--but that was about it in our first days--(unclear).
Speaker 1: I know in the city I came from we had, you know, a top forty station in Dayton [Ohio], down in Dayton.  WING played, you know, Motown music.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, at first they wouldn't play Motown.  And some of the program directors just defied, were defied by the jocks that say we gonna play it and, if we lose our job, it's all right.  We just gonna play the Motown sound.  So we have a lot of the jocks to thank for--they were the first rappers that I ever knew, and they'd talk on our records.  They'd have little jargon that they make you remember the songs by.  We had a lot of help from the DJs in our early days.
Speaker 1: Now that's--what a sound, though.  I mean, it's--.
Speaker 2: We used to do record hops for them, though.  We'd go and work for them for nothing.  They'd get a hall or something and rent it and charge admission and we'd go and sing for them, free for them.  And they'd play our records all, all year (laughter).  It was a good exchange.
Story_ID: 19272
Speaker 1: We were talking on the way over hear about those hits of Martha and the Vandellas and it would seem like for some reason--I don't know if it's--you know, this isn't scientific, this is just subjective--and it seem like the band would really cook on your records.  I mean, you know, "Heat Wave"--and I just think of all the orchestration, and it really seem like the band really cooked on--.
Speaker 2: Well, it might have been because of that first confrontation I had when I made sure that the musicians got their checks the minute they recorded.  That's why I think our music had such good input.  And if the guys heard it was for Martha and the Vandellas, they gave it a little special "oomf."  The thing that was unique about Motown--they used the same musicians, but n-, nobody sounded the same.  Stevie Wonder's music sounded different than The Supremes.  The Temptations' music sounded different from the, The Contours or The Spinners.  Mary [Esther] Wells' music sounded different from anything else that you ever heard.  So, it was a unique place to be.  And the musicians, the Funk Brothers, were the reason.
Speaker 1: Right.  I mean, they really did the thing when you think about the hits, the "Dancing in the Streets," you know.
Speaker 2: "Nowhere to Run."
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Right.  So they were grateful for that (laughter) first hit.
Speaker 2: And I was, too (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: I was glad I could be of help because that was very frustrating for the guys that they couldn't get their money on time.  Then they couldn't feed their children, and they couldn't get transportation to get back to the studio--keep their instruments out of pawn.  It was very important that they get paid when they played the music.
Speaker 1: Right--.
Speaker 2: 'Cause they got such a small compensation for millions of sellers.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) They didn't get the fame either.  And people didn't know who they were.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Their names weren't on the records.  We didn't know who they were.  I mean, we knew, I mean, your name was on--Martha and the Van--we knew who--that Martha's singers were the Vandellas.
Speaker 2: Singers were, yeah, and who the producers and the writers were 'cause they'd have it on the label.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Holland-Dozier-Holland.
Speaker 2: But you never knew who the musicians were.
Speaker 1: Never knew.
Speaker 2: But the--then, too, you have to remember the musicians played for every record label.  They played for  Chess [Records], they played for--they went to, down to Muscle Shoals [Record Company].  They, they did every--they did a lot of traveling.  So they played for a lot people, not just Motown.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard from--Carl Davis in Chicago [Illinois] was talking about how he would, he would import them to Chicago without Berry Gordy's knowing.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's right, without Berry knowing it, that's right.  And they'd also go down to Memphis [Tennessee] without Berry knowing it to [High] Stacks [Records].  Columbia [Records]--everybody used the same musicians.
Speaker 1: Anonymity had its purpose.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Just goes to show you, too, that they might not have been recognized, but they were compensated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's a, I know there's a, there's the--a movie was made a couple years ago about the Funk Brothers, you know--.
Speaker 2: "Standing in the Shadows of Motown"--I was featured in that as the only artist who would actually consent to doing it.  And, it was fun to see the guys get together.  It was just before [Howard Richard] Pistol Allen passed away [2002] and Johnny Griffin lost his, his battle with his heart.  But it was good to see the guys get back together.  But the real Funk Brothers have already, -ready passed on like James Jamerson and [Benny] Benjamin--.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and Benjamin and Robert White, Earl Van Dyke--they've gone on to heaven.  Those are the guys that recorded our music.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) The idea that Jamerson was a big star in Britain--when the Motown tour went over there, he didn't even go on the tour.
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.
Speaker 1: And they had signs out there welcoming James Jamerson, the bass player, with it.
Speaker 2: That's right.  They could, they could sense his, his ability.  He was, oh, one of the greatest bassists.
Story_ID: 19273
Speaker 1: Your name was on the records that--did you--you became a star.  Now, I don't know--but, did--was your perception at the time that you are now a star--is, was it?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Because I know in other places people perceived you as a star.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But when we got to England it was my--well, I have bec-, I had, prior to going over there with the Motown Revue, traveled with, with Georgie Fame [b. Clive Powell], who on his record I say, "Yeah, yeah, it was big."  We had done a good forty-week tour with him.  And so our name was known all around the UK [United Kingdom].  It's just, not just on that BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation] special.  So that might have been why.  And I'd also befriended Dusty Springfield, whose actual special that was.  She had been given maybe five or six opportunities for specials on, on the BBC broadcasting station, and she chose to use the Motown acts as one of her featured topics and brought us all over.  But she and I were real friends.  In fact, she was the first person I let hear "Dancing in the Street" after I got my demonstration record and ran out--we were in, in New York and she came to the Apollo [Theater] to see me and I let her hear "Dancing in the Street."  She thought it was a hit, too.  But I was excited about it.  But she was one of the first people who I let hear the demo before it was released.  She was a real good friend.  We met at the Brooklyn Fox [Theatre]  in, in New York.  And I thought she was one of the best singers I'd ever heard.  And we had a lot of similar tastes.  She recorded some of the things that I did, and I also recorded a couple of things that she did.  So--.
Speaker 1: Remember she recorded with Burt Bacharach and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did--but did you have a sense that you were a star?  I mean, when you, when your first record hit, did you, did you have a sense that you are now a star and that people all over the country would know who you are, who you were?
Speaker 2: No.  I--like I said, from the age of three I've always been asked to sing.  So, singing--I know it's a gift and I have confidence to know that I'm one of the people who God gifted with a talent of singing.  Some people sing because they want to.  Other people sing because they are blessed with the ability.  And when called on I just feel obligated to, whenever I'm called, to answer.  As far as a star is concerned, I never went there.  Mama [Ruby Lee Gilmore] always told me that when the light goes off, I'm off stage.  People have depicted stars as being the one with the fairest complexion or the straightest of hair or the, the best of physiques, you know, the ones who stand out in a crowd as being the fairest and the prettiest and whatever--so I never went there.  I always thought that I had a gift, that I could touch other spirits with my lyrics.  And I did only things that I felt I could do from my heart.  So I'm talented, but I don't, I never thought of myself as being a, a star.
Story_ID: 19274
Speaker 1: Now the music of Martha and the Vandellas seem to be the more danceable music of the Motown music.  I mean, it's, it's--I mean, you couldn't, I couldn't imagine Martha and the Vandellas singing "I Hear a Symphony," you know.  I mean I couldn't imagine that.  I mean, but it's--but did you, did you really choose the kind of--or was there--how did, how were the, your songs chosen, and did you participate in that yourself or--?
Speaker 2: I was told to sing most of the things.  And Berry [Gordy] would assign all of the writers to present entries when an artist was up for a recording opportunity.  There would be five or six people to compete for the release.  And the songs picked for me were framed or--my trademark was the fact that I was gospel and, and country.  Being a country girl was expressed on a record called 'Honey Chile' that Sylvia Moy wrote for me.  The lyrics were "You're shiftless and you're lazy just like that hound dog Daisy I had when grandma raised me, honey chile," which let me know that they understood I was from the South and sort of poked fun a little bit.  But 'Honey Chile' I thought was a good record, and it was a big seller for us.  They chose songs that could, I could use my gospel and my country influence.  And the musicians made sure that they were funky or that they were danceable.  And we did dance good.  We were good because of [Charles] Cholly Atkins and his choreography.  He gave us good rhythmic steps, and we had a good look on stage.  We, we did, did--we do dance, and still do dance good to the music that we've recorded.  I think it was basically that they, they studied the artists and they wrote songs about our lives or about our personalities and, and they fit us very well.
Story_ID: 19275
Speaker 1: So I just recently produced a CD and in it I emulate what Motown did as far as recording is concerned.  A learned a lot in the A & R [artists and repertoire] department.  I didn't just sit by a typewriter.  I sat by the control room, and I watched how the producers came up with their lyrics and how they actually started to write songs on that simple piano that was in the, Spinet piano that was in the A & R department.  So I did use some of the same techniques.  And I searched the city, found Thomas "Beans" Bowles, who has passed away--God rest his soul.  He contracted me the jazz musicians from the Hall of Fame that are, are featured on my album.  And I used the rhythm section that came closest to the sound that, of maybe that James Jamerson produced on his bass and that Benny Benjamin did on his drums.  In fact, my brother, who passed away recently--is playing just like Benny Benjamin on a few of the songs just for me and with a lot of pickups and drum rolls.  We, we chose the top guitarist in the city, and we chose Rudy Robinson to write all of our charts out for us--God rest his soul.  Those two gentlemen, Rudy Robinson and "Beans" Bowles passed away before I could show them how much they helped me and how great this album's turned out to be.  But I'm continuing the sound, the sound that I was recorded on as opposed to a lot of the new music that's technically noise (laughter).
Story_ID: 19276
Speaker 1: Eventually, you know, Motown had hit--it's be the biggest thing around then it, it--what happened?  It seem like it--to a lot of people on the outside look like it shot itself in the foot, you know, or something, Berry Gordy's, you know, direction with it, but what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, he outgrew Detroit [Michigan].  There are a lot of artists that were--he discovered over thirty acts right here in Detroit.  Then he got involved with people like Lionel Richie and his band.  The Jackson Five grew out of proportion to a level that he never expected.  It's, it turned out to be--bands are supposed to, groups--if you can remember the, the Jackson Five were self-contained when they first started recording.  One of the guys played bass, one of them played guitar, and they had an organ player that was a cousin, and a drummer.  So, it, you know, that mode of music changed.  It wasn't just standup singing.  It was like the band and everything playing and--.  He wanted to make movies.  So he took his top people and went about that project.  He had fallen in love with Diane [Ernestine Earle Ross].  That made a difference because at first he was "hands on" to all of us.  After that some of us were left on our own.  He went from act to act--making an act, dropping an act, making an act, dropping an act.  And eventually to make movies he had to move to California.  It was a good thing while it lasted, and a history-making, star-making machine that no one could have predicted or can ever duplicate.  And I'm glad to be one of the originals of it and one of the pioneers of, of the sound.  And I'm glad to have seen it happen and to be a part of it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're right.  It's the kind of thing that once its disassembled it's hard to--.
Speaker 2: You can't put that machine back.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's sort of like people speak that way about some of the activities during the Civil Rights Movement with the time and the people came together at a certain point and then--.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --to put it back together again is--.
Speaker 2: No.  Berry, Berry was very smart, and his genius shows in all of us.  We're all Berry Gordy clones.  He would come and sit and watch us and say do this, do that, put this there, sing that better, put that on the end.  And we did what he said, and he taught us all how to do the Motown sound.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--basically when the Motown machine kind of switched focus and all that, I mean, what did--did you feel abandoned by the--?
Speaker 2: I would have felt abandoned when they moved to Los Angeles [California] and I didn't know anything about it.  I was the proud mother of a one-year old child.  And after touring Europe I came back to Detroit and asked for my next assignment because that's how they would operate.  If you were not on the road, you were there doing either choreography or music theory or working with Professor [Maxine] Powell in personal development or you would record.  So I asked for my next assignment and was told that "Don't you know that Motown moved?"  "What?"  "Yeah, they've moved to California.  All we have to do now is music computers out there and we're all moved."  And I wasn't even told.  So, I sat around for a little while, and I was gonna quit show business.  With this new baby I was gonna get a job, and I thought I could make it doing anything 'cause I've never really gotten to a point where I wouldn't make a change if I had to.  I still feel that if I have to make a change, I can.  However, I love show business and love singing.  Eddie Kendricks came by my apartment and literally cursed me out.  He said, "How dare you think you can quit.  You--sure the company's moved, but you gotta keep singing.  You got all that music out there.  People expect for you to respond.  You gotta go out and reproduce that music over and over again.  And I have to do it--you have to do it.  You're no better than I am."  And he really cursed me out.  But he gave me the, the, the encouragement that I needed to persevere, to continue.  And I'm glad he did.
Story_ID: 19277
Speaker 1: Did Berry Gordy like cancel contracts with the artists or something?
Speaker 2: No, my contract was up.  It was up.
Speaker 1: It was up, okay.  So, and--.
Speaker 2: And it wasn't renewed.
Speaker 1: --it was over and it wasn't--okay.  And so he just--.
Speaker 2: Nothing said.  I sat around for a while and then--and my sister Lois [Reeves] heard from this man named Ron Strasner.  And he was interested--he was at the time managing Rare Earth, a group called Rare Earth that had recorded on Motown.  And he thought he could take me to another level and invited me to have a meeting with him out in Los Angeles [California] with Richard Perry to see if they would produce a record on MCA [Records], which would be the first solo album after Motown.  And we negotiated and it became--I moved to Los Angeles and continued my career.  The MCA album was one of Richard Perry's best-produced albums, but it was a controversy because he spent $250,000 recording it although that money did not go toward recording.  And MCA was very upset so they didn't promote the record.  And my first solo album was sort of like put aside--I'll put it that way--the controversy.  Then I s-, living in LA I started working and attending a church called Mount Zion Missionary Baptist [Church] and that Frank Wilson again who had recorded me on Motown--I was depressed and angry and whole lot of disappointing things had happened in LA.
Speaker 1: About what time is this?  About what year is this?
Speaker 2: This is 1972.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My son's just a year old.  And I'm out there now.  The, the MCA record project went well, but it didn't do what it was supposed to do.  I should have been established then as an artist.  And, I'd even sang a soundtrack for "Willie Dynamite," a movie that Universal [Studios] produced.  I thought that this might be a good living if I could do more soundtracks and establish myself in LA.  But it all like petered out.  Everything got slow.  And so I started attending church and after being re-, reborn was found at a prayer retreat at Frank Wilson's house by Hank Cosby and taken to Fantasy Records where I did my second solo album.  Fantasy p-, produced actually two albums on me, 'We Meet Again' and 'Martha Reeves.'  And, that didn't do so well.  It didn't hit the charts, and it wasn't played.  Then when the contract was cancelled I moved on to Arista Records.  Arista was a good move for me.  It was in New York--complete opposite coast.  And Clive Davis was someone to reckon with.  In the process of my being there, he discovered Melissa Manchester and Barry Manilow and pushed people like Gil Scott-Heron, Al Wilson, and Martha Reeves to the side.  And I had an album produced by six different producers, and that's no way to go.  But it was under his instruction and a couple songs came out of it but nothing of any salability.  And I was back in Detroit [Michigan] then--after, after the Arista I moved back to Detroit and have been here basically working since then.  I've done a couple of the Motown specials, the twenty-fifth and the, as well as the forty-fifth.  Forty-fifth wasn't--I wasn't aired.  I was left on the cutting floor--I don't know why.  But, I've been here and representing Motown Records.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Doing a lot of charitable work, working with United Way [of America], the (unclear) for Children, the Junior Chamber of Commerce, African American museums, just basically--and then working all over the United States singing the Motown sound.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I know there are a lot of the fans all over the country that, you know, just thrilled that you appear.  It's--do you--now you've just produced a CD.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  And--.
Speaker 2: I started a label, Itch [Records] label, and it's distributed now, and it's in all the stores.  I'm learning the business again, another--from the other side.  I'll soon learn how to get it played on the radio, if at all possible.  Or maybe the next effort will be distributed with a company that can get it air-, get airplay.  Whatever, I'm in the business; I'm not out.
Story_ID: 19278
Speaker 1: Have done any work in terms of trying to nurture young talent and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I have ran several programs here in Detroit [Michigan], and I started out in nightclubs, which was not the proper setting for instruction.  I gave talent shows at about six different nightclubs, and each one seemed to be highly and well attended, but people didn't continue.  I guess it was because it was of no, no charge.  The only thing I expected them, them to do is to show up and to actually perform for an audience of people who are well-wishers who could help them develop their talent, which is how Motown did us.  We worked a long time in the Twenty Grand until we were developed as artists so that we could go to other larger establishments and, and in different countries.  We were, you know, we were based here at the Twenty Grand.  And I thought, if some of the talent could get that exposure, that it would be, it would vend a better artist than some of the people you see today.  They have hit records, but they weren't trained in any kind of way to perform or to hold a mike or how to walk on stage or how to present themselves.  Like Mrs. [Maxine] Powell and, and [Charles] Cholly Atkins, Maurice King, and Johnny Allen taught us under Berry's [Berry Gordy] direction, of course, and Mrs. [Esther Gordy] Edward's direction.  And the last one I had was at a Unity church.  I decided that the next one would be at a proper theater, and it'll be one where I'm compensated.  But I would like to give some of the talent that I run into the education that I received at Motown.  I consider it a Motown university 'cause we were instructed.  We weren't just artists who were thrown out there to just do whatever we could.  We had a Motown look, a Motown style, and we were all proud to be a part of the, of the Motown movement.
Story_ID: 19279
Speaker 1: Can you tell us some more detail about how, how the Motown look and attitude and all that was formed by Mrs. [Maxine] Powell and the other people that worked with the, the artist?
Speaker 2: The first girls' group that I remember meeting at Hitsville was The Marvelettes.  And they had a record called 'Mr. Postman' that went to number one immediately.  They were chosen from a, from a talent show in Inkster [Michigan].  They were the winners.  And the prize to WCHB's contest was a recording contract with Motown Records.  And when they went on the road the first time Mrs. Edwards traveled with them and found out that there's a lot of things that artists need to know before you just expose them to other countries and, and different cultures.  And when they returned Berry [Gordy] said, well, we'll get some people to train them.  And the first thing they did was hire chaperones.  These were lovely ladies who'd--Bernice Morrison was my mentor.  They would simply would tell us things like etiquette, you know, protocol and keep us kind of calmed down in gatherings and make sure that none of the men took advantage because that was something very, very dangerous to do--have young ladies traveling with different older men and married men.  And so we had to have some sort of control taken.  And after the chaperones Mrs. Edwards realized there should be more.  And Berry said there's, there's someone who has done this before who could probably show them how.  And he hired Maurice King.  Maurice King taught us to sing ballads and to work the Twenty Grand and to go from the R & B [rhythm and blues] to the standards, graciously--vocally to be able to sing songs like "All the Way" and "People" and then come back and sing our hits and, and have shows that were interesting and, and entertaining--to increase our boundaries.  Then the idea came that we should not just do the street dances 'cause The Temptations were the dancin-est people you ever saw and their choreography was made up by Paul Williams.  And The Marvelettes could really, really dance and they made up their own routines.  But Berry wanted it smoother.  They wanted it, us to go to Broadway.  He wanted us to play the Copacabana.  He wanted us to be on the 'Ed Sullivan Show.'  So he hired [Charles] Cholly Atkins from vaudeville.  And Cholly, who had previously worked with Gladys Knight and the Pips and had them already in that state--they were the smoothest R & B group out on the road.  He wanted more of that style, so they hired the man who was responsible for Gladys Knight and the Pips being that grateful, graceful, and that was Cholly Atkins, himself, of Cole and Atkins dance team from vaudeville.  And then Maurice King hired Johnny Allen who played very, very good keyboard to sit with us--two- to three-hour sessions and teach us songs, teach us the proper way to vocalize.  And the--there's an art with two-part harmony background singing 'cause usually a background is three parts.  But he taught us the art of singing with two parts and blending the third voice around the vocals.  And all of that was necessary.  But when we weren't on the road, we were in the studio.  There was always a session going on--always something or some instruction that you had to catch up with and to be a part of when you were not on the road.
Story_ID: 19280
Speaker 1: What about Mrs. [Maxine] Powell?  Now what--can you tell us something about her?  I mean, you, you're still very close to Mrs. Powell?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  She's my, she's my mentor.  And I'll always admire and love Mrs. Powell for being the first person to ever tell me that I could be beautiful.  And I wondered why would she that, you know, because America and the world has its own standard of beauty.  She said that every person is like a flower.  There are pansies, there are roses, there are petunias, there are carnations, there orchids, lilies.  And each one of us is, is a, is a flower, and we all have inner beauty that she would help us, if we would just lis-, listen to her and to apply the advice she gives us to our own development, that we could become qualified to perform before queens and kings, lords and ladies, which made us all laugh 'cause we had no idea we could be before any king--we just wanted a hit record, wanted to sing and be on the stage.  But she taught us some positive thinking.  She taught us that we weren't the best singers or the most talented people she had ever met, but each one of us could deliver and, and, and develop ourselves into stars.  And she started out by teaching us how to enter a room.  There's a way that you get a, you get a person's attention.  She also told us that if you talk to people directly and not around them that you get a better audience--and little simple things like that.  And she called, she called it personal development.  A lot of people offend her by saying it's a chaperone or etiquette 'cause it's not that.  It's a--she taught us class, which is a--you, you, you're accepted anywhere you go if you just know how, how to, how not to offend, how to be accepted in a crowd, how to communicate--little simple things like that.  But they weren't simple.  And they, the instructions weren't like two days or four days--we spent years with her until there was no longer a, a, a course at Motown.  But we spent years with her getting us to a point where she would be proud of us as a artist.  And she always tells us that she won't teach other people what she taught us so that we might be unique and stand out above other artists.  She said it's something she did for the Gordy family, not necessarily for the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did she teach you to enter a room?
Speaker 2: Well, she said that you should always make sure that you don't stumble in or get in the door and don't come in.  Just approach, you know, one foot in front of the other, stop when you first get there to let everybody know you're in it and then to move to another position.  But you don't come in loud and boisterous.  You don't come in distracting what's going on in the room, but to make your entrance.  And she showed us.  She didn't just tell us.  She demonstrated.  And it works.
Story_ID: 19281
Speaker 1: In today's music world, I mean, popular music today is, I don't know, hip-hop I guess is the most popular music today.  And it seems as though, you know, people in the hip-hop world don't seem to be as concerned about how do they enter a room or, or maybe it's a, maybe it's, there's a hip-hop way to enter in a room, but what do you think about the artists of today?
Speaker 2: My exposure to the hip-hop world has been limited because they're not in my work field.  Anywhere that I go to perform, they're nowhere there.  I've only viewed them as from afar, like TV shows and different programs where they feature a lot of the new acts.  And first of all you can tell that they are not being developed.  They have their own individuality whether it's offensive or not--it doesn't really matter.  Our music was about love and to make people happy and entertained where it might not be the same reason that they're performing or in the songs that they're singing.  The message that they deliver doesn't say exactly promote happiness or healthy thoughts.  Some of our children are being influenced wrongly, and I've even heard three- or four-year-olds curse out their parents.  So their--the music is not the influence that I would encourage--some of them.  However, the youngsters have a message, and it's being delivered.  What the message is or the result of it is, it's questionable.  However, I encourage anyone who betters themselves--if they start out that way and if they take lessons from learned professionals like we did and develop the, whatever their talent is, then that's the reason that they are gifted with the, with the ability or the audience.  It's a privilege to have an audience.  And they, if they don't appreciate their audience, they won't be in the business very long.

Speaker 1: Now you've lived right here in Detroit [Michigan], you know, for a long time and, I mean, you--are you still cool with the community in Detroit and the, you know, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I get along very well.
Speaker 1: You're a person who can go to Europe and you're a big, you know--.
Speaker 2: I get along with, with Detroit very well.  Of late, though, I've seen that anybody that lives here can be di-, di-, distinguished as a Motown act.  And I'm getting a little on e-, on edge about that because there are some of us who are still alive who are responsible for making the Motown sound.  I understand that we derived the name Motown because of Motor City, and it's a name that could be owned by anyone who lives here.  But it's just something that I think should, should have some exclusivity about it.  The--there should be something that distinguishes the actual Motown acts from just anybody who lives in Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the name is appropriated by a lot of people.
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I had strong church connection.  And because of my religious and spiritual beliefs and influences, I'm a good person.  And I'm hoping that our community gets back to the point where the elders of the church make the decisions.  And the elders are not in affect or in control right now.  Lot of the elders are being mistreated and overlooked and misplaced.  However, they do have a place.  The people, the learned people should be, have more to say about our schools because they've been there, done that.  And they should have more to say about how families are conducted.  And they should spend more time with the youth to give them the instruction.  I try to give my time to the junior high schools and elementary schools that, that are asking to inform the children that they need to pay attention to the, the, the teachers.  Everything that I've ever learned, I've used.  They made me desire to ha-, have a better education because I'm sure I could have fared better had I had a little more knowledge of things that I was actually exposed to.  But everything that I ever learned, I, I've used--anything in school.  As far as travel and desires--even to the point of going in the, in the pyramids--I've actually done that in, in Cairo, Egypt.  So, it's all about putting hope in the hearts of the youngsters, letting them know that h-, all however slow life seems, it's just short-lived and have one turnaround and we should do the best we can when we're going through.

Speaker 1: Remembering back at all the things that you've done, is that--do you--is there any major thing that you would, you would have done differently now if you had to do it again?
Speaker 2: I don't think so because everything had a developing stage and everything that I went through was a lesson.  And everything that I have experienced, I've gained knowledge from.  So I wouldn't, I wouldn't change a thing.  As I approach sixty-four I realize that I've got some more living to do and some of my dreams haven't been fulfilled so I'm just gonna dream on and watch and see what God does.
Speaker 1: Okay.  At this juncture, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I have encouraged a lot of youngsters that they can make it.  If I, if I can make it, they can make it, too.  I'm from a humble beginning, a large family, African American, and I made it in spite of, because of.  And cherished every moment of life and busied myself.  I do know that if you're busy and you're never idle, that you can accomplish and achieve anything you want.  So, that's what my legacy should be--to continue, persevere, be strong.

Speaker 1: How did your family feel about your success?  I mean, I know they were glad, but what was their reaction to it?
Speaker 2: I now sing with my two sisters, Lois and Delphine.  And I've also had Eudora, one of my baby sisters, to--it's five girls altogether.  All of them haven't on one occasion sang on stage with me.  My family's very, very happy about my, my entertainment and my stardom.  And I've never left my family.  I've always been able to be there and assist and encourage and con-, and contribute--'cause I never left my family, and they've never left me.
Speaker 1: What happens in a family when someone becomes a big star in a family like this, you know, in a family that size?
Speaker 2: I got a lot of encouragement from my family.  The missed me when I was away, knowing that I had to go and make the sacrifice of doing without them.  And I've taken them with me, so--mamma always said do the best you can what, what you're doing and, baby, when the light goes off, you're off stage.  And that's been my biggest help.

Speaker 1: Okay, now is there anything we haven't asked you that we should have asked you that you--or something that you think you need to address?
Speaker 2: No, I, I think you've been very thorough in, in asking me, and I've expressed a lot of things that I've perhaps repeated with you today.  But I think I've gotten the point across here that it's been a good life.  I'm glad to be a pioneer of the Motown sound.  I met some wonderful people and some have gone on to heaven and I cherish the memory of them.  We were a group.  We're like a--we're very family and we still are.  And, we made history, and it's good to see it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is similar to legacy but, ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember people fondly for the music that they presented and the songs that they sang.  And I sang my songs from my heart, so I'd like to remember the love that I sang in my songs.  I'd like that ha-, to have that remembered.  As far as with my personal life, it's been one of ups and downs and a lot of things have occurred that I wouldn't want remembered.  But, my music, I think, should stand for my life 'cause it has been my life.
