Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interview today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, could you state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Sure, Valerie Bowman Jarrett, V-A-L-E-R-I-E, B-O-W-M-A-N, J-A-R-R-E-T-T [HistoryMaker Valerie Jarrett].
Speaker 1: All right, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 14, 1956, and I was born in Shiraz, Iran.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's sort of unusual.  Can you maybe just give us just a brief explanation why, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yes, it is.  Well, I was born there because my parents [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman and HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] were living there.  My father is a physician, and he decided to go to Iran in the early '50s [1950s], well, mid-'50s [1950s] to help Westernize medicine in Iran.  The shah [Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi] was recruiting American physicians to come over and help start hospitals in some of their smaller provinces.  And my parents were adventuresome spirits, and they decided to go to Iran, and I was the second baby born in the hospital [Nemazee Hospital, Shiraz, Iran] that he helped get started.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, and what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a real estate developer.
Speaker 1: And public servant I guess in a number of capacities?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I serve on a variety of different civic and not-for-profit boards.  The University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], the--I chair of the University of Chicago Medical Center [Chicago, Illinois], Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois], Window to the World Communications [Window to the World Communications, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], and the list goes on, local initiatives in Ford corporation [ph.].  I'm very involved in the civic and philanthropic community here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: All right.  And an attorney by trade?
Speaker 2: I'm an attorney trade.  I practiced law for ten years.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Good question.  I have no idea (laughter).  You tell me (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think the 13th.  Does that sound right?
Speaker 2: Is it the 13th of December?  We'll call it the 13th of December in 2006.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in my office here at The Habitat Company [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 639612
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that I'm compelled to ask everyone--
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: The first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do, ice cream.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you a favorite--
Speaker 2: That was easy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue, also easy.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Somewhere warm--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --anywhere warm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Of late, yes, I say, "And that is that" 'cause it seems as though we debate a lot of different issues.  And when I get tired of debating, and it's a joke between my daughter [Laura Jarrett] and me.  I just say, "And that is that," and that means I don't wanna have any more conversation on that subject.  And I'm now, using it at work.  People don't like it so much at work (laughter).
Story_ID: 639613
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] side.  But we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes, Barbara Taylor Bowman, B-A-R-B-A-R-A, T-A-Y-L-O-R, B-O-W-M-A-N [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born here in Chicago, Illinois.  She was born on October 30, 1928.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, I probably can go as far back as my great-grandmother.  I was very close with my grandmother [Laura Jennings Vaughn], my mother's mother.  My mother's father died when I was only six months old.  So I didn't know him at all though certainly, our lives have taken certain parallels.  So I feel close to him even though I never knew him.  But my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  And he was, or I guess we should mention who he was.
Speaker 2: He was Robert R. Taylor [Robert Rochon Taylor].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so my grandmother died about ten years ago, and she lived around the corner from us so I knew her my entire life.  During the time I was in Iran, she would often come over and visit us.  She was there for my birth.  She was there at least a couple other times while we were growing up and traveled with us throughout the world.  My father's career required him to travel a great deal, and my grandmother always came along.  So I was very, very close to my maternal grandmother.
Speaker 1: Now, are there any stories passed down from, on your mother's side of the family about--is there a tradition that they're from somewhere other than Chicago, further south?
Speaker 2: Well, my parents, my mom, her father was from Tuskegee, Alabama, and her grandfather [Robert Robinson Taylor] was the architect who designed the campus [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And he was the first African American to get a degree from MIT university [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And so their legacy really goes back to Tuskegee, and then my grandfather is really the one that moved to Chicago, and that's where he met my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Are there any good stories that are passed down?
Speaker 2: Oh, there're so many stories.  It's hard to say.  I will say a lot in our family revolves around eating (laughter), and the kitchen and maybe that comes from coming from the South where everything revolves around the meal.  And it's one way of showing hospitality.  So in our family, you know, holidays are very important.  Sunday afternoons are very important.  We've always kind of devoted Sunday afternoon and evening to family time and no matter how busy we are, we always try to have dinner together.  And that's something that started with my [maternal] grandmother [Laura Jennings Vaughn].  And my guess is, is it goes, you know, far before her.  So the importance of breaking bread and sitting together as a family and having conversation and everyone feeling, you know, loved and comfortable is certainly a part of our tradition.
Story_ID: 639614
Speaker 1: What are your impressions of how your mother [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman] grew up?  Did she talk about how she grew up and what did you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, she talks about it a great deal.  My mom's very smart, and I think her father [Robert Rochon Taylor] recognized enormous potential in her, and so they lived here in Chicago [Illinois] in the Rosenwald building [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments] at 46th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue].  And she was attending public school.  And his, his, I guess his parents, who were then in Tuskegee [Alabama], particularly, his gra- his father [Robert Robinson Taylor], decided that it was important to send his sister to--wait a minute.  Which generation am I--there's so many generations.  I guess what I was trying to say is my grandfather decided that it was important, based on a conversation with his sister to send my mother to a prep school, Northfield Mount Hermon in Massachusetts [Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts].  And he based that because his--he had a conversation with his sister who lived in Tuskegee, and she was sending her daughter there.  And her daughter was a year older than my mother.  And so the two of them went off to boarding school at the age of fifteen to really an excellent school on the East Coast which was rather atypical in the black community back then.  And then, in the next generation, I attended the same boarding school, together with my mother's sister's son [Jeffrey A. Dugas, Sr.] and several of my cousins.  We were, there were about four of us there all at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: So education, my point was, I guess education--she was brought up to value the importance of education and hard work, and I think, you know, my grandmother [Laura Jennings Vaughn] was the traditional stay-at-home mom, but my grandfather recognized in my mother some potential and really cultivated it.  So it was kind of, promoted her to have an independent career of her own.  And then my father [HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] was very supportive of my mother's career, and although there were times when she made decisions to do what was in the best interest of his career, perhaps more than any man in his generation, I think he was kind of a man before his time in recognizing the importance of parity in a relationship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that started with my grandfather, really helping to make my mother pretty independent.
Speaker 1: Right, I remember your mother talking about her father reminded her of her responsibility to the community--
Speaker 2: Well, there was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) of that being an important part of--
Speaker 2: --the sense of civic responsibility and, you know, the saying that to those who much is given, much is expected [Luke 12:48], certainly started with my great-grandfather as far back as I know.  And, you know, we were all raised to say that, you know, to the degree life is good to you, you have a responsibility to give something back.  And my grandfather and my mother--I don't know if she told you this story, used to wake up in the middle of the night and sit around the kitchen table eating and it was just the two of them.  And to this day, my mother wakes up in the middle of the night and I'm sure misses her dad.  And I think that's where they had a lot of those conversations about life and what he expected her to do and what her potential was, and then also what responsibility went along with that potential.
Story_ID: 639615
Speaker 1: Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, James Edward Bowman [HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman].
Speaker 1: And what's his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Novem- I'm sorry, February 5, 1923, and he was born in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: All right.  What do you know about his side of the family?  I mean how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: I can go back to his parents.  His father [James Bowman, Sr.] was dentist.  His mom [Dorothy Peterson Bowman] was a homemaker, and they lived in Washington.  And so at that time, it was pretty unusual, I think, to have an African American who was a dentist.  And he had a very successful practice in D.C.  And my father is oldest of five.  And so, and all of his siblings were really brought up to have sense of self-reliance, different than my mother's [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman] family.  And so my grandfather insisted that they all work through school.  So my father worked his way through college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and medical school, and really took care of himself.  And I think, you know, his siblings followed suit.  So they, he was really kind of a task master on controlling your own destiny.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where did they go to medical school?
Speaker 2: Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Are there any stories from your father's side of the family you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Well, unfortunately, his mom died when he was a young adult, and I think, you know--what I remember him telling me most as a child, cause there were so many kids and contrasting with me who's an only child, and he would always tell stories about, again, sitting around the dinner table.  And he's a very fast eater.  My father and I both eat really, really quickly.  And he'd say, and people would always tease him about why you eat so quickly.  And he'd say, in our family you had to eat fast if you wanted to get fed.  And so, I think that, you know, he had the advantage of having a lot of siblings and so there was always a lot of activity.  But again, they came together at mealtime, and I think that that was a priority for them.
Story_ID: 639616
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story that's passed down about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, did they tell you the story?  My mother tells a two-minute version.  My father takes about three hours (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, what's the version that you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right, I'll tell you this version.  I'll try not to make it the three-hour version.  All right, so, in the '40s [1940s], my dad was in medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], and he would come to Chicago [Illinois] for parties.  He had friends who were from Chicago, and so he visited Chicago, and he was gonna go, gonna go to a party.  And he was looking for a date to the party, and so he had a good friend who suggested that he call on Lauranita Taylor [HistoryMaker Lauranita Dugas], and Lauranita Taylor is my mother's sister.  And so he called and he made a date to take her to this party.  And then another friend of his said, "Oh, you don't wanna take Lauranita Taylor.  She's not pretty at all."  And my father says, "Really?" and he goes, "No, I wouldn't take her.  You're gonna be so embarrassed if you take her out."  So my father broke the date, and--which was a terrible thing to do.  So fast forward, he then finds out later that the reason why the second friend said break the date is 'cause Lauranita is gorgeous and he wanted to have a relationship with her.  And so he was discouraging my father and any other potential suitors from having anything to do with her.  Well, when my father found this out, of course, he was mortified.  And he should have been mortified that he broke the date.  So he comes back to Chicago, oh, I don't know.  It must have been at least a year later.  And at this point in time, my mother is I suppose about a junior in college [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York].  And so she's home.  And meanwhile, my aunt had since become engaged and was getting ready to get married the following year.  So my dad call the house, and he says to my grandmother [Laura Jennings Vaughn], you know, "My name is James Bowman [HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman], and I had heard of your daughter a couple year- a year or so ago.  And I called and unfortunately, you know, I broke the date.  It was a terrible thing."  He kind of fessed up to my grandmother, and he said, "but I was wondering is Lauranita home.  I'd like to take her out and make up for it."  And so my grandmother paused, and she said, "Lauranita's not here, but Barbara's here."  And so my father said, "Oh," well so, of course, he's stuck then.  He couldn't break that one.  So he said, "Well, I'll be happy to take out Barbara [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman]."  And the rest is history.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So my grandmother gets full credit for having gotten the two of them together.
Story_ID: 639617
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I have wonderful memories of living in Shiraz, Iran.  We lived on a hospital compound and adjacent, you know, to the--so our homes were right next to the hospital [Nemazee Hospital, Shiraz, Iran] that my father [HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] helped put together.  And I learned to swim before I learned to walk.  And there was a swimming pool on the compound, and so some of my fondest memories are swimming in the pool, and I had a Belgian Shepherd dog who followed everywhere.  My parents got the dog a few months before I was born.  And he was my protector.  And we used to just walk around the compound together, and people would joke and say if I fell down and hurt myself no one could help me because the dog would stand guard over me.  And my parents had very, very close friends there, and they had a daughter who was a little younger than I am.  And so the two of us were just, we felt like we owned the world, and it was safe, and it was secure.  And we just, you could roam around and, wonderful ex-, wonderful memories.
Speaker 1: Now, how long did you live in Iran?
Speaker 2: We lived there until I was five.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we moved to London [England] for a year, and then we--my father joined the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and we came back here.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so you grew up in three places, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and then we went back to Iran frequently until, 1974 is the last year I visited Iran was the year I graduated from high school [Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 639618
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the sights, my favorite sight was Persepolis, which is a ruin outside of Shiraz [Iran], and we used to call it my playground, and we would go and wander around there and look at all of these ancient, you know, figures and gives you a sense of history, of the history of Iran, and, you know, going back hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years.
Speaker 1: Were these ruins of the Persian Empire, or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, exactly.  And so that we have lots of pictures of me posing at Persepolis, and it would be at--you know, the kids in Chicago [Illinois] might have gone to Great America [sic.] back then, and my playground was Persepolis.  Sounds would probably be, hm, that's a, that's an interesting one.  I would say, my memory is that it's quiet 'cause it's, you know, it was an undeveloped area.  There weren't a lot of cars.  My mother [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman] was the first woman to get a driver's license in the City of Shiraz.  She may have mentioned that to you.  So I remember just kind of peaceful and quiet.  And smells would be smells of spices.  They have bazaars, and so you go into the bazaar, and you'd smell all these different kinds of spices.  That's one memory.  My other clear memory is the smell of red clay, which is what the ground was made of.  And it's a wonderful smell.  So any time I go to the Middle East or to Africa, you know, the wind blows and you smell this red clay, it reminds me of my childhood.
Speaker 1: Or Georgia.
Speaker 2: Probably so.  I haven't spent enough time in Georgia.  So you know the smell.  It's a wonderful smell (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, well, you know, there's a tradition in the black community where some women when they're pregnant call for this red dirt so they can eat it--
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: --in the black community, yeah.  They (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it's a wonderful smell.  So I'd say the spices at the bazaar and red clay are my two fondest smells.
Story_ID: 639619
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself growing up?  I mean what kind of a little girl were you?
Speaker 2: Well, that's an interesting question.  Perfect, I would say (laughter).  My mother [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman] might disagree with that.  You know, I was, to be really candid with you, I was in my own world.  And I think it's because I was an only child, and I spent a great deal of time traveling with my parents.  And I would just kind of be in my own little fantasy world, and living--when we moved back to Chicago [Illinois], my mother has, at that point, she had four, well, she had a sister [HistoryMaker Lauranita Dugas] and three cousins who lived within about a three-block area of our home and their families.  So there were about thirty of us.  And so I kind of had the advantage of having so many cousins, and there were seven or eight of us the same age.  And so I'd kind of roam, we would all roam from home to home and eat meals at different places and spend the night at different places.  And, you know, we had no idea our parents were communicating our every move.  We thought we were just roaming around.  So that was, you know, really kind of a wonderful combination of being an only child, but yet having this extended family.  But I think I was pretty self-sufficient and self-contained as a child.  And I didn't, I enjoyed interaction, but I was very used to being by myself.  And so I have friends who can't be alone, and I have no problem with being alone.  I'm pretty content.  But yet, I still enjoy relationships, and I think it was coming from this kind of combined only child, extended family upbringing.
Story_ID: 639620
Speaker 1: How did you deal with questions of identity as a small child--and well, you were so young in Iran, I don't know if that was a question or not, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, part of the reason my parents [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman and HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] moved back here--it didn't really affect me whatsoever, but they felt it was hard to raise this little black child in a Muslim country where people had servants and it was kind of con- they thought I was getting a confused upbringing.  I don't, I don't know, I--maybe kids are, they adjust pretty well.  I think having grown up in the Middle East and then England and then Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], gave me a perspective on the world and a perspective on people that is pretty unique.  And my father traveled extensively with us throughout Africa and Mexico and the Far East, and I guess I--and I wish I had the opportunity to do that with my daughter [Laura Jarrett] to the degree my parents did because I think it gives you a sense of self that, you know, the people in the United States would rather think of themselves and the United States as rather self-important.  And I think it helps you understand, you know, where you fall in the total scheme of things.  But I also think it gives you a sense of people and that they really are pretty similar the world over, and I think I am comfortable sitting down talking to, you know, the residents that I work with who live in public housing and connecting with them.  And I'm perfectly happy to have a conversation with the leader of the free world, president of the United States.  And I think, you know, I've been to villages in the poorest parts of Africa and played with the kids while my father was doing his work.  And, you know, I've played with people who were, you know, related to royalty so--and everyone in between.  And I think that world-rounded experience certainly shapes you.  And it's probably better for other people to say how it shapes you, but it certainly gives you a level of comfort with all kinds of people which I think is important.
Story_ID: 639621
Speaker 1: Can you maybe compare and contrast the--how your, the I guess the principle identifier that you think people used to identify you in Iran, London [England] and here?
Speaker 2: The people who are in all those different places?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean how do they really per- I mean were you perceived more as a Christian or an American or a, you know, I mean in Iran say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I would say in Iran we were definitely perceived as American, and, you know, the whole Western world was kind of a foreign land.  And America, in a sense, at that point, because the shah [Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi] was so big on Westernizing the country, we were considered so fortunate to have come from the United States, and that all the good things, you know, many of the good things were in the United States.  And it wasn't, you know, insulting their own heritage, but it was just saying they had so ma- particularly, in medicine and housing or so many areas where the Western world was considered to have advantages.  And, you know, I think their sense was people lived better in the United States, the overall quality of life was better in the United States than it was in Iran.  And so from that perspective, they probably envied us to some degree, but yet, as you see in time, that envy turned into, you know, kind of hatred towards the United States, at least at the government level.  But I don't think the people of Iran necessarily embrace what the government thinks, which is another whole subject matter.  And in London I think they probably looked at us more as peers, you know, peer countries, both of them developed countries.  And so that part of it is the difference between an underdeveloped and a developed country.  And in the United States I think because I had so many advantages that a lot of African Americans didn't have, you know, having parents [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman and HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] and grandparents who went to college and graduate school and growing up in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], which was always considered, you know, a good community, a strong community, attending the University of Chicago Laboratory School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] versus public school and going on to prep school [Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] and Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and Michigan for law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  So I think people thought I had a lot of advantages--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I did.  I was very fortunate.
Story_ID: 639622
Speaker 1: Was there a sense that you were an African American in Britain or in Iran?
Speaker 2: No, and I think part of it was how I looked, and so I didn't have--I, I probably was not perceived as being an African American, and I can--and even coming back to Chicago [Illinois], you know, when I first came back here we lived with my [maternal] grandmother [Laura Jennings Vaughn] until we got our own place.  And I started attending public school.  And they thought I was white.  And so I remember I would get beat up for fair skinned, and it was--and then I got beat up because I was young because in Ir- in England, really the education system was really very advanced.  And so when I came here, they kept skipping me in grades, and so, you know, I was young and I was fair skinned and I just kept, every, just kept getting beat up in school all the time.  It was like I couldn't do anything right.  And so I think it took me a while to get comfortable with who I was and to be able to say, you know, I may not look exactly like you, and I may not be brought up just exactly like you, but I'm still a person.  And so I think part of what gave me the strength to deal with that kind of pushback was having lived all over the world, and knowing in my own self that I was just like everybody else.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I know for African Americans, lighter skinned African Americans sometimes are, it's counter intuitive to identify--you know, their identity is almost counter to say, well, this person is black, well, you say, are you (unclear), so and oftentimes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, how black are you really if you look like that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oftentimes parents have to tell the children who they are at a certain point cause they, the other--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They don't know.
Speaker 1: --children don't know who they are, and they don't know either.
Speaker 2: I think that was a big problem.
Speaker 1: Was there a point when they had to actually tell you, said, look, you're an African American or you're a Negro or whatever they were saying in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sure there was and what that meant cause I don't remember, you know, that happening, but I'm sure it happened because again, it was a part of why my parents [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman and HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] moved back here is they think that I, they thought that I wasn't getting that kind of heritage and culture that I needed.  And I think I probably was confused for a while.  But again, as I said, it didn't, it didn't like register that much because I had this own little world that I would kind of retreat into.  And so I remember being upset that I got beat up but not so much why I was getting beat up, but just that I got beat up.  I don't think I, I really didn't care that much why (laughter), I just knew that I was in trouble.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the beating up hurts worse than the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, why they we- it was immaterial.  I knew it was nothing I could do about.  And so I remember the sense of helplessness.  And I remember, I have a younger cousin who was in school and she would come and try to fight with me.  And she was brown skinned, and so they kind of stayed away when she came to my defense.  So she was kind of my armor.  So it's complicated, it's complicated.  And I had an English accent when I first came back here, and I lost that English accent quick.  I thought well, this isn't going over (laughter).  So children adjust, and I think that's the part of, if you're well-loved and you're nurtured, and your parents keep telling you you're okay, you just, you adjust to the environment around you.  And it doesn't, it doesn't make you lose your sense of self.
Speaker 1: Was coming back to the United States a culture shock at all?
Speaker 2: I'm sure it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sure it was in a lot of ways.  But again, you know, as long as my parents were there, and I think this is probably what was most important to me growing up, is--because it can be very destabilizing I think traveling as much as we did, but I always had my parents and I always felt well loved, and I always felt that they were gonna look after me.  And so it didn't really matter where we were.  Wherever we were, that was home, and, you know, I love Chicago now, and I can't imagine really moving somewhere else, but if a circumstance came up and I had to move back to Iran or I had an opportunity, I would do that in a moment.  So I think I'm much more attached to people than I am to places.

Speaker 1: Tell us about school.  Now, you started school in Iran?
Speaker 2: I started in Iran, yeah, preschool in Iran.  And then same thing in, when we lived in, in London [England], and then I--we came back here, and I started out I think like the first day in kindergarten, and by the end of the first day I was in second grade.
Speaker 1: I like to ask the names of the schools, so can you give us the names of the school in Iran (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, gosh, in Iran, I couldn't tell you.  In England it was Tetherdown elementary school [Tetherdown Primary School, London, England].
Speaker 1: Tetherdown?
Speaker 2: Tetherdown.
Speaker 1: Is it spelled the way it sounds?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, just the way it sounds, Tetherdown.  And then in Chicago [Illinois], Shoesmith Elementary School [Beulah Shoesmith Elementary School].
Speaker 1: Shoesmith, that's S-H-U?
Speaker 2: Shoesmith, just a--S-H-O-E--
Speaker 1: O-E, okay.
Speaker 2: --Smith Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Is that a public school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was the elementary school to Kenwood High School [Kenwood Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, yeah, that's the one.  Right, I've seen the building for it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, it's still there right at 50th [Street] and Kenwood [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  Well--
Speaker 2: And then the Lab Schools [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: I usually ask people if they liked school, but I tend to think you probably--well, how much did you like school (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I liked it.  I didn't like it as much as my daughter [Laura Jarrett] likes it.  She really likes school.  But I liked it.  I was always a pretty, you know, a pretty good student.  Sometimes I worked harder than other times.  But I enjoyed school.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject matter in school?
Speaker 2: Hm, did I have a favorite subject matter?  In the lower school, I would say geography because I figured I had a head start on everybody so I really liked geography a lot 'cause I knew the world.  And I would say in high school [Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts], anthropology.  In fact, I intended to be an anthropologist when I first went to college [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  And then in college, I majored in psychology, but my favorite subject was statistics.  I was actually really good at that.  It's amazing how we tend to gravitate towards things that you have some aptitude in.  So kind of all over.
Story_ID: 639624
Speaker 1: Were there any particular experiences in grade school that stand out right now?
Speaker 2: I was on the Grand Prize Game of 'Bozo's Circus' ['The Bozo Show'].  That was a big deal back then.  Do you remember 'Bozo's Circus'?  You remember the Grand Prize Game?  Well, I was selected for the Grand Prize Game.
Speaker 1: That's with the buckets and the (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You got that right.  That was the highlight of my youth (laughter).  And the only person who saw me on TV was one of my cousins who was home sick that day 'cause I can--I don't know why it's such a wonderful memory other than everybody loved the Grand Prize Game.  I only got to bucket number three and I remember Bun candy bars and stockings for my mom [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman] and pirates of something was the game I won.  And I remember walking home from school--my mother used to always meet me half way from between our house and the school.  And here I am carrying all this stuff, and I remember being just so proud of myself.  And she's like, "What did you do?"  And I was like, "I was on the Grand Prize Game."  So that was my first television debut at the age of eight.
Speaker 1: 'Bozo's Circus.'
Speaker 2: 'Bozo's Circus' is on the air, and they had these little arrows that would go through the audience, and I can remember thinking that arrow's gonna stop on me.  And why I thought that, I don't know.  And when it stopped on me, I remember thinking, I knew that (laughter).  And then, of course, I had to get up there and actually do something, I was a nervous wreck.  But it was, that was fun.
Story_ID: 639625
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers in grade school that stand out that you remember that--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had two really good teachers.  I had Mrs. Wheeler [ph.] at Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois], my first year at Lab.  And that was a big transition going from public school [Beulah Shoesmith Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] to private school.
Speaker 1: And what year did you do that?
Speaker 2: Fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Fourth grade, okay.
Speaker 2: And she was, I don't know.  She sensed something in me, and she decided I needed a year to just kind of pause and find my way.  And so I played chess the whole year.  My mother [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman], to this day, goes, I can't believe Mrs. Wheeler let you play chess the whole time.  That's all I did in fourth grade.  And she just said, you know what, academically, she'll be fine.  She's, chess is something that she's good at and she'll find peers who play chess, and they'll have--they'll come together around that.  And that's really my only memory from fourth grade, but I loved Mrs. Wheeler 'cause she let me do what I wanted to do.  And I think, you know, in the end, she was right.  I needed that year of transition, and I needed to feel like I had some control and some success.  And so that was, that was what she let me do.  And she just retired about, I don't know, maybe ten years ago (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm not an educator, but I'm grasping here.  Was that like a Montessori [Maria Montessori] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: A little bit, a little Montessori was in here.  Dewey [John Dewey] was the founder of Lab School and was very much, you know, bring out the best in each child and give them a sense of community and a lifelong appreciation for learning and how you play that out, you know, you have the freedom to explore it as you wish within some, some boundaries.  So Mrs. Wheeler was great.  Who else was particularly, yeah, well, I'd say Ms. Wheeler was probably the best.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was the chess (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, you know, and she talked to me a lot I remember.  You know, I have memories of just sitting down with Mrs. Wheeler having conversations.  I'm sure there was some method to her madness, but I just thought she took an interest in me, and that was important to me.
Story_ID: 639626
Speaker 1: Now, you went to high school at the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I stayed at Lab, and then I went, my last two years I went to Northfield Mount Hermon [Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  What is that?
Speaker 2: Northfield Mount Hermon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's here in the Chicago [Illinois] area?
Speaker 2: That's in Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Massachusetts?  All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's the same school my mother [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman] went to, prep school, boarding school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So for the last two years of high school you were there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I graduated from there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you have any special teachers or mentors in high school?
Speaker 2: High school's a bit of a fog to me.  I had, I'm trying to think.  You know what, I'm blocking her name.  I did have one professor at Northfield Mount Hermon who's the one, who taught anthropology, and I remember going to her to try to figure out what college to go to.  And I was choosing between Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] and Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  And I really wanted to go to Stanford, but my parents were, my mother--not so much my dad [HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman], was encouraging me to go to Wellesley 'cause she went to Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York] and so she appreciated, you know, a small liberal arts college, all-girls college.  And I was thinking West Coast, warm weather, big school.  And I remember going to this, this teacher, and she said to me, and she knew I had an interest in anthropology, and Jane Goodall who was a famous anthropologist was at Stanford.  And so she said, "Well, whether you do anthropology or not," she said, "if you go to Wellesley, you're gonna get a great education.  You're gonna have a wonderful experience and it's gonna be very predictable."  And she said, "If you go to Stanford, the sky's the limit.  You can go in a hundred different directions."  And so I liked that, and I thought it was kind of a liberating piece of advice.  And she said, "I can't tell you which path to choose.  You have to figure out, you know, what do you want?"  But I'll never forget that conversation 'cause I thought, well, I'm going to Stanford (laughter).  That's what I want to do.
Story_ID: 639627
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about, I guess about when you were growing up, I mean, well, you've been involved in a lot of civic activity--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as a, as an adult, when you were growing up were you particularly aware of the political or civic life in the city?
Speaker 2: Not at all.  As I said, I was really in my own world.  I couldn't have told you who the local alderman was.  I knew who the mayor was but just because my--
Speaker 1: He'd been mayor so long.
Speaker 2: Well, I went to some event where he was there.  I think before that event, I wouldn't have known who he was.  I remember people saying, "Well, there's Mayor Daley [Richard J. Daley]," and I thought, okay, there's Mayor Daley, but it was of no significance to me at all.  It didn't affect my world one bit.
Speaker 1: Were you aware of the Civil Rights Movement, I mean with any kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, oh, that's different.  Absolutely, growing up in Chicago [Illinois], I was here during the Democratic Convention [1968 Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois].  Actually, we weren't physically here.  We were overseas, but we were living in Chicago at the time.  We were just traveling at the time, and one of my cousins who was down in front of the Hilton Hotel [Conrad Hilton Hotel; Hilton Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] during the riots was hit in the head.  And I remember coming home and being really angry that anyone would have hit my cousin in the head.  And I couldn't understand, you know, and so I was just, I remember being just furious at kind of the injustice of this while he was out there protesting, that the police would have done this to him.  So I was very aware of the death of Martin Luther [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy].  And the night before Bobby Kennedy died, I put a poster for him up in my room, and that was the first time I remember having any kind of, you know, national, political awareness whatsoever.  By the time I put that poster up, I had no local idea at all about what was going on.
Speaker 1: So you were about twelve then, I guess?
Speaker 2: No, he died in sixty--yeah, it was '68 [1968].  So I guess I would have been twelve.  I was thinking eleven, going on twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So probably, so by then, but in my younger childhood, absolutely none whatsoever.  And again, it was just really reserved for national politics at that level.
Story_ID: 639628
Speaker 1: You decide to go to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, and to major in anthropology--that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was my intent going in.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I had several evolutions while I was there.  I started with anthropology and then pre-med.  That lasted through organic chemistry, and then I came to an abrupt halt.  Plus, I went to an anatomy class.  I had a friend who was a medical student, and so he took me to his anatomy class where they were dissecting a cadaver.  And I remember looking at those cadavers and thinking I can't do this.  And so that was about the end of medical school.
Speaker 1: Did your father [HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] encourage you to become a doctor?
Speaker 2: Not at all.  He did not want me to be a doctor at all.  He didn't articulate that until after I said I didn't wanna go.  But once I said I didn't wanna go, he was relieved.  My parents were really--I mean part of their approach was, you know, do whatever you wanna do.  And, you know, my mother [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman] said--she said going to a liberal arts college was great, but I could go anywhere I wanted to go.  And so it was kind of a combination of sharing their judgment but without any pressure to follow that judgment, but really to do what I thought was gonna make me most happy.  So, you know, she says that I don't listen to her.  But I did, I very well remember her advice.  It's just that I decided to go a different path.  So, no, he was not disappointed.  He said to me, "I'm relieved."  He thought medical school was--is unnecessarily hard and rigorous and dehumanizing, and so I think, you know, he would have preferred for me to have a different path.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I think on balance, he's pleased with the way things turned out.
Speaker 1: That's interesting 'cause you never hear, you know, you rarely hear that side of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, no, he thought it was very abusive.  That's probably the best word to describe it.
Speaker 1: At the time he went to Howard that was in the glory days of Howard University medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were really, really unnecessarily abusive, he would say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, staying up all night and all of that.  So--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I often wondered why they have to do that to--
Speaker 2: It's crazy.  It's a rite of passage.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems more like a rite of passage.
Speaker 2: It is, it is.  So he didn't like any of that. But, you know, enjoyed being a physician, but the way to get there he thought was, not the way it should be.
Speaker 1: So you didn't, what discouraged you from anthropology (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened, in the summer before I started at Stanford, Jane Goodall had a dig in Tanzania, I think it was, and her, several of her students were kidnapped.  She flew, and left the students.  They were kidnapped.  So they closed down the dig.  The students were released and everyone was safe and sound.  But I remember being a little upset with her that she (laughter) left the students.  But anyway, they closed down the dig, and then I got to Stanford and I took anthropology and I enjoyed it.  And I just got distracted, I guess.  I started taking some psychology courses.  I had a fabulous psychology professor.  And he sparked my interest, and after that I just started gravitating towards psychology.  I wish I could tell you it had a lot of, you know, disciplined thought.  It didn't.  I just drifted.
Speaker 1: Now, were you--just thinking about Jane Goodall, were you interested in primates or animals at all, or--?
Speaker 2: I was interested in all of it.  I was interested in the history of it.  I had, I mean my fantasy was to go on a, have a dig and be out there, similar to Iran, probably with Persepolis.  And when I think about it now for the first time, that left such an impression on me, and, you know, just studying history and being right out there and discovering.
Speaker 1: Were there a number of anthropologists always out there digging in Persepolis (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Well, I don't know that they were digging, but you saw the results of their digging, which was Persepolis.  So they had uncovered this city, and so I think that's probably what originally sparked my interests.  And then having a good teacher in high school [Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] who helped me, you know, appreciate where we are in the continuum, I think was interesting to me.  But, as I said, I was easily distracted.
Story_ID: 639629
Speaker 1: Well okay, well psychology, you, so you sort of leaned toward psychology, got involved in psychology.  What was it about psy- psychology that attracted you to it?
Speaker 2: Understanding how the mind works, people, dynamics, just--and as I said, a series of really good professors.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, who were some of the professors that you appreciated the most?
Speaker 2: Zimbardo [Philip Zimbardo] was my first professor who, I'll never forget the last day of class and he said, "This is our last day.  Go out into the world and do something with yourself."  And the (laughter) way he said was just so, I remember having kind of goose bumps, and I was so sad to think this was the last day with him.  And it was his way of saying goodbye, but kind of pushing us that one last step.  And then I had a fascinating class in sleep and dreams with a Professor Dement [William C. Dement], who's world-renowned figure, and I thought that was, that subject was fascinating to me, just what happens while we're asleep.  You know, so much of our life we spend asleep.  And he had, and still does, enormous research in the area.  So those are probably my two favorite overall.  And then one, one interesting professor I had who was a teaching assistant at the time, my freshman year, was Scott Turow, and--the author.  And he was doing graduate work at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  And so our paths are strangely connected.  I had him as a professor at Stanford, and then when I started practicing--not when I started, but after several years of practicing law, he joined the law firm where I was practicing, literally the week I was leaving the law firm.  And now, he's a trustee at Amherst [Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts] where my daughter [Laura Jarrett] attends school.  And my daughter was able to recruit his youngest daughter to go to Stanford.  And they're now good friends.  So Scott and I, our paths just keep crossing.  But I always say to him, the least you could have done was to have taught me to be as good of a writer as you are so that I could be as wealthy as you are now (laughter).  He didn't impart that skill to me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, he's really--
Speaker 2: He's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) sold a lot of books, yeah, Scott Turow.
Speaker 2: He sure has sold a lot of books.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: He really has.
Story_ID: 639630
Speaker 1: Okay, so, what was social life like at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California]?
Speaker 2: Wonderful.  We had a good time, far too, too good a time probably, considering.  I lived in, they called it the Black House, and it was a dorm that was made up of 50 percent black people and 50 percent something else.  And my parents [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman and HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] were very unhappy about that 'cause you had a choice.  They sent you a survey as you were making your room selections, going into your freshman year, and it said, do you wanna live in this dorm or do you wanna live just anywhere else?  And my parents said, "You grew up in a black house.  Why are you going to Stanford to live in a black house?"  And I think because I had been at Northfield [Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] which was, you know, predominantly white and I just was looking for a different experience.  And in retrospect, it was probably a mistake because I think I ended up limiting myself to a smaller circle of friends than perhaps I should have, given that I was at this huge university.  And I think I could have, my best friend didn't live in the Black House.  She lived somewhere else, but she was always coming over.  And I think she probably had the best of both worlds.  And I think that, you know, the whole point in being at a university like that is to take full advantage of every single piece of that university, and I don't think I took nearly as much advantage of it as I could.  In fact, last night, I was at a dinner with Miles White [Miles D. White] who's the chairman of Abbott Laboratories.  And he had been reading a Stanford alumni journal [Stanford Magazine], and he chairs the board of the Federal Reserve Bank [Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And I'm on the Federal Reserve Bank, so we've known each other for a while.  And he said, "You and I were in the same class at Stanford," and he said, "I bet we knew a bunch of the same people."  And I was thinking to myself, I bet we know none of the same people 'cause I really kind of limited myself.  And I didn't even know him, and he said he remembered me.  And, you know, it seemed kind of--it was an indication of really how insular I was throughout that experience, and I regret that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you don't think that being in the Black House intensified your understanding of the black community any at all?
Speaker 2: It did not.  I think my parents were right.  I grew up in a black house.  I think I had a great time.  I think I made, you know, good friends.  We had wonderful parties.  We all ate together and there was a sense of camaraderie which was important, but did I really need that in order to have a fulfilled college experience?  No, I think I could have had both.  I guess that's really what I'm saying.  I think I could have had the advantages of having a cohesive population of African American students. And we did have, you know, a pretty appreciable number for comparable schools that size.  But I think I missed out on the broader experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is about 1970 or--
Speaker 2: Four [1974], I started, in '78 [1978] I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, '74 [1974].  Were there issues on campus that black students were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, our big issue, our only demonstration I remember was against apartheid trying to encourage Stanford to divest, which they did not.  But most of the unrest of the '60s [1960s] was pretty much done.  The Vietnam War was over, and it's interesting, you know, I think about when my older cousins were in college, drugs were really big.  And there was, I mean it was very little drug activity, at least among my circle of friends, there was none.  And so, it was, kind of the crazy '60s [1960s] was over, and it was the rather more subdued '70s [1970s].
Story_ID: 639631
Speaker 1: So when you, when you were on the verge of graduating from Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], did you know what your next step was gonna be?
Speaker 2: Nope, no idea.  Unfortunately, my senior year I signed up for the GRE [Graduate Record Examination] thinking of going to graduate school in psychology.  I signed for the GMATs [Graduate Management Admission Test], maybe I'd go to business school.  I signed up for the LSATs, maybe I'd go to law school.  My best friend had gone to law school.  And she said, if you don't know what to do, go on and go to law school because you can always go do something else.  And I, my father [HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] wasn't much on me going into psychology.  He thought if I wanted to really, you know, if I really was focusing on the mind, I should go and become a psychiatrist and go to medical school and that psychologists weren't taken seriously the way psychiatrists are.  And so he was kind of pooh-poohing my clinical psychology idea.  And I didn't really care that much, you know.  I have to tell you.  I couldn't have been any less ambitious.  I couldn't have been any less driven in a particular direction.  And so, I thought well, law school buys me some time to figure out what I wanna to do.  So off to law school I went.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where did you go to law school?
Speaker 2: The University of Michigan [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, why did you choose University of Michigan?
Speaker 2: It was rated number two at the time, so it was the best school I got in.
Story_ID: 639632
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Michigan [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], through no fault of its own, was a pretty, freshma- my first year, it was a pretty tough experience.  I think I went in, as I have gone into a lot of experiences in life thinking they must have made a mistake (laughter) you know.  Why would they have let me in here?  I can't possibly compete, and I don't know where that came from.  But I remember feeling that way at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] at first too, just thrilled to be there, but like, oh, they must have made a mistake.  I can't believe they've admitted me to this wonderful place.  And at Michigan, Scott Turow had just written a book right before I started at Michigan, 'One L' ['One L: The Turbulent True Story of a First Year at Harvard Law School,' Scott Turow], which was about his experience his first year at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And it scared me to death.  And I just thought, oh, gosh, it's gonna be so competitive, and it's gonna be, you know, cutthroat, and it's gonna be--and so I kind of--I think I psyched myself out, to be honest with you.  And so my first year was a pretty dismal experience.  And then it got better.  I actually, cause I did find, and I ended up teaching freshman, first year writing my second and third year, and so I felt like I had, you know, a role that was, that gave me a sense of--that I had accomplished something.  And I enjoyed teaching.  And so, but overall, I would say I learned an enormous amount about myself and about how to think.  And people say, think like a lawyer, but I just say, think in an analytical, disciplined way which helps you no matter what you do.  So I'm glad I went to law school, but I can't say it was an enjoyable experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there any particular instructors that stand out or fellow students (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have--professor, I had one professor whose name was L. Hart Wright.  And he taught tax.  And I would have never thought I would be interested in tax.  It didn't seem like the kind of thing I would have an aptitude for.  And he, I think he really shaped my, well, he certainly shaped my view of the tax code, but it was also, he shaped my view of public policy because he used to say, what you need to do is to understand tax law is to get up on top of the world and look down and say what public policy objective are we trying to accomplish with this provision of the tax code.  And when he told me that, everything else made sense.  And so whether I was taking individual tax or corporate tax, it's all driven to achieve a public policy objective.  So if you get tax credits for affordable housing, it's because the government's decided affordable housing is a good thing and you can't afford to finance it without giving somebody an inducement to do it.  So, okay, then you could understand tax credits.  Deductions, charitable deductions, well, the government's decided we want people to do, you know, to be philanthropic.  So in order to induce them to be philanthropic, we're gonna give them a deduction.  So he put everything in context for me in terms of the real world.  And that, that was enormously helpful.  So it helped me understand tax, and it helped me interpret public policy and all kinds of other laws and from a, from a more big picture perspective, which I think I was more comfortable with than focusing on the minutiae.  He made the minutiae make sense.  So he was probably, he was my favorite.  There was a black professor there who taught a seminar for me, Sallyanne Payton, and she was my first African American role model outside of my family because she had really come along at a time where very few women were going into law.  When I graduated from law school, there were only 25 percent of my class was women.  And she was at least ten or fifteen years older than I am.  So my guess is she was probably the only African American woman in her class, and she was tough as nails, and she took an interest in me.  She was kind to me.  And everyone was terrified of Sallyanne Payton and somehow we clicked.  So I remember her fondly too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She gave me a sense that, you know, if you work hard, only if you work hard, you're gonna be okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you graduated in '81 [1981]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was it '81 [1981]?  Okay.
Story_ID: 639633
Speaker 1: Did you join a firm right away (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did.  I joined a firm here in Chicago [Illinois], and I did general corporate, banking, securities law for three years.
Speaker 1: What firm was that?
Speaker 2: Pope, Ballard, Shepard and Fowle [Pope, Ballard, Shepard and Fowle, Ltd., Chicago, Illinois], no longer in existence.  And then after three years of that, I moved to another firm, Sonnenschein, Carlin, Nath and Rosenthal [Chicago, Illinois], still in existence.  And they're an outstanding--at that point, they were an outstanding real estate firm.  Now, they're really, they're general practice is equally as good.  And I was interested in doing real estate.  And so I went there and spent three years, and then right after Harold Washington's second term, second election, the beginning of his second term, I had two very good friends who were leaving his administration, both of whom had been partners at law firms, both black.  And as they were leaving, they said, "You know, you should really consider going to work in the Harold Washington administration."  And I was bored to tears practicing law.  We'd gone from financing new deals to doing workouts 'cause it was a really bad time in the real estate industry.  And I had had my daughter [Laura Jarrett], and I can remember thinking I'm leaving her every day which is hard enough, and I'm coming to work where I'm miserable.  And so they kept saying, "If you're gonna get up every day and go to work, go and do something where you'll feel good about it."  At the same I was going through Leadership Greater Chicago program [Chicago, Illinois], which is related with the Chicago Community Trust [Chicago, Illinois], and what the program really did for me is it kind of opened my eyes to what was going on civically and, in terms of government at the local level for the first time.  And it, the course really allows you to meet the leaders in you know all areas of government from the mayor to the head of the school board, to the head of the transit agency, to the business community, to the cultural community.  It really introduced you to the greater Chicago area leaders.  And it made me think to myself for the first time, that I didn't have to take the path of least resistance.  And I really would say my career before that was just kind of going down the path of least resistance.  I was in this own little world that I described to you from childhood.  And I would just kind of stumble along, and I wasn't really taking control of my life.  And I think having my daughter, getting divorced and feeling like I kind of had to stand on my own two feet coupled with--
Speaker 1: When did you get married?
Speaker 2: I got married in 1983.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got divorced in 1988.  And so this is 1987, and so already things were a little rocky, and I had this child.  And I was thinking, well, you know, for me, kind of figure out what I really wanna do for me, as opposed to thinking what I wanted to do for everybody else.  And so between Leadership Greater Chicago and my two friends, I decided to join the Harold Washington administration.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was kind of a leap of faith, I call it.
Story_ID: 639634
Speaker 1: Being in Chicago [Illinois] in those, in the Harold Washington days was really an experience.  Were you an active part of the campaign at all, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was, not in his election, I was not.  I was really at that point knee-deep in being a second year associate at a law firm, working twenty-four hours a day.  I remember the night he was elected, I remember walking into the law firm the next day with my Harold Washington button and everybody scowling at me, and I remember the sense of self-righteous pride.
Speaker 1: Were you the only black employee, I mean the only black lawyer there at that time or--
Speaker 2: I'm sure there was one other woman.  I'm trying to think if she had left by then.  She left soon after I arrived.  I think I may have been.  But I lived in Doral Plaza [Chicago, Illinois], and I can remember walking down Randolph Street and seeing people who were just frowning at me cause I had this button on.  And I remember I had been pulling all-nighters for, I don't know, a week, working on something.  And one of my best friends called me at two in the morning, and she said, screaming, you know, I'm down at--I don't know where they were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At Donnelly Hall [McCormick Place, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Donnelly Hall.  She said, "I'm at Donnelly Hall and get up and come down here."  I said, "You've got to be kidding," (laughter).  I just can't, and I really regret that I didn't get myself out of the bed and go down there.  And I can remember the screaming in the background.  And she says, "Come on down, we're down here."  And I said, "I can't do that."  So, but four years later, these two friends, same two friends, enticed me to work Election Day.  And we went to LeClaire Courts [Chicago, Illinois], which is over at the Stevenson [Expressway] and Cicero [Avenue].  And we knocked door-to-door, trying to encourage the residents of the public housing develop to come out and vote.  And I remember we spent the whole day there, and it was so frustrating because no one wanted to come out and vote.  And Harold Washington came, he showed up there, and he walked through the streets.  And then everyone came outside, and that was when we really got, we think we can win this.  And so I'd say his second election was really my first time getting involved in his campaign.  It was a very exciting time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he died three months after I started.  So I started in April of '87 [1987], and he died in November.
Speaker 1: What position did you--?
Speaker 2: I started out working as a lawyer in the corporation counsel's office.  And I was, soon after he died, I was made the deputy for finance and development.  So I did all of the public financing, municipal bonds, conventional lending, real estate, condemnation, all kinds of--everything that I really, the expertise that I gained from being a real estate lawyer (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you started what, in August then?
Speaker 2: I started in August of '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Okay, right.  He died in November--
Speaker 2: He died in November of '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And so I stayed through Mayer Sawyer [HistoryMaker Eugene Sawyer] and then a couple of years into Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley], I stayed in the same position as deputy for finance and development.  And then a couple of years after Mayor Daley's election, I became the mayor's deputy chief of staff.
Story_ID: 639635
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I have to go back, reel back to the Washington [Harold Washington] administration.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was it like working in the Harold Washington administration?
Speaker 2: I would say, the biggest word I think of is just pride and feeling a sense of belonging.  And, you know, I was, as I said, I was kind of politically disconnected before as a younger, certainly as a child and even as a young adult.  I bet I didn't know who my alderman was at the time, and so to suddenly feel as though there was somebody leading the city, and working in a predominantly white world, I think it gave me even an added sense of balance.  And, you know, Harold Washington was very good about giving out legal work to black lawyers, whether they were at their own law firms or at white law firms.  And so he was really affecting the business community.  Bond work, same thing.  So, you know, it wasn't just that he affected government.  He affected the entire fabric of our community and so I felt that by being a part of his administration, it lifted me up.  And I was a part of something for the first time that was really bigger than my own family.  And before that, I always felt, you know, the strong sense of my family, but I never felt connected to the broader community the way he connected me.
Speaker 1: That's really--that's profound, and I'm really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I would walk in City Hall [Chicago City Hall, Chicago, Illinois] and I felt like I owned the place.  It was just a wonderful, wonderful sense, and the day he died, the law department's office is right adjacent to his private office.  And so we had a glass door that looked literally as close as I am to you to his door.  And I was standing there when they wheeled him out.  And I remember looking at him and thinking, he can't possibly be alive.  He was just a horrible color.  And they were working on him as they were taking him down the hall.  And I just, you know, burst into tears, and I just, you know, I almost, the most selfish of ways, I felt like you know, I always say he died on me, like, you know, (laughter) he did something to me personally by dying.  It wasn't just his own life.  But it was my life too that he was affecting and everybody's life.  And it was just a horribly sad time, horribly sad time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know black people ran the emotional gamut with Harold Washington--
Speaker 2: I don't think we've ever recovered (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) (unclear) great pride and feeling of, the response that you describe has been described by quite a few people when they--the day after he was elected and how white people look, you know, in the city.  Of course, not all of them, but--
Speaker 2: No, no, but he changed the balance--
Speaker 1: --a significant (unclear).
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: And before.  Remember the vote for Harold--I mean, vote for Epton [Bernard Epton] before it's too late.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And it's too late for a lot of people, and they felt wow, this, but in '87 [1987], it wasn't that same sense of it's too late.
Speaker 2: No, no, not at all, not at all.  He--well, you know, and my friends always tease me that I kind of came in at the easy time.  You know, those first four years were so hard.  He didn't, you know, it was twenty-one, twenty-nine on the city council [Chicago City Council], and, you know, his tenacity is what allowed him to get through those four years.  But after his second election, he had the majority of the city council going his way, and everyone said he had the wind at his back, and it was really like gonna be just smooth sailing.  And so they would tease me and they'd say, "You came in at the easy time.  You should have been here the first four years when it was really hard."
Story_ID: 639636
Speaker 1: And to have that, you know, wind just get blown out of everyone's sails was--so suddenly.  It wasn't even though, you know, he had time to deal with a long illness or something.  He was just here one day--and, in fact, I'll tell you a really bad story.  This is, and it's a lesson in life which I have tried to keep close, but the night before he died, he was--he would always have these receptions out on the fifth floor of City Hall [Chicago City Hall, Chicago, Illinois].  And again, my office of was on the fifth floor of City Hall.  And so as I would walk down the hall, I would inevitably be bombarded around the whole elevator bank where he would be having, you know, everything from the Lithuanian reception to the Columbus Day to whatever, you know.  And I remember walking down the hall and it was too crowded out in the reception area to take the elevator.  And I can remember thinking, well, I should stop and see what he's talking about.  And I was so tired.  And I can remember thinking well, I can hear him any time.  And I took the stairs down.  I didn't stay at the reception.  I just kept going.  And I've never forgotten that.  What a mistake, you know, and, of course, I remember peeking and going, oh, I can see him any time.  Well, what kind of a lesson is that?  So I try to appreciate people while they're here and not take them for granted because they're not gonna be here forever, and I have nothing to do with when they come and go.  So you might as well just--and I guess it's almost inevitable is that you don't really appreciate something like a Harold Washington sufficiently at the time.  But I knew it was new, and I knew it was different, and I knew I had all those emotions I described to you a few minutes ago, but I obviously had gotten to the point where I just figured we were gonna be together for a very long time.  And as I said, I don't think we recovered.
Speaker 2: Well, how did you feel, and how did the inner circle feel about his, his just sudden demise, like I mean were you suspicious?  I mean I know quite a few people in the community (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, he'd grown too big, and fat.  And I remember I saw him maybe a week before he died.  We passed in the hall, and I can remember--I hadn't seen him in a while.  And when I say a while, I'd say like a month.  And I remember he came right up to me, and I remember thinking, you are just much too fat.  And, but he was so delicious and he had that twinkle in his eye, and he said, "How you doing, honey?"  And he didn't know my name from (unclear), although my father-in-law [HistoryMaker Vernon Jarrett] at the time was very close to him.  And he wouldn't have known my first name.  And, you know, infectiously charismatic, you know, you just loved him to death.  But I do remember thinking, you are just much too big.  But did I think he would drop dead?  Absolutely not.  I thought he was immortal.  And so the lesson is, none of us are immortal, and I know I always counseled my friends who were in stressful government positions to, you do have to put yourself first.  And you will be of greater service to the community if you put yourself first in terms of your health.  So, for example, every morning, I get up and I work out.  And that's just what I do for me.  And I don't say I enjoy it.  I'm used to it and I know it's important.  And that's how I start my day, and I probably could work with that hour that I spend on the treadmill, but I think, you know, you've gotta be mindful of the fact that if you're not healthy then nothing else will follow and, particularly, as a single parent.  I felt like, you know, my first job was to keep myself healthy and then I could take care of her [Jarrett's daughter, Laura Jarrett].  Like they when you're in a plane and the oxygen things come down, put it on yourself first and then put it on your child.  I think the analogy fits.
Story_ID: 639637
Speaker 1: Now, how was the transition into the Sawyer [HistoryMaker Eugene Sawyer] administration?  Did the--
Speaker 2: Painful.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Painful.  I think it was very hard for Mayor Sawyer, and, you know, he's a very kind and decent man, and I got to know him after he left office.  But I met with him once in the two years he was mayor.  My mentor in the mayor's office, a woman by the name of Lucille Dobbins was kind enough to take me in to see him on a matter--I don't even remember what it was.  But I remember she made me speak, and I remember being terrified and sitting in that big ole office.  But he was a very kind and decent man, but my guess is that he would have never run for mayor.  And you have to really passionately wanna be mayor in order to be a really great mayor.  You've gotta love it, you've gotta get up in the morning and really feel it.  And I think Mayor Sawyer never really had that passion.  And they also, white people never gave him a chance (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he kind of, he thought he deserved on some level, but at the same time he didn't know if he should--it was really--
Speaker 2: He was ambivalent.
Speaker 1: Ambivalent, yeah.
Speaker 2: And the ambivalence showed in his leadership, I would think.  I think he would probably say the same thing, a reluctant leader.  And people smell that reluctance and they perceive it as weakness.  And I'm not sure it's weakness or not.  It's just reluctance.  But it made it hard for him to get things done.  And I think because that election night, which I remember staying up 'til four in the morning and watching Alderman Mell [Richard Mell] on the table and everything else that went along with it, it was so divisive and polarizing that it was really hard for someone who was a reluctant leader to pull everybody back together again.  It would have been hard for Harold Washington after a night like that to pull everyone back together again.  And so I kind of viewed his time there as kind of caretaker and I don't think things went very wrong, but they probably, we didn't have anything bold go right either.
Story_ID: 639638
Speaker 1: And then Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley] was elected, and I just assumed he would fire me, you know, 'cause everybody kind of gets rid of the prior regime at the deputy and above level.  And I, I don't know if you've interviewed John Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] yet, from Ariel Capital [Ariel Capital Management; Ariel Investments, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't do it but--
Speaker 1: --one of my dearest friends in the world.  We grew up together and lived on the same block.  We're cousins of cousins, and he got married in 19-, I wanna say '85-ish [1985].  And I remember going to his wedding, and he sat me next to Mayor Daley and Maggie Daley.  And I said, "Why are you sitting me with them?  Sit me with my friends.  Why are you sitting me with these people?" He was state's attorney at the time.  I said, "I don't even know him."  And he goes, "Trust me, he'll be mayor one day.  You need to get to know him."  I said, "I don't want to.  Don't make me sit with him.  I won't have any fun."  So, of course, John, being John, he sent me with the mayor.  And so I think back, and, you know, obviously John had some sort of clairvoyance about what the mayor's future was.  But that was the only time I'd ever met the man.  So when he was elected, I just assumed I would get swept out.  And I didn't, so I stayed.  And I knew I wanted to stay as long as I felt comfortable that I was gonna be able to do my job the way I felt I needed to do it professionally.  And I was and the person who was appointed as my boss, Kelly Welsh [Kelly R. Welsh], who was corporation counsel.  And he couldn't have been a better corporation counsel, and he's a dear friend of mine today.  And he really gave me the latitude to do my job and to develop relationships with the other people in the mayor's office such that they ultimately recommended to the mayor that I move into the mayor's office and be his deputy chief of staff.  And that's what took me away from practicing law, and that was in 1991.
Story_ID: 639639
Speaker 1: That was, I guess the beginning of the Daley [Richard M. Daley] era, you know I suppose.  How was, well, tell us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the beginning?
Speaker 1: --about being deputy chief of staff?
Speaker 2: Well, being deputy, this was like two years into his first term.  So he was elected in '89 [1989].  This is '91 [1991].  I would say it was probably the most fun job I've ever had.  And I thought it was particularly suited to my personality because I got to know everything I wanted to know.  And I loved information.  I loved to be like on the inside scoop.  And in government, you know, you work hard to be in that inner circle, and I felt like I was finally, finally in that inner circle.  And you have all this authority because you're deputy chief of staff and you have no responsibility, perfect job?
Speaker 1: Now, who was chief of staff?
Speaker 2: David Mosena.
Speaker 1: David Mosena, okay.  That was before Gery Chico and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--yes, yes, before Gery.  So David had been planning commissioner.  And so we knew each other very well.  I was his lawyer as the, in the corporation counsel's office when he was planning commissioner.  And so we went down there together the same day and so I felt really good being with somebody I knew.  But it was just, I had no responsibility.  And so I kept, you know, at the end of the day, it wasn't like, you know, the way you have when you have your own department or even in the law department where I felt like I had responsibility for certain matters.  Here, it was troubleshooting.  We were, you know, working on a variety of different topics, but once it got to a certain point, you passed it off and then somebody else was responsible for implementation.  I loved it.  I thought it was just like, as good as it gets.  But it only lasted four months.  So one of the assignments that I had while I was there was to look at the departments that had been my clients and figure out, the mayor was trying to get the government more efficient.  And so he said to look at a bunch of departments and see if we could figure out ways of consolidating the departments.  And so the one that I took a particular interest was, we had had a department of planning [City of Chicago Department of Planning], a department of economic development [City of Chicago Department of Economic Development], a department of housing [City of Chicago Department of Housing and Economic Development] and a Department of Public Works.  And they all did similar things in different ways and it was very confusing to the outside world.  And so David and I came up with a recommendation for consolidating several of those departments, and then pieces of them into the Department of Planning and Development [City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development].  So we created a recommendation for the mayor to start this new department, and the thought being, if you have one person in all of these decisions then you're sending out one consistent message.  And so, for example, used to have developers who would go meet with the planning department.  And they would get their zoning, and they'd get their land and they would figure out what they would wanna build.  But then the department of economic development would object to it for some reason or they'd go and get all these incentives, and then the planning department would tell 'em they couldn't build where they wanted to build.  So the thought was, you're confusing everybody.  And so let's put everything in one place where if you--you know, you'll have arguments within the department.  But then one person makes a decision, and from the outside world's perspective, the government is much more user-friendly.  So the mayor liked it, and then he asked me if I would run the department.  So I left there and ran the department (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, now that seemed to be a pivotal, pivotal place to be.
Speaker 2: It was, considering our mayor is really a planner at heart.  It was, you know, near and dear to his heart.  And, you know, it's really where I developed a much closer relationship, working relationship with him.  So I j- ran that department for four years.
Story_ID: 639640
Speaker 1: All right, so that brings us to 1995, or so?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what happened in '95 [1995]?
Speaker 2: Well, in '95 [1995], I was, several things happened.  I was exhausted.  I was having constant battles with Gery Chico who was the mayor's [Richard M. Daley] chief of staff and Paul Vallas, who was his budget director.  And we were having differences of opinion about public policy issues.  And that's all perfectly good.  We had a huge debate over the head tax.  I thought we should get rid of the head tax because here I am responsible for creating jobs, and every job that's created, you tax the employer.  So back to my professor [L. Hart Wright] in law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], I thought that was really bad public policy.  You should be giving people a tax credit for every person that they hire, not a head tax.  Well, so I had a big argument with them about that.  And it wasn't so much the argument but the tactics weren't really very fair.  And I started to think, well, you know what?  Do I really wanna continue to fight with these guys day and night, and it was played out in the newspaper.  And who wants to see your name in the newspaper.  And my daughter [Laura Jarrett] was getting older, and I started thinking about college tuition and, you know, prime income making years.  And so I thought well, maybe four years is about long enough.  I hadn't stayed in any job I'd had longer than four years.  And so I started looking around trying to figure out what to do next.  And I was weighing my options between going into banking or going back to practicing law or going into real estate development.  And the reason why I chose to come to The Habitat Company [Chicago, Illinois] is that I, what I loved most about the Department of Planning and Development [City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development] was kind of the community development, revitalization work that we were doing, so working in neighborhoods like the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and these major redevelopment projects, and working with the community-based organizations to try to help them redevelop their neighborhoods.  And at the time, and still, The Habitat Company was the receiver for the Chicago Housing Authority, was and is the receiver.  And we're responsible for building all family public housing.  And I had started working closely with people from The Habitat Company on redevelopment around Cabrini [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois] and Henry Horner Homes [Chicago, Illinois] and trying to figure out, you know, what's the right mix of incomes and how can we build this housing so that the families who've been living in public housing come back into the urban fabric and no longer live in isolation.  And so I met Daniel Levin, who's our chairman, and I thought, you know what?  He's a pretty special man because unlike most real estate developers who were just about the bottom line, making money, he's really spent all this time on the kinds of social issues that I cared about in planning.  And so I thought well, if I go to Habitat, I can be in the private sector, but I can continue to do what I love most, which is community development.  So it was a perfect fit, and I've been here eleven years, so twice as long as I've been anywhere else, and will be here, I think, forever.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did we skip CTA [Chicago Transit Authority]?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't because when I left planning in 1995, and I joined Habitat, at the same time as I joined Habitat, the mayor appointed me as chairman of the CTA.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the first eight years that I was here, I was doing both.
Story_ID: 639641
Speaker 1: I guess, back to the redevelopment, I remember in the mid-'90s [1990s], Chicago housing coalition, a lot of groups, there was a lot of demonstrations outside of Cabrini [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep, yes.
Speaker 1: --people, the community was in a flux as to what should be done--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with those high rise units.
Speaker 2: Huge fights.  We had demonstrations, we had lawsuits, we had everything you can think of.  And last week, we were at Cabrini for a groundbreaking for the new redevelopment of the onsite at Cabrini that's being done by a developer here in town.  And I was asked to give a speech, and I said, you know, I started working on Cabrini in 1991, and so the moral of the story is if you live long enough and you are tenacious and you have a dream, you know, magic can actually happen.  And I think, you know, we had lots of problems along the way, but the one thing we continued to do was to talk to one another and the residents who, you know, I remember meeting with in there in the mid-'90s [1990s] in the dead of winter in their office haggling over all kinds of issues were the same ones who were there, you know, all standing together last week.  And, you know, I feel like we've grown up together, and if you think about over a fifteen-year period, eventually, if you're patient, you get to a really good place.  And I think the residents forced us to really think hard about what was important to them, and we forced them to say, you know, you're not in isolation anymore.  You're part of a community, and it can't just be what's in your--what you think is in your best interest.  We've got to look at it as a community as a whole.  And so, in the end, it was a love fest, and it was a--it's a better development having had that friction.  Do I wish it hadn't taken as long?  Of course, I do.  But I think sometimes things take a long time.  If I look at, you know, the neighborhood around North Kenwood-Oakland [Chicago, Illinois].  When I started the planning commissioner, as a planning commissioner, this is, you know, the neighborhood like 47th [Street] to 39th [Street], the lake [Lake Michigan] to Cottage [Cottage Grove Avenue], 70 percent of the land was vacant in that community.  And 50 percent of what was vacant was owned by the city.  And everyone said, well, it's a terrible neighborhood.  Well, I'd grown up at 49th [Street] and Greenwood [Avenue], and I can remember driving down 47th Street and only looking south and never looking north.  And I can remember thinking, well, why is there this invisible line on 47th Street, you know.  And how could it be so close to South Kenwood [Chicago, Illinois] and be perceived so poorly.  And so I looked at that vacant land as potential.  I said, well, if the city controls all that land, you know, we can help rebuild the community.  And if you drive through the neighborhood today, it doesn't look a thing like it did fifteen years ago.  And, but it required, you know, community hearings and community input and a lot of back and forth, and in the end I think, again, you make a far healthier community having heard all the voices as opposed to just one.  And that's what I really enjoy.  That's the community process that I enjoy, and I think what ties it back to my [maternal] grandfather [Robert Rochon Taylor] is that he really believed that public housing should be woven back into the urban fabric and that there should be--it should be temporary.  It should be a place for you to go when times are tough and you need to get back on your feet.  But while you're there, he was a strong believer in requiring a sense of responsibility.
Story_ID: 639642
Speaker 1: And so I think what happened over the time between the time he left, really and until Terry Peterson and Sharon Gilliam [HistoryMaker Sharon Gist Gilliam] arrived, is that the accountability drifted away, the social services drifted away, the commercial development drifted away, and all you really had was a warehouse for someone to live.  And, you know, again, public policy decisions were made that ended up having people who were not just poor but very poor.  So if you weren't--if you got a job, there was a disincentive to stay.  So everybody who got a job then had to pay 30 percent of their income for rent.  And so, you know, 30 percent gets to be a bigger and bigger number the more you make, and so as soon as you could, you left.  But the people who were left behind had no resources or tools to get out.  And so you ended up with these horribly isolated enclaves that had no support services and no hope for change.  And generation after generation stayed put.  And that's the exact antithesis of what my [maternal] grandfather's [Robert Rochon Taylor] vision was, but he couldn't carry out his vision cause at the time he was chairman of the housing authority [Chicago Housing Authority], there wasn't an appetite to spread the housing around.  Everybody liked it being, you know, isolated in one location.  And so he really resigned out of frustration 'cause he couldn't get the white elected officials, aldermen, to take public housing in their neighborhoods.  And so I remember when Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois] opened, and my [maternal] grandmother [Laura Jennings Vaughn] and my mother [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman] and my aunt [HistoryMaker Lauranita Dugas], we all were out there for the day of the opening.  And I was six, and I think, and everyone was kind of excited because they were making a big deal out of my grandmother.  But I remember as an older child my mother saying, there's no way my grandfather would ever put up with that being named after him had he been alive.  And so I began to understand, you know, what his vision was compared to what the reality of Robert Taylor was.  And every time Robert Taylor Homes was on the news, you know, everyone in our family would just cringe and to have his name associated with something that was so, such a disaster in the lives of the people who lived there and for the city as a whole, you know, it's just one of those things you have to live with.  But, boy, I wish they hadn't named it after him.

Speaker 1: Well, I think it was interesting that you, what you said about community activism being positive, seeing it in a positive light (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, you have to embrace--
Speaker 1: --as being something to sharpen the--
Speaker 2: --absolutely.  And I think I made really good decisions, but I made better decisions being pushed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everybody needs to be pushed.
Speaker 1: Is that generally the attitude of city government today?  That they like to see activism and hear those voices?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I think one of the things that happened with Harold Washington is that he opened up city government to a, to a process that required consultation and interaction and all the good government stuff that you might think about.  And I think, regardless of who his successors are or will be in the future, you can't go back.  Once you open up the door, and you say, okay, people, you're gonna be a part of this process, you can't shut the door again.  And I'm not saying that Mayor Sawyer [HistoryMaker Eugene Sawyer] or Mayor Washington would have wanted to do that cause clear direction that I had from both of them was to honor that process.  But I think that, you know, if it hadn't begun under Harold Washington, would they have done it?  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the city really wasn't--
Speaker 2: It wasn't very open before Harold Washington.  Let's put it that way.  So I think that--I'm a big fan of that process, and I think, you know, is it a pain in the neck when you have people demonstrating in front of your home, you know, and my daughter's [Laura Jarrett] asking me why do you do this?  Of course, that is.  But, but I try to--and I'll never forget when we cut service at the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority], people were, you know, rightfully upset.  They should have been upset.  I would have, I was upset too.  But I think part of being a public official is that you have to take that piece and you have to put it in the broader context.  And our view was, we were delivering really more service than we could afford.  We were driving empty buses around the neighborhoods, and you can't continue to do that.  And the CTA's crisis today is kind of an example of what happens if you continue to ignore those kinds of, those economic realities.  And so I think in public service you have to make really tough decisions, but the reason why I feel so strongly about the public process is that when you make 'em, you wanna make sure you're fully informed.  And you can't make 'em in a vacuum.  You've got to listen to people.  And I can remember going to a community meeting and a resident of public housing said, "I just got a job, and I gotta leave home at four o'clock because I gotta take three buses to get to my job.  And if you cut my bus route, I'm not gonna be able to get to work."  Well, here I am at The Habitat Company [Chicago, Illinois], with my [maternal] grandfather's [Robert Rochon Taylor] legacy saying, you want people to get a job.  You want them to become self-sufficient.  You want them to move on.  So she was really, you know, it was like a nightmare for me to have to listen to her, but I knew that if we didn't cut that bus, then we were gonna end up having to cut dozens more buses two or three years later because of the economic decline.  And then we would have affected far more people than that.  But that was a hard decision to make because she was exactly the kind of person I was trying to help.  So, so public, being in the public sector is very--it's hard.  It's--you make the toughest decisions that you can imagine.  So you wanna make 'em, knowing what you're doing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It doesn't mean you won't make mistakes, but at least they'll be informed, but if we knew--and you just, you give it your best judgment.  And that's kind of what I always encourage people.  I think a lot of people in government become paralyzed because they're afraid of making the wrong decision and in a political atmosphere where everything--and particularly, in Chicago [Illinois].  I don't know what Chicago, why Chicago is so different, but, you know, every decision you make turns into a political decision on the front page of the newspaper.  And my parents [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman and HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] would always say to me, you know, to your own self be true.  You know, listen, do your homework, try to get as much information as you can and then make a decision, and you'll sleep at night.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I still remember that woman from public housing (laughter) who was trying to get to that job.
Speaker 1: I guess you can't please everybody with every--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You can't, you can't please everybody.  And that's the diversity of our city and our world right now.  And so, but I think about, you know, a public hearing that we had in North Kenwood [Chicago, Illinois] where a lot of people came in who were organized to demonstrate against this plan that really provided the blueprint for the redevelopment today.  And it would have been very easy to say, okay, well, we're not gonna do it because these people came and demonstrated.  Well, I'm really glad we made that decision.  So you have to be prepared to take an awful lot of heat, but if you really are confident that you're making the right decision, then you gotta just keep moving.
Story_ID: 639644
Speaker 1: I know one of the issues in public housing with the demise of the projects was the Section 8 vouchers.  I think people were given vouchers, and they, there was--I don't know if it was the Chicago [Illinois] housing coalition or other groups but people complained that there wasn't, not enough housing to match the vouchers.  So if they had to leave Cabrini [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois] or one of these projects that was being torn down, where could they go?  Has that situation changed since those days (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it's a very complicated situation.  First of all, there isn't enough affordable housing in the city.  And the city spends a great deal of money trying to create affordable housing, but the downside of the real estate boom is that the housing prices have gone up.  So neighborhoods are healthier.  They're also more expensive.  So they're right.  There wasn't a lot of affordable housing.  Everybody who had a voucher, so far, has been placed in a home, so the people are not living on the streets.  Now, what has also been an issue is that as you move into--as you take a voucher and you move into private housing--which is what vouchers are.  You just take it and it pays your rent, you've gotta find landlords who will allow you to come in.  And so a lot of landlords in the city don't wanna deal with the strings of the government, Section 8 program, one problem.  And so they say, no.  And you don't have to take Section 8.  You have to opt into the program if you're a landowner--landlord.  The other problem is, some of the landlords just let anybody in.  And so you have buildings with residents who aren't mindful of the responsibilities.  And so then they become slum and blighted as well.  Or you have, what I see as a real problem and there's not a lot you can do about it, which is that a lot of the people have chosen to live near where their public housing developments were.  And so neighborhoods that were already poor have remained poor or become just even poorer.  But you can't blame people for wanting to stay close to home, you know, their schools, the kids are in the schools in that location.  They have an extended network of friends who live in the same location.  A lot of people move, not just public housing residents, but a lot of people move in the same community in which they've lived before cause that's where your roots are.  So it's hard to force them to leave.
Story_ID: 639645
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about Chicago Transit Authority.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that's, that's another big public service--
Speaker 2: It sure is.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was the first woman, African American woman to chair the board and--
Speaker 1: You were appointed by the mayor [Richard M. Daley].
Speaker 2: I was appointed by the mayor, yep.  And I'd say, probably if you were a betting person, most people were taking odds that I wouldn't stay very long, that they would--
Speaker 1: Now, you were appointed in what year, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty--1995.
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-five [1995], okay.
Speaker 2: October of 1995.  And I think, you know, at the time there was a perception that this was just something the mayor was doing as I was leaving planning [City of Chicago Department of Planning; City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development] for political reasons to keep me close but not too close.  I think that--a lot of people said that to me.  Oh, well, he's just doing that because he, you know, he doesn't want you completely gone because you might be adversarial if you are.  But he's just giving you this position, and you'll probably stay there six months and then leave.  It was just a graceful way out.  That's probably, I think how a lot of people described it.  And, you know, we, the mayor and I had several heart-to-hearts before I took it on.  And it was clear to me that he expected me to be there a long time, and he expected me to change the agency.  And so going into it, I think we had a quiet understanding that, you know, that in the end those who bet against me were gonna lose that bet.  And eight years later is when I chose to leave.
Story_ID: 639646
Speaker 1: Number of reforms I read about--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we did a lot (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority], everything from washing the trains to--
Speaker 2: Isn't that a novel idea, let's make the trains clean.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, let's wash the trains.
Speaker 2: You know, the funniest one, one of the funniest ones--well, first of all we started with a philosophy that, stop talking about the CTA customers as riders because a rider is almost kind of a un- impersonal way of describing them.  They're our customers.  And if you say that they're the customer, then a whole lot of other things follow.  And you then start to think about servicing the customer as opposed to providing buses and trains on a street grid or a rail grid.  And I think for a long time, the CTA just kind of looked at, you know, let's get the trains and buses out on the system.  Let's get 'em out, let's get 'em back, let's get 'em back out.  Let's get 'em back.  And what happened along the way wasn't valued as much as we thought it should be.  And so if you say, okay, I'm gonna start to call you a customer, then you have to say to yourself, well, what does a customer want?
Speaker 1: Now, anybody that's tried to catch a Chicago [Illinois]--CTA bus and has seen the driver's eyes as they whiz past you when you're running to a stop--
Speaker 2: Isn't that the worst?
Speaker 1: --knows that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Isn't that the worst?
Speaker 1: --knows what you're talking about.
Speaker 2: And see I grew up riding the bus.  You know, we took the bus all over the city when I was a kid.  And when I was working, practicing law, I lived in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] and I took the number six downtown every day.  And I can remember being eight months pregnant and no one would get up for me on the bus.  And, you know, the bus driver wouldn't stop and all that kind of stuff.  And I will say this, driving a bus is one of the hardest jobs that there is.  And if you think about having, you know, fifty-some odd people on a good day who you are responsible for their lives, and you're trying to go in and out of traffic, and you're trying to stay on schedule, it's a high-pressure job.  And we probably should do a lot more to recognize how tough that job is and honor the bus drivers who do this job.  But having said that, what we really tried to do is to get everyone to start thinking about the customer.  And so I'll give, just one story of something simple that we were able to do.  I asked, do we have a train schedule?  You know, airplanes leave on time or at least they tell you what time they're gonna leave.  Why can't we have a schedule?  And I understand on the bus side it's harder to do it because you've got traffic.  But on the trains, with a dedicated route.  So, the answer was, "Well, we do have a schedule."  I said, "Well, are we on time?"  And they said, you know, "97, 98 percent of the time, we are exactly on time."  I said, "Well, why wouldn't you tell people about it then?"  Well, it never occurred to them to publish the train schedules.  And at first I thought it's because, you know, we couldn't possibly be on time.  But when I found out, here we have this unbelievable, you know, record.  So we put train schedules up in the station so you could figure out what time your train was coming.  Well, what kind of a message does that send to the customer when they, when you do something like that?  Well, what message does it send, when you decide, okay, we're gonna clean the buses and we're gonna clean the railcars on a regular, routine basis?  You know, and so, you know, power washing the stations, stations that have smelled like urine for years, we cleaned them up.  And just, all the little things that anybody would want from a customer relation perspective, trying to make the agency, you know, clean, on time, safe and friendly.  That was kind of the mayor's model that he gave to us, and he said, you know, if you can do that, people will be happy with you.
Story_ID: 639647
Speaker 1: Now, at the same time we were trying to do that, the ridership at the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] had been declining.  Over the fifteen years before I got there, the CTA lost 40 percent of its customers.  Well, in any other business, that's like, you know, bankruptcy.  And, in fact, the guy who was the president when I first arrived one of his first acts was giving me a memo to explain how we could go into bankruptcy.  And I said, well, that's just not gonna happen on my watch.  We're not having any bankruptcy here.  Let's figure out how we can be more efficient and align our service with the demand and see if we can get our, you know, house in order.  And I'll say, you know, as much flak as Governor Ryan [George Ryan] has received over the years, one thing that he did that was very helpful to the CTA is Illinois FIRST [Fund for Infrastructure, Roads, Schools and Transit], which was a huge bond issue that gave the CTA money for capital.  So we were able to upgrade a lot of our system.  And, I mean part of the problem was, everything being so tough is that the buses are old way beyond their useful life.  Most of the buses are, you know, they have a twelve-year life.  You got buses on the street that are eighteen years old.  So, of course, they're gonna break down.  They're too old, railcars that hadn't been upgraded.  And we hadn't ordered new railcars in years.  And so a lot of what the state bond issue did was give the CTA a chance to bring itself up to what we call a state of good repair.  And it, then it was much more reliable.  Just like with your car.  If you're driving a twenty-year old car, and you haven't had it serviced, it's gonna break down on you, whereas you take it in routinely, and, you know, give it the service that it needs and retire it and get a new car, then your life is gonna be easier.  And so that's the perspective that we tried to bring to the agency.  And ridership did turn around.  You know, during the time I was there, we reversed that trend and we were starting to move up when I left.
Story_ID: 639648
Speaker 1: Having worked for Mayor Washington [Harold Washington], Mayor Sawyer [HistoryMaker Eugene Sawyer] for a brief period of time and for Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley], I mean is there--I know the black community is--was just completely flattened out by the death of Harold Washington--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, I know that the black community will never love a Mayor Daley like they loved Mayor Washington.  But what's your assessment of Mayor Daley as a black person in the administration?
Speaker 2: You're asking a bunch of questions there.  I'll say, I'll say this.  I'll say that his administration has always reflected the diversity of the city.  So there have always been African American women and men who work.  My colleagues while we were there, I always felt that the mayor valued my advice and counsel and that he didn't look at me as a black woman.  He looked at me as a person and took what I had to say, you know, as professional advice.  And it wasn't a black-white issue at all with him.  I think that he is, I know that he is extremely proud of how his vote count in the black community has steadily increased with each election.  So in the first election, I don't know, let's say he got 7 percent of the African American vote, and in his last election, he won all fifty wards.  And really takes pride in that.  So it's important to him.  And, you know, if you were to think of him what his foes think of him, you would think, well, he wouldn't care about that.  And he'd be happy with 51 percent of the vote.  He takes huge pride in having reached across the city to the entire community.  And if you drive around the city today, we still have neighborhoods who are--that are in terrible condition.  But we also have many neighborhoods in the black community that are far better off now than they were.  And one example is my local alderman, Alderman Preckwinkle [HistoryMaker Toni Preckwinkle], who is a huge thorn in the mayor's side in the city council [Chicago City Council].  She speaks her mind, and she is not afraid to stand up in the city council or anywhere and say when she disagrees with the mayor.  But every time that he comes to the ward, and he comes for ground breakings and ribbon cuttings and all kinds of events.  When she introduces him, she always says, "The mayor and I disagree on issues, but he has always been supportive of the redevelopment of this community."  And so I use her as an example because here's one of his harshest critics, and she gives him his due.  And she's right.  The resources from his administration that have been directed into the 4th Ward to help support the revitalization of that neighborhood could have easily been diverted to the eleventh ward, you know, easily.  And they weren't.  So my observation as the planning commissioner and then as the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] chair, is that he was very sensitive to trying to provide equal service throughout the city and to reach out to the black community that he knew had distrusted him.  Oh, he was well aware.  It's not like he isn't aware of how the black community felt about him when he was first elected, and to try to do what he could do to reverse that.
Story_ID: 639649
Speaker 1: What are some, some of your immediate projects here at Habitat [The Habitat Company, Chicago, Illinois] now, I mean the things you're working on right now?
Speaker 2: Well, right across the street, we're building a new rental building that's gonna be tied to the East Bank Club [Chicago, Illinois], which is gonna be beautiful.  It's going up.  It's about half way done.  I mean earlier our work as the receiver for the Chicago Housing Authority [CHA] which I'm particularly proud of, and that takes a great deal of my time.  And so right now, we're working at Cabrini [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois], Henry Horner [Henry Horner Homes, Chicago, Illinois], Stateway Gardens [Chicago, Illinois], Robert Taylor [Robert Taylor Homes, Chicago, Illinois], Madden Park [Madden Park Homes, Chicago, Illinois], North Kenwood-Oakland [Chicago, Illinois], Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois], all over the city really, on these massive redevelopments by having--the CHA has torn down these high-rise buildings.  And so we're building back on site and in the surrounding community, these mixed income developments.  And so that's something we're really, really particularly proud of.  We have offices in Detroit [Michigan], St. Louis [Missouri] and Atlanta [Georgia], and I spend a fair amount of my attention in Atlanta.  It's a great city.  I love it.  It's manageable.  My best friend from law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] lives in Atlanta so it's always a chance to go down and visit her.  And we manage about half the, maybe a little less than half of the public housing portfolio in Atlanta.  And so Renee Glover is the head of the housing authority down there.  And she's fabulous.  She's a lawyer who bring the business acumen to the job and has done a remarkable job in Atlanta.  So, but having said that, Chicago's home, and Chicago [Illinois] will always be the first priority to The Habitat Company, and we're always looking for new opportunities.
Story_ID: 639650
Speaker 1: What do you see as next steps in terms of your career?  I mean are you--are you--well, you say you never stayed in one job more than four years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know.  This is remarkable, but, you know, I just, I fell in love with these guys, and I'm now an owner, thanks to Daniel Levin's really foresightedness to realize that if you want this company [The Habitat Company, Chicago, Illinois] to continue beyond his death, then he's got to incentivize people to have a stake in it.  And so he made me an owner a few years ago.  And I have every incentive to grow old here.  The only caveat would be is if Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] is the senator--is the president of the United States, and I might be tempted to go and spend some time with him.  But other than that, this will be my home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I worked on Barack's campaign a lot.  I was his finance chair during his senatorial campaign.  And he and his wife [Michelle Obama] are dear friends of mine, and, you know, if he decides to run for president, then everything's up in the air.
Story_ID: 639651
Speaker 1: What are some of the oth- now, you serve as a board member of a number of organizations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I do.
Speaker 1: --here in the city.
Speaker 2: --I do.
Speaker 1: What are some of the--
Speaker 2: Well, I listed some of the civic ones for you earlier.  In addition to that, I'm on the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] board, USG Corporation [Chicago, Illinois], makes gypsum, wallboard for your homes, Navigant Consulting [Navigant Consulting, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], which is a consulting firm, professional consulting firm in town, RREEF REIT [RREEF Property Trust, Inc.], which owns a bunch of real estate across the country.  Those are the--and then I chair the board of the Chicago Stock Exchange [Chicago, Illinois].  So, how could I, how I put that last (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right, that's a big one.
Speaker 2: That's a big one.  I just had a board meeting yesterday so maybe I'm putting it to the back of my mind 'cause it was stressful (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did that happen?  Are the first black woman to--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, definitely.
Speaker 1: I'm sure, yeah.
Speaker 2: First black person, I'm sure.  It's a funny story.  Remember I was talking about Mrs. Wheeler [ph.] in fourth grade [at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois].  Well, a gentleman by the name of Andy Davis [Andrew Davis] was also in Mrs. Wheeler's fourth grade class.  And Andy Davis was the vice chairman of the Chicago Stock Exchange board.  And I met him, one of my cousins used to work for him, and my cousin's mom died, and Andy was kind enough to come to her funeral.  And we reconnected at the funeral.  And he asked my cousin, "Do you think Valerie [HistoryMaker Valerie Jarrett] would come on our board?"  And I didn't know anything about the stock exchange really.  But I remembered Andy from Mrs. Wheeler's class (laughter).  And so I decided to join the board and over the course of the years that I was on the board--I was on the board about three years before I became chairman, I got to know the other board members.  And then the guy who was chairman decided to step down, and so Andy, as the vice chair, supported me to become chairman.  And so that's one of those examples where those childhood relationships come in handy.  And Andy was really supportive of me during my time there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's how it happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know, (laughter), it's an odd way to get somewhere, but it worked.  So I've really, I've enjoyed that immensely.  And that takes--between, I think probably the stock exchange and chairing the board of the University of Chicago Medical Center [Chicago, Illinois], those are the two that take the most amount of my time.
Speaker 1: How are you received as the chairman of the stock exchange I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, really well received.  I have to say it's a, again, white male dominated industry.  But I think because Andy has such a big presence on the floor, and because I was his pick, that made things a lot easier.  And they, they all gave me a great deal of support.  I think I worked hard to earn their support as well.  So it's been, it's been good.  I will say, kind of a more general question than the one you asked, I think being a black woman has always been to my advantage.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I think, I can't really think of a time it's been to my disadvantage.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting 'cause, you know, some people would say, you've always got two burdens that you're carrying, and you've got--
Speaker 2: I know.  That's why I mentioned it.  I've never felt that way.  And again, maybe it's how I was raised to not think of it as a burden but to think of it as, you know, an opportunity.  And it's okay with me if people underestimate me.  I like that.  Then I get to--there's no better revenge than success (laughter).  So if I--and the same thing as I said, starting at the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority].  I knew those guys thought I wouldn't last, and that just made me more determined than ever to make it work.  So those kind of low expectations just bring out the best in me.
Story_ID: 639652
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, I have huge concerns about the black community, particularly the black male community.  And I don't know what's going on exactly, but it's a bad thing.  I know that.  And I think, you know, whether it's the breakdown of the family or what, but I just find that there are lots of strong, black women who are doing their best to raise their children.  And I wish that for every strong, black woman, there was a strong black man.  And there isn't.  I mean if you look at the prisons around the country, not just in Chicago [Illinois], they are predominantly populated with young African American men.  And, you know, how we got off track, I don't know.  I think about, you know, again some of the social policies I think of the '60s [1960s] probably had unintended consequences 'cause there was an incentive to be a single, head of the household.  But what kind of message is that saying, that, okay, I'm only gonna give you aid to families with dependent children if you're a single mom.  But if you're married, you don't get that money.  Well, you create a disincentive for the man to stay in the home.  And I'm not blaming everything that's happened to black men on that, but I think, I think that there were some unintended consequences of the liberal '60s [1960s].  And, you know, again, my [maternal] grandfather [Robert Rochon Taylor], as he would walk through public housing, if he saw, if he went to somebody's home and it wasn't kept up to standard, he would evict them.  No, not--you know, he would tell you what the standards are.  He would tell you very clearly what the standards were.  But if you didn't live up to those expectations, you were out of there.  And I think having low expectations of people was a part of the problem, letting people think that they could just live anyway they wanted to with no consequence was part of the problem.  And I think, you know, racism, particularly, in the poor community, is still a huge barrier to entry.  And, you know, it's amazing how many people actually come out of public housing and become fruitful citizens 'cause you got an awful lot going against you.  And there are no role models.  There's, all you see is the television with immediate gratification, and then you know, it's, from a perspective of a young, black man, where do you get your role model being a part of a gang.  You've got a leader who's telling you how great you are, and you're not necessarily getting that from home.  And so, it's an easy path of least resistance.  And no, you know, kind of fabric, trying to keep you on track.  So now, the far harder problem is what do you do about it?  And I think, you know, all of us who are successful have a certain responsibility to our community, and to those who are less fortunate in our community.  But I can't tell you I have the solution.  I think a big part of the solution is getting rid of these, living in social isolation and getting, you know, public housing, for example, reintegrated back into the community.  I think if you're living next door to somebody who gets up every day and goes to work and sends their children to school, you're more likely to do the same if there's community pressure.  If you live in a community where nobody gets up and goes to sc- work every day, and the kids don't go to school, well, then it's easier to kind of fall into that.  So, getting back our sense of community, and the other thing I think we need is leadership.  You know, we talked about Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] a minute ago, but, boy, to have a black man president of the United States, I think would have to put a little ump in a lot of people's step to maybe think well, maybe I, too, could be, you know, if not president, something more than what I am.  And we need--and, you know, he gave a speech a couple of years ago on being a black male parent and your obligation.  And I think we need a lot more of that.  You know, I'm tiring of this kind of self-defeatist victim.  I think at some point, you say, yes, you know what?  There's a lot of unfairness in the world, terrible things happened to my ancestors, maybe even my parents.  But at some point, self-determination has to enter into it.  And you have to say, you know what?  I'm gonna take care of my children cause I had these kids.  And maybe I was too young, and maybe I didn't have a lot of other opportunities, but I'm gonna--I have some responsibility to these children, and that means I have to get up and go to work every day.  And it may not be the best job in the world, but it's better than doing nothing.  And I think we need to get that from leadership.  And we have had a vacuum, in the black community, of leadership.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I was with somebody last night who was saying he had regrets about his career.  You know, it's so far, so good.  I think, you know, do I wish that I had been a little more ambitious as a younger person as opposed to kind of drifting the way I did?  Yeah, but it turned out pretty good.  So I'm becoming more fatalistic as I get older, and I think, you know, things happen for a reason.  And I think, you know, I consider myself a work in progress.  I just turned fifty, and I think feel really good at fifty.  I didn't feel good at forty, and I felt terrible at thirty, and at fifty, I feel really good.  So I feel, I feel like I'm in more control of the direction of my life than I probably was--as opposed to kind of just letting things happen, and some really, really good things happened, but just imagine if I'd had a little drive back then.  I don't know.  But I'm, I'm absolutely blessed and lucky to be where I am, and I--it doesn't mean I haven't worked hard, so I'm not saying it just kind of happened along the way.  Certainly I work really hard, and I sacrificed an awful lot.  And I'd spend, you know, and get like five hours of sleep and I'm working every night, but I enjoy it.  I'm doing what I enjoy.  So I have no regrets really.
Story_ID: 639654
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look at what you've done to this point, what do you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My daughter [Laura Jarrett] I mean probably more than anything else, I've enjoyed being a mom.  And we haven't talked about her at all which is hard to believe 'cause there's nothing more important in my life than my daughter.  She just turned twenty-one a couple of weeks before I turned fifty, and I think that's part of what made turning fifty so easy is that I said, well, this is something that I did really good.  And I, you know, I was not hapless about that at all.  I took that responsibility really, really seriously, and I feel--do I regret that I couldn't have spent more time with her when she was younger?  I do, you know there were many times when she wrote me a note up there, which was a really sad note, say, "Dear Mommy, you know, I miss you.  Please come home."  And I keep it--she wrote it when she was five, and I always keep it there to keep me balanced.  But on balance, I think, you know, I always carried, I had little things, like I always carried a cell phone.  So every time she wanted to talk to me, no matter where I was, she could reach me.  And I think I've been a good role model for her.  She works really, really hard.  She takes school very seriously.  She's a, she's a very serious young woman.  And so I think she'll be a good--she's a wonderful adult, not will be a good adult.  She is a wonderful adult.  And so I am most proud of having--with a lot of help from my parents [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman and HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] and my [maternal] grandmother [Laura Jennings Vaughn] and the woman who was her caretaker from the time she was three months old is still a big part of our life today.  And so I had a lot of help, but she's about as close to perfect as one can get.  So by far, she is my proudest accomplishment.  Everything else just pales in comparison.
Speaker 1: Okay, the typical question I ask after this, can you tell us something about your family, but you've done it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) That's it.  She is, she is really as good as it gets.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she's in college now, or--?
Speaker 2: She's a senior in college [Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, I guess is there anything we have not asked you that you think we need to raise before we ask our last sc- question?
Speaker 2: Covered a lot of ground.  No, I can't really think of anything.
Speaker 1: We'll come back in fifty more years and then ask some more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right exactly.  I feel like I've just turned the corner.  I got--the best is yet to be.  That's what I hope.
Story_ID: 639655
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Hm, it's hard to say at the halfway point (laughter).  What I, I would, I would--I guess I would circle back to what my parents [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman and HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] taught is that, you know, they gave me huge opportunities.  They paid for my education.  I never had to work.  I did work when I was in college [Stanford University, Stanford, California], but I didn't have to work.  They gave me every advantage parents could have.  They loved me dearly.  They were unselfish in their love.  To this day, there's nothing either of them wouldn't do for me or for my daughter [Laura Jarrett].  And so what I really want is to make sure that I honor the other side of that contract and do whatever I do, as well as I can do it so that you, you know, leave the world a little better, hopefully, than you found it.  And so I have found, you know, my passion to be either in healthcare through the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  It's the largest employer on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois].  There's a huge health problem on the South Side of Chicago.  The African American population has diseases which are skyrocketing compared to our white counterparts in the broader city.  And so one of, one of the things I'm very interested in now is seeing what we can do to change that delivery of healthcare on the South Side.  Community development: I like the fact that, you know, if you ask really anybody why is North Kenwood [Chicago, Illinois] a better community?  Why is Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] a better community?  Why is the Near West Side [Chicago, Illinois] a better community?  They will say because of the work that I did when I was in the Department of Planning [City of Chicago Department of Planning; City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development] with a team of great people who came to work with me.  And so knowing that the neighborhoods that haven't received the attention that I think everyone would say they deserved, got that focus while I was with the city.  And it kind of started a chain reaction that you can't really reverse, I'm particularly proud of.  So being a good citizen of the community.  I mean there's something really special about Chicago.  I think there's very s- there's something special about the people here.  We've got a lot of heart, a lot of intensity, a lot of conflict strife, but I'm really proud to be a part of this community and to play as strong of a role as I can be.  So I think it's too soon to say what my legacy will be.  I hope the best I yet to come, but I'm off--I feel like I'm off to a pretty good start.
Story_ID: 639656
Speaker 1: All right, this is picture of me with my idol, Michael Jordan.  It was taken in 1995 at the opening of the James Jordan Boys Club [James R. Jordan Boys and Girls Club; James R. Jordan Boys & Girls Club and Chicago Bulls Family Life Center] on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois], named after Michael's dad [James R. Jordan, Sr.].  And it was a very important day to me because it was an anchor to the West Side community where I had been working for the last four years, trying to help revitalize the neighborhood.  And so the boys center was really a shot in the arm, and for me to be able to be that close to Michael just the thrill of a lifetime.
Speaker 2: Here's a picture of President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and my cousin, [HistoryMaker] Mercer Cook and me.  We are at Mercer's mom's home, Ann Jordan [HistoryMaker Ann Dibble Jordan], Ann and Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] have a house at Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], and President Clinton and his wife [Hillary Rodham Clinton] would frequently visit the Vineyard during our summer vacation.  And the Vineyard is a wonderful place that we go every summer and to be able to celebrate being there with the Clintons was a thrill.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Here's a picture of my daughter, Laura [Laura Jarrett], and me with Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley].  This is at a CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] event.  We were opening the Garfield station, right next to the Garfield Conservatory [Garfield Park Conservatory, Chicago, Illinois] on the West Side.  It was a part of a revitalization effort of the green line and I would always, on weekends, take my daughter with me to any kind of events.  So she got to know the city, all parts of the city, and the mayor was sweet enough to pose with us.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And that's a nice station too.
Speaker 2: It's a beautiful station, historic station.
Speaker 1: This picture was taken in 1995 as well, maybe '96 [1996].  It was the inaugural ride of the green line, another line that was renovated in the last ten years by the CTA.  And it was Mother's Day, and I convinced my daughter that she should come out at six a.m., as you can tell from the look on her face, to ride the first green line ride.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a photo of the revitalized Henry Horner community where the old Henry Horner Homes [Chicago, Illinois] used to be, and it was the first phase, and it won an award from the Chicago Association of Realtors as being a beautiful new rental construction, affordable housing development.  And I liked the fact that it didn't say public housing anywhere on the plaque.
Speaker 2: This photo was taken on a beautiful summer day in about 2001 or 2002.  My daughter and I were riding on a CTA float in the Bud Billiken Parade, one of the highlights of every summer.  And it was a hot day, and I said, "Laura, please smile," and she did, but it was, it was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Here we have Senator Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] before he was U.S. senator, when he was state senator, together with Andy Davis [Andrew Davis], who is the vice chairman of the Chicago Stock Exchange board.  And it was at one of Barack's first fundraisers running for U.S. Senate.  I'd just become chair of his finance committee and was pretty happy to be there.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is my daughter's high school graduation.  I'm in cap and gown because I was on the board of her school [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois].  And one of the benefits of being on the board is I was able to give her her diploma, and there with my dad [HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] and my best friend, next to my dad from law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], Carol Mason, and my niece, Andrea Dugas [Andrea Dugas Douglas], and it was probably one of the best days of our life.
Speaker 1: And that's a photo that was taken right after I gave my daughter her diploma so we were both beaming from the moment.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: This photo was taken at the Commercial Club Family Dinner.  The Commercial Club [Commercial Club of Chicago] is a rather exclusive group of business leaders in town and I was privileged to be admitted to membership.  And every year they have a family dinner.  And this was taken the day after my daughter was accepted to college.  So she was so proud to be able to come and tell people she was gonna be attending Amherst College [Amherst, Massachusetts] in the fall.

Speaker 1: Shall we?
Speaker 2: My goodness.  Everybody I love (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There's a lot of love in this room tonight.
Speaker 2: --in the world in one room.  Hello everybody.
Speaker 1: We're here in Chicago [Illinois], your hometown.  Your family's here, your friends, your former colleagues, PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] audiences watching us tonight.  And there's one person who could not be in the room tonight, but he had something that he wanted to say.  Let's take a listen.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of President Barack Obama):  Before Valerie [HistoryMaker Valerie Jarrett] ever became a HistoryMaker, she was one of my oldest and dearest friends.  In fact, she's more than that.  She's like a sister to me and Michelle [Michelle Obama].  Valerie is the one who more than anybody else has made sure our White House [Washington, D.C.] and the policies we pursue are as inclusive as America is.  And that's who Valerie is, somebody who believes that everyone deserves a voice, and that all of us have a responsibility to give back to an America that's given us so much.  Valerie, you know we love you.  Congratulations on being a HistoryMaker and thanks for being our sister.  We love you.
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Speaker 2: Don't I have a great boss (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: And it's nice that he could be in the room where this happened (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes, it is nice that he could be in this room with us tonight, together with the first lady, who I'm so grateful--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that she's here, my sister.
Speaker 2: (Applause).
Story_ID: 641676
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You have a very interesting family.  And let's just take a minute to learn a little bit more about them.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Daniel Levin):  Valerie [HistoryMaker Valerie Jarrett] comes from a wonderful and very gifted family.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Antoinette Cook Bush):  Valerie and I share a great-grandfather [Robert Robinson Taylor] who was the first African American to graduate from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Barbara Bowman):  His grandfather was a slave owner.  His father [Henry Taylor] was a slave.  He was liberated at the end of the Civil War, but while he was still enslaved, his owner, who--but he was also his father, gave him permission to build buildings and make contracts on his own.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.):  He designed all of the buildings for the most part at the request of Booker T. Washington at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  In fact, he died in the chapel at Tuskegee that he designed and built.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Barbara Bowman):  Well, my father was Robert Taylor [Robert Rochon Taylor].  He took an active role in the community.  He was chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority for a number of years.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Toni Cook Bush):  Valerie's mother and her aunt, [HistoryMaker] Lauranita Dugas, grew up in what was called the Rosenwald building [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois], built by Julius Rosenwald.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Robert Zimmer):  Her father, in fact, James Bowman, Dr. Bowman [HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman], was a historic figure for the university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], and very particularly for the University of Chicago Medical School [Pritzker School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois].  He was the first African American tenured professor in the Department of Medicine.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Daniel Levin):  Her mother, Barbara [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman], has been responsible for the creation of an important early childhood education program [Erikson Institute, Chicago, Illinois], and, and she's still active in that, and she's respected in the community for, for her contribution in childhood education and other areas.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Barbara Bowman):  Valerie was born in Iran, and my husband and I went there, just maybe a year before she was born.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Elvin Charity):  Her father, this is a man, a physician, teacher, but who did not have opportunities in the United States.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Dr. James Bowman):  I heard about a excellent place in Iran.  There's a new hospital [Nemazee Hospital, Shiraz, Iran] that's being built.  They're looking for a chairman, Department of Pathology.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Barbara Bowman):  When we came back to Chicago [Illinois], and Jim decided to take the job at the University of Chicago Medical School, we immediately began to look for some place to live.  My mother [Laura Jennings Vaughn] was living in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] at the time, and so living close by my mother and my sister made a lot of sense.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Antoinette Cook Bush):  Valerie is an only child with dozens of siblings.  She had fifteen cousins that lived within a few blocks of her house.  Either Valerie's father or my mother took us to school every day.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of John Rogers, Jr.):  And it was just living in a magical community.  You know, just a block away was where Ann, Ann Jordan [HistoryMaker Ann Dibble Jordan] lived, which is Vernon Jordan's [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] wife.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Antoinette Cook Bush):  It was a very progressive community, and there was a lot of political activity in the community.  It was a very exciting and vibrant place to live.
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Speaker 2: Oh, that brings back memories.  Should we take a second and have my relatives stand up, who are here?  Okay family.  Represent.  Everybody up.
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Speaker 2: It was a lot of us, and we just roamed from house to house.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: And one person who's not here is your father, and it was so wonderful to see him in that clip.  He would be so proud.
Story_ID: 641677
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about your life tonight.  We're gonna talk about your childhood, your career, your experience in Washington [D.C.].  But I want to begin, if we can--you have a big family tree.  A lot of people are here in the audience, but I wanna reach back on a particular branch of that family tree to talk about your [maternal] great-grandfather and your [maternal] grandfather, Robert Robinson Taylor and Robert Rochon Taylor.  And I wanna begin with your great-grandfather 'cause he has an interesting story.  He's someone who h- was a history maker himself.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah, he sure was.  Here he's a--he was the son of a slave.  His father [Henry Taylor] was freed during his lifetime, probably freed by his own father who was his slave master.  And then he had the curiosity to leave his hometown and travel all the way to Massachusetts and be the first African American to graduate from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and he became an architect.  And the thought that back in the day when his father is a slave, he is able to become an architect is just extraordinary achievement.  And with that talent, he decided to go to Tuskegee.  It was called Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] back then, recruited by Booker T. Washington, and designed many of the buildings on the campus, and spent most of his life there.
Speaker 1: And he designed the buildings.  He helped build the buildings, and he was particularly industrious in that he taught the people who built the buildings how to actually build the materials, how to build the bricks for the buildings.
Speaker 2: Well, his students had to actually make bricks and build the dormitories that they then lived in.  And so I always say to young people today, "Don't complain about your dorm.  At least you didn't have to build your dorm."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it was a little different back then.  But it taught them all a great deal, and I think his legacy lives on that campus to this day.
Story_ID: 641678
Speaker 1: And his [Jarrett's maternal great-grandfather, Robert Robinson Taylor] son [Robert Rochon Taylor] continued that legacy.  He, too, was involved in building and building Chicago [Illinois], in particular.
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather was a businessman, a banker, and he also chaired the Chicago Housing Authority board at a time when the city wasn't really open to having public housing diversified around the city.  And he ultimately resigned because he believed that public housing should blend into the fabric of the community, that it should be temporary, that people who are living in public housing should be given the skills that they need, whether it's job training or social services, to get back on their feet.  And he provided that resource to them.  And when he found that the resources weren't coming and the City Council [Chicago City Council] wasn't willing to diversify the housing around the city, he resigned.
Speaker 1: You know, when you live in Chicago, when the Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois] were still standing, along the side of the Dan Ryan Expressway, you would turn on the news, you would flip on the radio, you'd pick up the newspaper, and you would often see that, that name, and it would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and I wondered as someone for whom that name meant so much, what that was like for you and your family?
Speaker 2: Well, it was very painful.  And my, my mom [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman] and my cousins who are here will remember sitting with my [maternal] grandmother [Laura Jennings Vaughn].  And any time the news came on and it said, Robert Taylor Homes, and it was usually something horrible that would happen, she would literally, just like clench up at the thought that this was her husband's legacy.
Story_ID: 641679
Speaker 1: I'm gonna move a little bit down the family tree branch and talk about your parents.  Your father is from Dun- D.C. [Washington, D.C.]  He went to Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].  He went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], undergraduate and medi- medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  And your mother and your father met in a very, very interesting way.
Speaker 2: But when my mom was sixteen, my dad was about twenty-one.  And he was still in medical school in Washington [D.C.].  And a friend of his set him up on a blind date with Lauranita then-Taylor [HistoryMaker Lauranita Dugas].  And she invited him home for dinner.  And so he came and had dinner, and met my mother when she was still only sixteen.  And then one day he called and my grandmother [Laura Jennings Vaughn] answers the phone, as the story goes--and by this time, Lauranita was engaged, and had well moved on.  And, but my mom was still home.  So my grandmother answers the phone, and my dad says, "Hi, this is Jimmy Bowman [HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman].  Is Lauranita home?"  And my grandmother says, "No, Jimmy, but Barbara [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman] is."
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: And the rest is history, (laughter) sixty-two years of marriage.
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Story_ID: 641680
Speaker 1: So your--as we heard, your mother [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman] started the Erikson Institute [Chicago, Illinois].  Your father [HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] had worked here, and you went--later on, after you left school here, you followed a family tradition.  You went to a boarding school that seven members of your family had attended.  And part of the posse came with you.  They actually followed you to the boarding school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so Toni [Antoinette Cook Bush] and Rochon [Rochon Dibble] who are here tonight, both--we all went away together.  And then the following year, Rochon's sister, Carla [ph.], joined us.  So it was really the best of everything.  We were away from home.  It was an excellent school.  It was rigorous.  It had lots of rules.  And so the theory was, we couldn't get into but so much trouble.  Our cousin, Gail [Gail Dugas], is at Tufts [Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts] in college, and so weekends, we would leave and be able to go and hang out with her and experience what that was like under some kind of modicum of supervision--
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: --maybe not as much as our parents thought.  But it was wonderful.  It was really, really perfect and a great transition to college because a lot of people, I think, are homesick, but how could you be homesick when you were there with your best friends (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You'd already been away from home.
Speaker 2: --and you had your family, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you'd already been away from home.
Speaker 2: And, yes, so college was easy because of that transition, I think.
Speaker 1: College was easy?
Speaker 2: Easy in that respect.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: In that respect.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: And, you know what, actually, I found Northfield Mount Hermon [Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] was so rigorous actually I didn't find Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] as challenging.
Speaker 1: And your decision to go to Stanford, there's something interesting there also because--
Speaker 2: Uh-oh (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) tradition weighs in your, in your childhood.  And I think there was, it sounds like there was an expectation that you might make another choice, and you decided that you wanted to go all the way to California to go to college.
Speaker 2: Yes, I guess I could confess to you.  I met a really cute guy who was there--
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: --when I was freshman in high school.  And he said, "You should go to Stanford," and from that moment on, I was going to go to Stanford.  But I really was looking for warm weather and a great environment, and one of my professors at Northfield Mount Hermon said, go somewhere where you can just spread your wings and have infinite possibilities.  And I thought Stanford was the perfect place, and it turned out to be. Loved it there.
Story_ID: 641681
Speaker 1: So Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] undergraduate, Michigan Law [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], and then a career in law here in Chicago [Illinois].  You began working for a law firm here in Chicago, but that was short lived.  You had someone who suggested that you might want to take a different path, advice that you say was some of the best advice that you've ever received.
Speaker 2: Best advice I've ever received.  So I was--let's see.  I was, I had practiced for six years.  Laura [Laura Jarrett] had been born, and I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Laura, your daughter.
Speaker 2: My daughter, Laura, yeah, and I went back after a four-month maternity leave, which was pretty generous back then.  We try to encourage every company to do that now.  But they were on the cutting edge of it.  And when I returned, I really began to realize how miserable I was, and not even that good at what I was doing.
Speaker 1: Well, let's take a look.  We have a clip (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Shall we?
Speaker 1: --that tells a little bit about your career.
Speaker 2: (NEWS CLIP OF HAROLD WASHINGTON)
Speaker 1: (HAROLD WASHINGTON):  How many of you are going to vote?  Now the sixty (unclear) dollar question: how many of you are going to vote for me?
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Elvin Charity):  I served in Harold Washington's administration during his first term.  And then when he won reelection in 1987, she called and said she was considering leaving the private practice and going to work for the Washington administration and could we get together for lunch?  And I just remember looking across the table from her and saying, "You know, you gotta do something different."
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Susan Sher):  I first met Valerie [HistoryMaker Valerie Jarrett] in 1989 in the beginning of the Daley [Richard M. Daley] administration when I came in as the number two person in the law department, and she was already a deputy in that department because she had started in the Washington administration.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Elvin Charity):  The mayor decided he wanted Valerie to lead this Department of Planning and Development [City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development].  Everybody wanted to hear what the commissioner of planning and development had to say.  That's when I realized that, that she had spread her wings, but more importantly, she knew she could fly.  And, and then I knew it was only a matter how high.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of John Rogers, Jr.):  I remember working closely with Valerie when I was president of the Chicago Park District and she was the planning commissioner for the City of Chicago.  She was gonna make those tough decisions and those tough calls to move our city forward, and to move our communities forward where there was so much need.
Speaker 2: (NEWS CLIP)
(REPORTER):  What did the mayor tell, Ms. Jarrett, what did he--what were your marching orders?
Speaker 2: (VALERIE JARRETT):  He was very clear.  He said go over to the agency and make it better, make the riders want to ride the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority], make it more efficient, make it a--make it the best transit system in the world.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Daniel Levin):  Valerie, at one time, had told me that she was interested in leaving the city and would I be interested in talking to her.  And I said, of course, I would, and so she came to my office at The Habitat Company [Chicago, Illinois], and we chatted.  And I offered her a position as executive vice president in charge of the public housing program and the affordable housing program.
Speaker 2: (NEWS CLIP)
(REPORTER):  The Chicago Housing Authority is proposing to build 241 units of scattered-site public housing here and has hired The Habitat Company as its developer.
Speaker 2: (VALERIE JARRETT):  What we're proposing is reducing the number of public housing families in the neighborhood, and I think that if done properly, this will be a catalyst for further development.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Kelly King Dibble):  And so what she tried to do is take a very holistic approach to redevelopment--not just using the city assets, which was a lot of vacant land, to rebuild new housing that was in close resemblance to the historic homes that were already there, to sort of fit into the fabric of community.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of William Goodyear):  Valerie, in Chicago, had public profile with all the roles she played for the city and so far.  She had her private impact at The Habitat, which she ran, and then we developed--we worked together in many of philanthropic and charitable organizations.  The Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois] comes to mind and others.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Robert Zimmer):  Valerie, herself, played a very important role at the university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  She served for many years on the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] board.  She was chair of the University of Chicago Medical Center board [Chicago, Illinois] for quite a number of years.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of John Rogers, Jr.):  Other leaders saw her as the ultimate leader who could really get things done and make a difference in these trusted positions.  You think about it, and the diversity of her leadership roles, to chair the Chicago Transit Authority, to chair the Chicago Stock Exchange [Chicago, Illinois] and then to chair the University of Chicago Hospital.  Those are, you know, totally different worlds, from the philanthropy to government to business.  That's a unique set of skills to be able to be--able to lead in all those different types of areas.
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Story_ID: 641682
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I wanna go back to your decision to leave the law firm.  Elvin Charity, who gave you that advice is here in the audience tonight.  And, you know, again, putting this in context, politics in Chicago [Illinois], what do they say?  "It ain't bean-bag."  And to decide that you want to enter politics.  For many it seems impenetrable.  I mean he was asking you to do something that would require quite a bit of muscle for you to put your shoulder down and try to bust into a really entrenched power system here.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't look at it as entering politics.  I looked at it as serving in government, and city government, a city that I loved dearly.  And what Elvin said to me is, look, you're miserable.  You can always work at a law firm, but Harold Washington is the mayor.  He's transforming the city.  It's an exciting time.  Why wouldn't you just try it out?  You have these great credentials which will be your safety net.  So give it a whirl.  And I had this beautiful office on the seventy-ninth floor of what was then called the Sears Tower [Willis Tower] in Chicago.  And I moved into a cubicle, facing an alley, and the window was looking out at the alley.  And as all the folks who worked with me there know, there was just the most wonderful activity going on.  I never regretted it.  I knew I was exactly where I belonged from day one.
Speaker 1: People who've known you a long time say that you started to find your voice in that position, in that office overlooking the alley.  What happened?  What was that transition?
Speaker 2: Well, a few things happened.  One--I'll say a couple of things.  So I started under Mayor Washington and then Mayor Sawyer [HistoryMaker Eugene Sawyer], and then Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley].  And when I was working under Mayor Washington and Mayor Sawyer, Elvin was our outside counsel, and Lucille Dobbins, who I think is here, was our client.  And they were so incredibly supportive of me.  And we would work all day, and then we'd go to my house so I could have dinner and make dinner and put Laura [Jarrett's daughter, Laura Jarrett] to bed.  And then we'd get--we'd start working again after dinner.  And actually, Lucille is the one that convinced me to go and ask my boss, Judd Miner, for a promotion.  And I think all too often, particularly women, are hesitant to ask for what they want.  And she kept nudging me and nudging me and nudging me.  And so one day, I went in, and I said all the reasons why I thought I should get the promotion.  And he said, "Okay."  And I thought, well, that was easy.  "Well, how about if I move up into to the suite of offices up in the front by you?"  And he's like, "No, no, there's a long line of folks to move up there."  I said, "Well, how about I'll just move in until somebody else moves in."  And so I did.  And that's where I stayed, and then when Mayor Daley was elected, Susan Sher came in, first, as first assistant, and her office was right next door to mine and forged what I know is gonna be a lifelong friendship.  And many of the people I worked with over those years are my dear, dear friends today, including, of course, Mayor Daley.  And we love to tell--Susan and I love to tell the story which I bet he will not even remember because one of the things I work on now in the White House [Washington, D.C.] is workplace flexibility and paid leave and paid sick time and try to make sure that both the private and the public sector employers understand that the needs of the 21st century worker are different.  Women are now half the workforce.  And soon after the mayor promoted me to commissioner of planning and development, Susan was corporation counsel, and we were in his office for a meeting.  And I can confess, he was--Mayor Daley, you were a little terrifying back then.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: I know you find that hard to believe.  Susan and I were a little nervous.  And we kept looking at our watches during this meeting, and he finally realized we weren't paying any attention at all.  And he said, "Well, obviously, you two are not interested in the meeting.  What, what's going on?"  And in this moment of truth that Susan and I still to this day cherish, I said, "Well, the Halloween parade starts at the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois]"--
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: --"in twenty minutes, and it's twenty-five minutes away."  And I'm blabbering on and on.  And he said, "Well, then what are you two doing here?"  And the relief we felt at that moment as we were flying down Lake Shore Drive, trying to get to the Lab School.  Susan's son, Evan [Evan Moore], and Laura were in second grade.  We pull up just as the door to the school opened, and the kids come flowing out in force.  They're looking in the crowd for us, and we were there because of you, Mayor Daley.  So we appreciate that.
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Story_ID: 641683
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I wanna reach back a little bit.  We were talking about Harold Washington, and we see his picture, you're just sort of taken aback.  I worked in Chicago [Illinois] during that period also, during the Harold Washington years for the Chicago Tribune.  And anybody who was here at that time, well remember, where they were and how they received the news when he passed away.  Where were you?
Speaker 2: I was in the law department, and his office on the fifth floor of City Hall [Chicago City Hall, Chicago, Illinois] was really just adjacent to the law department.  And one of the police officers who worked on the first floor, his sister worked in the law department.  And so they must have called down and said they thought he'd had a heart attack.  And so the sister told everyone in our office what had happened.  And we stood in the entryway which had a glass door that looked right onto his private office.  And so I was standing there when they took him out and could tell that, you know, the chances were not good for him.  It was a very, very hard day because keep in mind, I had left the law firm, thinking I was gonna be part of the Harold Washington movement, and I'd only been there a couple months when he died.
Speaker 1: And, and the whole city was thrown into a period of tumult after that.  I mean there was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was.
Speaker 1: --it was really a political scrum.  And, and people who remember that also said that you--that everyone who was in the middle of that took some sort of a lesson from that, that, that would leave an imprint on their career going forward.  For you, what was that lesson?
Speaker 2: Well, that one thing is that once you start that kind of movement and the momentum gets going, it's easier to carry it forward.  And I think he began the transformation of our city.  I think that continued under--certainly, during my time there with Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley].  And there was, there was--you could just feel the momentum.  And I think the city wanted to heal, and I think Mayor Daley made a lot of effort to go neighborhood by neighborhood around the city and build bridges that he knew were fractured.
Story_ID: 641684
Speaker 1: As you continued to work in civic roles in government, there again is the family legacy, following in your family's footsteps, making decisions that in some way keep that family legacy going.
Speaker 2: Well, what I loved about the Department of Planning and Development [City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development] is, is that we had prioritized not just revitalizing the downtown, but the neighborhoods as well.  And Kelly Dibble [Kelly King Dibble] took a huge leap of faith.  She was Kelly King back then.  She moved all the way from Massachusetts, came first, initially, to join us in the law department, working with Susan Sher, and then eventually joined me in the Department of Planning.  And the goal was to go out to neighborhoods, meet people where they were and build revitalization plans and use our resources at the city to be a catalyst for redevelopment, but development in a way that the people who lived there wanted to see happen.  And then, when Daniel Levin hired me at The Habitat Company [Chicago, Illinois], Habitat was the receiver for the Chicago Housing Authority, the scattered-site program, and then we took over a lot of the big redevelopments, including the redevelopment of the Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois].  And so it was so satisfying to, started the work at the city and being able to continue it from the private sector.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that, the redevelopment of the Robert Taylor Homes, and how that was like for you personally?
Speaker 2: Well, I think what we realized is, is that many of the buildings that had been built back fifty years ago were in horrible condition.  They were beyond repair, and the thought was to return back to the vision of my [maternal] grandfather [Robert Rochon Taylor] and build housing that's--blends into the fabric.  We selected architects for each neighborhood who studied that neighborhood and built housing that fit within the context of that neighborhood.  And, actually, Robert Taylor was one of the latter redevelopments that we did.  But before I left the city, the last building came down.
Story_ID: 641685
Speaker 1: You met two people who would change the trajectory of your life.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: You first met First Lady Michelle Obama, before she was first lady, and then you met Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  How did you meet?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--soon after Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley] appointed me deputy chief of staff, David Mosena was the chief of staff.  David's here as well, and we were trying to fill out our office and recruit people.  And Susan Sher sent me a resume and across the top it said, "Brilliant young woman has no interest in being at a private law firm."  And I thought, well, that must be my kind of person.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: So let me invite her in, and we had what was supposed to be like a twenty-minute interview in my office.  And an hour and a half later, I said, "Would you wanna come work here?"  I hadn't talked to David.  We hadn't talked to the mayor.  We just like gave her an offer--I gave her an offer on the spot, wisely, 'cause she was always old beyond her years.  She said, "Well, let me think about it."  So a couple days later, we're talking, and I said, "Well?"  And she said, "Well, my fiance, well, he has some reservations, and so we have some reservations."  I'm like, oh, dear.  Well, that's not sounding very good.  So she said, "Well, how about this, 'cause I'm still interested.  Would you be willing to have dinner with us?"  And so the three of us had dinner, and I guess the dinner went pretty well (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: Twenty-five years ago this summer.  So I saw something very extraordinary in the two of them, both in terms of their love for each other, and they were engaged and planning their life as a unit, not as separate people, but also respecting each other's individuality.  And I didn't know then where life would take us, but I just knew they were--yeah, who knew?  But I did know they were pretty special. Pretty special people.
Story_ID: 641686
Speaker 1: People always, people know that you have served as a consigliere for the, for the president of the United States [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], but I'm wondering in those early years, what kind of advice was he giving you?  What kind of advice was the first family giving you?
Speaker 2: We talked a lot about raising children and what that was like, the work-life balance.  I remember when the first lady interviewed for a job at the University of Chicago Hospitals [University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois], and babysitter didn't show up or something, and she had to take Sasha [Sasha Obama] to the interview.  And we talked and she said, well, you know what?  This is my life, and so if Mike Riordan [Michael C. Riordan] doesn't like this, he'd better find out before he give me the job because Sasha might show up from time to time.  And I mean, so these struggles of working parents are something that were very real in our lives, and I think you often hear the president talk about when he was in Springfield [Illinois], and Sasha and Malia [Malia Obama] were young, the pressure that put on Michelle [Michelle Obama] to carry the responsibility of the family and the pressure that put on him, knowing that he's down there, and they're at home.
Speaker 1: And it's interesting that you talk a lot about work-family balance, but you're working in very demanding jobs, and you're also--as your civic activity increase--you also serve on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  As you're going through this, I wonder if you learn something about civic governance when you're also serving on corporate boards, if there's an interesting balance there.
Speaker 2: Well, I think what's interesting about Chicago [Illinois]--and now that I've had a chance to see the country, Chicago is a unusual city in that the connection between the civic community and the business community is so close.  I mean many of the business leaders serve on museum boards and hospital boards, and make major contributions to our city's civic life and its over health and beauty.  And because of that, the relationships that I built oftentimes on my not-for-profit boards, forge the relationships that then took me into the for-profit world.  And I think that's part of why I kept saying, yes, is, is that I only said, yes, to join a board where I felt that the CEO had incredible integrity, and I believed in their mission, and I believed that I could again make a contribution.  And I just was so fortunate during my time here to have such a broad spectrum of experiences in both the public and the private section.
Speaker 1: And you then took on two chairmanships and not just any chairmanships.  I--we could basically say they're mega chairmanships.  You were the first woman to chair the Chicago Stock Exchange [Chicago, Illinois], and you chaired the University of Chicago Medical Center board, as we heard from John [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] in the clip.  Did anyone at any point say, you're saying yes, to a lot of things?
Speaker 2: Yes, my daughter (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: I remember one day feeling overwhelmed.  And I said, wait a minute.  You voluntarily joined these boards.  This must be what you enjoy doing.  And it just kind of like was a gut check to myself to say, okay, this is my life.  I like it like that.  I like to do a lot of different things.  It's part of what I enjoy about my job now.  And in that, though, I was fortunate to work both for bosses and also in institutions, organizations that valued family.  And I know I couldn't have done what I have done without the support of those institutions and those bosses because there wasn't a time in that entire arc where Laura [Laura Jarrett] wasn't the most important thing in my life.  And that meant you had to be there.  You couldn't do that in an absentee way when you're a single mom (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 641687
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk a little bit about your, your path to Washington [D.C.].  At one point, Barak Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] decided to run for office, and did he seek your advice early on--
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I should say president.  It's hard to say his name without saying President Obama now, so forgive me for doing that, but President Obama, before he was President Obama, decided to run for office.  Did he seek your advice?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we talked about it when he first ran for State Senate [Illinois State Senate] and then when he ran for [U.S.] Congress and lost.  And then I remember very vividly as certainly will John [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.], when he decided to run for the U.S. Senate because we had a little conspiracy going that we were all gonna come to my house and have breakfast.  This was at the first lady's [Michelle Obama] thought, and we were gonna convince him not to do this.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: And, I mean it was like a best-laid plan, except at the end of the breakfast, not only did we all fully embrace the idea, but the last thing, I was like, "Well, how are you gonna raise any money?"  He said (laughter), "Well, you're gonna chair my finance committee."
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, but I--but the lesson in this, and it was a good one, was he said--'cause we were afraid that so soon after losing to Congressman Rush [HistoryMaker Bobby Rush], that if he ran again, then that would be the end of his political career.  Well, it would have been the end if he'd run and lost.  And so I kept expressing fear.  And I will never forget.  He said, "Look, if I'm prepared to take that chance, then you should join me and support me, and what's the worst thing that's gonna happen?  I'm gonna lose."  And being willing to kind of look failure in the face and, and overcome it.  Well, that's courage, and that's a pretty important lesson in life.
Story_ID: 641688
Speaker 1: We have a clip that'll take a look at that transition and your ent- your entry into a different political world.  Let's take a look.
Speaker 2: (Film clip of John Rogers, Jr.):  When the president was making the tough decision about whether to run for the United States Senate or not, you know, it was a, not an easy decision.  He had lost to [HistoryMaker] Bobby Rush in that congressional race.  People didn't see a future for him in politics or a way forward in Chicago [Illinois], and Valerie [HistoryMaker Valerie Jarrett] was the one that said, all of us who are in the private sector, who care about these broader values, we have a responsibility to help support you.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Richard J. Durbin):  And so as we got into the campaign, I noticed big decisions being made, and Valerie was always there.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Sheryl Sandberg):  She also really cared about giving him an opportunity to reach people.
Speaker 1: (NEWS CLIP)
(REPORTER):  The newest poll from The Des Moines Register shows Senator Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] ahead by 29 percent.
Speaker 1: (NEWS CLIP)
Speaker 2: (VALERIE JARRETT):  I was with Senator Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] yesterday, and I--when I think what's more important than the polls that come and go week-to-week is what we're hearing on the ground.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of William Goodyear):  And I said, "What are you going to do when the campaign wraps up?"  And she said, "Well, I don't think you understand.  We're gonna win the caucus and we're gonna win the nomination."
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Kelly King Dibble):  I think that the race speech was needed if he felt that was, maybe, maybe he would say it or maybe not.  I think she was probably behind him, saying, "Do it."
Speaker 1: (NEWS CLIP)
Speaker 2: (BARACK OBAMA):  I am married to a black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave owners, an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters [Sasha Obama and Malia Obama].
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Martin Nesbitt):  And it turned out to be one of the great political speeches of our time.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of John Rogers, Jr.):  And the president and Michelle [Michelle Obama] needed that kind of candid advice, that kind of visionary advice as they were going down this extraordinary, difficult path to become president of the United States and first lady.
Speaker 1: (NEWS CLIP)
Speaker 2: (PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA):  If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Arne Duncan):  Valerie always told me what I needed to hear, not necessarily what I wanted to hear.  That's sometimes a little bit of a rare commodity (laughter) in Washington [D.C.].  And that's the only way you get better.
Speaker 2: (NEWS CLIP)
Speaker 1: (VALERIE JARRETT):  The president doesn't shy away from talking to people with whom he may have a difference of opinion, and it's a great opportunity--
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Laura Jarrett):  Her role in the administration has been, I think, an inspiration to, you know, not only me, but a lot of young women because of her prioritization of women and girls.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of Susan Sher):  So she's in charge of the White House Committee on Women and Girls [sic. White House Council on Women and Girls], where they are constantly thinking about ways that young girls can get the tools they need to be successful.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Eric Holder):  When we were in the process of trying to decide how we were going to respond as an administration to what happened in Ferguson [Missouri], Valerie, the president and I really sat down.  And the three of us crafted what was gonna be the administration's response and ultimately led to the decision to send me to Ferguson to interact with people in the community there.
Speaker 1: (Film Clip of James McNerney):  She was a very trusted advisor and had enormous influence and looked out for him.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip of Eric Holder):  She has used the power that her position has given her, the access that her position has given her, really to advance the causes of people who for too long have been forgotten, who have been unheard.  And I think she leaves this nation better and certainly has served this president, I think, extremely well.
Speaker 1: (Applause) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Story_ID: 641689
Speaker 1: You know, I think everybody in the room, you could hear a little bit of a (gasp) when you saw Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois].  At that point, there had only been four African American U.S. senators in the history of the United States.  And his, his path to the presidency was interesting, and you have been a close advisor to him [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] throughout all of that.  And I'm interested in hearing from you, as you watched people watch him, first as an outsider, as someone who had an unusual name, as someone that people didn't recognize.  And then there's this moment, at the convention [2004 Democratic National Convention, Boston, Massachusetts], where he delivers a speech, and suddenly people start paying a little bit more attention.  And, and as they start paying attention, you kept saying that nothing had changed inside the campaign, that you had always known that, that this moment would come.
Speaker 2: Well, I can't say I always knew he would be president, but I always knew who he was, what his core values were, what motivated him, what drove him to shy away from the corner office in that law firm that I talked about, where he could have been making oodles of money, and pour his heart and soul and sacrifice enormously to jump in the arena.  And it's a fearlessness, and, you know, absence of fear of failure and, and one of the, I think, key lessons that I've learned from him because earlier, I would tend to get agitated when you read what's happening in the polls or you look at what was going on around cable.  He told several of our good friends--we used to watch too much cable.  He'd say, "Just turn off the television and take the long view.  Focus on the long view and then it will allow you to just turn off the noise."  That doesn't mean you don't listen to people because a big part of my job in the Office of Public Engagement [White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs] is engaging people, but you also know the difference between noise and constructive contribution.  And he's always been able to do that.  It's what has given him--I think it's a real blessing to have the temperament that he does throughout this incredible journey that he's been on because he doesn't, he just doesn't sweat it.  He just--he cares deeply and he focuses on what he cares deeply about, and that gives him enough strength.  And he's surrounded by these women in his life who love him dearly, and that's the sustenance he needs to do what he's done.
Speaker 1: Do you share that temperament?
Speaker 2: I think I've gotten better at it.  I think I was always pretty even keeled.  Don't you think I've gotten a little better?  I used to get a little agitated, but I, I think I am much calmer now because I've seen, I've seen what has been able to happen with that long view.  I mean there's so many major accomplishments that people said to him, "You'll never be able to do this."  And he did.
Story_ID: 641690
Speaker 1: Did you have any inkling that you might one day move to Washington [D.C.] or were you determined to stay in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: When he [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] joined the [U.S.] Senate?
Speaker 1: When he joined the Senate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --did you ever think that there might--
Speaker 2: No, because it--I mean I'll be honest with you.  When he joined the Senate, I really wasn't thinking, well, he's gonna be running for president any time soon, and I was extremely happy at The Habitat Company [Chicago, Illinois].  We were doing great stuff.  I had a life here, and so not at first, but I will say it became clearer after he'd been there--I don't know, six months or so, that there was some magic in the bottle, as he likes to put it, going on around our country and that there was a hunger for his kind of leadership.  So I didn't really think about what would--what I would do.  I just thought about what we were trying to get done.
Speaker 1: And when you worked on the campaign, did you think that you would move to Washington at that point?
Speaker 2: I didn't, I really didn't think about it that much at the time at all until it became really clear that he was gonna win.  And then one day, he said, "You know, if I win, I think you should come with us."  And I said, "Yeah, I guess that's right, I guess that's right."
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: Wait, that was you--you didn't think about it.  You didn't deliberate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, I did think about it.  I thought about the Senate seat, as I think everybody in here knows, but I think as a result of a conversation I had with both the first lady [Michelle Obama] and then the president, he said, "Look, I know the Senate.  I know what I wanna do in the White House [Washington, D.C.].  I know the role I think you could play here, and there's just no choice in the matter.  You should come."  And with that, I thought, you're right.
Speaker 2: So at that point, he's still on the campaign, and if you spend a lot of time on a campaign, it is a unique opportunity to learn about America.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: You go to places that, that you just normally would not get to.  You see people at their best, and not at their best.  And you have a chance to watch Americans step up and, and tell you the things that they really care about.  What did you learn about America in the course of--
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, I learned where Iowa was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the first campaign in particular.
Speaker 2: I spent a lot of time in Iowa, and what I liked about Iowa--and it's a, it is really kind of a, a microcosm of democracy at its best because people in Iowa are very engaged.  And I would be in the car, and he'd make a phone call.  And, you know, he has this long call list of people he's touching base with, and this was the sixteen-year old daughter of somebody who, you know, might be able to help him.  And she says, "I'm sorry, I'm studying right now.  I can't talk to you."  And it's humiliating.  He said, "I can't get the sixteen-year old to talk to me?"
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: But that's the way Iowa is.  You have to earn each and every vote, and it's a really good process.  And, you know, we, we complained mightily about the primary season and how long it lasted.  But I think it was good for us because it forced us to travel all over the country and go to states where if Iowa had been the precedent and New Hampshire had followed, we might not have visited during the primary season.  And you just meet these amazing people, really ordinary people who are doing amazing things and who care about our country deeply, and who are willing to get invested in it.  And the young people on our campaign, just amazing young people.

Speaker 1: Who's the person you met that's still--that you still think about all the time, that you met on the campaign?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I've told you this story.  Maybe I have, but there is one gentleman named Earl Smith, who I think about every single day.  And we met him in Texas, and that was at a point in the campaign where I was like okay, enough is enough.  It was a tough primary, and you'll remember, the first lady [Michelle Obama], the night of that primary.  And we were just finishing up--the president was just finishing up a debate.  And he had a cold, and it was like 7:30 in the morning, and he was grumpy.  He's not really a morning person--it's not a secret.  He's really not a morning person.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: And we get in the elevator, and there was an older gentleman in the elevator who'd been operating our elevator during the three days that we were there.  And he clears his throat, and I thought, oh, don't start a conversation now.  It's probably not the best time.  And he says to the president, "I wanna give you something."  And so we all kind of looked to see what--Eric Whitaker [Eric E. Whitaker] was there in the elevator with us.  He's here too.  And it was a patch from his [U.S.] military uniform.  And so then Senator Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] realizes what it is, and he says, "Oh, I couldn't possibly accept that."  And they go back and forth and back and forth.  And then finally, Mr. Smith says, "Sir, I have carried this patch with me every day for forty years.  It has kept me strong.  It has kept me safe, and you have a long journey ahead, and I want you to have it."  And I burst into tears.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean uncontrollably.  Eric was crying.  He may not admit it.  He was crying.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: And it was one of the first times where I saw somebody just give a stranger something in the hopes that it would give him some strength.  And later in the day, I asked the then-senator, "What did you do with that patch?"  And he said, "I put it in my pocket."  And I thought, you know, typical guy.  I didn't mean, where did you put it?  I mean how did it make you feel that--
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: --he gave you this--
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: --cherished possession.  You know what I'm talking about, fellas.  And so he says to me, as he is wont to say, "Valerie [HistoryMaker Valerie Jarrett], I mean I put it in my pocket."  So he pulls out all of these trinkets and he lays them on the table, and he proceeds to tell the story about every trinket and why it's so special and why he keeps it in his pocket.  And to this day, his pocket is full of those trinkets.  And so my long answer to your question, I made up my mind that Earl is who we are fighting for.  And every day, as I come through the gates of the White House [Washington, D.C.], every single day since the first day, I pause and I think about Earl.  And I say, it centers me, it grounds me, and it, it allows me to ignore the Republicans in [U.S.] Congress, and I just--any time I start to get agitated, I think about Earl.  And he's--he came back for the State of the Union this year, and after the last election, he came to inauguration and he came in the Oval Office, and he saluted the president.  And the president thanked him for his service to our country.  And our country is full of people just like Earl.  And unfortunately, one of my frustrations, which is why I said I didn't really like the fixture, is that we don't see enough of that.  We don't see enough of that in the media.  We certainly don't see enough of that reflected in what happens in Congress.  And Earl is what we should all be thinking about, every single day.  Think about Earl.
Speaker 1: (Applause).

Speaker 1: (Applause)
Speaker 2: At some point during the campaign--you were never anonymous, but your, you became very well-known because of your proximity, because people go to know you better, because the spotlight shifted onto this campaign.  And as that happened, when you would walk into rooms, people would respond to you.  When you moved to Washington [D.C.], there was a very hot spotlight placed on you.  You were not always comfortable with that.  How did you handle that?
Speaker 1: Stayed close to my family in Washington.  I mean every Sunday I go to Toni's [Antoinette Cook Bush] house for dinner.  Ann [HistoryMaker Ann Dibble Jordan] and Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] come over, and we just have a small dinner.  I have a group of girlfriends who I have brunch with every Sunday as well.  And so at least once a week--and they are all here, my whole group that I have lunch with: Susan [Susan Sher], Karol [Karol Mason], Renee [Renee McCoy-Collins], Kelly [Kelly King Dibble], now, Tina [Tina Tchen].  Since her daughter went away to college, she's joined our group.  And if you do, if you ground yourself with people who knew you back in the day and who love you unconditionally, then you can get out there and fight that fight the next, the next Monday morning.  So that has been invaluable to me.
Speaker 2: Did you have to develop a certain amount of, almost like a callus to protect yourself from that glare?
Speaker 1: You have to get used to taking a licking, oh, yeah.  I mean it's--I thought Chicago [Illinois] was tough, woo, baby.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: It's nothing compared to Washington.  I mean Chicago you always kind of knew it was rough and tumble, but people really cared about the city, and they might have disagreed about the means, but not the ends.  And I think in Washington, what we've seen, frankly, is a few people really make up their mind that their goal is to try to hurt the president and hurt those who are around him, even if it means that they're not taking that long view, and especially, it means they're not taking the long view, that their goal is just to be obstructionists.  And if you think about it, Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Norris], when the president took office, I mean people forget, our economy was crumbling.  It was in a free fall, and so to have that happening, and then you have the, you know, where in the [U.S.] Senate, Senator McConnell [Mitch McConnell] saying his number one objective is to make sure that President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] isn't reelected.  And I'm like, really?  You don't think we should try to like stabilize the financial markets or re- and/or revitalize our automobile industry or end a couple wars or give people--20 million people healthcare?  I mean that's not what we should be doing?  We should just be trying to stop President Obama? And that is a toxicity that, he said, is just his biggest disappointment, that we can't break that.  And so it's really gonna take a lot of effort from the American people to make that change.
Story_ID: 641693
Speaker 1: In Washington [D.C.], the president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] has contributed significantly to the national conversation that we have around race.  He did that early on in his campaign with a speech on race as we saw in front of that phalanx of flags in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He's done that throughout his campaign.  And, and I'm interested in your particular role because he often seeks your counsel in talking about these things, and people in the White House [Washington, D.C.] also seek your counsel.  When you wind up wading into these waters, usually because the president has something to say or because national events pull you in that direction.
Speaker 2: After the death of Trayvon Martin, when he said, "If I had a son, he would look like me," a lot of people knew what that meant, and it was deeply moving and touching to them.  When he went to Charleston [South Carolina], and gave the eulogy for Reverend Pinckney [Clementa Pinckney], it was really a lesson about the black church and how open and welcoming it is, not to strangers, even though the black church has a history of people attacking it, bombing it, killing children, and yet it's still open.  And so he thought, well, let's not just eulogize Reverend Pinckney which is important.  And let's not just express our sorrow for these eight additional people who were killed, but let's talk about the issue, and let's talk about, it's not just taking down a flag.  It's early childhood education for every child.  It's making sure that all of our schools are good.  The work that Arne [Arne Duncan] did when he was there was to help every school child, not just those who had the benefit of--public school kids so, so that you really lean into those occasions when people are raw and emotional and more likely able to listen.
Speaker 1: And that day, that was an incredible day at the White House (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, what a day, what a day.
Speaker 1: --because what a--I mean from my perspective, what a news day.  From your perspective, what a day in terms of--
Speaker 2: It was a roller coaster.  It was at ten o'clock in the morning, and we were all in the chief of staff, Denis McDonough's office, and the [U.S.] Supreme Court delivers their decisions first thing in the morning, ten o'clock.  And we had just had a major decision [King v. Burwell, 2015] the day before on the Affordable Care Act [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010].  And so we thought, oh, well, there's no way they're gonna decide this [Obergefell v. Hodges, 2015] today.  So we basically had forgotten it was a Supreme Court day. And my assistant comes down and delivers a note saying, "Supreme Court rules on marriage equality, five-four in our favor."  And so I rushed down to the Oval Office and the president isn't there.  And I was like, well, now what do I do?  So I call him, and he's busy working on the eulogy.  And so he says, "What?"  (Laughter) So I said, "Marriage equality came down, five-four."  And I hear a pause, and he says, "And who won?" (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: It's like you're burying the lede there.  And so he said, "Boy, it's been a really good week."  Again, massive understatement.  I said, "Yeah, it has been a really good week."  And he comes down to the Oval, he's working on the eulogy.  He places a phone call to the plaintiff in the marriage equality case, and then we fly down to Charleston, and the families were incredible.  I mean they're--as he said, amazing grace, so soon after tragedy, and yet when the president and first lady [Michelle Obama] traveled around and talked to each of them, they were talking about what to do that's good for the community in the honor of their family members who died.  So it was summer camp or--it was incredible.  And then we come back, and the president had agreed to put lights on the White House in the rainbow, symbolic of the LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender] community; never been done before.  We've done it for breast cancer awareness.  I mean that's probably the only time, right, Tina [Tina Tchen], that we've done a color on the White House.  And they figured out how to do this multicolored rainbow.  And Tina and I and about thirty or forty other staff who had worked on LGBT issues, stood out in front on the North Portico, which is the front door of the White House, as the sun went down and watched these brilliant colors pop out onto the White House.  And I think it's okay to say that later that evening the first lady snuck outside to see it 'cause she had only been able to see it on television.  And she wa- she and, I think, Malia [Malia Obama], wanted to see it for themselves.  And so, what a day, what a day.

Speaker 1: And what an evening.  It has been wonderful to spend an evening learning about you, learning about your family.  But we need to know something because we're coming to the last chapter of the Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] administration, and we wonder what that means for you?  What do you plan to do next?
Speaker 2: Sleep (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you.
Speaker 1: But you have miles to go before you sleep.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: We're gonna make sure that every single day we do as much as we can.  You don't get to go this way but once in a lifetime.  And that goes for everybody.  So let's like, make it count, right, make it count.
