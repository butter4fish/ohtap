Story_ID: 100342
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to come back and explore the details of your work later on in the interview.  But, we'd like to go back and take a look at your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Your birth, and growing years so we have a context in which to look at your professional life and your accomplishments.  (Clearing throat)  Let's start with your mother, if we can.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother, tell me her name, where and when she was born, where she grew up, what you know about her growing up here.
Speaker 2: Sure.  My mother is Barbara Joanne Sykes, she was born in Jamaica, New York, in Queens, in 1931.  She's still alive and lives in Jamaica Plain, today, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.  She was daughter of an entrepreneur, a welder, a woman who was a podiatrist, owned a bar with her husband and moved from Hell's Kitchen in New York, where she was born, my grandmother [Ida Johnson Swann] to Queens when there were cows roaming around the streets in Queens.  They became very much a part of New York society and she was friends with people like Adam Clayton Powell and members of groups, like the (unclear) and began to move around New York, pretty adeptly including spending summers up in Harlem with her--my aunt, great aunt, and her aunt, Lucille, who was a doctor in Harlem in the '50s [1950s], and '40s [1940s] actually.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  What was her last name? --the doctor, the aunt...
Speaker 2: Oh, now you got me.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's passed away a little while ago.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  I've done a lot of work on history of medicine in Harlem (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's interesting.
Speaker 2: I'll have to find it for you.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: I have a book with her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, I forgot.  She's a school teacher; that's a very important part of her life.  She taught first in New York on Long Island, after going to LIU [Long Island University].  Later on, taught in Rhode Island where we moved because my father became a professor at Rhode Island College.  But, my mother taught in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Becoming Teacher of the Year, and now is a recovering teacher, tutoring my two children.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.  Did you mother share with you, as you were growing up, special stories or things that happened to her in her earlier life that she wanted to share with you are there things that stand out; her memoirs to you?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, to a degree.  I think my mother is very much a here and now person, as opposed to a past person.  And, while moving from New York to Rhode Island was a big change for her.  I think she took it to be the best opportunity.  But, she always operated in the present.  We have some photos of her, apparently trying to integrate Valley Stream, New York.  'Cause I can see myself at age six, with a backyard full of black, white, red, yellow kids at a time in the 1960s when that got to have been a challenging motion--moment.  But, I think that speaks to her very much living in the present as much as sharing her history.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Some of the history she has shared was living history that I was able to experience because of both my grandparents were alive during a good portion of, of my growing up, her parents, in fact.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, we were able to go back to Maryland, where my grandfather was from and found out a bit about that history.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  Tell me about that grandfather, your mother's father.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was [J.] Ballard Swann [ph.].  Ballard grew up being both black and with some distant Linape Tribe influences from the down in the Maryland area.  They lived in Burtonsville.  He grew up in a very interesting background with spending some time with the Pennsylvania Dutch in his schooling days in elementary school.  And, eventually, my grandparents, Ida [Johnson] Swann and Ballard ended up moving from New York back to Burtonsville, the area outside of, outside of Maryland.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: In between Maryland and Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, and there was some history there of growing up on the farm, the family farm, too, that she shared.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, she sort of had two lives.  I think there was the grand--the father's farm life--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: More rural roots, a very quiet guy and the grandmother's more New York, you know, lively times.  But, they spent most of their lives in Queens, in Jamaica.  And, him welding in the Brooklyn Navy Yards.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  Okay.
Story_ID: 100343
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father.  Would you give me his name and when he was born and where he was born and a little bit about his growing years.
Speaker 2: Sure.  My father is Lawrence Sykes, Lawrence Francis Sykes, also born in 1931.  He, he was actually born in Decatur, Alabama, where my grandfather spent some time, that was where his roots were from.  Later on, moving to Baltimore [Maryland] and my father spent his form-formal [sic, formative] years in Baltimore, basically growing up and playing ball and then going on to study at Pratt Institute in New York [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: To train to be an Art Professor, taught for a brief period of time at Shimer High School in, in Queens.  And, later on coming to Rhode Island to Rhode Island College [Providence, Rhode Island] to be a professor, where he spent most of his time as a Professor of Art and Photography, mostly photography.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  Tell me a little bit more about his growing years and what he shared with you about his childhood and teenage years.
Speaker 2: Again, because my--both of my grandparents were alive on that side, as well, while I was growing up I got to experience their history.  But, to focus on my father's time, I heard a lot about growing up in Baltimore, going to Dunbar High School, playing pick-up ball in the Borscht Belt as he made his way through college working as a waiter--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, getting with the best coaches he could get about a revelation that, you know, sort of got him to the epiphany of ball was not going to be his life.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, that at 6'8", while he had that attribute, that he had decided to be a--an instructor, and an educator.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  Reading the materials that you shared with me this morning, let's talk about your father's father, Frank 'Doc' Sykes.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about your paternal grandfather, and give me his name and where he was born and grew up.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Doctor, well, Frank Jehoy Sykes was one of eleven children.  Son of So-Solomon [Sykes and Ada Garth Sykes], who was interestingly enough going back one more generation, a coal owner and entrepreneur owned a family mortuary business in Decatur, Alabama at a time that that was spun off by white folks not wanting to handle black bodies and so it became an opportunity for him.  The whole family was trained in the mortuary arts.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Meaning my father and his brothers.  He was, he was an entrepreneur of saloons, coal, and, and the mortuary.  He insisted on education for his kids.  And, my grandfather was one of those children who was a beneficiary.  He went to Atlanta Baptist College before it was Morehouse University [sic, Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia].  Upon a note, he was admitted to Howard University Dental School [Howard University College of Dentistry in Washington, D.C.].  He moved to Howard Dental School, where he played, he played professional ball in the Negro Leagues.
Speaker 1: What year did he leave Atlanta Baptist to go to Howard?
Speaker 2: I think it was 1918.  Actually, 1921, I'm sorry.  And from '21 [1921] into the late '20s [1920s], he was at, at Howard Dental-- dent.  But, he was come--at the same time working as a Pullman porter, going to Howard Dental School and playing in Negro Leagues, moving around the east coast, played for the Br--Brooklyn Royal Giants and the Braves, Homestead Braves, and the Monarchs--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: My children had a chance to see him in the travelling Negro League Show out of the Kansas City Museum of--of the Negro Leagues [Negro League Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, he--he's been a great inspiration, a quiet inspiration.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Because he, he's somebody who quietly did the right thing.  And, if you read his history, you'll, you'll discover that whether it was furnishing the getaway car for the Scottsboro Boys so they weren't lynched at a time that that was unheard of, or giving testimony to allow black people to be on juries--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Now, you knew your grandfather?
Speaker 2: I did know my grandfather.  My grandfather attended my graduation from Cornell University [Ithaca, New York].  He had the good luck to be lived, lived to be 93.  And, was quite a spitfire, in that he was driving 'til he was 90 around the streets of Baltimore, 'til we took his car away.  He was a skeet shooter, he was a member of many professional medical fraternities.  And, upon his funeral, upon his passing, I remember it being the most memorable funeral I could remember, because it was so positive.  Everybody's spirit of--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --all of the folks who admired him--
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was, let's see, '90--'93 [1993], would have been probably 1980, '81 [1981], '82 [1982]; thereabouts, '81, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  What are your earliest memories of you grandfather, Dr. Sykes?
Speaker 2: My earliest memories are going to his home, home office on Preston Street in Baltimore, where the front parlor was the dentist's office and the--just a stair away was the dining room.  And, I remember hearing the sound of the drills, drilling away on people's teeth and I remember also castings, always around people's teeth.  Because, at that time, I think they chose to remove, rather than replace or--fix teeth more.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, that, that's one of the memories I have of him.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  Did he take care of your teeth when you were a youngster?
Speaker 2: No, he was not allowed to take care of my teeth.  I don't know who took care of my teeth.  But, he had quite a following.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 100344
Speaker 1: What are some of the stories that he [Sykes' grandfather, Frank Jahoy "Doc" Sykes] told you about his early years as a child?  Did he share with you--?
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  You know, he didn't s---again, didn't spend a lot of time sharing much about his history.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: It was more stories I'd get from my father [Lawrence Sykes] about my grandfather--
Speaker 1: Um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, then upon his celebration at Howard University [D.C.] on his 90th birthday, it was a fair amount of digging done and he never touted his own, never tooted his own horn, never touted his own successes.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I think he was very proud of his shooting clubs and, you know, the professionalism which he did his, his craft as a dentist.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: He didn't share that much about his baseball period in the Negro Leagues, although I've had a chance to read more--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --recently.
Speaker 1: Kind of tell us a little bit about his time with the Negro Leagues; the teams that he played for and what decade is this--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, I think that if you read the articles about him playing with, as I said, Homestead Grays, with the Monarchs, with the Brooklyn Royal Giants. It was funny.  To tell a story, one day I was in a, in a woman's shopping area, clothing store in, in New Rochelle [New York] with my wife.  And, she had got into a conversation with the store owner, who was white.  And, had mentioned that my father--grandfather was Doc Sykes.  And, the man was besides himself, because it turns out he was a phenomenal fan of documenting the Negro Leagues and went on to run out the store and track me down and begin to tell me about pitching the perfect game.  Because, one of the histories that I never heard until later on was that he had actually pitched a no hitter.  And, and I'm not the best baseball aficionado, but I know enough to that that was quite a feat.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And this was something the stop--store-- shop owner raved about Doc Sykes and the perfect game.  And so, that is one of the memories that I do have.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  What do you know about his work as a Pullman porter?  Did you get any information on that?
Speaker 2: More recently, I've been reading "Rising from the Rails," and, you know, I was thrilled to come across an interview on National Public Radio of the writer [Larry Tye] of "Rising from the Rails," who happened to be white to my surprise, talking about how the Pullman porter's profession gave rise to the black middle class and how these folks moved around the country, both experiencing and taking stories with them as they moved to different parts.  But, also experiencing freedoms that were not afforded to most folks; especially, most folks growing up in Decatur, Alabama.  Now, he had a little money in his pocket.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: He had the bravado of being the Negro League player.  I'm sure he had quite the life that he never told us about.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  His Pullman porter years, was this before he went to Howard or while he was at Howard?  Or, when he left, when was--
Speaker 2: While he was at Howard, he actually worked his way through as a Pullman porter.  So, this would have been in the mid '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, he had an interesting sort of history of having completed that experience as a Pullman porter and going back to Decatur [Alabama] to set up shop as a dentist after he finished at Howard University.  I think it was only the Scottsboro Trial and his being run out of the south by a Klan [Ku Klux Klan] with a cross burned on his lawn.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: That sent him packing back up to Baltimore [Maryland], where he actually set up his final stay.
Speaker 1: His stay.
Speaker 2: So, he stayed briefly in Baltimore.  He came back to tend to matters in Decatur and then ended up getting into more matters than he planned, which sent him back up to Baltimore, ultimately where he stayed--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --Until he passed.
Speaker 1: Now, his Negro Baseball League experience, was that while he was a student at Howard--
Speaker 2: Well, he played for Howard University.  And then it's unclear to me where the, where the distinctions were made.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, unlike now, where people leave school to go pro.  I think there were some abilities to sort of blur the distinction.  So, I think that some of that evolved while he was at Howard and later on.  I don't recall that he was ever solely a player in the Negro League.  It always seemed as though he was doing something else, whether it was dentistry or the Pullman porter activities.
Story_ID: 100345
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of growing up?  How far back can you remember, as a child?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I, I, again, I don't know if this is a trend in our family; I, I tend to be someone who lives in the present.  I don't dwell much on what I did last year or last week.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I did have the good fortune to have both parents [Barbara Sykes and Lawrence Sykes] who were academics.  And, and what that meant was that we had three months together every year. And, that being a parent and being a working person who's not in that luxury--luxurious situation is what probably makes me most remember big chunks of time where we would do interesting things as a family.  And, one I remember, is when I was eight, traveling across country.  We decided we would drive for several weeks, which actually turned into about a two month trip, camping across America with my cousin [Kim Swann].  And I was eight, he was ten.  And, my parents were driving.  And, we saw America and actually we have photos of there--you know, just in an interesting way.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: That's one of the ones that I do remember.  I do remember going back to Valley Stream [New York], where I moved to, as I said, after being born in Queens and then a brief stint in Baltimore [Maryland].  We moved to Valley Stream, I grew up there in my first, second and third grade.  And, I do remember it being a su--a true suburb, a new suburb, a new town.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: In the true suburban sense.  But, looking at these photos, I don't remember that diversity that my mother seemed to have provided for us while juggling our lives between Queens and Valley Stream.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  Now, Valley Stream was where again?
Speaker 2: Valley Stream is in Long Island.
Speaker 1: Oh, Long Island.
Speaker 2: So, my migration was sort of Queens to Baltimore; Baltimore to Valley Stream in my formative years.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: To Rhode Island--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: When did you go to Valley Stream, how long were you there?
Speaker 2: Actually, it was probably in first grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I remember, one of the things I remember vividly; actually, I remember two things vividly.  One was a young guy who was playing baseball with us, who got hit with a bat in, in the mouth by accident that flew out of his hand.  I remember the insurance guy coming to the house to investigate what people had seen in this event.  I do also remember some, some taunting and, and you know, we were a little different.  But, Valley Stream was still predominantly white environment.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I don't remember it being overwhelming or, you know, an impediment to me and my progress.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But, I think I was happy to move on to Rhode Island.
Speaker 1: What was a Valley Stream neighborhood like, what did the people do in that community that--
Speaker 2: It was your typical suburban neighborhood, ranch houses and people roller skated on the streets.  In fact, I remember hot summer days, when one time, my roller skates got stuck in the tar.  I remember having to unstrap the skates and I must have been six, seven or eight.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Walk home, because I couldn't get my skates out of that hot new tar.  But, it was a fairly new place.  It, it had a grade school, you could walk to.  You know, it had a park.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, it, it, it was a true kind of suburban existence and that was probably the only time I had that kind of typical suburban--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: How far out on the island was this place?
Speaker 2: Valley Stream was just over the edge of Queens.  I mean you couldn't get much closer to Queens after you left Baisley Park and sort of the area around where James Brown's house was, 'cause that was what that area was famous for.  That was the next stop, and you kept going out further on the island; Freeport and so--
Speaker 1: How many years of elementary school did you spend in--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: In Valley Stream [New York]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was in Valley Stream up until fourth grade.  In fourth grade, I moved to Rhode Island.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, it would have been kindergarten, probably kindergarten, first, second and third.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  Any special memories stand out about those first four years of school, any particular teachers, or incidents that you remember as a--
Speaker 2: Well, as I remember--as I was saying, well, the one incident I remembered was getting my ear rinsed out after someone wrestled me to the ground and poured some sand in it.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: That was my most memorable moment at Valley Stream.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Other than that, I just remember great times skating on the lakes, going to a place called, "Jan's," the ice cream store that had the kitchen sink, with every scoop of ice cream in it.  But, because my grandparents [Ida Swann and J. Ballard Swann] were so close in Queens and because we were a close family and my cousins were nearby, you we always moved around.  We never were very sedentary and that's a trend in our family.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I have a hard time sitting still.  I think we have a hard time staying still as a family.
Story_ID: 100346
Speaker 1: What are some of the special family events, happenings that you remember?  Do those special things--I know you travelled during the summer because, your parents [Barbara Sykes and Lawrence Sykes] at the time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But were there other special times, holidays that you looked forward to with your family?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No matter where we went, we always got back together around Christmas, and that, that'll usually result in a drive from Rhode Island, if--if where we were living at the time, back to Queens.  One of the real things was that my, my mother's parents [Ida Swann and J. Ballard Swann], my grandmother and grandfather, their house really was this sort of starter home and in Queens, and Jamaica on 171st Street.  It had gone from being the cow pasture when they first moved there to now being fully grown up in Queens, just off of Jamaica, Jamaica Boulevard and not far from Jamaica Center.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But that house all--it was a two family house and one side was my grandparents.  And, the other side was the house that everybody went through.  And, so, at times, we'd live there before we moved on and got our first home.  And, another time my cousin, who I am extremely close to, her parents lived there and her brother and then they moved through there.  And, then, I don't know if that house was ever rented, I don't recall it ever being rented to a third party.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But, it was, you know, an attached two family house.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, I, I do remember that and I remember that street and I remember the ice cream truck.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: That was a very different existence than Valley Stream [New York].  'Cause that was a black neighborhood where, you know, predominantly everybody was a black person.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, Valley Stream, while it had white store owners, you know it was predominantly, I'm sorry, while Jamaica had white store owners.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: You know, Jamaica was pretty much a black neighborhood.  So, it was--I always liked the dichotomy between the sort of suburban Valley Stream existence to be able to come and then do the--my grandparents' house, not far away, only a half hour.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  You don't have any siblings.
Speaker 2: I don't.  I'm an only child.
Speaker 1: But, but you said you had a favorite, a close cousin.
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: Give us her name, and is it a he or she?
Speaker 2: It's a she.
Speaker 1: After her name, tell us a little bit about your cousin.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Kim Swann and Kim is effectively my sister.  We've always grown up extremely close.  She now is out on the West Coast.  She, she was trained here at Emerson [College in Boston, Massachusetts] when I first came to Boston, my first experience was staying at Kim's house for a summer while I was still at Cornell [University in Ithaca, New York], that is where I met some of my first friends that she was here for a brief overlap maybe that's the history of our cousin relationship, is that seems to be a year overlap and then somebody makes a move somewhere.  But, she was here for some time until earlier this year.  And, now has moved back out to West Coast to pursue her involvement in the, in the media industry.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But, I do remember for a while, her father, my mother's brother, while I think he loved Queens, he always wanted to be in the country and they moved up to a place called Ashland, New York and Ashland is near Windham or Hunter Mountain, it sort of in the Catskills.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And that was a whole nother existence.  I'd go visit her in the summer time and sometimes in the winter and we would ride around on motorcycles or go to the bowling alley or hitchhike, you know, the things you can't do in the cities and at a time you could do those things there.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And it was some freedoms there.  It was a chance for us as siblings to really explore our adolescence and with friends and bond, and so forth.
Story_ID: 100347
Speaker 1: Okay, you left Long Island [New York] at--end of grade four.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What school did you then attend, where did you go?
Speaker 2: Actually, I left Rhode Island [sic, Long Island] at the beginning of grade four.  I moved to Rhode Island.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, and attended public school in Rhode Island for a year, where ironically my mother [Barbara Sykes] was a teacher at that public school.  This was a school called Summit Avenue School, it was about four blocks from where we lived.  But, my mother was teaching a separate class.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, she had a more challenging class and we didn't see one another a lot, but I had friends and, you know, it was very typical public school--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: What city was this?
Speaker 2: This is in Rhode Island.
Speaker 1: What city?
Speaker 2: Oh, Providence, I'm sorry, I apologize. (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (unclear) That's okay.
Speaker 2: We lived in Providence, on the east side, not far from Brown University.  But, it was an interesting school, as I said, I made friends.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But, I also knew there might be more.  And, then in grade five actually went to an experimental school at Rhode Island College [Providence, Rhode Island] where my father was teaching, which was a teaching school, and--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: And the name of that school?
Speaker 2: It's Barnard [Henry Barnard Laboratory School], the name of the school was Barnard, and Barnard was interesting because Rhode Island College was a teaching college and--it, it--and remember the one way glass so that students in the college could sit on the other side and observe the classes being taught.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, and that was actually a good experience.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And I stayed there until seventh grade, and then seventh grade, actually went to private school in Rhode Island.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  I know Barnard school very well.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Because, my six year old grandson--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh, really.
Speaker 1: Attends Barnard right now.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's amazing.
Speaker 1: And, I went to Grandparents Day last spring, so I really got to know the place.

Speaker 1: You were at the Henry Barnard School on the campus of Rhode Island College [Providence, Rhode Island] and you were there for a year?
Speaker 2: I was there for a year.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  And then where did you move to, to do your schooling (unclear)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Actually, I was there for two years.  I apologize.  I finished fourth grade at Summit Avenue [School in Providence, Rhode Island], fifth and sixth grade I was at the Barnard School.  And, in seventh grade moved on to this school called Moses Brown [School in Providence, Rhode Island].  And, Moses Brown was--is a private school in Providence, one of the two Browns, I guess the other Brown, other than Brown University; grade school founded in the mid 1700s.  I went on to be on the board of the school more recently. And, and I'm not on the board now, but that was a big change.  It was challenging academically.  I think we initially had what I think, we called in the house a "cotton picking" scholarship; where there was some $2,000.00 scholarship that allowed us to go there.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, then upon asking for even more information I think my father [Lawrence Sykes] decided we didn't need to furnish more information, we would just take care of it.  But, I stayed there for--through my high school years, with the exception of a couple of respites.  But, that was different, there were only two black kids in the school.  The only other kid was Robert Wiley [ph.], who is--whose dad was a coach of athletics down at the University of Rhode Island [Kingston, Rhode Island].
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, and later on that came--became, became an interesting issue.  'Cause this is a school where kids had formed relationships from kindergarten, all of the first families of Rhode Island and I was coming in in seventh grade as this kid with differing experiences, different hair.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: You know, may be hadn't to the Alguien Country Club dances.  And, so the first year was a little rocky.  I think people called you names, you know quietly.  Nothing that would make you go running to the police.  But, it got better, it got better.  And, I found my friends and began to play on sports teams.  I got involved in lacrosse and soccer.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, found skiing, which later became a lifelong love.  But, I stayed there and I got a great education.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I learned a lot and I don't stay extremely close to the people that I met there.  But, I do value the education I got.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you at Moses Brown?
Speaker 2: I, I think I was a good student.  I, you know, I went back and looked I saw some honor roll letters that I found.  I just remember being challenged and I remember especially, you know, study hall with wooden desks, an old wooden school.  And, I also remember it was a Quaker school.  So, it was a school, we had meetings for worship three times a week when I first went there.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Then that became two times, and one time and I think now it's back to happening again.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But, I enjoyed that aspect, too; just a religion where you sat still, and then expressed yourself--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --when you felt the mood, when something moved you.  You can imagine as an adolescent, either people said nothing or they--you couldn't shut them up.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, I, I enjoyed that.  But, I went on to do, to do okay in my studies and to enjoy math, and to enjoy languages. And, it was terrific.
Story_ID: 100349
Speaker 1: At this point in your life at Moses Brown [School in Providence, Rhode Island], did you have any notions or ideas about what did you wanted to do as a future occupation or career?  Did you have any ideas at that point?
Speaker 2: It was, I think in tenth grade that I sort of decided what I would do with my life.  And, you know, I, I don't know that I did a deep exploration, but I did sort of systematic evaluation.  I said, "What are you good at, what do you like, what do you think you'd want to do with the rest of your life?"  It was all coalesced by a survey course about architecture that was taught by a student for Rhode Island School of Design [Providence, Rhode Island].  And, in tenth grade, we took this course and it was an introduction to architecture.  I remember designing a, a spherical building that, that I thought was just wonderful because you could put it on stilts, on any type of topography and it would just sit there.  And, I remember this student from Rhode Island School of Design telling me, "You'll never be an architect, because form always follows function, and this doesn't make any sense at all, a round building is just crazy."  I don't know if I went on to be architect to prove him wrong or I went on to be an architect because I saw vision in, in what I was doing then.  But, I did--that's when I really got a sense that the combination of expressing oneself artistically, being able to do math, being--having a chance to interact with people was really something that I could get excited about.
Story_ID: 100350
Speaker 1: During your summertime while you were in high school [Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island], and even after school, did you have part time jobs, did you have outside school activities and things that you were involved in?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had actually a bunch of interesting things I did.  And, I'm thinking a lot about this these days because I have a son who is about to--whose fourteen and daughter whose eleven, and we're trying to think about my experiences and how they, they helped mold me.  I did a couple things during the summer.  One, was I found my way to the Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] swimming pool and somehow I got involved in wanting to learn spring board diving and I conned a couple of the diving, guys on the diving team from Brown to show me how to do things.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, I worked really hard at that.  And, that ended up coming to be a little handy later on when I started skiing, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And I'll, maybe we can talk about that later.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But, the other thing I did was, I worked at a fast food place, well, more than fast food place that the Brown University students went to called Ronnie's Rascal House.  And, Ronnie's Rascal House was interesting only because the job started at seven at night and went to two in the morning.  So, you can imagine a sixteen year old kid staying up all night, busting dishes, busting suds, working with folks who were not, maybe not as smart as I was, but maybe more worldly.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, getting exposed to all the things.  Plus, it actually was--turned out to be a predominantly gay restaurant.  So, I had to interact with people I weren't, wasn't necessarily used to dealing with, but I think it taught me some tolerance and just how to interact with folks and get through situations, whether they were less intelligent or a different persuasion.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, so that was helpful.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: The only other thing I did was manage a drug store.  I was assistant manager of Rix drugstore, right near Brown University again.  But, that was in the black community and it was pretty neat, because I had to manage some interesting minute situations, like five little kids coming in and trying to break up and scatter and steal things from the store; and I had to learn how to lock the doors and talk them down through all the things they had in their pockets.  And, taught me some skills, not only dealing with people who you didn't--necessi--who maybe adversarially in position with you.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But, maybe just educationally could benefit from your help.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, those are the two job experiences that I remember just in high school, being very beneficial to me.
Story_ID: 100351
Speaker 1: You graduated from Moses Brown [School in Providence, Rhode Island]?
Speaker 2: I did graduate from Moses, Moses Brown, but in a very unusual way.  My eleventh grade year, my parents, my father got an opportunity to teach in Ghana and he moved--they [Barbara Sykes and Lawrence Sykes] moved together to teach at the University of Science and Technology in Accra [Ghana] and I was given a choice, which seemed strange to people.  But, my choice was to stay where I was in [Providence] Rhode Island, go to Ghana with them or do something else.  And, you know, I guess I will always relish my parents' trust and faith in giving me the option to do something else.  Because, something else I had wanted to do, somewhere around the age of twelve, I picked up skiing.  And, it was one of those things where one day I said to my mother, "You know, I, I want to, to go ski" and I got one ski lesson and I was hooked.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, I never took another ski lesson again in my life.  But, by the time I was fourteen, I was competing in skiing.
Speaker 1: At age twelve, you were introduced to skiing?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was the introduction through school or through some outside influence? (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No, I went to my mother and said, "I want to go skiing."  And you know--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Just like that?
Speaker 2: As only children get some privilege to do.  My mother went to the mountain and she would do lesson plans while I would go to the ski slopes and she would take me around or my father would take me around and I began racing.  And, eventually, I started getting into what was called freestyle skiing which is--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: So there's nobody else in your immediate circle who was skiing that influenced you.  You just--something you wanted to?
Speaker 2: No.  Something I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) and, it, it turned out to be a very--fortunately, the thing that I--one of the things I'm best at and I was lucky enough to find that.  So, on my optional do something else eleventh grade year, I moved to Switzerland.  And, I went to a school called Leysin American School, which was in the Swiss Alps in a town called Leysin, near Montreux, and Montreux is at the end of Lake Geneva.  So, this was big move.  I've gone now, you know, 3,000 miles away across--now it's an American school, so we're speaking English, but I'm living in a French speaking Switzerland, so I got to use my language.  I-- my parents, my parents are now in Africa so I can't call them up and say, "Come on over and give me some money."
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, I have to work through some issues.  And, and I got into some very interesting circumstances I think molded my life at that school.  So--
Speaker 1: What was the most outstanding thing that happened to you there in Switzerland?
Speaker 2: I think, probably two things.  One was I learned how to work with the system.  The school gave you a certain amount of freedom, but it really wasn't set up to do everything I wanted to do.  And, I started competing professionally in skiing and all of the meets were in different countries.  And, so I would have to get from Switzerland to France, from Switzerland to Germany, Switzerland to Italy to compete on this professional ski circuit sponsored by Camel cigarettes.  So, I had to figure out how to convince the school that they should let me run around Europe by myself at age sixteen.  Somehow, I did that, I don't know how I did it, but I, I learned how to negotiate different countries, and different languages and get to these meets.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, and I did okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: The only other thing that I'll say that the school did, was--it was a half Americans and the rest were people from all over the world.
Speaker 1: I was about to ask you that.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: A lot of Iranian kids, who were the Shah's Generals' children, Turks, Greeks, Japanese.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, I--my roommates were two Turkish brothers, Mettot and Vedot Uni, [ph.] and a kid from Hawaii and myself.  And, I wou--I kind of got a microcosm of how the world worked.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Because, the Turks would bring things back from the Black Market and then the Greeks would then broker and sell them and then occasionally--I'm sorry, the Turks would bring back the Black Market items.  The Indians would sell it.  I once remember a Greek guy tried to steal something from the Indians and then I found out about the Turks and the Greeks not getting along.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, so it really was an insight to the world in the sort of safe confines in the Swiss Alps.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  Your parents stayed in Ghana for a year, did they?
Speaker 2: They did.
Speaker 1: And, then you came back to the--
Speaker 2: We all came back.  They actually came to visit me in, in Switzerland at Christmas.  They brought my aunt and my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: My, my paternal grandmother.  And I have pictures of them walking around the Swiss Alps.  And, I don't know that my, my grandmother ever envisioned that she'd be walking around the Swiss Alps.  But, we all came back to the states and we, we spent the summer doing something, I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But, I do recall--ahh, I took my father's course, I took that art course because I needed some credits.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Because, I had a vision that I, I pretty much had it with high school.  I'd figured that I had done a lot of traveling.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I'd seen the world.  And, somehow, I figured out how to graduate with one, couple months of high school left to do.  And, then I moved to New Hampshire to be the director of a freestyle skiing program.
Speaker 1: But, you finished Moses Brown?
Speaker 2: I finished Moses Brown--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: You got your degree there?
Speaker 2: I finished Moses Brown, but I finished it out of sync with everybody else--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: I understand, okay.
Speaker 2: As usual in my life.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 100352
Speaker 1: And so now you're off to ski country, go ahead?
Speaker 2: I'm off to New Hampshire, which might have been the best education.  Because going to New Hampshire to teach, first of all, I made a tour of New England with my father [Lawrence Sykes].  So, it was a 6'8" black guy and his son going around we'd like to--my son wants to direct a freestyle program and I have a lot of Austrian guys telling me, "No."
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Eventually, I found a guy who took a chance on me up in Jackson, New Hampshire and said, "Okay, you can direct this program, you seem to have the credentials."  We designed the brochures together, my father and I to promote it and get the kids into the program.  We ended up with 20 kids from age 10 to age 15.  And, built big jumps and through ourselves off and did flips in the air and had a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But, I also lived with two people, three people who were older than me who were ski instructors.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, going into that year, I was certain that I would be a skier and, and I had applied to all kinds of schools for college that would facilitate that.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I knew when I finished this ski stint, I'd go to Colorado or Utah.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, I applied to one safety school that my aunt insisted that I apply to called Cornell University [Ithaca, New York].  And, I said, "You can pay for that school application, if you want, but, I'm not going there, I'm going out to where the snow is."
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, anyway, after a year of living in Jackson, New Hampshire, I decided there had to be a lot more to life than what I was doing and I scrapped all those schools that had snow, University of snow in them and ended up going to Cornell.
Story_ID: 100353
Speaker 1: Tell me about your years at Cornell [University in Ithaca, New York].  How many years was the program, architecture, a four-year program?
Speaker 2: It's a five-year program.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But, once again, the inevitable Sykes style, it got ready to wrap it up a year early and so, I managed to attend a summer program in Paris [France] during my fourth year which allowed me to finish early and move to Boston [Massachusetts]--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --In, in the fall [1980].
Speaker 1: What was it like being an architectural student, this would be what year, early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: 1976, was when I went to Cornell.
Speaker 1: What's it like being a student, were there other black students in architecture, at the time?  Were you--?
Speaker 2: Cornell was an interesting place.  Cornell is a big college.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: It's 10,000 students and the best thing about that is there lots of different types of people so you could find anybody.  There were a few other folks who were in architecture, in fact, we had about four in my class.  And, it was also, a time, where kids from different parts of America would come into Cornell under programs, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And so, some of these were kids who had gone to Sci--Tech school and Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York] and were now headed up from Science or Stuyvesant to come up to the program in Cornell.  It was also a time of turmoil.  'Cause I don't know if you recall, but, Cornell was a little later in keeping its--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --rebellious black rights roots.  So, I came at the heels of the takeover of the straight university and the sit-ins and so forth.
Speaker 1: I remember that.  Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, it was an interesting period.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But, but it was a great period.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, because while I got the benefit of great education, I also had the benefit of having a critical mass of black kids and a black studies program that was really more than your average Ivy League--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --sort of white washed version.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, we would have black light dances at Ujamaa Hall, as well as be working away all night at Cornell's architecture school [School of Architecture, now College of Architecture, Art, and Planning].
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 100354
Speaker 1: Now, with your degree in Architecture [B.Arch.], what was the next move, where did you go from there?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I, I tried to continue competing skiing while going to architecture school.  I think I took a lesson from my grandfather [Frank Jehoy "Doc" Sykes], I thought I could do it all.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I quickly decided after the first year, that I could not do the Can-Am professional ski circuit and stay up all night studying architecture.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Actually, a skill that's helpful now, I still stay up all night.  But, what that let me do was sort of get focused on other opportunities.  And, the first year I was at Cornell, to your question of what did I do next.  I tried to bring social issues into the School of Architecture.  I wanted to design buildings that affected people in ways that would help them be--change communities.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, I was kind of roundly dismissed in that initiative.  I think I didn't do well in my first semester, so I kind of put that on the back burner, my social architecture.  And, started to look for outlets to, to do that.  And, one of those outlets was when I graduated, I found a firm called Stull and Lee and that was my real reason for moving to Boston [Massachusetts].  The year before I graduated, I spent the summer working here at Stull and Lee [Associates, Inc.], primarily because my cousin [Kim Swann] who I was so close to, who was here going to Emerson [College in Boston, Massachusetts] and had a good time continuing those parties here with her in those black light South End row houses with all the folks.  But, but I found Stull and Lee, which was, was neat, because it was one of the only black owned major architectural firms, and it just happened to be in Boston.  So, Stull and Lee was where I ended up.
Speaker 1: So, you moved there in what year?
Speaker 2: Actually, moved to Stull in 1981.
Speaker 1: '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: Moved here, worked as a designer at Stull and Lee.  I remember distinctly 'cause I came to see David Lee for an interview and I remember it was winter and it was freezing cold and I didn't have a top coat.   And, so, I took the interview and I was looking rather dapper in my grandfather's suit.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: 'Cause, I was probably using that, and I remember as I was leaving, David Lee said, "Get yourself an overcoat, it's cold in Boston."  But, truly, Dave, David Lee and Don Stull [HM Donald Stull] nurtured me and really gave me the kind of freedom to both be a designer, to work on some great projects.  But, but really the freedom to understand that eventually I would be out on my own, doing my thing.  And, and I probably wouldn't have gotten the opportunity had I gone to a white-owned firm at that time.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: It might have taken me longer.  People might not have been as understanding about my moonlighting as I was getting my contracts together to make my move on my own.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: SO, they were, they were instrumental in my success as well as their own.
Speaker 1: Don Stull has granted a very long interview for the HistoryMakers.
Speaker 2: Oh, good.
Speaker 1: He's been done and David Lee is on the list to be done.
Speaker 2: Wonderful.  They, they are the two most eloquent and truly ethical and wonderful guys that I know.
Speaker 1: Actually, I think you'd enjoy looking at Don's interview on the, on the tape, perhaps he'd let you look at it when--simultaneous
Speaker 2: I'd love to see that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Because they really became family to me, and they still are.  David Lee and I actually own a house in Vermont together.  We developed the love of skiing and somehow, he's my older brother and Don might be my uncle if, if it were all the same.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 100355
Speaker 1: Now, you came here to begin your profession with Stull and Lee [Associates, Inc.].  You were how old?
Speaker 2: Let's see, twenty-one.
Speaker 1: twenty-one, okay.  What was Boston [Massachusetts] like when you got--how did you feel about this place when you got here?
Speaker 2: Well, I had been here the summer before [1980], remember.  And, I had my cousin [Kim Swann] to make the introductions to some very beautiful black women and some great parties.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And I discovered a vibrant place and I, I it was great.  'Cause, even though I was coming out of school, I was able to plug into, I wasn't too old to be part of the academic environment that was here and kids were here from all over America--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I was able to tie into the black medical students and the black lawyers.  And, so I found a place that I don't know exists now, but it, for me it was a dynamic place with lots of people from lots of places coming together, usually around social occasions.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, I also discovered Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] then, too.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Because I had been to Martha's Vineyard, but never really in the context of, sort of, you know, an active young man having a good time, so--simultaneous
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  How did you find the city, I mean you came here to live now and to work, how did you find in terms of race relations and social problems and issues because you had some social consciousness in terms of what you were trying to do at Cornell [University in Ithaca, New York], and --(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, how did you find the city in, in that regard?
Speaker 2: Well, I think probably 'cause of my ending up at Stull and Lee and being plugged into an environment where people where in tuned to some of these issues and doing projects that were in the community like this Orange Line going through the south, southwest corridor replacing the elevated line, or doing Roxbury Community College [Boston, Massachusetts].  I had a chance to work in those social community or socially conscious projects that I was looking for at Cornell and Don [HM Donald Stull] and David [Lee] were already doing them.  So, it was a natural that I moved to Fort Hill [Boston, Massachusetts] and I'll tell you a great story about that.  But, I, I managed to kind of immerse myself in sort of the black Boston and at that time where the movers and shakers were.  Because I moved in next to [HM] Fletcher ["Flash"] Wiley who found the house for us and gave us a down payment.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I moved in next to Duane Jackson and had a chance to spend time with, who had been here a little longer than me.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, I guess I had some mentors and I had a network via my cousin.  So, while you heard about "Don't go to South Boston," while you heard about, you know, "You go here, you don't go there."  Well, I guess I didn't perceive those boundaries.  'Cause, I worked downtown in our office, I rode my bike every day from Roxbury to downtown, downtown Boston.  I felt I had a community because I lived in a neighborhood with, with where people were, were very knowledgeable about one another.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, the funny story about living here was one day, actually, literally within the first year, we were three guys, two friends of mine, sitting around a pool at sort of upscale place we were living.  We said, "This is crazy, we need to buy house."  And, within one year, we had bought a six bedroom Victorian up on Fort Hill.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, pretty rapidly that became some, somewhat of a center of our universe.  And, everybody in Boston moved through there.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --Partying or spending some time with us.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, I guess I felt, I really got plugged into something that was here.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I discovered the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], became a member, tried to infuse some new blood into the oldest chapter of that.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And--so, I felt there were lots of outlets.  So, the fact that there were some places that were off limits, to--it struck me that my universe was very big in Boston.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 100356
Speaker 1: When did you meet your wife?  Tell us your wife's name, and when did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: My wife is Karen James Sykes.  Well, Karen James was her maiden name.  And, Karen, we met, I should say I first saw my wife at one of those South End parties and she has two very beautiful sisters who look very much like her.  And, I remember them being called the "James girls."  And, I think they were very much beyond my reach at that time and, so I, I admired from afar.  So, I--while we may have met, it wasn't for the purposes of beginning to date.  And, then over time through circumstance, I became friends with friends of hers.  We began going together, in fact, at one point we belonged to a ski house together where she was dating somebody else and I was dating somebody else.  And, eventually over time we became close friends and then eventually got married.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, we had an evolved relationship that, I think, took advantage of that closeness, or that network.  That--it's something about Boston [Massachusetts] that I love.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: It really was not a big town.  It does have the accoutrements of, of a network that people can plug into.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  You and Karen were married when?
Speaker 2: We were married in 1986.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Actually, 1987, I'm sorry. In 1986 we purchased the house together up on Fort Hill [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: We had a brief stint where we moved away from Fort Hill and Roxbury to downtown, while we were dating and then missed the sense of community.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, then upon rediscovering our roots and I think that was when Flash [HM Fletcher "Flash" Wiley] found us a house next door, and gave us some money to help fix it up from the down--his brokerage fee.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: We were married a year later in [HM] Reverend [Charles Richard] Stith's church.  And, it was a great event, a great event.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  Reverend Stith was interviewed yesterday afternoon.
Speaker 2: Ah-h, okay.  Well, you can imagine my pride in seeing the minister that married me becoming an ambassador, becoming a great person that he is.
Speaker 1: We spent all afternoon with him yesterday over at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  You and your wife, Karen started your family and you now have--
Speaker 2: We have two children, Kyle who's 14 and Sydney who is 11, Sydney is a girl.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Kyle's a guy.  And, they're wonderful kids.  They go to Milton Academy [Milton, Massachusetts], we've since moved to Milton when we left Roxbury Co--I left Roxbury kicking and screaming, because I'd become head of the Civic Association.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, I think that was part of the deal, was that if you moved in next door, you had to become head of the Civic Association.  But, gradually the people who were close to, began to move out and unfortunately, Roxbury began to gentrify and become less of the black cognoscenti environment that we knew it to be.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, we moved closer to schools that we wanted our kids to be in and they're flourishing at Milton Academy.
Speaker 1: At Milton Academy?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 100357
Speaker 1: What were your major and most memorable assignments as an architect when you were with Stull and Lee [Associates, Inc.]?  What were the big projects, one or two that you remember as being very instructive for you?
Speaker 2: I think, first and foremost, the Southwest Corridor Orange Line project [Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority].  And, primarily because I think when I came to Boston [Massachusetts], I wasn't aware of the history behind moving the Orange Line and the people had put themselves in front of bulldozers to prevent I-93, I guess, I-90 from coming through the community.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, it's ironic, that we built this development on the boulevard that was going to be the thoroughfare that, that I helped eventually not make happen.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Because, we put a transit line in.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: That got my exposure to community meetings, it got me a chance to get out and understand how to process people's--to build consensus, to understand what was important to people; to figure out how to infuse that into the design process and end up with the result.  And, I think it also made me realize that design, architectural design, as I knew it, as I learned it in Cornell [University in Ithaca, New York], as a point of abstract principle was really a much more business community, political environment than, than I ever knew it to be.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, that would be one.  I think I also got to work on some great design projects with David and Don [HM Donald Stull], like Roxbury Community College, which besides being down the hill from where I lived and going by it every day, you know, it had important symbolism as being an icon in the community in a sense of place where Boston--blacks hadn't had that.  So, that, that became a very important project for me as well.
Story_ID: 100358
Speaker 1: So, you did you first architectural work with Stull and Lee Associates [Inc.], and what was the next step?  Where did you do from there?  You eventually left.  And, why did you leave and what did you do?
Speaker 2: You know, I left gradually.  And, I left gradually because I knew that if I was gonna take this determinism or community building to another level, there had to be another dimension.  And, the dimension that I saw was sort of getting more engaged with my own clients and being able to help facilitate some change.  So, I built up a series of contracts moonlighting.  I worked at Stull and Lee in the day and at night I'd come home and work all night on doing renovations of brownstones.  And, this was during a period where, you know, there was a lot of gentrification of the South End [Boston, Massachusetts].  There was a fair amount of property that was owned by black families being brought up at a, at a bargain and being developed and turned around as condominiums.  So, this would have been '80 [1980]--probably around '86 [1986] actually, that I had built up enough contracts that I was able to now open my own shop, sort of.  Well, opening my own shop meant joining another black architect and a white architect who was sharing about a 20 foot wide by 60 foot long office off of Kneeland Street.  And, I think we used what looked like telephone booths is where we did our private calls, and we ended up sharing work.  And, that was Hezekiah Pratt, and a guy who later became my partner, Jeff Wescott who, in marrying a woman from Indonesia changed his name to Rashid al-Hakim Ashraf, adopted Islam, not just Islam but black Islam, became part of the black, black mosjid in, in Roxbury and later went on to design the initial Roxbury mosque that's being built now.  And, so Rashid and I were partners for a while.  And, we partnered with Hezekiah when it was appropriate.  And, you know, gradually I needed to kind of move into my own space.  I stated building my own clientele and the other thing I started doing, I started doing the financial side of things.  I started to see the opportunity to help black owners of property.  Not just design it and turn it around, but actually finance it, to manage the construction of it.  And, that was really the genesis of my involvement and development.  And so, mute of parallel tracks of being an architect and sort of a quasi-developer for a couple of years; left that space, ended up moving in with Stull and Lee.  You know, it's an interesting world we live in.  We ended up partnering on some major architectural projects, like the Boston Police Headquarters, and the Roxbury Post Office.  And, only, like only you can do with people you can trust like brothers and uncles. We managed to work out fair relationships.  And, I kept developing the development aspect until in 1990-1996, I formally stated Primary Corporation, which is a development entity.  And, that's when my world continued on this paralleled tracks with development and design for a couple of years until design started to take up less of my time and development took up more.
Story_ID: 100359
Speaker 1: I think we have to back up because, you went to the MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts] Real Estate Program.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You also entered the Harvard Business School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So, do we need to back up because--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  A kinda neat thing happened. I joined a group--well, I did two things.  I helped start a group called the Robert Taylor Society of Black Architects.  At the time I came to Boston, there was no association of black architects, it was just sort of a ragtag group.  But, there were about 10 or 15 of us.  And, we brought folks together and tried to nurture and support one another and got a lot of help from, from, you know, one another.  But, also from people outside the fact.  Someone who is now my partner now at a project, [E.] Lorraine Baugh from Lena Park Community Development Corporation had taken up her husband's business when he died and became an engineer and Lorraine whipped us into shape.  Got Robert's Rules of Order in place and we managed to be a little more effective.  But, at that time, I was really trying to culture, cultivate the architectural side of the business.  A couple years later in the sort of late '80s [1980s], I, I got a chance to go to a program called the MIT Center for Real Estate Development Minority Developers Program.  And, it was a very innovative thing.  'Cause the City of Boston [Massachusetts] co-sponsored with MIT and the Minority Developers Association, which I also belong to.  This program which was a one week emersion in commercial development.  Because we have mostly residential developers at the time.  People who knew how to renovate buildings but they really didn't know much about the commercial side.  And, so ended up spending a week at Endicott House [Dedham, Massachusetts] with a lot of people we all know, Robert--Richard Taylor, Ken Guska, Joe Feaster, and some white developers too.  Learning about the other side, the more professional side of development.  And, that really kind--I think, kinda kicked me into high gear about starting the development side of, or Primary Corporation.
Story_ID: 100360
Speaker 1: And, sort of in the mid '90s [1990s], or sort of, we've now gone forward to the early '90s [1990s], again, I operated sort of paralleled tracks of Primary Group doing architecture, Primary Corp. [Corporation] doing development.  And, by then, Primary Group had grown pretty big.  Primary Group had gotten to thirty-five people at its height.  I think then, were probably about fifteen or so, and we were still collaborating but also working on projects like the Central Artery Project [Boston, Massachusetts] where we didn't just work a little bit on it, we were one of the three major designers for the look up to about 25 percent and then hundreds of other contracts were lent to other firms to actually execute--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  And, this was under Primary Group now?
Speaker 1: This was under Primary Group.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, I also did that with Stull and Lee [Associates], they were a member of that group.  So, really there were two minority firms and one woman firm, Carol Johnson, which was a landscape firm, that did all the design for Central Artery did twenty percent.  Not, the leaky part, but actually--and not the engineering part, but the shape of the columns, the color, the railings, designs.  And, for ten years we worked on that project, designing it, and it helped grow the firm.  And, I also found myself in a position with the engineers as well as the architects to try prove the opportunities for black architectural engineering firms to work on this $15 billion project.  So, it was with Paul Parks that we help design a system of points that worked to the advantage of including more black owned firms.  That, I think, hundreds of millions of dollars went to black-owned design and engineering firms that wouldn't have gotten there.  But, because I had the role in the lead design ability, I didn't have to compete.  So, I could help shape the system a little bit.  So, I think maybe that's a little of my grandfather [Frank Jehoy "Doc" Sykes] changing the system, creeping in there a bit.
Story_ID: 100361
Speaker 1: So, we, you, know, sort of did those projects and in '96 [1996], Primary Corporation was launched.  And, it was launched with the construction of, or the development of the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative, first phase.  And, DSNI, which was a great story in its own right, is a great story in its own right--
Speaker 2: Tell us very briefly about DSNI.
Speaker 1: Well, DSNI, Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative, was a great grassroots initiative to take land that was being land banked and not utilized well.  And, used eminent domain capabilities exercised by a private organization, DSNI.  One of the first occasions of this happening in the country, under the leadership of a number of people, but one of them was [Eugene] Gus Newport, the former mayor of Oakland [California] or Berkeley [California], I'm not sure which--
Speaker 2: Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Berkeley.  Sort of a self-deterministic effort to make some things happen in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] where land had been sort of land banked and laid fallow.  And, so we did first 40-unit townhouse development called Winthrop Estates, and that was one of my first opportunities to do a major development project.  It later went on to be movie and a book and a bunch, a number of other things, not necessarily about our development but about all of DSNI.  But, a very proud moment to be part of a sort of a seminal change in Boston where communities of color really hadn't been empowered and now this was an empowering tool, and we were part of it.
Speaker 2: The film, "Breaking Ground" [sic, "Holding Ground"]--?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I've used that for many years with my students--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Oh, good.
Speaker 2: --With my teaching here with both Northeastern [University in Boston, Massachusetts] and UMass-Boston [University of Massachusetts in Boston].
Speaker 1: You know, I'd love to get a copy of that.  I've, I've never, I don't think I've ever seen it.
Speaker 2: I had a very (unclear).  You should see it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's one of my favorite pieces.  They were hard to get ahold of, but that's another story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, they were available.
Story_ID: 100362
Speaker 1: Harvard Business School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]; now where did that fit in?  Because you were there for what purpose?
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly enough as I was doing this sort of parallel development company and design firm, I had a banking relationship with First Community Bank, which is BankBoston.  And, through a good friendship with Gail Snowden who is a long-term friend and a very visionary in her right.  My lending officer came to me and said, "Hey, I know about this opportunity for you to go to this program called Owners and Presidents Management program [Owner/President Management program] at Harvard Business School."  He said, "The only catch is, you gotta live there for a month a year, for three years."  And, I said, "Oh, my God, how am I gonna do this."  You know, I got kids.  I got a wife.  I got a business, you know.  And, you know, the first year, and I think this was probably 1997.  I know because I went out and brought a car right after that.  1997 was the first year where I actually went to Harvard Business School and did this program, which is 100 people who own businesses.  I was at the smallest end of the spectrum.  The smallest business could be $3 million dollars in earning a year up to the large--second largest beer owner--beer company in China to the folks that made Honda seats in India.  So, it was a very international, multi-cultural group, coming together already a sense of business knowledge rather than the normal MBA process.  This was a chance to take your current business knowledge and nurture it in the typical Harvard Business School case study method.  And, that group, OPM built a bond around coming back together every year for three years and living on campus and breaking down into the study groups that actually analyzed the cases.  And, as a result, sort of by, I guess this would be 9--probably 2000 [sic, 1999] at this point.  I would have been through the three years of being at Harvard Business School.  I had now bolstered skills that I didn't have at the time, around marketing, around finance, around analysis, which helped me take my development company [Primary Corporation] to sorta 'nother level.  I think, going into it, I had the will, I had the desire, I probably didn't have all the skills.  So, the MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts] Center [for Real Estate] Program for black developers kind of wet my appetite, I think, a little practical experience gave me sort of the suave to stick-to-itiveness and maybe a little bit of polish that came out of the H--the Harvard Business School Program, gave me a little bit of the credentials and experience.
Story_ID: 100363
Speaker 1: As you finished Cornell [University in Ithaca, New York], and you came to Stull and Lee [Associates, Inc.] and then you started your own architectural firm [Primary Group and Primary Corporation], and then you did the advanced studies, did you have flashbacks and reflections for your grandfather, Dr. [Frank Jehoy "Doc"] Sykes, at all?  Did you think about him?
Speaker 2: I did.  I think, I think about him often, especially when I'm in challenging situations, when I'm a little over my head, or something seems like a bridge too far.  It all seems sort of inconsequential that none of the circumstances that I come up against can be nearly as challenging as they would be for him.  Nobody's telling me where to sit on the bus.  Nobody's telling me where I can stay; what hotel I can stay at; nobody's burning a cross on my lawn; and not being run from place to place.  So, you know, I--the other thing is just a bit of his humbling manner that this is what you do, you know.  You make change and you do what's right and, you know, you just keep moving and move on to the next challenge.  That's something I think I've been begun to appreciate even more as I get older.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  What lessons from your mother [Barbara Sykes] and father [Lawrence Sykes] had brought you to where you are?  Lessons that they gave you as you were growing up.
Speaker 2: I'm still very close to my mother and father.  I see them every week, and we're a very tight family.  I think, the--there were a couple of things. They are very different people.  My mother, I think, is a people person and very much about doing for others and trying to make peace and reach consensus and build coalitions which is maybe her being a teacher, a first grade teacher.  My father is very much an academic and a cerebral thinking out of the box person who's always looking to push the envelope; who doesn't really know any limits and I think he has taught me that.  And, that, you know, there are no boundaries, you just simply make your own rules and you keep stepping.  And, those are maybe two very different skills, but very beneficial skills in business.  You have to build consensus, we have to get the yes.  We have to do that to get anything done.  We also need to be able to be innovative and creative and those are maybe the values I value most in life.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 100364
Speaker 1: I'm looking here at your notes and your questionnaire.  I see something that says, "New Boston Fund."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the genesis of the New Boston Fund and this as a continuation of Primary Group, Primary Corp. [Corporation] What is this all about?
Speaker 2: Sounds like an alphabet soup.  You know, I think in my evolution, I'm continually trying to look ahead again, rather than back and see where am I going?  And, where can I--how can I get there best?  New Boston Fund was a big decision for me.  New Boston Fund is a basically a fund which invests retirement system and pension fund monies in, what's called double bottom line objectives;  which means, getting a return for those pension funds and retirement systems.  But, also promoting economic development in the communities that we invested in.  And, we've done some very innovative things in creating this fund in that we said that we'll invest two-thirds and up to a hundred percent of the money we raise in the communities we raise it.  And, we're looking to raise in communities that need economic development.  So, we're working in Massachusetts.  We're working in Baltimore [Maryland].  We're working outside of Washington [D.C.].  We're working in Prince George's County [Maryland], in Hartford [Connecticut], in New Haven [Connecticut].  And, ironically, these are communities of color.  They're places where there's a will.  But, the capital has been challenging in helping create change.  And, that's really what I learned in doing Crosstown Center [Hampton Inn and Suites Boston Crosstown Center in Boston, Massachusetts], was that, we had a great idea.  We built consensus with some help from the (unclear).  We were able to get everybody on board.  But, then when we hit Wall Street there wasn't an appetite to invest in this project.  And, we lost a couple years.  And, so rather than repeating that cycle or just solving it for myself, I said, "How can be fix this on a larger scale?  How can we have the impact that we had across town in many different communities?  How can we migrate some of this pension fund money so the state money, or you know, monies of small people who need the-- you know, change in their communities?"  And, so that's the genesis of New Boston Fund--
Story_ID: 100365
Speaker 1: Maybe we should back up then and talk about the Crosstown Center [Hampton Inn and Suites Boston Crosstown Center in Boston, Massachusetts] and what you've done here?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Why don't you tell us about getting that started and your partners, partners that you worked with on that?
Speaker 2: Well, this is, this will always be one of the most important events of my life.  Not only was it sort of the culmination of my transition of many years from designer, architect, to developer, and then eventually to financier.  But, it, it was a great experience in that we set out to do something that nobody had done before.  We looked for a site that could make a big change in the community but that had all of the features to be successful.  And, for years people have started had projects in Boston but they just haven't gotten done, you know.  Boston State Hospital [Mattapan, Massachusetts] is a great example.  We're get--we're now getting that one done through our fund.  But, we set out to do Crosstown Center by going to thirty different community groups and finding out what was important to them.  And, all the community groups that have butted the site.  And, we found it was very simple, you know.  Unlike the sense that politics is a full contact sport that you have to guess at.  You simply need to go out and ask.  And, so we went out and asked.  We found that the jobs were important to the surrounding community.  Traffic was important to the surrounding community, and transportation.  Getting from point A to point B was important.  So, that gave us a basis to build what was called the "love fest" by the [Boston] Globe for a direct designation of some land that was a failed digital equipment corporation, which is what this site now sits on.  It'd six acre of parcel of land on--
Speaker 1: Six acres?
Speaker 2: Six acres, on Massachusetts Avenue.  Once, a lead paint factory and a couple of gas stations.  Later, under some site assembly that was done under the Urban Renewal process in the '60s [1960s], it became the Digital Equipment Corporation assembly plant for computers.  When Digital Equipment Corporation went out of business, the site was abandoned.
Speaker 1: I remember all of that.
Speaker 2: You remember this.
Speaker 1: I remember all of it.
Speaker 2: And, it, it sort of languished.  It became an incubator biotech place.  And it became a computer assembly place for a small group.  But, it never generated the jobs.  It never created the change that was originally intended by the Urban Renewal process.  And, what we were able to do was to get the designation of the land to build a mixed use $150 million hotel, retail, garage, office event on this site.  And, people embraced it and supported us like nothing before.  And, that's one of the things, one of those most proud moments of my life is to be able to build the consensus to lead people in the vision and then to have them support it and to have faith.  Even when it wasn't going great.  And, there were lots of times when this went up and down.  It started, we couldn't find money.  We had tenants that came and went.  But, in the end the Mayor of Boston [Thomas M. Menino] stuck with us.  The community stuck with us.  Our financing sources stuck with us, and we won't get into all the machinations, but--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: When you say the community, what factions, and dimensions of the community supported you, and did you work with specifically?
Speaker 2: Well, beyond the thirty different community groups that we helped bring into a group called the Crosstown Council and our rule was, if you would meet with us and you would talk with us and share your ideas, we would put you on a council that would advise us.  And, that group became very important because--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: These are neighborhood people?
Speaker 2: Neighborhood people.  People from the South End, people from Lower Roxbury, people from New Market; people from Roxbury, and business associations.  And, so I don't know if this ever happened before in Boston, but it's not typical that you take forty communities to try to put 'em all together.  You typically try to conquer each community on your--in its own rights, and then get what you want.  And, that doesn't seem the right thing to do on a community based project.  The other piece was, we worked with Boston Connects, Incorporated which is the empowerment zone for the City of Boston.  And, the empowerment zone, every city has an empowerment zone, or many major cities have empowerment zones.  There meant to stimulate growth and economic development.  And, Boston Connects which is a half appointed, half community elected board, voted to put both capital and to work with us to make this project happen.  And, what was expected for that was we would reach out and try to have people from the community work in the project.  In fact, it was required.  There should be a thirty-five percent requirement of empowerment zone residence.  People in the ZIP codes of Dorchester, Roxbury, South End, even, Chinatown.  We managed to get to sixty-seven percent, and we worked very hard at that.  We have, six--97 percent people of color working in the hotel.  We have senior management, including general manager, who is black.  And, these are things that were unheard of before in Boston.  But, we took this as a challenge to sort of raise the bar of showing Boston that we could build a gateway to Roxbury in this location.  But, that we could do also, employ the community in that gateway.  It wasn't just a vestige.
Story_ID: 100366
Speaker 1: So, tell us about Hampton Inn and Suites [Hampton Inn and Suites Boston Crosstown Center in Boston, Massachusetts].  Tell us about this, this building.  What's here and how's it working?
Speaker 2: Well, this is the first phase of the project; which was building the hotel, and that we have a 600 car garage, 650 car garage and 22,000 square feet of retail.  The hotel is a Hilton Hampton Inn and Suites.  It's 175 rooms, 50 of those are suites.  We have a general manager, Phillip Tucker, who's a Morehouse [College in Atlanta, Georgia] man.  Philip is actually done a great job of managing the staff here.  But, the neat thing about this is that, people from around the country make a reservation to stay at this hotel.  And, they do it on price and proximity.  They don't know they're in Roxbury until they get here.  And, a lot of the baggage that we have as Bostonians, about thinking about the territories of Roxbury, South Boston, East Boston, the North End, goes away when you come from out of town.  And, especially when you're coming to stay for a couple of days.  So, one of the exciting things about this project and this site is that people come here and if you look in the lobby, it looks like the U.N.  I mean, a one day it maybe the black engineers, another day it maybe the USA Track and Field folks, another day it maybe ten people from Wichita, who have come here.  But, we're in a great location and we're celebrating the fact that Roxbury is very much part of the city [Boston, Massachusetts] and this project is sort of drawing us further into the city rather than making us an island of predominately black people.  Eventually, I'm sorry, we also lease 500 of our 650 parking spaces to the Longwood Medical Area a mile away.  So, now there's a link between the medical areas.  One is right next to us, Boston Medical Center.  The other is a mile away.  The Longwood Medical Area.  And, this becomes sort of the bar; the glue.  And, people are going back and forth in a way they never went before.  In the Spring, an even neater thing will happen.  Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Boston University [Boston, University] will come together to occupy an office building that we'll start building this Spring, adjacent to this site.  That's never happened in the history of Boston.  The territorialism that happens somewhat here by neighborhood, also happens at the institutional level.  So, the opportunity to bring them together to do an administrative office building for the medical areas, is a great opportunity to break down that territoriality and to create some jobs for local residents.  And, additionally will bring more retail to the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  There are very few African American owned and operated hotels in the country.  This is one of how many?
Speaker 2: Well, it's one of twenty-seven African American-owned branded hotels.  If you expand that beyond that, it might be a hundred beyond the Hilton, Marriott sort of choice brands of hotels.  It's a very difficult industry to get into.  It requires a lot of capital.  At the minimum, three or four million dollars.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that--
Story_ID: 100367
Speaker 1: Would you tell me a little bit about the financing of the Hampton Inn Garage Retail Complex [Hampton Inn and Suites Boston Crosstown Center in Boston, Massachusetts]?  And what you had to do to get the money that was necessary?
Speaker 2: You know, in Boston [Massachusetts], usually the hardest thing to do is to get community and permitting approval, and the money is the easy thing.  This was the exact opposite.  We rapidly got to consensus amongst all these different community groups to the excitement of a new thing coming to the neighborhood.  And, we quickly discovered that getting it financed was a really hard thing to do.  And, this is what's called an emerging market, or a pioneering location.  You know, it's at the end of an expressway, despite the fact that it's at the end of an expressway exit ramp, and next to a hospital with a million patients and visitors a year.  People aren't--now have to think about this site differently than they thought about it in its former use.  That was a bit of a convincing job, but I will say that initially we started with some help from BankBoston Development Corporation and Gail Snowden was instrumental in that.  And, they became our early stage partners to help us get the money together and get the site permitted and approved.  And, they stayed in as a partner.  Later on, we were buoyed by a commitment from the mayor [Thomas M. Menino] and from the community group, Boston Connects Incorporated, which is in the empowerment zone.  We were able to sell $50 million well, $42 million dollars of tax-exempt bonds assigned to empowerment zones.  And, empowerment zone bonds were fairly unique in their use for this application.  In fact, we may be on of ten opportunities where it's been done.  But, because we had no other sources of capital, we actually had to sell those bonds, but when we went to sell the bonds, we discovered that we needed a guarantee that required some multi-million dollar commitment that we didn't have.  And, that's where the community really stepped up and showed their belief in this project.  Because they converted seven million dollars of money that were earmarked for job training to bricks and mortar capital to guarantee those bonds.  And, that's huge.  Because the people on this board were actually counting on that money to help train people in this community.  And, I think, it showed me two things; one, that the commitment to this was huge, and that the people who were behind it were behind it for more than one reason.  I--in fact, I had a conversation one day with one of the board members.  I said,--she said, "You know why we're doing this."  And, I said, "Yeah.  It's the jobs, we're gonna create economic development.  We're gonna make that happen."  She said, "No.  We're doing it because of you."  I said, "What do you mean, doing it for me?  You know, we're gonna make work.  We're gonna make changes."  She said, "No.  We wanna see black developers operated scale.  We wanna see people become capable and recognized, and we're gonna make this happen."  And, I gotta tell you that, between my grandfather [Frank Jehoy "Doc" Sykes] sitting on their shoulder about the social consciousness of changing the judicial system of Alabama, and this community sitting on this side saying, "We're doing this because of you, because we need you to succeed."  That was very, very enlightening, and it really buoyed our sense of needing to do this.  And, we did whatever we needed to do to get this done.  And, I don't mean that in a bad sense.  But, we bought in some other partners.  Although we kept majority ownership, we actually spun off the 45 percent interest that BankBoston then Fleet Development Bank later then became Corcoran Jennison Companies and so, we've always kept the majority control, but we did whatever we needed to.  And, as a result, we haven't made a lot of money, you know, this is a long term play my, my senses is that it will eventually continue to accrue a lot of value.  But, the jobs that are created here, a sense of change that this represents and what that community expected us to do in terms of creating opportunity for this community and making change and being symbolic of a new Boston is really what this is about.  And, they're financing as well as the people that hung in there with us, like the mayor, and the banks, and the community, is really what made it happen.

Speaker 1: Tell me a little about, a little bit about the transition from Primary Corporation to the New Boston Fund.  And, also your partners and your colleagues in this transition bringing you to this Crosstown Development Center [Hampton Inn and Suites Boston Crosstown Center in Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Sure.  Well, New Boston Fund where I am the head of New Boston Urban Strategy America Fund, which is a new fund.  It's actually quite a transformation for me.  It, it came about an interesting way.  I was looking for that capital that I said we couldn't find anywhere.  And, in doing the Boston State Hospital [Mattapan, Massachusetts] project, I had been part of a group that really wasn't going, wasn't going along quite as quickly as I wanted to.  And, in joining up with Lena Park Community Corporation, we joined with New Boston Fund, or select a New Boston Fund as a partner in the venture.  So, mind you, we evaluated other people and made a choice and eventually decided New Boston Fund would be a good capital partner for us.  And, in the year and a half it took to take--to get a thirty year stuck project out of the mud, I began to appreciate what could be done with the capital that was present at New Boston Fund, which is a family run business.  The Rappaport family known for renovating the West End of Boston as a major project.  But, then fifty years in real estate had amassed the company that had $1.5 billion in assets under management for high net worth individuals.  So, it's a very different kind of thing than what we're about to embark on.  Now, we were gonna go talk to pension funds and retirement systems about using the little guys' money, but a lot of the little guys' money.  You know, in the case of Massachusetts, it's a $30 billion dollar fund of which we were looking to get some allocations from that and Connecticut, and Maryland.  To take that money and then use it to do some of the things that I've been doing at Crosstown.  To actually, take it a change communities and invest with local partners and to be the partner that I couldn't find now, for people in Baltimore and in Connecticut, and in, in other parts of the northeast and mid-Atlantic.  And, so, a terrific thing happened, [Jerome L.] Jerry Rappaport, the head of New Boston Fund shared the same vision I had, allowed me to have the autonomy I needed to be the president of the Urban Strategy Fund.  I had to make a tough choice in that I was the sole practitioner developer doing a fairly large project and I could probably go on and do three or four more in my lifetime.  I decided it was more important to be the head of an organization with all the resources necessary to make change in more places than for me to be somewhat egotistical about this.  And, so, I'm happy to share the spotlight with a lot of really qualified people at New Boston Fund where I can help identify projects that will make changes in communities and then use the resources and the capital of the Rappaports and New Boston Fund to do that.  There were other partners earlier on who also helped me make that trip from who I was to who I have become.  And, I have partner, Tom Welch, and a partner Gene Sisco who are partners in the Crosstown Project.  At a time when we had very little but a vision and some experience, they each brought a background in development and also in working with mixed use and media--multi-media type developments.  And, that helped to get the initial traction for the idea, and then rapidly it moved into all of us working together to--with all of our skills to actually execute what has happened here today.  We later on added a partner, Corcoran Jennison Companies, a larger non-minority partner in a minority position so that we stayed majority owners in the development.  But, always, it's been a question of choices, you know.  What's most important?  Is it most important to be in the spotlight, or is it most important to be effective?  And, at any time, I take effective over being sort of the visible sole player.
Story_ID: 100369
Speaker 1: You mentioned the Boston State Hospital site, which is in the Mattapan neighborhood of the City of Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What was the status of the development of that acreage now?  And, what's the history of that acreage being vacant and not being used?  Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I'm thrilled that we are involved in Boston State Hospital.  I'm really excited that we're breaking ground in the fall on a project that is gonna be near $150 million project.  It will be 500 units of housing of different types, 260 townhouses, 80 age restricted units, 160 apartments.  They'll be a 123 bed skilled nursing care facility.  They'll be a testament to its former purpose as a mental health facility called Heritage House which will have programs based for people who have mental challenges.  We're gonna renovate the Lena Park Community Development Corporation Headquarters, and add twice as much square footage.  So, that now there will be a training and education facility.  So, it's now going to be an opportunity where people previously thought of this site as, if you build it, they will come.  We're now going to train people and send them out into the Boston market as trained individuals.  And, Lena Park [Lena Park Community Corporation], who's our partner in this.  And, when I say our partner, New Boston Fund, the New Boston Urban Strategy America Fund is partners with Lena Park, and that's a really neat thing.  Because, we're now taking a community development corporation and giving them the strength of our capital to help take them to another level so that they can do projects at that scale.  But, one more neat thing is that Lorraine Baugh who's the head of Lena Park actually was a nurse who did some of her training on the Boston State Campus site when it was mental health hospital site.  So, it has been stuck for thirty years.  And, I came across an article insert in the Boston Globe from 1983 talking about, I'm sorry, yeah, 1983, talking about who the players were, what it was and what it was gonna be; like many projects in our community, we don't make the pragmatic decision about what's it gonna take to get it done.  We try to put a group together and say, "Do your best."  And, we can't afford to fail on major projects like this, so we have to make the hard decisions about how will we be effective, how can we do that, and, and the bottom line of that is, if we can't bring capital into communities like Boston State Hospital, the project doesn't get done.  So, it will get done.  It will break ground this fall in 2005, and it will be a four year build out.
Speaker 1: That's exciting.
Speaker 2: And, it will be a new place.
Speaker 1: That's exciting.
Story_ID: 100370
Speaker 1: You have another project that you're working on, a bicycle path.  Can you tell us about that?  Is that an idea?  Or, is it--
Speaker 2: It's happening.  It's outside the door.  It's under construction.  And, one of the neat--I'm always looking to find all the dimensions that are available and if one stays focus just on a singular goal, sometimes you miss the ancillary opportunities.  And, this was one of those opportunities that really was terrific.  There is a group called, Save the Harbor/Save the Bay that is promoted a path called the South Bay Harbor Trail that leaves from Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], from the exterior Roxbury at Northeastern [University in Boston, Massachusetts] connecting to the Southwest Corridor Parkland.  Along Melnea Cass Boulevard it goes underneath the Central Artery and onto the new, newly, or new to be renovated Water Sheet of the Four Point Channel and out to the Boston Harbor.  And, it actually gets to the heart of something called Chapter 91 Law, which says that every citizen is supposed to have access to the water.  Well, the problem is if you build big buildings and you build hotels and you build everything along the edge of the water, I'm not sure how inner city kids from Roxbury every really get to experience the water.  And, so, if we can get there by a train line, if we can get there by a bike path, if we can symbolically tie it into our community, that's an important thing.  And, so, one of the first new pieces of that bike path, which actually is in place up to the Water and Sewer Building in--if you go out there, there's a con--asphalt path.  But, now were gonna add retail, and activities and umbrellas and places where people can stop, get off of their bike, or get off of their walk and really experience Roxbury, right here at the gateway to Roxbury.
Speaker 1: How long will this path be?  How many miles?
Speaker 2: I think it, actually the trip to the water is a three mile path.  But, then of course the Harbor Walk is many, many, miles and goes around the whole Harbor of Boston, and includes the Institute of Contemporary Art, and a number of the hotels.  And, there have to be public amenities all along the way, and that's part of the requirement on building on the water in Boston.
Speaker 1: Now, are you doing the financing of this?  Are you doing the design and the architecture too?  What--
Speaker 2: Well, we hired--
Speaker 1: What piece of this are you doing?
Speaker 2: It--we're actually giving a piece of our land which is also public land.  'Cause as I may or may not have mentioned, this land is a ground lease from the City of Boston.  But, the land that the park is on is owned by the MBTA [Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority], the Mass Highway Department and, and actually the City of Boston.  And, so, we're able to give that stretch and we've contributed through utilizing Public Works Economic Development grab money, a million dollars to the development of the park.  So, that's where we are.
Story_ID: 100371
Speaker 1: Another area that has been talked about in literature on your work, is the Roxbury [Strategic] Master Plan for the BRA [Boston Redevelopment Authority in Boston, Massachusetts].  Is that something that's in the future, or is active now?  What is that about?
Speaker 2: The Roxbury Master Plan has been adopted.  And, it was a five year process that the community spent a lot of time developing what they wanted to see Roxbury become.  The part that I focused on was the economic development on Melnea Cass Boulevard and the opportunity I like to refer to it as the dumbbell, because on either end of this bar called Melnea Cass Boulevard are these institutions.  On this end, Boston Medical Center, Boston University Medical School [Medical Campus], BioSquare, our new Biotech Campus.  And, on that end, Northeastern University [Boston, University], the Fenway Colleges [Colleges of the Fenway], the Longwood Medical Area.  And, the bar happens to go through the black community.  And the bar is on Melnea Cass Boulevard.  This is just a piece of the bar.  It's a sort of a, a grip.  And, what happens along the rest of that bar would be very important to what--how Dudley [Square] and other parts of our community are actually developed because we can capitalize on the institutional commitment.  So, the Master Plan is in play, but I think we've begun the thinking around Melnea Cass with this project.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 100372
Speaker 1: Okay, we gonna move into some, some wrap up questions.  At this point, is there anything else that you'd like to add to this HistoryMakers' interview about your life, about your career, accomplishments that we haven't asked you about?
Speaker 2: I think you've asked me about many things.  I think in terms of putting it into a cohesive thought about one's life is a tough thing to do.  If I were to try and think about how to say that, I guess, I would say that as I may have a moment ago.  Two things that are important to me are innovation, and consensus building.  And, I think that those are central to being true to one's self and one's goals and trying to have a life that's meaningful and fulfilled.  But, innovation is, is central.  And, I think that I've always tried to springboard of what people who preceded me did.  And, whether that's my grandfather [Frank Jehoy "Doc" Sykes] or our icons of the black, black history, many of which you've interviewed, people who've been beneficial and helpful to me like [HM] Vernon Jordan, and people I've gotten to meet and got to know who have been very encouraging.  But, I think I'm always looking to take it one step further and I'm hoping that for my life that would be my legacy.  If my grandfather played ball, I wanted to be a professional skier.  If somebody learned how to design buildings, I wanted to figure out how to finance them.  If somebody knows how to make a lot of money, I wanna figure out how to make a lot of money and make a difference.  So, I'm hoping that I can always step it up one notch, and make it my history role.
Story_ID: 100373
Speaker 1: How was [HM] Vernon Jordan [Jr.], Vernon Jordan helpful to you?
Speaker 2: Well, Vernon, as my wife [Karen James Sykes] likes to call him, "Uncle Vernon," is by, by close friendship to his daughter Vickee [Jordan Adams] been helpful to us, at least in terms of as basically an icon in his own right of somebody who's made those transformations from the Urban League, to the world of business, and who hasn't kept those acc-that access to himself.  And, you know, even spending time to hear about the [New Boston] Urban Strategy America Fund and try to think where he could be helpful.  That--I really value that.  Because he doesn't have to take the time.  We have lots of people like Vernon but few that have achieved the same visibility and notoriety.  But, to take the time and to spend it with someone coming along like myself, is inspirational and keeps up going, keeps me going.
Speaker 1: Is there any other person who's been helpful in this way that stands out in your mind?
Speaker 2: There are lots people and I think in Boston one of the things that I've seen is people come together to try to make change and friends like Ralph Martin who has made it from being in the private--public sector to now being in the private sector.  There are people who like Marian Heard, you know, who, you know, as she makes her way out, or has made her way out of the United Way has continued to think about how to be an influencer.  And, so, while these are people who I don't spend a lot of time with, they are people who I know are there as resources and I know that I can call them and ask them for their help and their vision, so.
Story_ID: 100374
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way that you've led your life, so far?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm very pleased with what I've been able to do and who I am.  I think about that a lot.  I think about if your life were to end tomorrow, what would you think about what you've been able to do.  I don't spend a lot of time again, looking forward to what I might do or a lot of time looking backward to what I did.  But, I'm inspired in the moment to do more by knowing that I've been able to achieve a lot.  So, I'm very pleased with where we are and I hope there's more to come.
Speaker 1: Is there any reason why you might have chosen a different career than the one you've chosen?  You selected architecture.  As you look back, was that the right choice for you?
Speaker 2: I think the right choice was to be able to search your soul and find out what was important to you.  And, I think what was important to me about architecture was making change and being able to innovate.  And, I think that I've been able to migrate those principles through several different disciplines whether it's real estate or finance or development or architecture.  What was important wasn't the choice of the career, but the choice of the goal.
Story_ID: 100375
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community today both locally and nationally?
Speaker 2: I do hope that, and I hate to sound like a broken record, I do hope we can innovate there as well.  And, I hope we can get passed what we have done historically as a yardstick for what we'll do in the future.  I think, we're at a very interesting point and time given the demographic shifts of the country and in the city.  We are a minority, majority of minority individuals in the City of Boston [Massachusetts] today as a group.  We're not a majority of black people who dominate the overall population.  And, I think we have to learn to work across boundaries, cultural boundaries and learn how to serve people of color, rather than serve our own tribal instincts and interests.  That same situation is going to be reflected in the demographics in the United States and that's going to happen over the next fifty years.  And, if we don't figure out how to work, sort of unilaterally rather than individually, I think we'll end up missing an opportunity to really transform this country to one of more tolerance, to one of more innovation, to be one of more inclusion, and so I hope that we'll see that opportunity and seize it in our choices.
Story_ID: 100376
Speaker 1: I'm quite sure that there are young people here in the Roxbury neighborhood and the City of Boston [Massachusetts] who are beginning to know who Kirk Sykes is and what he's doing.  And, that will happen even nationally.  What suggestions or advice do you have for our youth?  Our middle or high school students who are interested in social change, architecture; what would be your message to young people today that--who would be thinking about going in the areas that you're working in?
Speaker 2: Be a doer.  Don't be a watcher.  And, that's a hard thing to do.  I mean, frequently there are a lot of impediments and they can be as difficult as "I don't how to get there from here.  I don't know who to call," to "I've gotta put food on the table."  "I've gotta translate for my mother or father."  I've been inspired.  I've been a member of the Jackie Robinson Scholarship Foundation for the last ten years, and the kids that I see come in front of us for scholarship are just mind blowing.  Because they're so multi-dimensional that they are monolithic, you know, they're not just good at math, or they're not just good at science.  But, they've, they've found a way to get in the lab at Beth Israel [Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts] if they're interested in science.  They've found a way to get a mentor.  They've found a way to inroads to get them spring board into corporate America.  And, I guess, the same kind of, "Don't wait for somebody to do it for you, take the initiative" mentality that has worked for me, I hope, is a--you know, an icon or a road map for other people to do it that were younger.  And, I'm sure they will do that.
Story_ID: 100377
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think I want to be remembered as someone who affected change.  And, someone who saw things differently.  I don't want to repeat what people have done.  I want to build on what people have achieved but I do want to leave my mark in a way that is not materialistic.  I mean, what is most exciting about this place as we've talked about it, is not that it's a building but who's in the building.  And, that we can get people to go places that they haven't been before by understanding how to make them comfortable but also how to expose them to that which is often a little challenging.  So, if I can be of one of those agents of change that helps people explore their boundaries, then I will have achieved a good result.
Speaker 1: Good.
Story_ID: 100378
Speaker 1: One last question: tell me about your life as a skier today.  Are you still skiing?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My life as a skier is gonna be one that is gonna have a legacy as long as my body will keep up with me.  A couple acupuncture visits every couple of weeks to take care of the aches and pains, and the things I've done to myself.  But, now it's more one of coaching my son [Kyle Sykes], who has become an accomplished skier in his own right.  But, for me it's a matter of freedom.  It's a chance to be in nature.  It's a chance to do things differently, and it's much more than a sport.  It's really a chance for one to realize one's dreams and to physically be part of nature.  And, so, for me that's, that's really an important part I think will always be a part of me.
Speaker 1: When was your last ski trip?  When was the last time you skied?
Speaker 2: Well, I skied last, last weekend.  I took my son to the Eastern Championships where he had earned a spot to compete with the best in the East.  And, I went to a place in May, and I never thought I'd go that far into May, but it's amazing what will take you places.  But, prior to that, we actually had been invited out to Colorado for the Sports Illustrated Championships where he actually was invited to compete, represented our mountain out there during the Black Ski Summit, so.
Story_ID: 100379
Speaker 1: This is one of my earlier, earliest photos of, I guess, based on my father's [Lawrence Sykes'] artistic background, I always had designed materials in my hands, so.
Speaker 2: Probably on my way to church, I'm wearing a tie and a coat.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  This one, eight years old?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: I developed a passion for sort of alternative sports at a fairly young age, and I think this might have been one of those days I was hand standing on my skateboard across the Cornell Quadrangle [Cornell University in Ithaca, New York].  It ended on the cover of the Ethical Journal at one point (laughter).
Speaker 1: This photo for me because it has both of my grandparents.  On the left, my paternal grandfather, [Frank Jehoy] "Doc" Sykes, the pitcher in the Negro Leagues.  And, on the right, my maternal grandfather, [J.] Ballard Swan, entrepreneur and welder in the Brooklyn Navy Yards, and then in the middle and afroed Kirk, probably at about sixteen.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Good.  Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Now, one of the inspirations here--oh, I'm sorry you don't want--is Doc Sykes' history of playing with a number of different Negro League Teams; the Baltimore Black Sox, the Monarchs, Hillsdale, you know, just sort of the inspiration that he could do multiple things at once.  Going to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and playing in the Negro Leagues.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Which one is he?
Speaker 2: Doc Sykes is right here.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Upon my grandfather's 90th birthday, we had a celebration for him at Howard University.  It was very special in that all of his fraternal order of both medical fraternities as well as the head of Howard University sort of spoke on his behalf.  And, Sterling Brown, the poet, gave testimony to him in a poem as well.
Speaker 1: This is one of the few photos of sort of both sides of the family in one place.  And, here I am at about, I think it was around the time I was at Cornell, probably around eighteen.  My grandfather on my father's side, my father next to him.  My grandmother on my father's side here all together.  And, then my mother [Barbara Sykes], and my mother's mother [Ida Swann] and unfortunately by now my mother's father had died.
Speaker 2: Well, we do a lot as a family and this is our--we're out sailing on the Boston Harbor.  This is a great photo because it includes my wife, Karen [Sykes], and my son, Kyle, and my daughter, Sydney.  They're all a little older than this now by a couple of years.  But, still it's a great moment because it says, "We'll see you there," (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, this is the love of my life and you can imagine going through all the careers and activities I have, my wife Karen has been very much there to offer inspiration and guidance as well as the levity it taken when things are challenging.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 2: As I mentioned, I've sort of been an alternative sports guy for a long time and maybe that's because of my father was so successful in basketball, my grandfather at baseball, I felt the need to go far afield.  So, this is a picture of helicopter skiing in British, Columbia.  Skiing one of my greatest passions and this is the outer-most limits of the sport.
Speaker 1: I love this photo because it's when we broke ground for the Crosstown Center project [Hampton Inn and Suites Boston Crosstown Center in Boston, Massachusetts].  It sort of was a transformative moment for me.  Here I am, but the mayor; also [HM] Senator [Dianne] Wilkerson; my partner, Paul Welch; and a number of people who've been involved in the financing of the project and support for the community.  But, what's really important is that this shows that the diversity of Boston is starting to come together around important events to make things happen.  So, I guess, I'm proudest most of bringing all these folks together around our project.
Speaker 2: Every Thanksgiving my family serves Thanksgiving dinner to Morgan Memorial Goodwill [Industries] and here I am behind Counselor [Maureen] Feeney of Boston, cleaning up some pie plates I think, but it's just important for our kids to know that it's important to give back, to give back in their own community in Roxbury.
Speaker 1: Along the same lines, you know, I've always been excited about the projects that have brought people together and this is the opening of the Nature Center in Mattapan [Boston Nature Center and Wildlife Sanctuary in Mattapan, Massachusetts], Boston's first environmentally sensitive building.  But, more importantly, someplace the kids can come in the middle of the city and experience nature.  As you can see by the excitement on their faces, I think it's doing that.
Speaker 2: This piece is actually was done by my father to commemorate a trip that my son and he and I took when my son was ten, and my dad was seventy, from Cape Town, South Africa to Cairo, Egypt.  It was important in that it was sort of amazing trip with everybody from the Maasai to the (unclear) to surfing in South Africa to riding camels and Giza [Egypt] and learning, and trying to learn Arabic at the base of the Cairo Museum.  But, what's really important about it is how important being a global citizen to me and to my family.  And, my father's traveled extensively throughout Africa and now with my son at age fourteen having Africa, Europe, South America under his belt, we're on our way to China in the summer, and I hope that they'll be global citizens and that we can instill that in them.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot.
