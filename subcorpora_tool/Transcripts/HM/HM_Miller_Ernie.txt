Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: And his mother and father who were R.B. Willis [ph.], but they were in slavery in Tennessee in Nashville, Tennessee, and they had to take the name of Anderson because that was the name of the slave owners and when, when my grandfather was born, he was Laurine Cecil Anderson and he had two brothers, Calvin Anderson [ph.] and Ernest Anderson [E.H. Anderson], for whom I was named 'cause my mother didn't have any boys so they had to want to keep his name alive so they named me (laughter) and I get mail all the time when Mr. Ernest, you know, but I had to let them know I'm not a male, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, all right, okay. So tell me, go ahead, continue your--
Speaker 2: Okay, and so when they were little boys, they, they lived, they had a house near, they gave them a cabin to live in and everything but these were actually really good slave owners.

There was his brother, his youngest brother, Ernest Anderson died very young at forty-nine, I think he was, I'm sure, and then L.C. Anderson took over the presidency of the school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so they were well-educated and I didn't know the slave owners, you know, that was long before my time--

She could really cook good. She'd cook us collard greens, sweet potatoes, corn bread and chicken and dumplings and it was just, we remember her for all of her, and she'd make gingerbread and cookies and she was a very good grandmother and that's the main thing I remember.

Speaker 1: Okay, your mother, so she went to high school and then she went to Prairie View?

Speaker 1: Okay, and she learned to teach there, at Fisk?
Speaker 2: Yes, and she was in the home economics department at Prairie View for a while and then later on, after she retired, and that she was a matron out at the D.B. and O Institute [Texas Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institute for Colored Youth; Texas School for the Deaf, Austin, Texas] for girls (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, D.B.O. Institute, tell me about that?

Speaker 2: Yes, and he worked, he was the, he taught broom and mattress making and, but he went there to school also because he, when he was a little boy and climbing a tree and the limbs flew back and hit him in the eye and he lost one eye and so he had to go out there after he was, you know, old enough to, to go to school.
Story_ID: 571987
Speaker 1: Now, we'll talk more about your mother [Lizzie Anderson Crafton] but let's talk about your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Well, now, I didn't know them too well.
Speaker 1: Do you know their names?
Speaker 2: Kreisler, K-R-E-I-S-L-E-R, I think was their family name but they lived in Brazoria, Texas and that's near Houston [Texas] but the Crafton, I didn't know the grandfather on that side of the, of the family, on my father's side. So, this was Jesse's [ph.] sister that was a Kreisler, Kreisler.

Speaker 1: Okay, well tell me about your father. You gave me a little bit of information about how he lost his eye and went to the school there [Texas Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institute for Colored Youth; Texas School for the Deaf, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: And a limb flew back and hit him in the, in, right in his eye, a little boy climbing a tree, I guess, they told me and you need, ruined one eye and so he had a glass eye but he was still super to get out of the house, so--
Speaker 1: All right. Well tell me about your relationship with him.
Speaker 2: Not, not too much because he and my mother got a divorce when we were very young kids. I had two other sisters [Fannie Crafton Brooks and Marjorie Crafton] and one is five years older than I and the other one was six years older than I and so the three girls we, my grandfather [L.C. Anderson], on my mother's side, came up and came to Houston and got us and brought us home so we could have a better, a much better life here in Austin [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we lived there all, all our life.
Story_ID: 571988

And the other sister, who was, she was born with a, well they had to use, she was born in Galveston, Texas and they had to use forceps, she was a breach birth, I don't know, all that's in the stomach but it injured her spine a little bit and she was, not severely crippled but she was a little bit, it affected her nerves a little bit but she was, she finished high school and all but she's still here and she has, you know, a good mind and all but I finally just had to put her in a nursing home because I was taking care of her but I had to put her in a nursing, she got a little bit too rough on me to handle it all with my little kids and her too, so, but she's doing fine. She, I found the best nursing home in Austin [Texas] I could find for her and she's happy there and that's the main thing.
Story_ID: 571989
Speaker 1: Now tell me about when you were elementary school age and you're living now in Austin [Texas] with your [maternal] grandparents (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Grandparents, yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather [L.C. Anderson] was principal of the Anderson High School [E.H. Anderson High School; L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas] here and I remember, I remember, and I have a picture where I was standing under a little kid umbrella and he had, had me come over there, I was always playing the piano, I don't know, I guess I was just, my grandmother [Fannie Pollard Anderson] used to play the piano and all and so he had me come over there and play one day in the, in chapel and they had, and I think the song I played was, "Peter Peter pumpkin eater (laughter), had a wife and couldn't keep her, put her in a pumpkin shell, and there he kept her very well," and I think, there were two things and I got a big applause and that was also but, I think I was about five years old and they took a picture of me doing that. I have the picture here but, and they thought it was real nice that I would do that but I never was, I never had stage fright in my life, you know. So I was just a little girl and I ran on over to, they had such a grand and played this song for them, and that's--
Speaker 1: How did you learn to play the piano?
Speaker 2: I really started playing the piano, I used to listen to my, my grandmother had an old Victrola that you'd wind up and she had a lot of records and I would just play those records over and over and over and wind the Victrola and sometimes fall asleep on the Victrola and, but I had a good ear and I would go in the living room, we had a piano and I'm going, in a little bit and I started picking that out, I guess by ear, I'm sure it was by ear and then they decided to give me music lessons and so from then on I just kept on improving and a lot of times, a lot of times now, if I can have the sheet music, I read it but it sounds so mechanical, it's not me to just have to play everything that was written on that sheet music. I, I would change it in a way and put some of Ernie Mae [HistoryMaker Ernie Mae Miller] in it and it seemed like it passed melody (laughter) and I played it like it was from the way and I'd say, "Well, Mom [Lizzie Anderson Crafton], everybody plays it the way it's supposed to be, so, but I play it the way I liked it," and really it paid off 'cause all my life I had played piano. I used to play at Sunday school and then there were a, there was a pastor, Reverend C.E. Whitaker [ph.], that was at the Methodist church at Wesley Chapel Methodist Church [Austin, Texas] and he used to take me when I was a little girl to their little conferences that they would have around and towns and small towns here in Texas and he'd have me play and I think at one I sang 'Jesus Loves Me' and they, all the people at church just started, I was just a little girl, but I just really did love playing piano and still do and whenever I get, oh, whenever I get kind of upset or something, I go sit on the piano and it seems like the words just float right out the window and, you know, I was good about word about things, I'd go over and play and it tranquilizes me, okay.
Speaker 1: Now, you said your grandfather was the principal at the high school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the high school?
Speaker 2: It was L.C., it was Anderson High School then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but it was named for his brother [E.H. Anderson] first and after his brother had died and my grandfather took over the principal of the school, well Mr. McCallum [Arthur Newell McCallum, Sr.] who was superintendent of schools here in Austin, changed it to L.C. Anderson and so the new Anderson on Mesa Drive now, is really integrated and one of the best schools here in Austin, best high school and it was named for him, Laurine Cecil Anderson, and they have his picture in the library out there.
Story_ID: 571990
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about the neighborhood that you grew up in [in Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, then it was really a nice neighborhood, well, mostly all Negroes lived in that neighborhood. There were few white families and, that I remember and one had a little gift shop down on about a block from there and we'd always go when they have a birthday, anything, and we'd go down there and buy a little gift and she was very nice and then another family that was white, well he drove a bread truck for Pandan [ph.], the bread and he would bring us buns and, and bread and everything, he was very, very nice too, and we never had any trouble with any other races or anything, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was there a mixture?
Speaker 2: --the whole neighborhood was really integrated long before integration had actually came about because everybody that lived in that neighborhood kind of got along and some more people named Pesky [ph.] lived down on, about a block down the street from us and they all helped each other out but the neighbors are not like that now, but anyway you had, after the neighborhood finally went into a little bit of decay well, and my husband [Hammitt Miller] and I, after we, we got married and we moved out here where I'm living now.
Story_ID: 571991
Speaker 1: Talking about integration, do you know about any mixing of the races in your family tree? Were there white relatives of yours (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't, I don't know of any although pictures of my, I have pictures of great-great-grandparents and everything and, oh, great-great-grandmother was named Eggleston and she, I have the pictures out there, hanging in the, in another room, but she--
Speaker 1: She's your, on, on what side of your family? Your mother [Lizzie Anderson Crafton] or your father [Otto Crafton]?
Speaker 2: She was on my--
Speaker 1: On your mother's side?
Speaker 2: --on my, yeah, my grandmother, on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Your great-great-grandmother was Eggelston?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, E-G-G-E-L-S-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I don't know they, they looked, you know, I guess, she was, she was a good lady but I mean, they didn't look, I don't know what happened way down the line. It's just--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that's fine. Okay, that's fine, well, let's move on.
Speaker 2: She was good--

Speaker 2: Oh, I started at six years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And it was at Olive Street School [Austin, Texas], that's what they called it and this Olive Street School, previously, was one of the old high schools after this small little shotgun place, well they built this, it was a frame building, it was a two-story building, and they built it on, it was really a high, the high school, and then finally we just came on up and got real good high schools from then, but they made that school an elementary school and that's where I went 'cause it was right there in the neighborhood.
Story_ID: 571993
Speaker 1: --Telling me off-camera about the neighborhood and the streetcars. What do you remember about the streetcars (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, I remember, we had some little friends that lived up the street from us and we went up there to play and they said, "We've got some straight pins, we're going to make some scissors out of them." So we went out there and laid the straight pins on the track before the streetcar came by and the streetcar pressed them together, you know, and we thought that was something and we finally had to stop that. When Momma [Lizzie Anderson Crafton] found out about it, we were making scissors out of the little straight pins, crossed on and let the streetcar run over them and we'd run and hide and then (laughter) go get them back. That was just somebody's unwise idea, one of the kids.
Speaker 1: Well tell me about the streetcar, it went from where to where?
Speaker 2: It went from downtown, well, I, it was called the East End streetcar but they had streetcars, you know, all over town [Austin, Texas] but the only one we ever rode was the one that came up San Bernard Street all the way and then turned right on 12th Street and went straight out 12th to Chicon [Street] and that was the end of the line but now it has built up so since then. We have buses now and no more streetcars.
Speaker 1: Do you remember horses delivering milk or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Any what, now?
Speaker 1: Milk, horse, were there horses?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No horses?
Speaker 2: --no, it was run by electrical. It had the, some kind of a cable on the--
Speaker 1: No, I'm just saying, other delivery, other--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, sometime farmers and things would come into town and the ice men, ice man, he had a truck and, 'cause we didn't, didn't many of us have refrigerators and we had what we called a coolerator and I remember my [maternal] grandmother [Fannie Pollard Anderson] and them used to get a hundred pounds of ice and put it on top of the coolerator and that would last about a week, I guess, and he would come by every, every week and put in another hundred pounds of ice and, but there were refrigerators then but we didn't have one at the time and it used to be another lady that, she made hot tamales and she had a little red wagon and she would, she would come all down the neighborhood and she was a black lady with these hot tamales and all the neighbors would buy. They were real good, I remember that (laughter). And so, and then we had a grocery store, a neighborhood grocery store, that was Ms. Geese's [ph.] grocery store and every time my grandfather [L.C. Anderson] would go pay the bill on Saturdays, she would send a sack of jelly beans, a can of (unclear) to bring to us, you know. So I remember her for that and she was on San Bernard and 13th Street, but that's the way we'd get grocery and pay the bill once a week, I remember that very distinctly (laughter), on account of the jelly beans and what not she'd send back.
Story_ID: 571994
Speaker 1: What games did you play as a child?
Speaker 2: Oh, hopscotch and we played kick ball and I remember in, in Olive Street [Olive Street School, Austin, Texas], we had a teacher, Mrs. Hutchins, Robinson [ph.] at the time, and we did, she taught us a little dance with three, it would, one would be the leader and the other two on the side but we would hold hands and we'd, we did on the, the name of the song, the record player we played would be 'The Skater's Waltz' and she taught us how to do like we were skating, you know, and, and I really did like that and we did that on one of the May festival and was very enjoyable by the audience. She called it 'The Skater's Waltz,' the leader, we'd all go in the same direction, sometimes the kids would get kind of mixed up and the leader would be going one way and the others going (laughter), but we managed to get by.
Speaker 1: What else do you remember about Olive Street elementary school? Besides that teacher, was there any other teacher that you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Ms. Emma B. Starks [ph.], who was a music teacher and she kept us, we had a nice little choir, chorus, and we'd go out and sing whenever asked, you know. So I remember we wore a little black skirt and a white blouse and the boys had their own black pants and the white shirt and she'd teach us song. I remember one song we, we sang and we liked it. It was an Italian song called, 'Funiculi, Funicula,' and it said, (singing) "Harken, harken, joy is everywhere, harken, harken, joy is everywhere, funiculi, funicula, joy is everywhere, funiculi, funicula," you know, it's longer than that but that's about the only way I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was one of our favorite songs.

Speaker 1: Who were you taking piano, were you taking piano lessons by this time in elementary school [Olive Street School, Austin, Texas] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Ms. Laclede Smith, she was from Waco [Texas] and she would come here to go to school. It was the old Sam Houston College [Sam Houston State Teachers College; Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, Texas] then but she lived, when she would come to Austin [Texas], she lived right a few doors from my, from where we lived and we got acquainted and she told my mother [Lizzie Anderson Crafton], "Let me take her home with me in the summer and I'll teach her some music," that she, so she was one of my first music teachers and she was very good and then when I, she went back to Waco and then she was a teacher at Prairie View [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas]. When I went to Prairie View, she was the music teacher down there and so she was very, really my favorite music teacher, Laclede Smith and took also from a lady named Ms. Clara Brown when I was here in Austin, so, that, and they all used to get after me about changing, when they were teaching the music note by note they, I put my little part of me in it and, you know (laughter), "Why you doing that," you know, it seemed like to me that paid off and I was just a little girl, I didn't know that it would pay off that much but everybody liked the way I did it sometimes. They'd say, "Oh, you changed that from Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] to Ernie Mae [HistoryMaker Ernie Mae Miller], didn't you?" I said, "Well, yes."
Speaker 1: Did you listen to the radio much?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's, we didn't have television then and I liked listen to the 'Amos 'n' Andy' show and then there was some church choir or something would broadcast and listen to that on the radio.

Speaker 1: What else do you remember about elementary school [Olive Street School, Austin, Texas]?
Speaker 2: And I remember they (laughter), I was a pretty fat little girl then and I was in line one day and the teacher said, "Get in, get back, get in that line better than that," and I had my legs sticking out and she came by and whacked me on my leg (laughter) and I said, 'cause my legs were fat that they were sticking out more than the other little girls', but I don't know, so, I remember that. She, she didn't ever say excuse me or anything, she just whopped me on my leg and (laughter) I cried and then the other little girls at school, we had some paper and paste that we'd do in our little art class and so they put some paper on the whip kind of she gave me and put some paste on but when I got home, and then shoot and it wasn't there to hold to. I just can't forget that but she meant for us to be in a straight line and I was sticking, my leg was sticking out, not in a straight line but she was very strict (laughter).

Speaker 1: Did you go to a junior high school or did you go straight to high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I went--
Speaker 1: You went to junior high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to a junior high school and Mr. I.Q. Hurdle was the principal then, and--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Kealing, K-E-A-L-I-N-G, Kealing Junior High [Theodore Kealing Junior High School; Theodore Kealing Middle School, Austin, Texas] and it was only about a block from the high school. It was on Pennsylvania Avenue and then we just only went there in the sixth and the seventh and I didn't do any sixth grade work, they skipped me. I don't know if it was because we only had that one junior high school and it was so crowded, I think, those are, they thought I could make it, they skipped and then, and so I didn't do any sixth grade work. I was skipped just to the seventh so I was only at the junior high school for the seventh, you know, for the grade seven and then when I finished that, I went onto high school and was in the eighth, but--
Speaker 1: What high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: That was still Anderson High [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: Oh, Anderson High, okay, all right. Now who was the principal of Anderson High when you went there?
Speaker 2: W.B. Campbell, C-A-M-P-B-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now tell me about your high school days.
Speaker 2: Oh, they were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What do you remember about high school?
Speaker 2: --they were wonderful because I, with me being so interested in music and, and liking music so, I wanted to get in the high school band. They didn't have one in the junior high school then. So, I took, I didn't have a horn and mom [Lizzie Anderson Crafton] said, "Oh you don't need to play in a band. What you gonna go," you know, but anyway, Mr. B.L. Joyce who was the band director there at the high school, he said I had talent and I could use a horn that was left there in the band room, it was an old C melody saxophone. They're not even made anymore but I, I think in a week I was in the big band. I learned that horn very quickly and then when his daughter finished high school, she played tenor saxophone, she let me use her tenor saxophone for a while so I, then, then that was, more music was written for the tenor than that C melody 'cause we always had to, then the band director would have to write my part out with a C melody because he couldn't find the music that was written for C melody horn but then after I got on the tenor, it was, it was very much, it was different and it was, I liked it very much and then when I finished high school--
Speaker 1: Well, let's not, let's not go--
Speaker 2: Any further, okay.
Speaker 1: --because we need to go back a little bit because there was a story that we talked about earlier--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --off camera about when you were about eleven and you went to hear the International Sweethearts--
Speaker 2: Sweethearts of Rhythm [International Sweethearts of Rhythm]--
Speaker 1: --of Rhythm.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, and they were at the, it was a place called The Cotton Club [ph.] then, here on 11th Street, and I went to hear them, this all girl band which was a Sweethearts of Rhythm and someone told Mr. Jones [Laurence C. Jones] that I, "There's a little girl here, you ought to hear her play the piano," and so he had me come up and play, I think I played 'Starlight' or something and oh, he wanted me to go back with him to Piney Woods, Mississippi to learn more and he really wanted me to play guitar that, no, my mother wouldn't stand for that so that passed some but anyway that kept me, kept up my interest in wanting to play in a band. So when I finished high school, I, she let me go on to Prairie View [Prairie View University; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] and I had to buy a baritone saxophone then because they had all the other saxophones and I did good on the baritone so that's what I played with this band [Prairie View Co-eds] at Prairie View.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we all had to kind of have a little audition before we could get in the band and I remember the song I played was, 'Cotton Tail' and Harry Carney, that played with Duke Ellington, I think he wrote that, the song, 'Cotton Tail' and he played baritone sax with Duke Ellington and I, I heard them once too but I was older then and so I played 'Cotton Tail.' Well, they took me in the band real quick (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. Well let's, let's go back to high school a little bit. Tell me some more about your high school days.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you went to high school in, what year?
Speaker 2: When I finished junior high school, I must have been about eleven or, no, I had to be about eleven or, eleven because I didn't do any, any second grade work in school and I didn't do any sixth grade work so they had me finishing high school at fourteen. So, then I went to Prairie View and that was--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're about 1944, I guess.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, in high school, what were some of the other activities that you participated in?
Speaker 2: Well, nothing else really because the band just took up all of my extra time other than I wasn't in any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Any other things?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: What about--
Speaker 2: --pep, in a pep squad or anything like that, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 571998
Speaker 1: What about church? Church was very important?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, and I went to Ebenezer Baptist Church [Austin, Texas] and the pastor was Reverend J.C. Lott, L-O-T-T, Lott, and then we had Ms. Mary Jane Sims who, one the schools, elementary schools [Mary Jane Sims Early College Prep] here in Austin [Texas] named, have her name, but she was my Sunday school teacher and we, that's how I knew her. When I got to the first grade, she was teaching at Olive Street [Olive Street School, Austin, Texas] and she was my first grade school teacher, too, and so then she taught Sunday school and on Sundays and, and I got a little certificate and I still have that certificate which is a good thirty, it's about thirty-five years old, thirty-eight years old (laughter). I still have the certificate that I did well in Sunday school and, and the little certificate is sort of frayed now, I guess, I'm going to put it on a frame and see if I can have it re-photographed but--
Speaker 1: Did you play music at church?
Speaker 2: Well a little bit at Sunday school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And after, later, when I was playing in mostly in clubs and things, well, I don't know if this lady, well she wanted me to play for the children's choir at church and she told me, said, "Oh, you playing that too fast," and all she did was keeping me just kind of got me out of, I don't know what it was, but I told her, "Well, I'll tell you what, if I can't play it, if I'm going to play it right, you play it." I shouldn't have said that, I guess, but (laughter) she got me out of there right quick, you know, so, I really, it wasn't really my thing to play, you know, for the little kids, but I--
Speaker 1: All right, so you--
Speaker 2: --I would do it as long as they wanted me to do it but she found so much that I wasn't doing it like she wanted so I just told her to do it.
Story_ID: 571999
Speaker 1: Now we're onto Prairie View [Prairie View University; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] and you auditioned and they accept you into the band [Prairie View Co-eds]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So tell me what was, what was that like for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was real, 'cause I definitely wanted to be in the band and so they, my mother [Lizzie Anderson Crafton] had talked to Mr. Will Henry Bennett, he was from Houston [Texas], his home was in Houston, and he had married a lady from Austin [Texas], last name was Madison [ph.], and my mother knew her mother and all like that and so, they'd say, "Well, let her go on and see if she can get in that band," and so that just thrilled me so, so I went on, I finished high school in summer school and I went on to Prairie View to start in September and so they asked me, well what could I play and I told them the, I would play, they wanted a baritone, they didn't need any other saxophone but the baritone so, and I went to J.R. Reed Music [J.R. Reed Music Company] here in Austin and I bought a baritone and when, and so they said, "Well what can you play on it?" And I, I really wasn't too familiar with baritone but I had heard on one of my grandma's [Fannie Pollard Anderson] records a song called, 'Cotton Tail,' it was Harry Carney and he took a solo with, on this particular song with Duke Ellington's band. So I, I just played 'Cotton Tail' for them and they thought it was really good. I had just learned to play it on the baritone so I got in the band real quick.
Speaker 1: Okay, now give me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was a little audition like.
Speaker 1: All right. Give me a little history on girl bands, I mean, 'cause this was a time during the war [World War II, WWII]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and so tell me a little history about how the girl bands began.
Speaker 2: Well we got started because most of the Prairie View Collegians, which was the men's band, they were just breaking up because so many had to go in the [U.S.] Army or the service and so Mr. Will Henry Bennett thought, maybe we should start a girl band and he did and we were very successful and we went to all USOs [United Service Organizations], I think, in the United States and the, we would tour every summer and sometime we would go to places during Christmas holidays here in Texas but during the summer we traveled all up and down the East Coast, from Florida, we didn't go to Maine, but as far as New York and New Jersey and all of central America, central United States, and we'd play and we had just three station wagons and we crowded all of us in (laughter) his station wagon, put most of our instruments on top and, and three of the boys that were left that didn't have to go in the service, they were our drivers and we had a chaperone, Mrs. Von Charleston [ph.] and her, her husband was the, one of the, head of the music department at Prairie View and so she went with us and she was our chaperone but, and when we got to New York [New York], we, girls kind of all wanted to go to the clubs and, you know, not where we were going to play but we had heard of the Laredo's Club [ph.] and all in the, in New York and we all slipped off and like as soon as Ms. Von Charleston got to the hotel and for some reason, and she'd go to sleep and we all slipped on down to the West End club [West End Bar, New York, New York] and we, you know, and we'd get back and she's still snoring, oh, maybe you shouldn't put that in there, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's all, that's all right.
Speaker 2: And we got a really good, the Small's Paradise [New York, New York], we went to all those places and we got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well let me ask you this because you said that you graduated from high school [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas] when you were fourteen so you are fourteen, fifteen, sixteen--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at Prairie View, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, well now my birthday came in February but I, I went on to Prairie View as I finished in summer school and so I started in September, I was fifteen when I started Prairie View.
Story_ID: 572000
Speaker 1: Now you grew up during the Depression [Great Depression], also, and then the war [World War II, WWII], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh. Well--
Speaker 1: What were times like? I mean, did you, did it affect you personally that you knew about?
Speaker 2: No, because we all, our [maternal] grandmother [Fannie Pollard Anderson] was a good cook and she had a big garden. Our grandfather [L.C. Anderson] had a garden right at the, next to our house and oh, he raised corn and greens and little other things like that he, he and he had been a, when he was a principal at Prairie View [Prairie View State Normal School; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], I have a book written by Dr. Woolfolk [George Woolfolk] from Prairie View and he was speaking of the way my grandfather kept the whole, he fed Prairie View from the garden, from the farm he had down at Prairie View and they used to, all the vegetables and things came from off the farm there and they raised hogs in the agriculture department and cows and my grandfather, when he was principal down there, he'd get up in the morning and plow the fields and everything. He really worked for the little, the salary they gave him, then it wasn't that much but, in this book Mr. Woolfolk talks about that and how they fed the other students at Prairie View from off the land, from the land, the farm that they had that the school ran and all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and then we, we never did suffer with the Depression too much, 'cause not in our family. I guess some people did and I know my grandfather a lot of times would give people vegetables and things out of the garden and other things if the needed, in the neighbor- the neighborhood--
Story_ID: 572001
Speaker 1: How did you pay for your baritone sax?
Speaker 2: Well, they let me, I knew the manager, J.R. Reed and he, he said, "Well we have, it, it was a used one but it was in good condition," and it, I don't know, I guess my mother [Lizzie Anderson Crafton] paid for it 'cause I didn't, and remember when I started playing with this band [Prairie View Co-eds], I sent her the money and she would pay it, pay for it down there, pay for it in Austin [Texas].
Speaker 1: So, you're traveling all up and down the East Coast--
Speaker 2: And we got paid for that.
Speaker 1: Do you remember how much you got paid?
Speaker 2: It wasn't, it was a lot to us then but sometime we'd get eighteen dollars a piece (laughter), or something like that, and it, I don't remember exact, they paid Mr. Bennett [Will Henry Bennett] and then he'd pay us, you know, so. We were, it wasn't really a big union scale that we were getting but they took care of us. They paid our hotel, everything that was charged to the hotel and all, he took care of that but we would clear about eighteen dollars each, you know, every time we played but that was pretty good then because every night we were playing and so it would add up and--
Speaker 1: And that was eighteen dollars a night?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, each one, you know.
Speaker 1: Well tell me about your travels because everything was segregated? What were, you know, the Jim Crow laws were in effect?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: Tell me how that was for you?
Speaker 2: We played at the, now one place we played was Strand Theatre [New York, New York] and Vaughn Monroe, I'm sure there's, there's Vaughn Monroe, and Anita O'Day, they, they were the big attraction but they let us play on the same stage, you know, for the intermissions or whatever, but it was really a novelty for a girl band to be playing like that and they thought we were real good and so that was really an exciting experience for us to play with a big old band like Vaughn Monroe, you know, at the time. And then we went on and played at Tuskegee [Alabama] at the airmen, for the airmen in the Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] in Alabama and they, they had to bring us in on one of the army trucks because they wouldn't let us bring in our station wagons into this base. I guess it was some kind of, some kind of something from the government we weren't supposed to bring any station wagons in there. And so they met us at the gate and we all got on this big truck and the airmen would pick us up and take us off the truck, lift us off the truck and they thought, we thought that was really something, you know. And, MacDill Field [MacDill Air Force Base] in Florida and oh, in Oklahoma, we played at Fort Sill and oh, Camp Lejeune [Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Jacksonville, North Carolina], and is that in North Carolina, I think it, well, I believe that's where it was. I really don't count on camps with here in Austin [Texas] and went to just most of the [U.S.] Army camps and forts. We played when it was a real, the, the servicemen really enjoyed us then and we played, when we played in Tuskegee, they had Bob Hope there and he was the main attraction and he was on the, he was on the stage after we got through playing, you know, and he was the big thing then. So, we just had a lot of, it was a wonderful experience for us and, and enjoyable. We all liked it very much and--
Speaker 1: Did you have any, any problems on the road of, about staying in hotels because, because of segregation (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we didn't, the, we didn't stay in any, we stayed in mostly black hotels. We stayed at a, Hotel Theresa in New York [New York] and we stayed at, I don't remember all, in St. Louis [Missouri], I don't remember the name of that hotel but they were mostly black hotels but they were pretty nice, you know, they were real nice and, and had a bar downstairs because we were too young to go in there (laughter), have a dose with girls and everything. It was, we didn't stay in any white hotels but that Hotel Theresa in New York was a very exclusive hotel.
Speaker 1: Yes it was. So, you didn't experience any racism or prejudice in your travels?
Speaker 2: Well one thing we would, we were going through Mississippi. I don't, and the drivers were so tired, we went in these station wagon and they were so tired they said, well let's stop here on the side of the highway and let them take a nap and go to sleep, you know, and up on the hill we saw some, two men coming down the, I don't want to talk bad about Mississippi but they told us, "Get away from there." They didn't want us near their property and all, you know. So the boys woke up and we flew away from there but, and they had little shotgun. I don't think, they were, I don't think it was ever reported that they did that but they, when they found out we were black, they didn't want us anywhere near that, their home, their house, up on the hill.
Story_ID: 572002
Speaker 1: I asked you about your [maternal] grandfather, L.C. Anderson, and about his position at Prairie View [Prairie View State Normal School; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that's what I'm talking about (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: They called him principal instead of president--
Speaker 1: Presidents--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was the principal, president at Prairie View?
Speaker 2: He was the second, yes, he was the third principal and the, the second principal was his brother, Ernest Anderson [E.H. Anderson].
Speaker 1: Right, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: He died and they took him in.
Speaker 1: So now you were telling me a story about Waycross, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, and we [Prairie View Co-eds] were playing on the stage and around the club, that wasn't too, too hot but (laughter) it was big enough and then they were dancing and everything and one lady took a Coke [Coca-Cola] bottle and she threw it at us, threw it up on the stage, didn't hit anybody else she got, but they said, and then the people, you know, the head of the club said, "Oh, well she was just drunk and thinks she was kind of off," but she threw a Coke bottle. It's a wonder it didn't hit one of, but we didn't forget that, you know.
Speaker 1: Who was your audience in those, in those clubs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were, it was, it wasn't integrated then, it was, they were black people but she didn't like us, I guess, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe, maybe her boyfriend or something was looking at us and thought we looked a little bit too good or something, she took, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Now tell, tell me about the music that you played.
Speaker 2: Oh, we played things like 'In The Mood' and we played a lot of Glenn Miller stuff then, you know. He was very popular then and we'd play, we played blues and, and all popular music and, because the real, real hot jazz like it is now is completely different from when we were playing it but we were called, jazz musicians. I guess we played a lot of the old tunes and Duke Ellington and Count Basie and, well 'Blueberry Hill,' I remember we played that, Fats Domino (background noise), had made that popular. Uh- oh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So you were telling me about the type of music that you were playing. Now, how long did you play for Prairie View [Prairie View University; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas]?
Speaker 2: From 1944, the last part of 1944 to '45 [1945], '46 [1946], I'm trying--
Speaker 1: Forty-six [1946] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Forty-six [1946], and then that's when I got out and got married, first time--
Story_ID: 572003
Speaker 1: Before we take you out of Prairie View [Prairie View University; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], tell me about the Apollo Theater [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Oh, that was very, very nice. We played with this, the shows that they brought in and one time we played there [as the Prairie View Co-eds] and Ella Fitzgerald was the main attraction (laughter) and we played with her and then we played with Dorothy Donegan, she was a piano player and, and the Apollo and then they had, oh dances and comedians and whatever and we were just the big, we weren't the main attraction then because they didn't know too much about us but everybody liked us then. So, then when we came offstage one day this, there was a photographer there and he took pictures of us and took a picture of me on the backstage, on the stairs with my horn and it was, it was just real nice. We were there for a week at a time each year and we were on the program for a whole week at the Apollo.
Speaker 1: Right, and, and that picture became famous, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and it's, it's at the Bob Bullock Museum [Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum] here in Austin [Texas], that's the one down at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] and I have a magazine that has that picture in it from the museum.
Story_ID: 572004
Speaker 1: Are there any other stories about your travels with the, the Co-Eds [Prairie View Co-Eds]?
Speaker 2: No, we just went from, we were, we would be pretty tired and we'd get to places and we had to go in there and shower and take a, and put on these long dresses and try to look like we weren't tired at all but (laughter) I guess being, that didn't always work out. But after we'd sling on the makeup and whatnot and put on the, the long, we wore long dresses and we looked pretty charming, so they said.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And, oh, one, well what I was telling you about previously about the lady that was with us, the music director's wife, she was very, very heavy, heavyset lady and she'd go to sleep as soon as we'd get there and when we'd get through playing at places we liked to, you know, kind of, shop around the, go around and look for places, you know, that were near and convenient and that would let us in. So, some of us were too young to get in there but (laughter) I guess some of us told a little tale and got in anyway. It was, it was very enjoyable and the whole summer we were traveling with this, with our group. And I guess that's about the, no other bad experience except for the ones that I told you about (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah about, yeah. Well, was there a very good experience that you remember? I mean, something ex- that you just, stands out in your mind as one of the best experiences that you had?
Speaker 2: Oh, Lucky Miller [ph.], now, I don't know he, we were on a program with him once and he stayed up all night, had us rehearsing the play, so his music and all, and he was very nice. He had this band of his own but he wanted us to play some of his songs and we stayed up and we rehearsed and played his songs and that was really enjoyable and he liked what we did. He thought we were very good at it because most of the girls in the band were music majors and they, we didn't have any trouble with playing his arrangements and all and some of the girl, well one of the girls is a doctor in, in, at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], Margaret Grigsby (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well tell me who they are?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Margaret Grigsby.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she, she might be retired now but she was there a long time, she was very smart at Prairie View [Prairie View University; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], anyway, and another girl, Clara Brock [ph.] played trumpet and she played with Dizzy Gillespie for a while, after she, after she left the band and she's in California. And then Bert Etta Davis from San Antonio [Texas], I think she's deceased now but she was a really good alto sax player and, you know, and then the men really, they'd say, "Oh, a girl playing that good, you know," they thought we were just something inferior to them, I guess, I don't know, but and we'd get up there and play, they'd cheer us a lot, you know, and, and the drummer, Helen, Helen P. Cole, she was from Denison, Texas. She was excellent, too, and I think she still plays with a quintet and the last I heard she was in Detroit, Michigan so, she's, she was a good drummer. Well, she'd throw sticks up in the air and catch 'em and still wouldn't miss a beat and all and she was great. And, those, all of them were real good but those few were just excellent, you know.
Story_ID: 572005
Speaker 1: So, you leave [Prairie View University; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] in 1946 and tell me what happens next?
Speaker 2: I jumped up and married and that, that marriage I only had one child, by him, it was a Canfield, James Canfield [James "Spizzy" Canfield], and he was a comedian that I had met and also a D- the, oh, he used to, I don't talk too much about him but he was a deejay, you know, and so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but that marriage didn't work out and my oldest boy was by him but, then he sent me on home. I guess he thought I was country or something, I don't know what he thought but anyway when I got home three years after that, my boy was three years old and I met my husband, the, the second husband and he was an excellent guy.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: He was Hammitt [Hammitt Miller], H-A-M-M-I-T-T, Miller.
Speaker 1: And what was your--
Speaker 2: And he was a post--
Speaker 1: --what was your son's name?
Speaker 2: His name was Kenneth Canfield, the oldest son, the one by, and they called his daddy, Spizzy, that was his stage name. He was, he was in show business, you know, also, so, but Spizzy, I'm glad, oh I won't say (laughter) anything about--
Speaker 1: All right, so tell me about Hammitt Miller.
Speaker 2: Hammitt was, was very, he was just wonder- he was from Rockdale, Texas and he came to Austin [Texas] when he got out of the [U.S.] Army and some neighbors of mine, he had, he had gotten a room with the lady that lived behind us on Navasota [Street], he got a room with them when he came to Austin and she said, "Come over here, I want you to meet a real nice fellow," and that's the way that she, she had fixed us, she was from Louisiana and she had fixed us some shrimp gumbo, you know, and so I met him there and, and that's how we became acquainted and this boy that I had was three years old then. So we got married, after I had gotten a divorce from my first husband. And then we had five boys, Hammitt and I, and our oldest boy by Hammitt was in the Army and my baby boy now is in, he's on the Indian Ocean, he's in the [U.S.] Navy and I want (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well tell me their names? Tell me--
Speaker 2: Okay, there's Duane Miller, D-U-A-N-E--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Emmitt Miller, E-M-M-I-T-T, and next to him is Terrence [Terrance Miller], T-E-R-R-E-N-C-E, Miller and Phillip Miller and Gordon Miller. That's five there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, those are the ones I had by my second husband.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was really a good person and 'cause, now he died in 1977.
Speaker 1: And what type of work, you told me, you were telling me?
Speaker 2: He was at the post office here in Austin, Texas. He was a mail handler at the post office and then he took rural mail out on the mail route, you know, to the rural border of Austin. So he was a carrier and a mail handler and he was a corporal in the Army when he was in service. So, that's why my oldest boy wanted to go on and be in the Army and he did. He'll be able, well he's out of the Army now but I guess he will get his retirement pretty soon because he was born in 1949 and, and my baby son is, you know, in the Indian Ocean now on the USS Emory [USS Emory S. Land] ship and I haven't heard from him lately. It's got me kind of upset but I guess he'll call me when he, or something, as soon as he gets settled, Sydney, Australia, somewhere in there.

Speaker 1: So after you marry--
Speaker 2: Hammitt.
Speaker 1: --Hammitt Miller, and you're out of Prairie View [Prairie View University; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], do you, are you at home with your children or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) do you begin to--
Speaker 2: My husband worked in the daytime and I worked at night.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was playing, I'd start playing the piano, you know, in clubs and I mean I kept very busy. I'd work sometimes seven nights a week and then other times I did maybe six nights, five nights or something like that but that's when I really worked in nearly every, well in every hotel here in Austin [Texas] at the time and, and different clubs and they were all, you know, integrated about that time, you know, so I had, and--
Speaker 1: Do you remember the first integrated club that you played?
Speaker 2: The first, the first club I played was called Dinty Moore's [Austin, Texas] and it was on West 6th Street here in Austin and they had a, the piano was way in the back of the room, it was a long room there and one, I was playing and I looked up on top of the piano, it was a straight old upright piano and there was a rat sitting up there (laughter). Oh, it frightened me a little, the dead rat sat there and crossed his leg, listening to me play (laughter). It wasn't really a rat though, you know, but I was a little frightened. They got him out of there (laughter). I guess the music charmed him or something, I don't know. So, if I can charm a rat, I guess I can do pretty good.
Speaker 1: What did you--
Speaker 2: So that was really a funny thing.
Speaker 1: When, what year did you start playing in the clubs?
Speaker 2: In the clubs, '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was right after you had your, gotten married?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And so I played at the Driskill Hotel [Austin, Texas], the Sheraton Hotel, the Hilton Hotel, the Hyatt Regency hotel (laughter) and all the main hotels and they had me playing solo piano, you know, and singing and I had a lot of fans and one day I was playing, well, I didn't do this at most of the big hotels and thing but there was a little song called, 'Ice Man,' it was a marvelous song like and so one lady in there, she jumped and said, "Why you shock my modesty," you know, it was just a kind a little funny song with, you know, little, had a little life to it, you know, "You shock my modesty," she said that in front of, and one man in the audience said, "Oh you shut up, you have slept with the president," I don't know if I can say. She stormed on out the door and everybody almost fell out of their seats laughing. Then the, because it was right funny but she just said I had shocked her modesty but it wasn't that bad of a song, it was just funny, you know. And I did, and so I started singing a lot of little songs like that, one called, 'I'm A Woman,' that Peggy Lee did, and I don't know who wrote the song but I got ahold of it and, and it, right now, people say, play 'I'm A Woman,' you know, W-O-M-A-N, and so I used to, I still play that song and the crowd enjoys it but it wasn't nothing like what they do now like they get on the stage and do all that shaking and doing all, well, you know, that, those little songs weren't vulgar, they were just a little bit suggestive, you know, but, that's, but when this lady told me that and then she stormed on out the door 'cause the man had told her, "I know where you slept last," you know, something like that and she stormed out and that was kind of, I didn't laugh, I was (laughter), it was just, it was real funny.
Story_ID: 572007
Speaker 1: Did you travel outside of Austin [Texas] once your, your children got older (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm. I had played for a lot of people, well in nearby towns. I've been to San Marcos [Texas] and Victoria [Texas], when people would have parties and they would remember to call me and, and my agent, who's Patty Polonade [ph.], called Sophisticated Sound [ph.], she got me a lot of places in Georgetown [Texas] and whatnot but they were just one nighters that I would play for parties and, and sometime conventions here in Austin when they wanted entertainment at, at the hotel, they'd call me and I'd play for them. I stayed pretty busy, really busy. So--
Speaker 1: So this is on, in 1950s?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], I was at a club called The Old New Orleans Club [The New Orleans Club, Austin, Texas] on Red River Street, on Red River, and I stayed there for about fifteen years, I believe, and it was really a place where mostly university kids would cater to and I remember one night, there was a big flood here in Austin and they had about six steps going to a upper deck and it was all open outside like a patio but I was down in the bar, as you'd come in, you know, where I'd play, and this flood, we had water, was coming down those six steps, steps like a, like a horsetail falls or something, you know, and I had a brand new pair of red suede shoes and I really did like those shoes that, I kept my shoes on, I should have pulled them off and I walked out and they were just slushing water all out on my feet and I got them caught on a door and the water flew out of the car, you know, I made it home somehow that night and it wasn't too far from where I lived, where this club was, so, that was a really, a really exciting (laughter), those flood waters head down on Red River. That part of town is kind of low here in Austin and it was all flooded.
Speaker 1: Well tell--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, you have speed.
Speaker 1: And another time, I was playing out at Lakeway [Lakeway Resort and Spa, Austin, Texas], that's a very exclusive resort here in Austin and it's out pretty far, about fifteen, twenty miles from here but, and also this, it was a low water bridge out there that I had to cross, I was driving and it was all flooded and it had a sign up there, don't cross this bridge, you know, it's, oh, and I had to get home, I'd driven (laughter), I went on across that bridge anyway and I made it, you know, but that was really, I said, "Oh Lord, let me make it across this bridge, that water," and I crossed it and I came on home but that was out pretty far, that was kind of scary, but--
Speaker 2: What kind of event was out there?
Speaker 1: They had, they have a bar and it's, it's a place where a lot of rich people live out there and they have homes there and everything and it's called low water bridge that was really flooded across there but my car made it on across and, but it's a very exclusive--
Speaker 2: Were they white or black?
Speaker 1: It was all white.
Speaker 2: All white.
Speaker 1: I think there's some blacks out there now but at that time it was all white.
Speaker 2: Did you play for a lot of white audiences?
Speaker 1: Mostly, I played over in Huston-Tillotson [Huston-Tillotson College; Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] for two or three events they've had over there and they've asked me to come and oh and I, when I came, when I stopped Prairie View [Prairie View University; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], I went back to school at Huston-Tillotson for a while, you know, and I did about one semester in the summer over there but I still didn't graduate from college but--
Speaker 2: Well what stopped you after you, you went, after Prairie View, you went to Huston-Tillotson--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --and what stopped you there from continuing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I had married, you know, I had, I was married and every time I, I got pregnant and all like that and I didn't, just didn't want to go back, you know, so--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was working, kept on working all while I was pregnant. I think about two weeks before I had the baby (laughter), I was playing, I'd have to push back from the piano but I'd reach out and play anyway. And so, I didn't, you know, see too much fit for me to go back like that so, and I had, I kind of had it made just playing right here in Austin. Austin had been extremely good to me and I didn't want to teach, anything like that, so, I just kept up my career and that, that has paid off.
Story_ID: 572008
Speaker 1: In the '60s [1960s], any involvement in the Civil Rights Movement at all?
Speaker 2: Let's see, well, not, not too much of that, I played like the 19th of June [Juneteenth], I think I played the park, the Fourth of July they had programs like that they would call me to come play on the program but I didn't do much integration thing. It was rolling along pretty smoothly after, after a while, so, I didn't have any problem with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So, go to '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] and, and your career's going very well--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in Austin [Texas], so tell me what happens in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: In the '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 1: Did you make an album, sorry?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I made two albums when I was at The Old New Orleans Club [The New Orleans Club, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were made by Austin Custom Records here in Austin and the man that owned that, I heard from him just the other day, he's now in a nursing home in California and he's, his name is, oh, well the man I worked for at The Old New Orleans was Andy Poole [sic. Roy Poole], and he said, "Look you, you get social security, you take out social security out of, I don't want to pay you every week," and so I'm glad I did so, that's keeping me alive now, you know. I had a good social security coming in and also then an annuity that my husband [Hammitt Miller] left me. So, it all worked out pretty good and then some (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about the albums?
Speaker 2: The what now?
Speaker 1: The albums.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, the albums. They were made in, in the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: 'Ernie Mae at The Old New Orleans,' 'Ernie Mae at The New Orleans Club' [sic. 'Ernie Mae Miller at The New Orleans'] and they have a picture of me standing in front of the, The Old New Orleans Club, it's an old rock building that was there on Red River [Street] and 12th Street and both, and one, the other picture on the other album was where I was sitting in the bar and the people were around the piano, they had built a stand all around the piano, where everybody could sit there and tell me to play their request and all and sometimes they would all join in and sing and some had good voices and some didn't but it was really nice and so that picture was on the other album that I made. So I made two albums.
Speaker 1: What was the other album called?
Speaker 2: It was 'Ernie Mae at The New Orleans II' ['Ernie Mae Miller at The New Orleans Vol. II'].
Speaker 1: Two, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: One was made about a year before the other one.
Speaker 1: What songs? Do you remember what songs are on it?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had 'Little Girl Blue,' and 'I'm A Woman,' that song that I was telling you about and oh, 'Stagger Lee' and, I have the album over there and I can't think of all the things that I had on there right now but--
Story_ID: 572009
Speaker 1: Of all the music that you have played, what's your, do you have a favorite song that you play (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Type? A favorite, well everybody, wherever I go, that those that have heard me through the years, they always ask, sing 'I'm A Woman,' play 'I'm A Woman,' you know, and that's a little novelty song that Peggy Lee did a long time ago.
Speaker 1: Is that your favorite song to play?
Speaker 2: Not really my favorite song. There's not much to the music of it but the words are very, and they're, they're kind of exciting (laughter), you know, so, people want to hear that kind of comedy song, you know. They like that and then, oh, and, well now I play things, and I had 'Exodus' ['Theme of Exodus'], the theme from the movie, 'Exodus' and I played that and some of the, a lot of the newer songs like 'The Summer Knows' and 'Misty' and anything that was most probably, and they had, I had a good arrangement of 'Tea for Two' 'cause that's a old song but a lot of people like that arrangement. I played at the Zachary Scott Theatre [Zachary Scott Theatre Center; ZACH Theatre, Austin, Texas] and I played that song and one man said, "Please play that again." He hadn't heard it like that so, and I, I played 'Tea for Two,' my own arrangement of it, and he thought it was wonderful. It's a Vincent Youmans song but my arrangement (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 572010
Speaker 1: Who did you play with, you know, you, you played solo most of the time but did you play with other bands (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, and then the Patterson brothers here in Austin [Texas] and one, after Mr. B.L. Joyce passed away, this, he used to play in the band, he was a little ahead of me in high school but he finished and he, he took over the band from Anderson High [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas] and his name was Alvin Patterson and had a brother, Roy Patterson. They both were very good musicians and, but Roy was, he was an Airman at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and he was killed in an airplane but his brother, Alvin Patterson, is still around and he, he had a band out at St. Edward's University [Austin, Texas] and, and also he still plays here in town whenever he gets groups together and they play some but he's, he's a teacher also and I had played with them. They had a little five-piece quintet and I used to play with them, piano, then, just had a lot of experience playing with different groups around town.
Speaker 1: What was, you said you had, that you played with the, a Spanish group?
Speaker 2: Yes, and that was E.R. Flores band and I had a picture, we made at Zaragoza Park [Parque Zaragoza, Austin, Texas], that's in the Spanish part of town and I used to play with them and I have a picture of the band and all when I was playing with them, and--
Speaker 1: What was the name of that band?
Speaker 2: The name of the band was just E.R. Flores Band. They didn't have a, really a particular name at it.
Speaker 1: What was the type of music you were telling me?
Speaker 2: We would play a lot of Spanish boleros and rumbas and sambas and, and just all kind of styles (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You said something about Tex-Mex. Is that the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that's what, oh they call that--
Speaker 1: They call that, okay.
Speaker 2: --that's what they called Mexican bands, you know, and they just had that on an ad that they had put out and said that I played with the Tex-Mex bands. So it was T-E-X-M-E-X, you know, and--
Speaker 1: Well how was that different playing Spanish music?
Speaker 2: Well, some of it was beautiful, some of it was real, really pretty and I played things like 'Santi' [ph.] and 'Perhaps, Perhaps' ['Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps] which is 'Quizas, Quizas, Quizas' in Spanish and Nat King Cole played that, (singing) "Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da," but it was a Spanish song and then 'The Girl From Ipanema' and 'Little Boat' and all the kinds of Gilberto's [ph.] songs and, and we just drew in Mexican, a lot of Mexican audiences and, at the dancehalls and where they had, do some good dances and all now and the pep brunette and all the kind of things during the, during that time and so I just liked playing some damn music too. (Laughter) I just liked music period.
Speaker 1: Well who were some of your influences in the music field (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, well, there are, in the Erskine Hawkins band, Avery Parrish, had played piano and he wrote this song called, 'After Hours' and I still get requests for that. I learned to play that and it's a, it's a blues instrumental but it is very, that came out in the '40s [1940s] and, but still I get requests for it and they say I do a good job on that. So, I really did like Avery Parrish's piano playing.
Story_ID: 572011
Speaker 1: So now we're in the '70s [1970s] and, tell me what happens in your life after that?
Speaker 2: After playing, well now still I'm called on to play at all of the activity centers, senior citizen activity centers. I played in two of the centers here in Austin [Texas], the Conley-Guerrero Center [Conley-Guerrero Senior Activity Center, Austin, Texas] and the one on West 38th Street and usually for Christmas and, and I play Christmas carols and things and the people would sing and they put all this rhythm but I don't want to call them old people, there was, some of them are more lively than, than anybody. So, and, and just wherever, whenever I get calls, I usually go on and play them and they like me very much, I guess. It's, they act like they do and they pay me good, so (laughter).
Story_ID: 572012
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who do you listen to now? What music do you listen to today?
Speaker 2: In, I like, I like a lot of the old, the songs of, I don't listen to much, to radios now. When I have time, you know, I do but I still like the good old musicians like Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Louis Jordan and Lionel Hampton, oh boy, the, oh, any of the blues and the latest singer is Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald and [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson, I never get enough of hearing them.
Speaker 1: Have you met any of those people?
Speaker 2: Yes, Billie Holiday, and we played at the Plantation Club [Palladium] in St. Louis [Missouri]. She had, we were, they had, this was during, before integration, that she had occupied for us the whole back room over there and had a big dinner for all of the sixteen girls, you know, and they brought us out some fine food. We couldn't, we didn't eat in the front of the big club but in fact they had some kind of back dining room then. She sat at the head of the table and we really enjoyed that, Billie Holiday, and she did that for us and we were really appreciative.
Speaker 1: So did you hear her sing that night?
Speaker 2: Yes, she, she was the main attraction, you know, but she didn't sing with our band [Prairie View Co-eds], she had her own combo, or group, that, oh yeah, and I, I admired her and a lot of people say I tried to sing like her but I'm not really copying but I sing it the way I feel and, and that's me (laughter), you know, but I, I liked a lot of her songs that she did and I tried to keep up with things, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And who else did you meet?
Speaker 2: Who else did we meet? I met Lionel Hampton and as I said, Vaughn Monroe and oh, and Dorothy Donegan, who played piano and I, I don't know, I guess she's dead now, I'm not sure. Dorothy Dandridge and, what movie stars that we met. We met Sidney Poitier even in a time and--
Speaker 1: What was it like meeting Dorothy Dandridge?
Speaker 2: She was a piano player just about like I do and she, she was just a real good piano, but I didn't hear her sing anything but she was, I'm thinking about Dorothy Donegan was a piano and Dorothy Dandridge was a movie star, that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, I had it wrong, but Dorothy Donegan, we heard her, she was at the same Plantation Club, not when Billie Holiday was there but we were there for a weekend, she was there on one of the nights and she played.
Story_ID: 572013
Speaker 1: I understand you played for LBJ [President Lyndon Baines Johnson]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, and I played out at Liz Carpenter's house and she was his secretary but he was there and his wife [Lady Bird Johnson] was, Luci [Luci Baines Johnson] was there, and that was here in Austin [Texas] and I played out at her house two different times and it was way out on Sunset Boulevard, I believe. It was way out there and I'm, I'm driving myself in the night, there, I turned off wrong, on a road, it was a fence, a big gate-like fence up there but there's some kind of in the mountains and boy if that fence hadn't been there I think I'd had gone down that mountain 'cause I turned wrong, turned a little bit too soon (laughter) but I just loved, I'm sure the Lord took care of me and I backed out of there but that was kind of scary, you know. So, I did a lot, a lot of traveling up in the hills and all that here in Austin, with playing different parties but, after I got over there, I kind of had to put that down 'cause that scared me. At the time I was going to run off that cliff, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 572014
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what other organizations besides the senior citizens homes, are you a member of any other organizations?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not any member of the, but I played for Kwanzaa, or they had during the Christmas and, what other things, oh, and I played for Jake Pickle, he was, he, he had a party out at the Renaissance Hotel [Renaissance Austin Hotel, Austin, Texas]. I played for his party and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who was he?
Speaker 2: Jake--
Speaker 1: Pickle, who was--
Speaker 2: --Jake Pickle, J.J. Pickle. Oh I have the, I have a program from that over there but he was--
Speaker 1: But who was he?
Speaker 2: He was one of the legis- he was on the legislature here in Austin [Texas] and who else was prominent? Oh, I can't think of the alderman's names, he's a movie star that came and played out at the, I mean he did, he wasn't a musician but he, oh he had me come play for them, gosh, I can't think of his, Reppa- oh I have it on a piece of paper but I can't think of that guy's name right now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, that's fine. That's fine.
Speaker 2: I don't know, I guess I'm--
Speaker 1: That's absolutely fine.
Speaker 2: --getting kind of, okay.
Story_ID: 572015
Speaker 1: Is there something that we did not talk about that you'd like to talk about?
Speaker 2: No, and not, not a lot. I think I've just about talked--oh and, Nat Henderson, who, he would always write something nice about me. He was the editor at the Austin American-Statesman paper and he would, he'd always put me in a column. They had a big chili fest, they called it a chili fest in Georgetown [Texas] and then they had one here. Oh, I'd just play for different things like that and they would, but Nat Henderson, he, he was very nice and he's dead now and then Bill Woods, I played at Nat Henderson's funeral, he's dead now and then Bill Woods also was an editor of the American-Statesman paper and I played at his funeral and I played at a lot of celebrious people's funerals and whatnot but that's not too cheerful to talk about but, you know, how different, not the same type of music I did in the clubs but whatever they would want me to play, I did. Lots of different churches.
Speaker 1: When you were coming up, did you ever have the opportunity to, to listen to opera or go to the symphony?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I really didn't. I guess, I'm sure I would have really enjoyed that but, no, they, I didn't get around to that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I got stuck on jazz and blues and that kind of thing so that's what I wanted to accomplish and did.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That type of musician.
Speaker 1: All right. So, when you look back over your life, would there be anything that you would change?
Speaker 2: No, because I think, even though I had a lot of problems, I think that even makes a person stronger if they don't give up, just, I think it helps to have some suffering in your life because you wouldn't know how to, how to appreciate the good things if you didn't have some bad things happen, you know. There weren't really bad things that happened to me but I just kind of take 'em in stride but it made me appreciate the other side of the fence, you know. So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's good for me, I think, to have some suffering and, I can enjoy the better things in life.
Story_ID: 572016
Speaker 1: What advice would you give to someone who wants to start out in the music field?
Speaker 2: Well, oh, and then I was asked once to come to one of the schools and they wanted me to talk. They said, talk to the young kids about getting on this dope and stuff and I said, "I never smoked or drank or anything," you know, and I said, "Darn, that's why I'm still alive and still able to do what I want to do," you know, what the people want me to do but I said, they get on that stuff and they don't know what you're doing, you know, and it's terrible. It doesn't, it doesn't help. It might feel good one night or something, the next night you're down, it lowers, lowers and bottom of the world, you know.
Speaker 1: But did you see a lot of that as you were in the clubs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not during that time. I guess we didn't, you know, it wasn't as prevalent as it is now.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, if you look back at the stories say, of Ray Charles and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Billie Holiday and--
Speaker 2: Well I guess it did but we were pretty young, didn't, we didn't even pay any kind attention to that old kind of dope doings, you know, but, but I'm sure maybe that some of that was going on but--
Speaker 1: But it didn't affect you.
Speaker 2: --we didn't, it didn't phase us.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I'm glad it didn't 'cause most of us in that sixteen piece girl band [Prairie View Co-eds], a few of them are deceased now but they didn't die from overdose and that kind of thing, you know. They just, natural causes, but--
Speaker 1: So what advice would you give to--
Speaker 2: That, that, now don't--
Speaker 1: --people who want to, to enter into the music field?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well stay off of the, all those inhibitors or whatever they said it. You know, I mean, just be yourself and stay there and keep on working at it and you'll come out fine and have, have faith and, and don't let anything turn you away from what you really want to do as long as it's legal and as long as it's, and you'll find people that appreciate you more but people can tell if you're on that old stuff, you know, and it's just, they get so they can't stand you 'cause you get up and you just might say or do anything which is bad for your career and forgetting, fall all out on the floor, people don't want to see that kind of stuff. So, if you want to last, stay sober.

Speaker 1: What about the fact that you talked about how you were given the sheet music to play it a certain way and you added your flavor to it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that was in my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Would that be something you would encourage people to do?
Speaker 2: --with my music teachers and they didn't like that very much. "You shouldn't be playing like that," but I felt like, I said, "Well that's not me, that's just mechanicals," you know, if you're reading something off the paper or, every time you play you gotta sit down and play it just like it, well, 'cause that's fair for the musicians that wrote the song and everything but I didn't want to be them, I just wanted to be me, so--
Speaker 1: Did you ever write music?
Speaker 2: No, no, not really, I--
Speaker 1: You never composed a song that you wanted to play?
Speaker 2: --might have to do that first all over if I'm still here (laughter). Yeah, that may be my next step and--
Speaker 1: And it would be a jazz piece?
Speaker 2: I believe so, something close to it anyway (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there anything else that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: No, I think I, I think I have, well I was in a lot of the newspapers around in Austin [Texas]. They all mentioned me and have written stories about me and how they enjoyed my music so, I guess I've done pretty well, maybe just playing things the way I liked it and I found out a lot of people like it at least so, it's different. It's not just the same old thing. I don't like to copy off of people. I like to put my, just me in there and so many musicians try to copy what the other did, and that's not very commendable in my idea. Do it a different way, do it your way and it might get over.

Speaker 1: Tell me, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As I tried to make people happy. They come out and enjoy that and they wouldn't have, they can let their worries down for a little while. I'm sure everybody had problems, you know, and they could, the music could tranquilize them and that's it. That is one of my kids, something, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: So that's how you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Yes.
