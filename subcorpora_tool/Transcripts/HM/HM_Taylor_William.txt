Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there five 'People' magazine-ish type questions, strangely enough, and they don't require a long answer.  They require just a short one.  The first question is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite would have to be--it falls, would fall into, they would all fall into category, and that's things you mix together, gumbo, maybe at the top of the list, seafood gumbo at the top of the list, chili, hash.  So I guess things that, that are thrown together and enhanced by the, by the chef's skill at blending various tastes and, and products.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: It, it, it varies.  Right now it would be summer because of the, it's golf season.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite color?  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.  Air Force Blue, particularly.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I would think where we have enjoyed as a family, where we have enjoyed our vacations the most have been in the, in our overseas travels, primarily in the Far East.
Speaker 1: And the last question is, sir, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It comes from--and it's also part of my philosophy, and it comes from a--it's a line from a poem written by an author by the name of Mina Paul (ph.).  And it goes, it's very short, but it's, the tag line, and it's in old english, is "do ye next thing".  In other words, don't dwell on, on, on the past, but go on and move on to whatever is in front of you.  So it's "doe ye nexte thynge" cause it's spelled in, in Old English, D-O-E, ye nexte, N-E-X-T-E, thynge, T-Y-N-G-E--T-H-Y-N-G-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've used that on many occasions, particularly in speeches.
Story_ID: 20018
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your father's side of the family and your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Okay, my, my father's name was William McKinley Taylor, again, M-C-K-I-N-L-E-Y, T-A-Y-L-O-R, William, W-I-L-L-I-A-M.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His place of birth was Seguin, Texas.  The date of birth, I'm, I'm--I don't know.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell Seguin
Speaker 2: S-E-Q-U-I-N [sic, S-E-G-U-I-N].  It's a small town sixty miles Northeast of, of San Antonio, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how much do you know about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Not very much.  One, one summer when we, I visited in, in Seguin with him and met all of the, all of the relatives in Seguin, I had no contact with them until, on an occasion I was--the [U.S.] Air Force, I was on a--visiting at Randolph Air Force Base [Texas], and I happened to run into someone who we established a conversation and recognized that I was from the Seguin, Texas Taylors, which was only minutes away.  And I met Walter, again and his, his family.  Walter is, was a cousin that I, that I remembered from--the only one that I remembered from, from my visit there as a, as a twelve year old or thirteen year old.  And we established, again, established a relationship.  And my daughter, one of my daughters who went to a family reunion of the, of the Taylors some years ago when she was on assignment in the Air Force in Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there--did you meet your grandparents at all on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Just during that summer visit, yes.
Speaker 1: Did they, did anybody tell you any stories that had been passed down, you know, through the years about the family or what they were doing in, during Reconstruction or slavery or any of those kind of stories?
Speaker 2: No.  Not that, not that I recall.  I was ten or eleven during that visit, and, although there were stories, there were some anecdotal stories related to sports events, but not necessarily related to the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, were they involved in sports?
Speaker 2: Walter was, was a basketball player on the, on the local colored team.
Speaker 1: All right, now, what was the condition of your father's family?  Were they rich or poor or were they just regular people trying to earn a living?
Speaker 2: I, I think regular, neither, neither rich nor poor, you know, Seguin, Texas, a very small town, not necessarily--it wasn't industrial, outdoor plumbing.  The high school was right across the street.  It was a modest, but comfortable dwelling as I recall.
Story_ID: 20019
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother.  Can you give us her full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother was Alice, A-L-Y-C-E--A-L-I-C-E, I'm sorry, A-L-I-C-E, Melker, M-E-L-K-E-R.
Speaker 1: And what's her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Place of birth was St. Paul, Minnesota, October 30th, 1898.
Speaker 1: Now, same thing here.  Now, what do you know about her side of the family?
Speaker 2: I know substantially more than I, I do about the, about the paternal side.  Her father was Lawson Melker, Lawson, L-A-W-S-O-N, Melker, M-E-L-K-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--.
Speaker 2: And he was from, originally, and I don't know where, but originally from Mississippi.  And I, I--his profession as many of the African Americans who lived in, in St. Paul and Minneapolis [Minnesota] during those days, the primary, primary endeavor of, of employment, primary place of employment was either with the railroad or with the, with the post office.  And my grandfather was--had risen to a position where he was the chef and head porter on the car, on the president's car, President J. J. [James Jerome] Hill, of the founder and, and president of the Great Northern Railroad [sic, Great Northern Railway Company].
Speaker 1: Okay, so that put him in a prestigious position.
Speaker 2: Yes, his, his nickname was 'The Count'.  And on very occasions that, did we see 'The Count' where he did not have on a shirt and a tie.  That was his uniform of the day.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you said, before we started, that you had a chance, you know, go aboard the president's car.
Speaker 2: Yes, I recall, and I, I don't know at what age, but at a very young age, and it was kind of my introduction to the, to the life of the rich and affluent because on some days, and it, recognizing that when, when [J.J.] Hill passed away, he still maintained the car.  And I think Hill's son took over, but was very close to retirement.  And to the best of my knowledge, as the son aged and retired, so did my grandfather.  And they both retired at the same time, as I recall.  But he still went down every day to maintain and take care of the car and get ready for the few trips that it, that it then made.  So on, on those occasions, when the stay was going to be very brief, I would accompany him.  And that's when I learned about red leather upholstery and mahogany paneled walls and the best of, the best crystal and, you know, and he would show me that, "okay, this, when you place something, and this is how you handle it.  You just don't throw around here.  You're very meticulous."  So there was a, you know, there was an order to life, and there was--he was meticulous in the way that he maintained his portion of, of that requirement--,
Speaker 1: Okay, now--,
Speaker 2: --his job.
Speaker 1: --now, did he have any stories about his family from Mississippi or any story about how they got to Minnesota?
Speaker 2: His, his father--well, it's, it's a little hazy and my mother never dealt on it.  My, my daughters [Cynthia Taylor Ward, Leslie Taylor, Sheila Taylor Goins] and my wife [Phyllis Moxley] perhaps have heard more.  We know that his father was Caucasian.  There is, it is questionable the origin of his mother.  She may have been--my wife and I were talking earlier, she may have been Cherokee Indian.  She may have been part Cherokee Indian and part African American.  We're just not sure.  If, if we knew more about where in Mississippi he was from, perhaps we could, we could be a little more specific, but we can't.
Speaker 1: Well, are you saying it's possible your mother wasn't an African American as such?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Are you saying it's possible that your mother was not an African American?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I'm saying that his mother--,
Speaker 1: Oh, his mother.
Speaker 2: --yeah, his mother was, was either--well, we don't know.  And we wouldn't want to speculate with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So he may not have been African American if his was white and his mother was possibly a full Indian.
Speaker 2: No, I think, I think that there, I don't think there was any question that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was mixed with, she was an African American and probably Indian.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Possibly.
Speaker 1: Possibly, it could be something else.
Speaker 2: No, I think African American is, no question.
Speaker 1: No question, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Mississippi in those days, you know, you don't know how many drops, but it didn't matter.  One drop, one drop qualified you. .
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, did he have any--were there any stories passed down through the family about life in those days or during slavery or Reconstruction or how they got to Minnesota?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm, not that I'm aware of.
Speaker 1: It's not atypical.  A lot of people don't have any, you know, the stories aren't told for some reason.
Speaker 2: He was in, he was a very, very proud man, his penchant for always dressing and the nickname, 'the Count', and he, he carried himself with a great demeanor and great, great stature.  But although, looking back, I mean then, he was a big man, but as I look at the photographs now, he was not necessarily a tall person.  He was of average or less than average size.
Story_ID: 20020
Speaker 1: How did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: My, my mother [Alice Melker Taylor], who--well, her, her mother was, was named Corrine Melker.  And Corrine died when she was about four or five years old.  And at a point in time after that, sometime, it had to be, you know, in the early, early 1900s, 'the Count' [his maternal grandfather Lawson Melker] married Cassie Melker or Cass--I'm not sure of Cassie's name prior to her marriage.  But her first name was Cassie and she originally was from Missouri.  And at one time, she was very high up in the hierarchy of the Eastern Star.  And she was a very well spoken lady.  And my mother traveled with her quite extensively in her capacity as being official, as an official with the Eastern Star.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your mother like?  What did she do and how did she earn a living?
Speaker 2: Today, I think she would have been considered an activist in the forefront of, of the , of the women's movement because she was even--she did go to Hamline University [St. Paul, Minnesota].  She--and I'm not sure for how long, but she left Hamline--that's there in St. Paul, she left Hamlin and attended the University, University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota], which is in Minneapolis, but she never graduated.  She, she played tennis and recently I saw some photo--some pictures.  She had even tried her hand at golf (laughs).  And this would have been in the 1920s and there weren't a lot of African Amer--African American ladies playing golf in 1920, I suspect.  I don't know.  But she was, she was very vigorous and very, and bright and tough (laughs), very tough, in that she, she spoke her mind.  And she marched by her own, own beat, but a very, very--and an excellent cook.  Eventually, she established a catering service here later, in later life in Indiana.  And up until the day of, up until maybe just a, a year or so before she died at the age of ninety-one or ninety-two, she was still operating her catering business.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was industrious and--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell me about your father [William McKinley Taylor].  What was he like and what did he do?  How did he come to live in St. Paul?
Speaker 2: They, they separated shortly--in the early '30s [1930s].  The marriage only lasted a couple of years.  And my mother remarried in, like 19--in the late '30s, '37 [1937] or '38 [1938], '39 [1939] somewhere along then.  At that time, I went to, to live with my father in Omaha, Nebraska, who was then working for a clothing store, operating the, the, you know, the tailoring side of it, and privately, aside from that he, he ran his own tailoring business, making suits and alterations and things like that in a, in a shop that he--not in a shop, but in a facility that he maintained in the, in the home, in Omaha.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your father like?
Speaker 2: He was, he was tall, athletic, he played golf.  I know he played golf 'cause--although I have never played with him, but he was gregarious and outgoing.
Story_ID: 20021
Speaker 1: Did he [father, William McKinley Taylor] talk about why--how he ended up in St. Paul [Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: No, no, he did not.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he ended up in--well, he moved to Omaha [Nebraska], and so he had this business in Omaha.  So how long were you in Omaha with your father?
Speaker 2: It must have been from about the age of eleven through--about two and a half, three years, somewhere in that, in that period.  I remember doing something.  I remember doing something.  I would, I wouldn't think of doing it today, I mean with--as I look at my grandsons.  At the, at the age of eleven, I, I rode a train from--by myself, from St. Paul, Minnesota to Omaha with my little suitcases in hand.  And then, by myself, unescorted--then after three years, two and a half, three years--well, I can put it in, it must have been three years--there was third grade, third, fourth--no, fourth, fifth and sixth grades, I was in, in Omaha.  And when I moved to Indiana, my mother [Alice Melker Taylor] had, had remarried.  When I moved to [Muncie] Indiana, I began junior high school, so that makes me around thirteen or fourteen then.  So from the, from the fourth, fifth and sixth grade, I was in, I was in Omaha, then began junior high school.  So at, at the age of, you know, thirteen or so, I caught a bus in, in Omaha and went to Chicago [Illinois], changed, changed buses in, in Chicago to go to Indianapolis [Indianapolis], changed buses in Indianapolis to go to Muncie.  And I, I cannot picture my--I cannot picture my grandsons today doing that at--of course, different times, different, you know, different tenures.  So.
Speaker 1: Yeah, with different expectations today.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: So, how'd you like Muncie?
Speaker 2: Muncie was eye opening for someone coming from Minnesota, you know, eye opening in that, aside from the visit to, to Texas--well, let me, let me back up a second, okay.  Minnesota was very, as it is today, it was equally so then, it was very liberal.  So I recognized at, and I think I would have to say, first or second grade, I recognized that there is a difference in, in people.  There are, you know, dark-skinned, light-skinned, Hispanic, etc.  But I did not know that it made a difference, that there was a difference.  And I remember to this day the moment that I was informed that the difference made a difference.  And we had some guests over at our house.  And I'm, I'm what?  I'm like in the first or second grade, right.  So the, the--one of the guests, one of the male guests asked me, "Oh, you're a handsome young man.  Do you have girlfriend?"  And I said, "Yes, I have a girlfriend in, in school."  He said, "Well, what's your girlfriend's name?"  And I said, "Laverne Kayloff."  And he said, "Laverne Kayloff?"  I said, "Yeah."  "What does she look like?"  I said, "Oh, she kind of looks like Shirley Temple."  And they said, "You can't have Laverne Kayloff to be your girlfriend."  And I said, "Why not?"  And then they went into this, well, there's a difference and etc., etc., etc.  And I, I remember it to this day, okay, that someone advising me that, that there was a difference.  And I, I didn't--well, I can't say I didn't accept it 'cause I didn't have any choice.  But I didn't understand, and I won't say understand 'cause I understood.  I'll say I didn't like it.  And at that moment, I think I--that's when I decided that I was never going to let the difference make a difference in my life.
Speaker 1: Did you talk to your parents about it?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I think that was just a decision that I came to that someone, you know, someone said well, you know, because of this, and I didn't--although I didn't understand all the , all the rationale behind it, I just said it doesn't sound right.  And at, at that moment, I, I decided I--I was just determined, I would not let the difference, make a difference in my life.
Speaker 1: That--.
Speaker 2: And I remained friends with Laverne Kayloff (laughs).
Speaker 1: Now, did they ever try to warn you about racism?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or give you barriers or--?
Speaker 2: No, no.  That was--in Minnesota, you know, in, in those days there really wasn't a large enough African American population to really have a big problem.  You know, you know in small numbers, it's easy to be liberal.  I think they found this--well, I won't go into that, but--.
Speaker 1: I think that you're right.  I know what you're getting at.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right, it's probably true.  Yeah, a smaller number of different people, it's easier to accept them.
Speaker 2: Right.  Only in large numbers does it become, do--when the points of friction become greater and more prevalent then, then that's when the biases begin to--when there are threats or--.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's pretty much true.
Story_ID: 20022

So I recognized at, and I think I would have to say, first or second grade, I recognized that there is a difference in, in people.

Speaker 1: Tell me about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Minnesota is, has been and, and probably still is, and always will be, a wonderful place to raise a, raise a family, with the many lakes and outdoor activities and fishing and hunting.  I remember, I remember a tornado in a place called Bemidji, Minnesota, which is north of St. Paul [Minnesota].  And I remember driving up in--and we drove up on a Sunday, and, and saw the results of the, of the tornado.  And I think it was Bemidji.  It may not have been that far north, but it was--see we had a, as I, I mentioned to you earlier, we had--our house, our house, which no longer exists.  It's, it's on an express--it's where the expressway connects--the inner-city connector goes right through where St. Anth--455 St. Anthony [Avenue], where, where I was, where I was raised.  But we had a huge house.  We had a boarder, a room that was, was let out to our boarder.  And the boarder was Ms. Myrtle Carton from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  And she was the director of the, the heart of the African American social and cultural life, Haley Q. Brown--other than religion, the Hallie Q. Brown Community Center [St. Paul, Minnesota]--.
Story_ID: 20024
Speaker 1: Hallie Q. Brown, the Brown Center [Originally the Hallie Q. Brown Community House].  Tell us about the center, and what it meant it to St. Paul [Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: It was the, it was the heart of, of social life.  It had, they had a gymnasium, a--they ran programs for, for kids, educational programs.  I remember--and, and I guess, I guess you would say I was a, I was privileged because everyone knew that I was, that Mrs. Carden stayed--Ms. [I. Myrtle] Carden stayed at, at our [house as a boarder]-so that made me kind of her, her extended family.  So there was, there was a choice.  They were running programs for kids.  And one was tap dance, and the other was piano.  And so someone had decided that I was to go in the tap dance.  And I said, "No, I don't, I don't want to go in tap dance.  I want to, I want to go, the piano--what else is there?"  "Piano."  "I'll go to piano."  "No, you got to take tap dance."  And that was a mistake.  So what I am?  I must be about five maybe, five, six years old.  And I'm, they're trying to get me in this tap dance class.  So I acted out as a five or six year old, so you won't let me out of the class, I will force you to let me out of the class by my behavior.  And I guess I cut up something awful because halfway the through the class, I was put out.  But they still didn't let me take piano.  But at least, I understand now when my grandsons, when we try to ask them or force them to do something and they, they say that they don't want to do it.  I understand their behavior because I've been there and done that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the Hallie Q. Brown Center was sort of like a settlement house, would you say that, in that sense?
Speaker 2: I'm not, I'm not familiar with, with the definition of a settlement house.  It was more like a community center, I think, where--that provided for the needs of, of the community.  It had a, it had a gymnasium.  They had--and I know I saw my first basketball game as, I must have been seven or eight, I'm not sure when.  But my little collection of friends and I were taken to this basketball game.  And we thought it was the funniest thing in the world to see these guys running around in little short pants.  And we didn't quite understand that.  And in Minnesota, what you do in the winter, you play hockey and you ski and you skate.  But running around indoors in little short pants was, was kind of beyond our, our frame of reference at that, at that time.  But it was this center of, of activity in the black community.  Recognizing, that the Black community in, in St. Paul, as I recall, was only maybe seven or eight blocks long, maybe ten at most, and maybe four or five blocks wide.  I don't, I don't know the numbers.  But it certainly was not, not extensive.  I'm only aware of three churches, so that, you know, the numbers have to be relatively small.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was.  We were a part of St. James AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church.  There were, there were two others, and I, I don't recall the names.
Speaker 1: Okay, probably a Baptist church, one of them was more than likely Baptist.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, I want to say Bethel, but I'm just not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was the name of the woman who was in charge of the Hallie Q. Brown Center again, and--.
Speaker 2: Myrtle Carden, C-A-R-D-E-N, and Myrtle, M-Y-R-T-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what else?  Now, you moved from St. Paul--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One, one story about--she had, and when I mentioned we went up to, to look at the tornado, the effect of the tornado, she was the one that had driven us.  There weren't many because, there weren't many of us because what she drove us up in was a convertible.  It was an old I think Chevrolet with a rumble seat, you know, where you step on the little step and jump.  So there were two of us in the rumble seat and two, two people up front.  And I think what's famous about that car is that John Dillinger stole it.  And I'm not sure of the circumstances or, or exactly when it happened, but I know it, it had been stolen by, by--she was relieved of it's possession at a point in time by John Dillinger under the circumstances, I don't recall.  But, so from a point in history, there is, there is that about Mrs.--Miss Carden's automobile.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, where was she from?
Speaker 2: Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And I, I don't know much about her, her past.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Obviously, educated and--very well educated because she was very well spoken and highly respected in the community.
Speaker 1: Right, you're right.  We've talked to other people from St. Paul.
Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: When you were, what'd you say, about seven or eight, you moved with your father [William McKinley Taylor] in Omaha [Nebraska]? Is that it? Or ten?
Speaker 2: It was later.  I think it was about ten, nine or ten, and was there for roughly three years.  And at that point, at the age of, guessing thirteen, moved to [Muncie] Indiana.  My mother [Alice Melker Taylor] had since remarried.
Speaker 1: Did you see a big difference in Omaha from St. Paul [Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: Not really, well, yes.  Yes, because in, in Omaha there were, there were elements of discrimination.  And I'm not sure whether it was because we were no longer in St. Paul or whether it's just that I was more attuned to, to what, what the rules of society had, had put upon us.  And I recall, right across the street from where we lived there was a, a huge, big, big, big house, and it was kind of like a rooming house or a bed and breakfast, if you will.  It was more like a bed and breakfast, you know, the way they operated.  But any time that black entertainers came to town, they stayed there.  And they couldn't stay downtown in Omaha.  So whenever they needed a gopher then I was summoned to run across the street and be the gopher for people like the Mills Brothers and Steppen Fetchit and Lionel Hampton.  Those are the ones who, those are the names I recall, and particularly, the Mills Brothers because they tipped (laughs).
Speaker 1: Well, that's good.  Yeah, the Mills Brothers were from Piqua, Ohio, I think.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're favorite to a lot of people now, my father's favorite.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what were they--so they tipped you, well, what was Steppen Fetchit like? Was he--?
Speaker 2: The only thing I recall about him was I think I had to, you know, take some shirts to the laundry or do something like that, and the pick up something.  And I, whatever gratuities I received, I think they were quite modest.  But what I remember was, was him worrying about his, his hair growing, and he would, you know, he, he wanted his head perfectly bald, and that he was--I'd never seen anyone shave their head, you know, with a, with a razor.  And that's, that was my image of, of him.
Speaker 1: So his concern was that it--it wasn't that it wouldn't grow, is that it might grow?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he was keep it from growing.  Any other entertainers you remember or figures?  Did the black ball players stay there too, from the Negro Leagues?
Speaker 2: I, I don't recall.  I don't recall.  I don't think it was big enough for--I mean, you know, they--I think there must have been other places because I know, you know, if an entertainer comes through, they always have enough musicians and--like Lionel Hampton, etc. or a band.  And I think the band would stay somewhere else, but I know Mr. Hampton was, was in, and we'd shine some shoes and did some stuff like that.  But the other little gopher things, but it was kind of fun.  I enjoyed that.

Speaker 1: You started school in St. Paul [Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your school in St. Paul?
Speaker 2: McKinley.
Speaker 1: And did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, very much.
Speaker 1: Okay, what were your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: I'm not so sure I had a favorite subject.  And I'm trying to recall--I guess geography at the time--,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because we talked about places and things.  And, and I think if, if anything was more interesting than any other thing, it would have, it would have been geography.
Speaker 1: So you were interested in other places in the world?
Speaker 2: In other places, right.  And I think, and I'm not sure at what point I, I became interested or was introduced to 'National Geographic', but it was some time during that period.  And to this day, I'm still a subscriber to the 'National Geographic' magazine.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there any one locale that piqued your curiosity more than another?
Speaker 2: Not particularly, no.
Speaker 1: You just liked the idea?
Speaker 2: Yes, that and, and 'Life' magazine.  And I remember, I remember the first edition of 'Life' magazine, and we--I, I guess if, I guess those two publications, more than anything else, may have, you know, planted the seeds of an interest in my pursuing journalism as a career and my interest in photography as--.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have a radio?
Speaker 2: Yes, the old-fashioned radio with the big dial in the middle, and, you know, gathering around, listening to, to Joe, Joe Lewis and the fight with Max Schmeling and all that.  And also the, the radio, the radio shows.  And the one, I guess if I had a favorite--and it also relates to places and things, and it was, it would have been 'Grand Central Station'.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was that show about?
Speaker 2: The, the introduction to 'Grand Central Station', and you had this big voice that came on, it said, it said, "Grand Central Station, crossroads of a million private lives, gigantic stage on which are played a thousand dramas daily."  So I'm listening to this, and I picture something like a movie theater (laughs), with this, you know, big, this huge stage.  And, you know, I, I didn't quite know how it worked in Grand Central Station, but I figured if, if that station in New York was anything like the big railroad station in, in St. Paul, then it must have been huge.  And then there must be all these little plays going on all day long.  And the people could--and that was, and so I would always listen very carefully and very intently to what was going on at 'Grand Central Station'.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think partly because of the background of a railroad too.  You know, you have that connection.  So.
Speaker 1: Did you have any other favorite shows?
Speaker 2: Not particularly.  And the rest of them were kind of, you know, you could take them or leave them.  But--.
Speaker 1: Now was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Either playing music or listening to music?
Speaker 2: No, not, not then.  I was, for a brief time in Omaha, I was in a drum and bugle corps, little blue satin pants and a white satin shirt with a little band around, you know, did that.  And I had always wanted to, I wanted be--somewhere along the line I wanted to be a drummer, but I never just--I, I could never get to the point where, where, you know, I would study it seriously.  I did have a drum once, and I, you know, I played a little bit on it.  But I think it came from my Uncle Curtis there in Minneapolis [Minnesota], and that's how I got in the drum and bugle corps cause I did know a little bit about the rumpy dumps.

Speaker 1: What was the name of the school that you attended in Omaha [Nebraska]?
Speaker 2: Lake--Lake Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how'd you like that--?
Speaker 2: My address in Omaha was 2226 Ohio Street.
Speaker 1: Did you like that school, you know, as well as you liked the one in Minnesota?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you fit right in, sort of?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a couple of fights here and there, but we made it, we made through it.
Speaker 1: And any outstanding teachers or people in elementary school, in either place that you remember?
Speaker 2: Going back, going back again in St. Paul [Minnesota], we had a, I had a third grade teacher [at McKinley Elementary School, St. Paul] by the name of--all I, all I know was Ms. Jones.  Ms. Jones, on, on Friday afternoon--and she was, I guess she was also homeroom teacher.  I'm not quite sure how the classes were structured.  But Miss Jones would take us out to--during the wintertime, only during the wintertime, and we'd play hockey or skate.  And I didn't have a pair of skates and one of my cousins gave me a hand-me-down pair of racing skates.  But nevertheless, I played hockey on racing skates, which limited your maneuverability somewhat, but a pair of skates is a pair of skates.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you could go real fast in them too, I guess.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Yes.
Story_ID: 20028
Speaker 1: When you were thirteen, you say you took that bus trip to--,
Speaker 2: Indiana.
Speaker 1: Muncie--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Indiana, and rejoined your mother [Alice Melker Taylor] in Muncie [Indiana].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And she'd remarried, right, and--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --by this time.  So how'd you, what'd you think of Muncie, when you got to Muncie?
Speaker 2: Muncie was, it was eye opening because, again, you're reaching a little further into a--and, and not just because you've changed locales or you're older, but because central Indiana is sort of the dividing line between--I mean it's kind of where the, where you leave rural America and you go into industrial area, Industrial America, at least in, in that Illinois, Indiana, Ohio belt because just below that, you're--there's southern Indiana.  And the lower half of, of those three states relates more to the states below them, which are Kentucky and Missouri and, and Tennessee, rather than the states adjacent to them or above them, which are, you know, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan.  So you--a lot of the Southern tendencies and the practices in the South are inherent in central Indiana.  The Ku Klux Klan was, was formed forty miles southeast of--southwest of, of Muncie in a town called Greenville, Indiana, I think it began.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think, yeah, it probably began in Indiana.
Speaker 2: Greenville or Greentown or something like that.
Speaker 1: At one time the grand dragon was the governor of Indiana in 1928, he was actually the Governor of Indiana [sic, Indiana Governor Edward Jackson, 1925-1928, was not a grand dragon but was politically supported by Grand Dragon D.C. Stephenson].
Speaker 2: Really.
Speaker 1: And ran as the grand dragon.  I mean he wasn't hiding anything.
Speaker 2: That says enough for--.
Speaker 1: That's the only state in the union where the dragon was the governor.  So, yeah, so Muncie--so how was Muncie?  Did you experience racial difficulties in Muncie?
Speaker 2: Muncie was, it's an industrial, a small industrial, industrial town.  I mean, you know, and not light industry, I mean heavy industry, Chevrolet assembly plant, a--there's a Warner Gear plant that manufactured gear housing for, for all Chrysler products and even, I think eventually, for Japanese automobiles.  I, I attended, I started junior high school--.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Wilson Junior High School [Muncie, Indiana].  And I came to Muncie in the, in the summer.  So when we decided where, where we lived, I could have gone--there are three junior high schools in, in Muncie.  There's Wilson, McKinley [Junior High] and Blaine [School], I think Blaine or Blair--Blaine, I think.  And Blaine was in the middle of the industrial section.  McKinley had I think the, the more affluent and the--African Americans in Muncie lived in two sections.  There were quote "the town people" that lived on one side of the river.  And then there was another area on the other, on the other side of the river, further out, and it was called Whiteley.  So, and the population was probably divided equally between, between.  So most of the, most of the Whiteley kids went to McKinley.  Most of the town kids went to, went to Blaine.  And because we were kind of on the fringes of, of the, of the area where most of the African Americans lived, that's how we choose to go to, to Wilson.  I think partly because we lived in the projects and somebody next door, their kid went to Wilson.  So that's where I went to school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you lived in the projects of Muncie?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, the projects in those days, when you were living in the projects were new and a transitional place to live, well maintained for the most part.  I don't know if they were in Muncie, but in most of the areas, they were in pretty good shape.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Not--today when you say "the projects--".
Speaker 2: They were, no, they were, they were--in fact, I'm, I'm not quite sure of their origin, but they were relatively new at the time, living room, dining area, kitchen, two, maybe three bedrooms, something like that, storage unit out back.
Speaker 1: And tell me if I'm right or wrong, but to many, they represented an improvement from housing that, you know, low-income people were living in prior?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they were seen as transitional to a home, to home ownership.
Speaker 2: And they lived right in the--they were right in the center of, of town, right on the main road into--and they, they were, you know, it was--they, they weren't, (laughs) they weren't segregated really, but they were because the high, the main highway ran right through the middle.  And I think 99 percent of the, of the population--I mean not--99 percent of the population north of the, of the highway were African Americans.  99 percent of the population south of the highway was Caucasian.
Speaker 1: Like a lot of Midwestern towns in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it was, you know--technically, they were, it was not segregated, by de facto divisions, they were.
Speaker 1: So housing-wise, it was pretty much, it was an unwritten segregation of people in that sense.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But were public accommodations segregated in, in Muncie?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: At, at that time, they were, theaters, you know.  You had the crows nest in the, in the movie theaters.  Their golf courses--I'm trying to--there were no, oh, swimming pools.  I, I guess there was a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] right across the street from the projects where, with a small, Jackson, Jackson Street YMCA, I guess it was called, where there was a pool table and a swimming pool and, you know, yeah, basketball court and that, that sort of things.  But nothing, nothing elaborate certainly.
Story_ID: 20029
Speaker 1: Did you like Muncie [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: It's difficult to answer because very seldom do--my practice is to, you know, take things as they are.  And situations that you are not in control of, that to, to view those situations negatively only makes that situation more difficult.  So my practice has always been to try and deal with positives of the situation, regardless of, of, you know, the circumstances that brought about the negatives that exists, recognizing that there're always negatives, and recognizing that there're always positives.  So if you dwell on those positives, in the long run, you'll just feel more comfortable and can make the best of whatever particular circumstances you're cast into.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, did you have to do that in Muncie (laughs)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes (laughs).  For example, I was told--they said that, that the really poor section of, outside the African American community was in, was right in the heart of the Wilson [now, Wilson Junior High School] area.  It was called Shed Town.  Shed Town was right--so they said, awe, that's a tough school, tough school, said, you'd better, you know, get ready.  So I had a couple of weeks before I went to school, and not knowing, I mean this is gonna be a whole new adventure to me, so not knowing exactly what I was gonna be faced with, my mother [Alice Melker Taylor] had a sewing dummy.  And I had read in 'Life' magazine about this new technique for defending yourself or fighting.  It was called Jujitsu.  And they had demonstrations of, of Jujitsu.  And this was, this would have what?  1941 or '42 [1942], something like that, '42 maybe.  So she had this sewing dummy.  So I practiced with the sewing dummy.  I'd grab it--I'd throw I around and toss it around, over my back and knew all the moves and everything.  So I felt I was proficient in this new (laughs) unknown sport, Jujitsu.  So on my first day in school, you know, I didn't know anyone, and so, you know, guys coming up, "Who are you?"  And I told them who I was. " Where are you from?"  I told them where I was from, "Moved here from Minnesota."  I forgot and left out Nebraska.  So they said, "Can you fight?"  And I said, "Well, I don't, I don't box so good, but I'm a Jujitsu expert."  And they said, "Oh, man (laughs), said, you don't want to mess with him,  he's a--." So that then gave me a nickname.  And no one ever tested my--I guess I was big enough so that, you know, as a, as a thirteen year old, you know, I'm 5 [feet] 10 [inches] or something.  So people are just gonna take you at your word, you know.  And so that then--in junior high school, that was nickname, 'JuJu'.
Speaker 1: 'JuJu', after Jujitsu.
Speaker 2: Yeah, after Jujitsu.  No one ever challenged it, but good thing, (laughs) cause I had never tried it except on that, on that sewing dummy.

Speaker 1: Now, did you like writing in high school?  Did you, you know, you had aspirations to become a reporter.  Had they manifested themselves at, in the early part of high school?
Speaker 2: I wrote, I wrote--in fact, I have a copy in there and if you want to see it, I can find it.  I mean I'll try and find it.  I was in the tenth grade and in Central High School [Muncie, Indiana].  And we had a writing assignment.  And I'm not sure what the writing assignment was.  But I had, I showed movies at one--I volunteered for a job.  And the job was during class breaks or noon hours or something, they would show movies in the auditorium.  And one of the, the series that I ran was a five-part series--five-part series called 'Preclude to War'.  And this would have been what, like in 1945 or '46 [1946] now.  And 'Prelude to War' was mostly made up of, of captured German film, not captured, but recovered and bore a lot of footage originally shot in Germany.  And I remember very vividly a segment [from the film 'Triumph of the Will'] where, and I've seen it several times since, but it was where there was this huge gathering, huge gathering.  There must have been several, more than several thousand people.  And Adolf Hitler came in, and everything was perfectly still, absolute silence.  And he walked down this long aisle, surrounded with drummers and, you know, the SS Elite Guard and their black--walked down and he rose up to the podium.  Not a pin, a pin drop could be heard.  And then he raised his, his arm, "Sieg heil! Sieg heil!."  And everything went, pandemonium broke loose.  And it, I said, the man's got power.  I mean, you know, what--and I became interested.  And I then became a student of, of Nazi Germany.  I mean even at that age. And this was, this was like 19--the early '40s [1940s].  The war had not quite ended.  And I, you know, just became everything that I could read about Nazi Germany.  I even read 'Mein Kampf'.
Story_ID: 20031
Speaker 1: The reason I mentioned Nazi Germany, ''Mein Kampf' and the--because I wrote a, I wrote a, a sonnet, you will, and this is in the tenth grade.  Mrs. Michael was the teacher.  And I wrote a sonnet.  And the way I wrote it, and it was kind of corny, and if she had been a baseball fan, she would have recognized what I had done.  But what I did was take the, the structure and the, the beat of 'Casey at the Bat', only turned it around and described the situation that had happened in Munich, Germany.  And the last line was, "Somewhere people laugh, somewhere people shout, but there is no joy in Munich, the Führer has struck out," because it was the end of the war.  I mean that was, that was the end of it, you know.  And it went on and, you know, this whole, describing this whole scene and, you know, the, the theatrics and the drumbeat and all that.  But that's the way it ended with (laughs)--this was two pages.  So I get it back and no grade.  There's no grade on it.  And there's this question, "What is this?  Where did you get this?"  And my answer was, "I wrote it."  But, you know, I, and I don't know if it was ever graded or not.  But, so I guess that was, you know, if you write and challenge people, I guess they respond no matter, no matter what the subject.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've heard other stories where people have--students write things and because it doesn't fit the normal, what the teacher normally gets, they question whether the student wrote or wonder, they're stumped, they're stymied with it, you know.  They don't know what to do with it.
Speaker 1: So I worked on the school newspaper and, in addition to that, I was, participated in athletics, basketball, football, baseball, track.  So--.
Speaker 2: Now, in terms of writing--I wanted to stay on writing for a minute.  But you were obviously fascinated by how words affect people, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And did you--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not words alone, but the process of, not--I guess the, the whole process of communication, I mean whether, whether it's visual or whether it's, you know, sound or, or whether it's the written word.
Speaker 2: And in those days, did you, did you think about other examples other than the, you know, Nazi Germany example of how people were influenced by media?
Speaker 1: I'm not so, I'm not so sure there were any examples that were more visible or that, you know, that carried, the carried greater impact than--I guess, you know, some of the things that we did during--you know, we meaning the United States did on bond drives and, you know, ginning up public support for, you know, let's behind the war effort.  And my mother [Alice Melker Taylor] worked, and she was a munitions inspector in a, in a [U.S.] Navy amm--ammo plant there in Muncie [Indiana], you know, the casings to--she inspected the casings to make sure they were all--she got an award, I recall that.  So, but the little bits and pieces, but and, and I don't think, I don't want to focus on what happened in Nazi as being the centerpiece.  I mean it was  just part of the pie that leads to the development of, of an approach to, to communication.  And there are other things that, I mean everything sort of contributes and, and fits.  It's a never-ending process, my belief is.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, during that time period, during the war, there's a lot of, what people would call propaganda going on, and even here in terms of whose a enemy and whose not--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: --whose a friend and whose not.  And, and you know, when there's war all Americans are Americans, except when you're an army, you're not--some are more American than others.  Did you ever think about, did you think about all that sort of thing when you--?
Speaker 1: I think if, just by, by reading or looking at enough--'Life' was a pretty high-class publication and, and, you know, given, given the tenor of the times.  And they dealt with most matters in a fairly straight-up manner.  And when things were bad, they showed it being bad.  When things were good, they showed it being good.  So, the--you weigh that against some of the--and there weren't too many other mediums to, to counter, I mean, you know, the propaganda in movie theaters, you'd see that on the radio, you'd hear, you'd hear, but you didn't have the, the mass communication to, to, you know, to weigh and balance things.  You sort of--what you had, you had, and you had to make your decisions based on that.
Story_ID: 20032
Speaker 1: So you were editor of the paper throughout high school or worked on the paper, rather?
Speaker 2: Yes, was on the, on the paper through high school [Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have any other writing stories from high school that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Not that I, not that I can recall, not, not--at least, not from a written standpoint.  I did, I did begin taking pictures and began a photography career with a little, a little cigar box developing thing in the, in the room as you flick on the light, on and off and the little processing thing.  I began that.  I made my money delivering papers.  I, for, I think three years, I had a morning paper route.  I got up every morning at five, 5:00, 5:30, walked this, walked this paper route.  I still get up at 5:30 in the morning.  I still wake up early, always have.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever run for class office or anything?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have time.  I, I--when I say, didn't have time, it was partly because of athletics.
Speaker 1: Now, you were a pretty decent basketball player from what I understand?
Speaker 2: Yeah, basketball, football, ran track, played baseball.
Speaker 1: Now, we didn't talk about football before we started this, but what did you play in football, what position?
Speaker 2: End.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you played both ways [offense and defense]?
Speaker 2: Then, they did, yeah.  My mother [Alice Melker Taylor] wasn't particularly happy with football.  In fact, I, I don't think she went to--she went to basketball games, but she wouldn't go to football games.  She didn't like seeing her son get bounced around.
Speaker 1: Did you have a winning football team?
Speaker 2: Central Muncie [Muncie Central High School] was a powerhouse in everything.  And it was partly--it was a lot because of the politics of the city, you know.  The city had a lot of pride in it's a, you know, as a working-class city, you had working-class values.  And just like, you know, other working-class areas, say--and I don't mean to speak disparagingly, but I mean Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]  is a, you know, the [Major League Baseball team, Pittsburgh] Pirates and the, and the, particularly, the, you know, the football team are the [National Football League team, Pittsburgh] Steelers are, you know, that's, that's their, that's their, you know, they don't want to--they wouldn't share it.  Or, they, you know, there's a lot of interests and there's a pride in having that team.  Well, I think Central Muncie was the same way, to the point where Central Muncie was always competitive at, in the football arena.  They had a number of state championships.  They were always competitive in basketball.  They always had a good sports team, and one of the reasons was, they--even when they had reached the point where you need another high school, they needed another high school, they would not build one because that meant breaking up the powerhouse.  And it went on, and to the point where that old fashioned Central could, just could not accommodate the growing population.  And they had to come up with a, eventually now, a Southside [Middle School, Muncie, Indiana] and, I believe there's a [Muncie] Northside [High School, Muncie, Indiana] also.  But it was, it was done, recognizing that that's gonna be the end of an era.
Speaker 1: I guess the more boys you had to chose from, the stronger your team can be?
Speaker 2: That's right.  Right, right, and particularly during the days when you had vets coming back.  And, you know, in the '40s [1940s], you'd have, you know, we had--who played, we had on, on our football team, we must have had, you know, three or four or five starters who were right up to the, to the age limit of participation in high school inner, inner scholastic athletics.
Speaker 1: So there were like men starting, making sports--.
Speaker 2: Yes, and we, we just ran roughshod over the whole conference that year.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in basketball, you know, you all went to the semi-finals in the state basketball, high school basketball tournament.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, we went to the finals.  Yeah, the finals are in--semi-finals, there are sectional, regional, semi-finals and then the final four.  We were--the year I was a senior, we were in the final four.
Speaker 1: Who'd you lose to?
Speaker 2: Evansville [Indiana] Central [High School].  Interesting, and I, and I still, I still have to respond to, to this gentleman.  He lives over in, lives over in Bethesda [Maryland], okay.  The center on the team we played against was Lee Hamilton, the congressman from, from Indiana.  And the gentleman, his name escapes me right now, Mac--I'll, I'll think of it.  But he called or I ran into him once because he was in the [U.S.] Navy at the Pentagon.  And he saw me, and he said, aren't you from Central Muncie?  And I said, "Yes."  And we talked.  And he was a guard on that team.  So the plan was, and I, I know there was a sixteen millimeter version of that final game and, because I, I had it once.  And I, and I saw it.  I should have copied it, if video had been more prevalent then, I, I would have.  I would have had it copied.  But we had, we, we tried to have, we, you know, with our kids and families, to have a little, little reunion and to show that film and invite, you know, Lee Hamilton and his, you know, some of his, his family.  And this guy and his family and then my, my kids.  And we were gonna do that.  And we still are, and--but I have to find a copy--resurrect that sixteen millimeter copy and get it transferred to video so we can do it.  And I said, I'll do it, but I'm gonna get up and walk out at the end of the third quarter, 'cause the ending is not gonna change.
Speaker 1: So what happened, you all fell apart in the third quarter--in the fourth quarter?
Speaker 2: We had some, we had some, some problems, yeah, and we were, we were leading at half.  And, you know, once you lose momentum and, and try to get, play safe, etc., etc., you, you just lose, you lose your momentum.  And you don't recover it.  And we lost I think by, I don't know, four or five points or something.  And the whole town died, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, this was big deal.  This is Indiana.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: Indiana basketball, so--.
Speaker 2: Right.

Speaker 1: When you were a senior [Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana], who were the teachers that influenced you the most?
Speaker 2: I think that, not necessarily the, the teachers.  I had mentioned earlier, Ms., Mrs. Michaels.  I remember Mrs. Michaels.  I remember a social studies teacher, O'Hara, who used to throw erasers, if you didn't behave, but--not at me, but at--I guess if anyone, if anyone had an influence as much as, more influence, at least memorable influence is, would be, would have been the track coach, a gentleman by the name of Wilson, who was, was an outstanding, you know, motivator, individual, gentleman, the kind of things that most coaches, that you, you expect or want your, your sibling, I mean your, your child to be coached by--a very upstanding, forthright.  And I guess he would be a model.
Story_ID: 20034
Speaker 1: Did you have plans to go to college when you were a senior [Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I almost went to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  And, in fact, I, I even went up to, to Wilberforce and had some encounters with--because we, I think we had some other friends from, who were older than I, who were already at Wilberforce.  And we ran into a couple of encounters with a couple of foreign students, and I said, you know, maybe this isn't the place for me.  So I, I left before I ever enrolled.  But I, I already had a combination track and football scholarship to--track scholarship, no, just track scholarship to Indiana.  And I said that's, that's where I'm going.  And Indiana also had a journalism school.
Speaker 1: So that's the University of Indiana in Bloomington [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: University of Indiana at Bloomington, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, there was a--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I really wanted to go to the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota].  And we had some correspondence, you know, sent the clipping and all that up to the university in Minn--and they responded that, as much as they would like to, they could not offer a scholarship at that time, primarily because of some unwritten agreements among the Big Ten Schools about where scholarships would be offered, and where they would recruit.  And, let's see, by--you know, if you draw the lines to Mississippi River--and I'm not sure how far south it went.  But anyhow Minnesota just did not recruit east of the Mississippi River, see, and that gave them all of Montana and Utah and the Dakotas and down in Nebraska where, where they could go, where they could get the hunting--,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --happy hunting ground without, without fear of competition.
Story_ID: 20035
Speaker 1: How did your journalism aspirations do at the University of Minnesota  [sic, University  ?  How were the classes and the teachers and how did you, how did you like Minnesota [sic, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Interesting that you should ask because just, just this summer, the--the, there's an undertaking at Indiana [University] School of Journalism [Bloomington, Indiana] to recreate and do a history of the, the newspaper that is produced by the journalism department, which is the, the university newspaper, the '[Indiana] Daily Student'.  And one of the professors, the letter came out in the blind, and I had, I had some materials and some information and some hard copy of things that, that I had written that were worthy of mention for various and sundry reasons.  And I sent those back to them and in their little sealed, protective, you know, preservative package.  And he, he then sent--at the time, he did not know I was African American.  And then he, he came back and he said, I, he said, "I didn't realize.  However, are--is there anything that you can add about, about your experiences as an African American student?"  And I have not yet responded to that letter.  And I, I don't think I really can.  And I think the--there is a reason, and the reason is, you know, we, in, in our society, athletes still have, still get--well, not just athletes, but anyone who is outside the norm, can get preferential treatment.  And they are accepted where otherwise, they may not be accepted, simply because they are doing what they are doing or they are who they are.  Okay, well, at the time, because of athletic pursuits, I was limited on--I couldn't, you know, '[Indiana] Daily Student', it's a, it's just like any other newspaper.  It's published.  You know, your, your deadline is like at 9:00 at night.  So, if you're on the editorial staff, you're there from X hour to X hour because you've got to, you know, proof it, read it, and get the thing out and rush so it's out and delivered in the morning.  I could not do that because of participation in the, in the athletics program.  So that was, that was an excuse.  And whether--so I covered things that happened in the evening, basketball.  Whenever we'd go on a track meet, I'd cover the track meet.  I'd write some editorials.  I'd do, you know, little bits and pieces, but I was never on the editorial staff.  And I don't know whether it was because I really didn't pursue it, but it should have been part of my experience.  But no one went out of their way to say hey, you have to have this if you want to reach a certain level of competency, recognizing that there are some accommodations we can make because of your schedule, etc., etc., because track season begins in like, like November, because you do indoor track, then you do outdoor track.  So you've eliminated a third of one semester and all of another semester.
Speaker 1: So you don't think you got as much out of it as you could of if--?
Speaker 2: I did not get as much out of it as I, as I should have, I don't think.  And there was very little encouragement.  And this was, subsequently, you know, some of this was supported later on, on some of the things that, that we tried to do, very late, very later on, involving my daughter, who also went to--one of my daughters [Leslie Taylor], who also went to Indiana [University], and also majored in journalism, and is also now an editor down at 'The Roanoke Times' [Roanoke, Virginia].  But she was in Japan, and I--I'm going ahead, I know, but this is, this reflects on part of the policy down there.  She was Japan, I think, the middle of her--between her junior and senior year or between her sophomore and junior year.  So I was, and in my position, I had many contacts in the, in the media world in, in Japan, including the three largest newspapers.  One, the largest newspapers in the world, 'Yomiuri Shinbun', I believe.  I had arranged or I, I had made the, done all preliminaries to, for her to have like an internship with, with the Japanese paper and with two of the Japanese papers, 'Yomiuri Mainichi' and with 'Stars and Stripes' [U.S. Department of Defense-authorized daily newspaper], which was also under my jurisdiction because I had, had policy reign over 'Stars and Stripes' at the time.  So when I wrote back to Indiana, I said, "Now, this going to happen.  We have this set up for my daughter.  Can--is there a way she can get credit for this?"  So I get this little snotty note back saying, "Well, we don't understand the methodology; therefore no, we couldn't--."  I mean there wasn't even a consideration of, of looking at it, saying, here's a student whose, has an opportunity to have exposure to a world that, you know, any student, would enjoy, insight to a whole different world of publication.  And the school, you know, the aca--the politics of academia, I guess are, are such that, you know, there are the protocols, and they're kind of unbending so.  But at any rate I, subsequently I talked about the, the dean of the school, the late dean of the school about my un--but anyhow, digressing.
Speaker 1: How were your grade at the University of Indiana [sic, Indiana University]?  Did you do okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they were o--), I mean, you know, for a jock they were very good (laughter), but no, they were, they were good.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, you had a--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous] I didn't graduate with honors certainly, but, but my grades were, they were in the, in the B range somewhere, B plus, something like that.
Story_ID: 20036
Speaker 1: Now, you had an event that took place when you were running track that you, that you were able to memoralize in a clipping that's on a wall, you know, and I think that you were--what, were you a senior then when this happened or were you in the--? You were running the hurdles, right?
Speaker 2: Right. No, I was a junior [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] when we--we were, were defending Big Ten champions then because in my sophomore year, Indiana was a Big Ten Champion.  And my junior year, we, we had a pretty good team.  But--and, the, I think the, the reference that, that you made was to a picture that appeared, it was an Associated Press picture that ran, I guess all over the AP network that was of the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] hurdle finals.  And I have, a couple of times I have used it as an example to one of my grandsons.  When the others grow up, and they're a little bit older, the other two, I, I will probably make the same reference in that, that picture preceded, seconds after the, the picture was taken, my, the termination of my participation in that event because I fell down.  You know, we, in Big Ten we were used to the aluminum rocker hurdles like you see today, where you can, you know, you can kind of grill your way through and knock them over and they don't--but out there they have the--they were L-shaped or T-shaped and they didn't, they didn't give.  And it was like hitting a two by four.
Speaker 1: Okay, but the important is that you got up, kept keeping on, and that's the example you give them from that--,
Speaker 2: Right, right, and that--,
Speaker 1: --don't let anything stop you.
Speaker 2: --even though this was, at the time, you know, the biggest race in my career and that it would have preceded--it would have allowed participation in the, in the Olympic trials of that year.  And, you know, it, it was just--I didn't let that deter from, you know, you can't dwell on what happens.  What happens, happens, good or bad or indifferent.  You have to move on, and you have to move on and not dwell on--you can't undue it.
Story_ID: 20037
Speaker 1: After Indiana [University, Bloomington, Indiana], what did you do?
Speaker 2: Okay, the, the other, one, one final point, and it relates to after school and when you, when you graduate and what, and what happens.  And I, I had an ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] scholarship, and or RO, ROTC Commission.  So I had an obligation go into the [U.S.] Military, right.  So I went I into the Air Force, but as a reserve second lieutenant, you have the option of either extending your tour or getting out at, at a point in time, at the end of your, end of your two-year period.  So six or eight months before that, I had written to, to the university, you know, told them that I was doing actually a job search.  And the only thing they could recommend was, was a job, a public relations job at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], you know, which was entirely outside the--I mean there's nothing wrong, and I'm not, you know, I would have loved to have gone to Florida A&M.  But at the time, the school had an obligation to not put me in a box and say that we can only refer you to a black institution for hiring.  And, I, I--that disturbed me quite a bit, and that the school wasn't willing to make overtures because at the same time, we had a, we had a--I, I, at the time I was stationed in my place, in my place of birth, and that was St. Paul, Minnesota.  And we had, we had a group of young professionals there, who were because, because we were quote "outsiders," even I was an outsider because I no longer--I was an outsider because I just wasn't part of the, the community.  And as a, as a very reversed community, then you'd have a hard time making social inroads, not that there was dislike, it's just that, well, you know,--so we had, we had a group of young professionals, and we bonded together and formed an organization.  And we met, met monthly and played poker and went to dinner with the wives and stuff like that, and it was called the Hedonites.  And--.
Speaker 1: That was (unclear) (laughs)--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and in that organization Carl Rowan had just begun his career or had just reached notoriety with the, with the Minneapolis [Minnesota] '[Star] Tribune'.  Richard Fox, who was then head of the [Minneapolis] Urban League in the Twin Cities, who subsequently went on to the [U.S.] State Department and who, who retired from there several years ago with the rank of ambassador.  He had been ambassador to one of the Caribbean nations.  There was a physician who was then with--he was Navy, but he was with Public Health or, or something.  I didn't quite understand that, but he--and several other young, young professionals.
Story_ID: 20038
Speaker 1: Knowing that I was fairly close to, close to the date where I had to make a decision about extending in the [U.S.] Air Force or, or seeking private employment, Dick [Richard] Fox, who was head of the [Minneapolis] Urban League said, well, let's, let's go down and try the, the 'St. Paul Dispatch' and 'Pioneer Press'.  As a journalism major, maybe they have opportunities.  So we went down, took my credentials.  And he arranged the interview.  And I had a very long discussion with the managing editor and, you know, showed him what you usually show, writing samples and, and credentials from Indiana [University, Bloomington, Indiana], etc., and military record.  And his, his response to all that was, "Oh, well, you know, that's all well and good, but we just don't think we can take you on at this time.  What we are really looking for is someone with the experience of Carl Rowan."  So, you know, (laughs) my response, I don't know whether I said it then or whether I said it afterwards, I said, "But there is no one with the experience of Carl Rowan, you know, on a major daily newspaper with the exposure and columns, etc."  I mean they just aren't there, and that's, that's how Carl got there was because someone said, here's an individual with talent, etc.  And I don't know whether I said that or Dick said it or, but at any rate, that was a reality check, although when I--there was another time when I started to get out of the Air Force--but at that, I did, I went on and extended.  The job search wasn't, wasn't really producing anything.  And I extended my, my date of separation and went Indefinite, which is just that, indefinite, and then remained in the Air Force and went to California.  And then I did, I did have an opportunity to get a job.  And it was, and it was all kind of--it wasn't a done deal, but I still had to go down--I, we were based in Sacramento [California], and it was going to be with the 'Los Angeles Daily News', but before anything else happened, the 'Los Angeles Daily News' went under [in 1954]  And, you know, they just couldn't compete with the, with the 'L.A. Times'.  So they were no longer in existence.  So then--.
Speaker 2: You decided to stay in the Air Force?
Speaker 1: Yes, at that point, I said--you know, with, with family and, and with the necessity for income, yeah.  And I'll, I'll get to it later about, you know, my, my beliefs on, on our generations.  But as, as those who were some of the early benefactors of, of desegregation, we came up in, in an area where we didn't take chances.  I mean, you know, security was--we didn't take chances primarily cause we didn't know.  We didn't know you could take chances.  We thought you got a job and you keep that job, and that's it.  We, we weren't necessarily aware of opportunities and willing to, willingness to go out and invest in, in other pursuits because security, you know, when you, when you go so long without it, and then all of a sudden you have it, you're, you're not willing to gamble because when--you don't know what the odds are.
Story_ID: 20039
Speaker 1: When did you start to travel?  Had you already started traveling in the [U.S.] Air Force before you--?
Speaker 2: Yes, our, our first overseas tour was in Alaska.  And then when we came back from Alaska, we were in Sacramento [California].  And we left Sacramento and went to Dayton [Ohio].  And it was during that time that the, the Vietnam War started, and that then began my continuation of travel in the Pacific Rim, counting Alaska as part of the Pacific Rim.  So we did a tour in Vietnam, not a, not a full tour because this was--we, I went over in a, in a program that was the, the immediate, you know, we, we were notified in, in early December and departed short after, after Christmas.  And we were the quote "advanced echelon" because they were still, you know, figuring out what they needed, how may people and to get these people and get them trained and get over there.  So we were the first party that went over in, in December, prior to the time that we committed to actually--that wasn't until January when we, it was determined, decided that there was gonna be a full commitment and troops and the whole, what, what eventually followed, was going to take place.  And so our group that went over during that period established the, the initial American presence, other than the advisors in, in Vietnam.  And after that short tour--I tried to extend, but the Air Force--the Air Force has what you call Foreign Service selection date.  And if you're in any overseas area longer than 180 days, your Foreign Service selection date changes, and then you go to the bottom of the list in terms of vulnerability.  So I tried to, I tried to stay for the 180 days, and they finally told me, said, we know what you're doing, captain and we're not gonna let you get away with it (laughs).  If you're not on this next airplane, back, if not, we're gonna court martial you.  So at the 172nd day, I came back.  And we were back for like 60 days.  And then we were--then the system, because my Foreign Service selection date had not changed, the system coughed up my name as, as a requirement.  And so we went--I went back unaccompanied to the, to the Far East, to this time, Thailand.  But I was, I was based in Bangkok [Thailand], but traveled extensively up country because we, again, we didn't have a presence, and I mean we didn't have a people presence.  So I was, I was constantly on the go at the, at four or five upcountry bases.
Speaker 1: Now, what time period is this?  Mid '60's [1960s]?
Speaker 2: This is in 1960, early, early 1960.
Story_ID: 20040
Speaker 1: On one occasion I was asked to, to make arrangements for a briefing for an Israeli journalist and to, you know--and that he was okay, and that you could, you know, go on and, well, give top secret stuff, but, you know, just make sure that, you know, he's aware of the, as much as any American journalist would have.  And I said okay.  And it turned out, and the guy comes up, and he's got this patch over his eye, etc., etc.  It turned out it was [Israeli Prime Minister] Moshe Dayan  (laughs).
Speaker 2: And I, so you--.
Speaker 1: I mean we didn't know that at the time.  It wasn't until, you know, subsequent events that revealed, you know, who he really, really was.
Speaker 2: Now, you were privy to top-secret information and that sort of thing?  Or did you have--or I mean, were you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in, in--yes, and more, you know, top secret and when we came back to the Pentagon, then you really got the, the clearances that allow you access to, to the highest information.
Speaker 2: Okay, as a, in the press corps of the [U.S.] Air Force, would journalists come to you and try to get the real story about different things or try to get this, get you to reveal things?
Speaker 1: Most, most--well, at least in--most, you know, most journalists know, and, yes, there are--and the good journalists have their ways of, of getting information, but they--you know, without compromising, without compromising their sources.  And they know the, the higher you are and the more information you have access to, the less likely you are to compromise information.  Most journalists know that.  And they, you know, they'll, they'll take what you--you know, your working relationship is a--they, they know when not to cross a line.  And they know when you crossed the line, and in some cases they even, they even warn you.  And I, I remember on one occasion, a very astute reporter in the Pentagon press corps from, Fred Hoffman from the Associated Press, Fred Hoffman came in, and we had--this is when I was a military assistant.  And then we had this big map on the wall of Vietnam.  And he came, and he said, "Show me where such and such a place is."  And I said, "Okay Fred."  And we went and we looked.  And he said, "Oh, that's, that's fairly close to such and such a place, isn't it?"  And I said yes.  And he said, "Okay, thank you."  And he went out.  And what he had was, he had a tip that there was--something was going to happen somewhere, and that the forces were going to do something that perhaps they hadn't done before.  But he knew not, you know, he wasn't going to reveal that to me, nor was he going to reveal that, that he had information that something, and he eventually wrote the story.  But he was, he eventually became an assistant secretary in a later administration.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, did you have a standard procedure in terms of what you could say and what you couldn't say?  I mean how would you--I don't know, what were your guidelines, I guess?
Speaker 1: Policy.  And I think, you know, and there are two kinds of policy.  There's military policy that relates to, you know, classified and unclassified information.  And then there's political policy, in other words, and I guess the term that we would use today is political correctness. Political policy is more difficult to deal with than military policy.  Military policy, when it relates to releasing information, is pretty straightforward and without, without nuisances.  Political policy sometimes conflicts with military policy, and then that's when the job of the public affairs person becomes very difficult.  And I, I would say--well, I won't get into contemporary times, but it is more difficult today than it was then.  And we didn't have, then we didn't have a reporter with an instant, you know, telephone, video who can tell exactly what's going on the moment, the moment it happens.  And the media recognizes and, when I was with the oil industry, we gave a seminar that said, it said the process of engaging in, in warfare has changed, will be changed considerably when you have instant reporting from the battlefield.  And we saw the first of that just a few, a few months ago.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: [General] Al [Alexander M.] Haig [Jr.] said, at a time when we, when he was commander of [NATO] Supreme Allied Command headquarters Europe, Al said in a presentation, and he was talking to public affairs officers.  And he said one of the biggest difficulties of diplomats today is that the, their ability to weigh decisions and pontificate and consider results has been compressed to the point where it is, it--they have to respond instantly, whereas in days gone by, they could take weeks or days or, to look and measure and weigh and, and have their words perfectly structured so as not to upset the balance of any--he said, but in today's environment, with the instant communication, he said, that, that time is lost.  And I think, I think, you know, as individuals, we have lost that time too, that we have to respond instantly to, to situations even, you know, in, in private life that we did not have to engage before.
Story_ID: 20041
Speaker 1: Can you give me an example of something that would have happened then, that would be different now to deal with, I mean--?
Speaker 2: I think the, when we went to--I'll, I'll try to bring it closer to home.  And I, I think it's a case of, as we, as we look at local television every evening, you can--an incident will happen, and it will be instant knowledge before the people involved are even aware of its--that something has occurred or the responsible, responsible individuals, a car accident, a bridge collapse, a bank robbery, a, a--I know in, in the oil industry we had an example where a group of senior officials were traveling overseas, and just before a big board meeting.  And they had a plane crash and two of them or three of them, I don't know, were killed and, and the system could respond quickly enough to, you know, to, to satisfy the requirements of what happens when a senior individual in a, in a multi--you know, Fortune 500 company, when suddenly the leadership changes and the stockholders become, you know, you, you don't have enough time to prepare the markets and the markets decline, etc., etc.  You know, I just--all of those are factors that, that come into play where, before you had time to measure results and measure responses and, and act, and act accordingly.  But now, you, you know, you shoot from the hip, unless you are prepared.
Story_ID: 20042
Speaker 1: Since I've retired from the oil industry and what, what we've done with our little venture with Action Image is that we have--and this is on a, on a voluntary basis, we have gone in and worked with, with individuals to say there, there is a problem and, you know, I can, I can help you with that problem.  And I'm not looking for pay, and I'm not looking for a job.  I'm doing it because I appreciate what you're doing, and--but there's a way you can, you can do it better.  We've done that with a couple of government officials.  Early on in Montel Williams's career, we did it with Montel to the point where, it had reached a point in time where, you know--when he first started, he was, he was operating primarily with, with a credit card.  And certain sponsors were, were kind of backing his, says, yeah, he's, he's up over the limit, but--and we thought we meaning some folks in the Public Relations Department at the American Petroleum Institute felt that what he was doing was good.  This is when he was going around doing motivational speaking.  And so we--if he wanted it, we had offered office space, free telephone, free office space and the ability--just to cut down on the amount of money that he was having to put on his card.  He got support from, from elsewhere, and then he asked us to, or in a conversation, he asked us, from a public relations standpoint, where do I go from here?  What do you see?  And so some minds, individuals sat the late Phil Goulding and a gentleman by the name of Jerry Friedheim who was the, who helped build Newseum downtown [Washington, D.C.] in its state was former executive director of American Newspaper Publishers Association.  And then we sat down and prepared kind of an outline of this is where you want to go.  These are some paths you have.  This is--and he appreciated it, and that's when eventually he got to the point where he was structured.  And he invited us to be on the board, but we declined because that's not why we did what we did.  Since then, and I kind of learned a lesson from that and this way of, if you've had good fortune and good experience, and you have an opportunity to give back to society in whatever form it takes, then you sort of have an obligation to do it.  And that's why I approached--I heard a government official speak one night and recognized that he did have a public relations problem, a media problem.  And we, we chatted and we looked at his operation and some of his clips and stuff.  And then we made some recommendations.  And that was the end of that.  We've done it with--I had, very early on, I was talking to, to some folks, and we offered to do the same thing for, with Richard Williams when we were dealing with the--but some other folks got to Richard early enough so that he did finally get the IMG on board and kind of did a lot of things for, instead of having lawyers and accountants doing his PR [public relations], he did get some professional help.  And they've gotten, you know, better contracts and they've moved on to, to where they are now.  I have a friend who--well, I won't go into that, but, but anyhow, we are--and I, and I do these things not, not for pay but simply because I think it--things need to be done.  If we can help people voluntarily on a, on a one-to-one basis, I'm more than, more than pleased to do it and make the expertise and the experiences that I've had contribute to the success of others, I'm, I'm more than willing to do it.
Story_ID: 20043
Speaker 1: We need to talk about your experiences in the defense department [U.S. Department of Defense] and how you felt--you were--from all the photos I've seen you seem like you're the only black person involved in the defense department in the public relations field--.
Speaker 2: Well, at--.
Speaker 1: You may not have been the only one, but you're, you're one of the few--.
Speaker 2: At, at the time, since then I've, you know, at, at the time, and I don't know since I haven't return to, but to the best of my knowledge, I, I--and I don't like to, you know, (laughs) play my own little horn, but to the best of my, my knowledge, I am the highest ranking African American to--in the [U.S.] Air Force Public Affairs apparatus.  There have been others who have, who have moved from operational to--[Daniel] 'Chappy' James, for example, who was a fighter pilot, had a, had a public relations position on the [U.S. Department of] Defense Staff at the same time I was a military assistant.  Chappy's office was right down the hall, but that was merely a stepping stone to his going back into the, into the operational arena at the conclusion of his very--the time during Vietnam when he served in that position.  There have been--Tom Clifford who came also out of Air Force flying ranks and served essentially in that same position that, that Chappy served in.  And when he left, he went to General Motors and was, was very successful at the Fisher--I think his first position with them was operating a Fisher Body Plant up in--and has since has gone on to higher offices in GM [General Motors].  And now, and the last I heard, he had his own, own dealership.  So there were those in other career paths who performed public relations or functions, but from someone who was a trained public--or who was a professional public affairs or journalist position, to the best of my knowledge, I was the, the highest ranking one, up till that time.  Since then, I'm not sure.

Speaker 1: You were in a difficult position of trying to, I guess, handle public relations when [Richard M.] Nixon was the [U.S.] President and the Vietnam War was at its height.  Now, you worked with Melvin Laird who was the [Secretary of] Defense--.
Speaker 2: I was the, the military officer that accompanied him in, in providing public affairs support, along with the--my senior was the assistant secretary, the civilian appointee, who was the assistant secretary of defense.  And I was his military assistant.  And together, we provided support to the secretary of defense in all of his travels around the world and around the country, and very interesting experiences occurred during that time.  But, I think that, from an educational standpoint, it was, it was--I've always believed that a job, a job is a job, but what makes a job important is if the person you are working for is someone that you can learn from.  And as--and I always enjoyed having positions where I could learn from the person that I was, I was working.  When that job was finished, then I, I am better prepared for whatever else comes afterwards.  And I was fortunate in that most of the people that, who were my supervisors--and everybody always has a supervisor, everyone does.  And I was fortunate in that, I mean even the secretary of defense has a supervisor (laughs).  Even the president has one, although sometimes he might not recognize it, and that's the supreme supervisor up, upstairs.  But it--I think you're always, if you, if you--that has to be part of your mindset, in other words.  What can I learn out of this position?  Every, every experience is a learning experience, and if you don't take something away from it that makes you better prepared or a better person or, or more involved in your profession or your beliefs or spiritual, social or professional, then perhaps, you're--you know, you have to approach it with that mindset.

Speaker 1: You served in the Defense Department [U.S. Department of Defense] in a similar capacity in the [President James 'Jimmy'] Carter Administration too, right?  You served in the Pentagon?
Speaker 2: In--understand the operat--the news operations of the Pentagon.  There is, there is the news department.  And the news department has several, several branches, the Army, the Navy and the Marine Corps, the civilian representation, the audio visual, the same thing, Army, Navy, Air Force and there's still, still photography.  And all of that comes under a manager, and that manager is called the, the chief, the director of defense information.  Or to put it in laymen's terms, the chief, chief of the Pentagon press operation.  My first tour in the, in the building, I was--I began, at that time they had the Southeast Asia, just having come from Southeast Asia, I was on the Southeast--I was the Air Force representative on the Southeast Asia desk.  And then from that position, I moved up to the military assistant position.  And when the [Secretary of Defense Melvin R.] Laird Administration [1969-1973] ended and that tour of duty was over, I went to Japan as the, as the senior public affairs representative of the Armed Forces, U.S. Forces Japan, in Japan.  And then the second job, as you wore two hats, as they say, I was the chief of information for the fifth Air Force, which included all Air Force units in Japan, Okinawa [Japan] and Korea.  Language-wise, I studied the Japanese language, spoke Japanese.  When I was in Thailand, I spoke Thai.  I always believed that you, that you, you know and understand more about the country you're in if you understand the language.  And it does, it opens doors and opens, and gives you a recognition and a realization that--even though you don't speak well, you can still--and sometimes it's to your advantage not to speak too well because you throw, you throw your, your host off guard.  But you have to speak well enough so that you can, you could understand what's being--and it's difficult to become proficient, but you should become proficient enough so that you can communicate in, in the local language.  And we were fortunate enough to--Thai, I had trouble with because it's a tonal language, and I, you know, I can't sing anything on, on key.  So, but as long as you keep things in context, you can, you can offset the, the inability to be accurate on your, on your tones.

Speaker 1: When I was invited to participate in this, in this program, I, I questioned my own, I won't say worth, but my own credentials for participation, given the, the long list of notables who have been or will participate.  And I, I tried to think what could I bring to, to this forum that, that some others may not bring, even those who have been in, in the military or in other, in other endeavors.  And I think I came up with a thing, a list of my own personal involvement in catastrophic events that, either catastrophic or emotional events that occurred during the periods, the '60s [1960s], the '70s [1970s] and the '80s [1980s] and the '90s [1990s].  And if you go back and chronicle the major news stories of, of those times, a good percentage of them I was either a player or a participant or a witness to those, in one capacity or another.  And you say, well, what were those events.  Well, we could start with the prisoner of war return, the--and, and all of the Vietnam circumstances, at one point, at one point in, in Southeast Asia during Tet [Offensive, 1968] I was, I was the main point of contact for every news man in the world who got shut out from Vietnam and was trying to get back.  And we, and we dealt with--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) '68 [1968], yeah.
Speaker 1: --and we dealt personally with and, and I still correspond with and see him, and, and speak with him in very friendly terms, with Ted Koppel, 'cause he was one of those.  Walter Cronkite was one.  An Italian, Oriana Falachi left her fur coat in my, in my office while, while we, we, you know, we aided her.  Okay, so there was the Vietnam thing.  After Vietnam and all of the, the My Lai [massacre, March  1968] and the, the disastrous, the disastrous things that happened from, from a public relations standpoint that occurred--but that ended--then the, the Jonestown Massacre [1978] down in, in Guyana, the, the lost nuclear bombs in, in Spain and in Greenland, the, the capture of the [USS] Pueblo [Navy intelligence ship] up in, up in North Korea [January, 1968].  And the oil--oh, the Iranian situation [Iran hostage crisis, 1980]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the hostage--in 1980.
Speaker 1: --the hostage, the hostage and the failed attempt to rescue them.  The--on the oil industry side, there was the, there are always decisional prices and the raise and decline in oil prices.  There was the Kuwait virus during Desert Storm [first Persian Gulf War, 1991].  There was Desert Storm itself.  And the relationship to the oil industry was at--. There was, and above all, the Exxon Valdez [tanker oil spill, 1989], which to this day is, is still, is still recorded and is referred to, particularly as it relates to a continuation of all of development in, in Alaska.  On the emotional side, we had the, the riots in, in both the, the civil riots and also the, the riots and the disturbances related to the anti-war, Vietnam movement.  I got personally involved.  And I have, have a--I just saw it the other day when I was going through looking for photographs, I have a, in a sealed set of orders, signed by the secretary of defense that (laughs), that give me authority to go any place in the Continental United States or outside the Continental United States to perform duties as dictated by the secretary of defense.  And then there's, you know, it's all the Xs and Ys are punched.  And it was a, a blanket order to do anything that I thought I should do, to call on any resources to, to perform whatever task I was asked to perform.  And that happened on the couple of occasions where, you know, I'd go, and [wife] Phyllis [Moxley] didn't know where I was going, and I just said, I got to go.  And we'd hop on an airplane, and it related to intercepting--I was supposed to meet an airplane in, in Stockholm, Sweden and ask the return, the prisoners who were in the company of some anti-war--leave their presence and come with me on an airplane that I had been given to fly.  And whether we could have done that or not, I don't know.  What they did was change the itinerary, so we, we did the same thing up in New York on the, on the tarmac up at the [John F.] Kennedy [International] Airport.  And, you know, there are, you know, are there others?  There're probably some other minor instances that--.
Speaker 2: This is an--what you just described was an attempt to get prisoners who had been released by anti-war people to--.
Speaker 1: They had--no, the, the Berrigan Brothers [Daniel and Phillip Francis Berrigan] and a couple of other activists whose name I can't remember, who were tied in with the, very vocal members of the anti-war movement had somehow or other negotiated or convinced the North Vietnamese that, that--well, if we can bring back, we can make, you know, it will enhance our presence, it will, it will show that we have credentials and that we can become a part of--the overall objective I don't know.  A lot of it would have been just propaganda.  "You can't--look, Government, you can't get them back, but we can."  And there were, there was one, there was an African American, a Lieutenant Charles, Navy, Navy lieutenant and there were, was one Air Force and then there was another Navy.  And the Air Force, the major, I can't, I can't recall his name, but he was married.  And on the airplane that we left with, we had his father and his wife.  And they weren't--the plan was they would not--we'd go as far as Germany, but they would not go to, they wouldn't go to Sweden.  And so we were to, you know, call upon, get airplanes and--but when they changed the, coming out and they went into Moscow [Soviet Union], and coming out of Moscow, they changed the itinerary and did something.  Now, they may have gone direct or something like that.  So we didn't pursue that, and it was easier to do it in--.  Exxon Valdez, we, we took newsmen up to--we, meaning the American Petroleum Institute, and we had newsmen and went up to the North Slope [Borough, Northern Alaska territory] to look at the operation at Prudhoe Bay [Alaska] and then down to Anchorage [Alaska], and then back to, down to Prince William Sound [off the coast of Alaska] to look at the end of the pipeline and to show how the situation, you know, how oil moves from point A to Point B, what happens to it when it gets to the port, how it gets on a tanker and what the--and then looked at the clean-up operation that was ongoing up in--even to this day now, I have, I have made presentations on behalf--and I, I do it in a balanced way, with pluses and minuses.  You know, what the proponents say, and what the opponents say, and what the value is.  Anyhow, those, those, those experiences, the help that we've given individuals--.
Story_ID: 20047
Speaker 1: I have a theory, and I think I--a theory and an idea.  And I'm pursuing it, and it gets more difficult to pursue it every day.  And it deals with, I, I, I've developed the theory that--and I'll call it the Z Generation, generations, 'cause it's a family of generations, African Americans who were born essentially in the, in the late '20s [1920s], the '30s [1930s], the '40s [1940s].  And maybe, maybe just a few into the '50s [1950s], but basically, those, basically those folks within those four generations.  And they, they bear a distinction and they hold cards that no other generations before them or no other generations after them will be able claim.  And those three points are that they, among those generations are the last living links to slavery.  I mean folks who have, who can identify and remember and know, either relatives or, or direct links to those in the slave--and Phyllis's [Moxley], my wife's sister, is, is married to George Haley, the brother of Alex Haley.  And it was through that relationship that we began thinking about the links to slavery.  They just live right--in fact, he will in the not too distant future, be one of your subjects.  All right, that's point one, the last living link.  But the second point is, it's they are the first generation--groups of, of individuals of African Americans to have matured during, at a time when they can appreciate the, the difficulties in a segregated society and, and the promise that is held in a desegregated society.  And they're old enough to, to know the difference.  And the third point is that they are the first generations to have prospered under the deseg--in, in the desegregated society, have had the opportunity to prosper in, in the desegregated society.  During this period, they, there are, there were no manuals.  There were no guidelines.  There were no books.  There were no documentaries that said okay, this is how it's going to be.  The law passed and the assumption is that all will follow the law, but how, how do I act now that I am--I used to be this, now I'm this.  What, what are the rules, the rules of engagement?  The protocols, etc.  So since there were no written rules, most individuals who were branching out and moving into new ventures had to rely on common sense.  They had to rely on their own values and they had to, as--to use an Air Force expression, they had to sort of fly by the seat of your pants.  And this was on both sides, both in the, the majority and in, in those who, from the minorities.  And sometimes there were a lot of awkward situations.  And sometimes there were, sometimes when things didn't go as well as they should have gone.  And among any group of, of individuals who are sitting in those age groups, everyone has a story to tell, an anecdote that reflects the ability to adjust, the ability to respond to social situations or a political situation or respond to a given set of situations without guidance or, or benefit of an experience factor to draw upon.  And there's--you're dealing from, with a fresh deck.  And in some cases, they reflect humor in the results, in some cases they reflect sadness and in some cases, anger.  And I guess the, the genesis of, of what I, what I envisioned was--and I know the book because I have seen it referred to even, even at your headquarters, and that is, 'Lay My Burden Down' [Alvin F. Poussaint, Amy Alexander], which did essentially the same thing.  It told the, the story of slavery from the side, from the view of the slaves by coupling vignettes of life or experiences or short--not short stories, but just capsules of, of what individuals felt or saw or, or experienced in various subject areas.
Speaker 2: So one of your projects now is to try to collect some of those stories.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And, and the difficulty with that is, and every time, every time I pick up the obituary page, and I see, you know, someone that I know.  And I could, I could start giving a long list of folks who, who have a story to tell.
Story_ID: 20048
Speaker 1: A friend of mine who, who just passed away, Ernie Fears, Ernie Fears had been a government official.  He had been a basketball coach at, I believe Norfolk State [University, Norfolk, Virginia].  He had been a number of--and professionally, he was, he had achieved--yeah, he had a government-appointed position in the state of Virginia and had reached some recognition in that capacity.  And at the time I believe, I believe it was the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was, was badgering ABC [American Broadcasting Company] Network to, you know, diverse and, you know, pick up and why, why at the management level do you not have more.  And the response had been, oh, well, we can't find any qualified person.  Said, well, if we, if we provide you with a list of qualified people, will you hire them?  They said, yes.  Well, one of them was Ernie Fears.  So Ernie was appointed as a station manager of the, one of ABC's [American Broadcasting Corporation] leading radio stations here, FM stations here in, here in Washington [D.C.].  At the time it was, I'm not sure if it, it still carries that moniker, but it was WKYS [sic, WRQX, Washington, D.C.].  And essentially, it was a soft rock station, okay.  But anyhow, Ernie took it, and he started operating, and they grew to a, to subsequently become the largest radio, moneymaker in the ABC, in the ABC family.  I mean he'd been that successful.  So, and so Ernie recognized that the--and I say all this just to, just so you understand the story I'm about to tell you, that he told, that he tells.  Okay, he, he lost his station manager.  And the heart of an operation radio station, even soft rock, is, is the station manager.  So he--ads are out and people were responding.  And Ernie went in early to work.  He always went in early.  He said, he said, I don't like surprises, and I want to, you know, get a feel.  He's in there one morning, and he's got his shirtsleeve rolled up and he doesn't have a tie on yet, etc.  A fellow walks in, a spiffy young guy, and he's in the coffee room.  So Ernie's in there, and fixing a cup of coffee.  And the fellow walks in and says, "You work here?"  He says, "Yeah, I, I work here."  He said, "Oh, well, fix me a cup of coffee, would you, please?"  "Yes sir," and he fixes the coffee and he hands it to him.  He said, "Thank you."  He said, "I'm here to--."  He said, "Do you know, Ernie Fears?"  He says, "Yeah."  "Good man?"  "Yeah, he's a very good man."  He said, "Okay, well, I'm here from Memphis, Tennessee.  And I know you've got a, you've got a vacancy, and I'm, you know, I, I think I'm, I'm the best one qualified for this job."  And he said to him, "I've got an appointment with him this morning."  Said, "And by the way, fix me another cup of coffee there would you, please."  He said, "Yes, sir."  And he fixed him a cup of coffee.  He said, "Well, I've got to be going."  He said, "Okay, it's nice talking to you.  I hope you have a good day, work hard.  You'll get ahead in this," etc., etc., you know, so (laughs).  Ernie goes in, puts on his tie.  Nine o'clock comes and the guy walks into his appointment.  The secretary said, "Mr. Fears, so and so is here from Memphis, Tennessee."  He said, "Send him right in."  The guy walks in and he takes one look, and his eyes get big.  He said, "Ah," he said, "I might as well go on right back to Memphis." (Laughs).  And Ernie said, "You got it right."  You would never anticipate at a soft rock station that the general manager would have been African American.  But any--so anyhow, I mean everyone, everyone who has, who has ventured out and has had an experience like that and one that shows, all right, well, how, how do you handle it?  I mean do you get, you know, do you--as some would say, do you, you know, grab somebody and do it by force or do you do it the, very, with subtlety?  Do you--how do you handle situations?  No one knows.  You do what your instincts tell you is correct.  And sometimes it works, and sometimes it does not.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hope and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: We have--I, I have been very fortunate.  I have been very fortunate in my near fifty, my fifty-some odd years of marriage.  I have a wonderful wife [Phyllis Moxley].  I have three, three daughters [Cynthia Taylor Ward, Leslie Taylor, Shelia Taylor Goins], all grown.  I have three grandsons, and I, I feel that I have, that I have been blessed and that family structure, which I may or may not have had early on, I, I didn't think about.  I mean you come up in a broken home or something, that's, that's--as long as you have the awareness of family and the, and the love of family, then that offsets some of the negatives involved in, in the broken home thing.  But I think maintaining the family structure, having ideals and, and a sense of purpose would, would begin the process of leading us to the points that we have not yet reached, that we want to reach and that we, we need to reach.  I'll give you an example, and this is not necessarily related to example, but it's a matter of mindset.  And a lot of it is just changing mindset so that you view things, you view situations, perhaps maybe we internalize it too much; maybe we don't externalize it enough.  The--'Savoy' magazine recently carried a little, a little comment about some entertainers in, in Korea who were doing black face.  And the comment was, you know, don't they realize this is embarrassing and it's, it's a shame.  And my letter back to them indicated that, yeah, they were right, and I, I don't disagree with them.  But at the same time, if, if you live in, in Korea, you don't have access to African American community and your image of African Americans is drawn by what you see on BET [cable television station] or in, in the--not on BET, they don't get BET, on VH1 [cable television station] and the videos that are carried on, on the stations, that VH1, I think being one of them or on the, on the HBO [cable television station] or something.  And those videos if you, if you take the time to look at those videos as if you were seeing them for the first time and were not aware of what was behind the cultural values, then you wouldn't think it was offensive to do what this group in, in Korea did.  In fact, it may be that an imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  I don't know, but I think we have to look at, look at, you know, at what we are doing and what it means to the world as a whole and perhaps change our, our values.
Story_ID: 20050
Speaker 1: What would you see at this juncture as your legacy?
Speaker 2: That, hopefully, that I, I served as a role model to those or either a role model or and to, to individuals who I have come in contact with, either in, in leadership roles, either socially, professionally or--and, and not necessarily, not limited to African Americans, but mostly involving African Americans.  If I have a regret, it would be on my own side that perhaps, you know, have I done enough?  I'd say, well, no, I haven't.  Could I do more?  Yes, I could.  Have I been perfect?  No (laughs), I have not.  Would I like to?  Yes, we all would.  So I would like my legacy to be that my, my grandsons, the three of them, Theodore, William and Kenneth, if they have an opportunity to look at this, they will appreciate what they have seen and use it, use it for their--to benefit their lives as they--and that perhaps this will be some day be part of their legacy too.  I don't know.  I would hope so.
Speaker 1: Okay--.
Speaker 2: I, I appreciate what the, what the HistoryMakers is doing, and this perhaps is, is why I, I first made the overture to--and initially, I declined.  I, I would rather help, and I will continue to help the HistoryMakers identifying persons.  I think, thus far, by my count, maybe, maybe ten or eleven, I don't know, I've--of the, of the recommendations that I have made have been, have been part of, have been part of your archives.  And I will continue.  In fact, I--the names are not on the, on the sheet that I filled out, but I do have some more names that, that I'm, that I will pass on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I will continue to be an advocate for, for your program.
Speaker 1: All right, well, thank you.  But this last question is similar to legacy, but different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Okay, I guess I would have to answer that, that two ways.  The first of it, I would like to be remembered as, as a golfer who had skills the equal of Tiger Woods, but that, that's not possible (laughs).  As, as folks ask me, say, "How's your golf game?"  And I say, "It's, it's never, it's not as good as it never was," okay, nor will it be.  But secondly, I would like to, to be remembered as a, as a good father, as a good grandfather, as a loving husband and as a good family man who, who did his best and went on to "doe ye nexte thynge."

And what he said was that his executive assistant was a young man, and he is pictured in the top row at the far left, his executive assistant was a bright young man.  He had both an engineering and lawyer's degree from [University of Southern California Los Angeles, California].  He had a six handicap on the golf course.  He was bright and--but he said, the thing that concerns him most is that all of the gentlemen that you see--most of the gentlemen that you see in that picture are the heads of their organizations.
