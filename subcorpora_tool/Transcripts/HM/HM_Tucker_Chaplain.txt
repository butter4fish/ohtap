Story_ID: 165897
Speaker 1: Now, if you will, let's begin talking about your mother, starting with your mother's name and where she was born, and where she grew up as a girl.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Wilhelmina Scott Smith.  And she grew up in Melbourne, Florida.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her as a little girl?
Speaker 2: Well, it was difficult, she shared that.  But she was a hard worker, and her grandfather reared her, along with her mother.  So, and she was the only girl, and she had two brothers.  So, she had to work very hard.
Speaker 1: And did she ever talk about what Melbourne was like during that time, and what kind of work she did as a child?  Did she do like domestic work, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did domestic work.  And during that time, it was difficult for African Americans.  They didn't enjoy the privileges that we now enjoy.  So, she had struggles.
Speaker 1: And did she ever talk about, like, any particular families that she worked for, or that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I think sometimes that was... like she just really didn't like to re-hash that part of history.
Speaker 1: And did she ever talk about, like, the kinds of things she liked to do as a young girl growing up in Melbourne?
Speaker 2: Well, I think she liked, like most young girls, going out and having fun and things like that.  She didn't share a lot about that part of her life with me.
Speaker 1: So, let's talk a little bit... actually, how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: I would describe my mother as a strong woman.  She worked hard all her life.  And she's very caring, a very caring person.
Story_ID: 165898
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father now, starting with his name and where he grew up as a boy, and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: My father's name was Sylvester Kelsey.  He grew up in Lake City, Florida.  And my father shared a lot.  He was a presser for a cleaners, and he did that real well.  And he shared the hard times that he had as an African American man.  But my father was just an outstanding man.  He was a family man; he loved his children, and I just can't say enough about him.
Speaker 1: And did he ever talk about, like, the process involved with being a presser?  Like, what he had to physically do at work, and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, he would talk about--in those days, the machinery was not like it is today.  So it was a lot of manual labor.  And he talked about the long hours standing on his feet and, you know, from six maybe to eight at night every day for just small wages.
Speaker 1: Did he ever get burned or anything by the machine?
Speaker 2: No, he was really a very good professional at that.
Speaker 1: And did he ever talk about what life was like for him as a little boy in Lake City?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.  It was kind of difficult, because his mother worked hard.  And she was a Seminole Indian.  And they talked about how they were treated, you know, very... during that time a lot of racism... and how he was always referred--even on his job--as "boy," never "Mister."  And he had to take those kind of things because he had a family and children to rear.  And he talked about how it was very painful not to be able to say, "Don't call me boy, but call me Mister."
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No, they never really talked about it. My father was considerably much older than my mom [Wilhelmina Scott Smith].  And, but they never shared that.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: I would describe my father as a very unusual man, because he took much pride in rearing his children.  And I know he wanted the best for us, because it was a must that we go to church, that we would go to school.  And he really talked about education.  My father didn't have an education.  In fact, he couldn't even write his name.  But he would enjoy--when we were being educated--for us to read to him.  And he was just an unusual man.  He taught me how to cook, how to clean.  And I don't remember him really going out on--you know, doing anything but just being dedicated to his children.  He never had a life of his own.
Story_ID: 165899
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestry?  You talked a little bit about your paternal grandmother being a Seminole Indian.  Like, how far back can you trace your ancestry?  Do you know if you came from free people, or slaves?  Can you trace it at all?
Speaker 2: I know a little history about my father's [Sylvester Kelsey] mother, and I know that she was a Seminole Indian.  But I think due to the pain of her history, she didn't share very much with us.  And it's a tragedy that we didn't try to find out more about it.  She was a very quiet person, and didn't talk a lot.  But on my mother's side, I, as far as I know, we were free slaves, I mean from just a little bit of history that I got.  And I'm not absolutely sure.
Speaker 1: So your people were perhaps slaves at one time and then became free?
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: And is there any Native American ancestry on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: No, just my father's mother.  But my mother [Wilhelmina Scott Smith] was mixed.
Story_ID: 165900
Speaker 1: What about your grandparents?  Did you know your grandparents well?  And could you start by telling us their names?
Speaker 2: Yes.  On my mother's [Wilhelmina Scott Smith] side, my grandmother was Bessie McDaniel Scott.  And I knew her father, my great-great-grandfather.  And his name was Amos Scott.  And I know that I spent a lot of time with them during my childhood.  And my grandmother, none of them were really educated, but they were hard workers.  He had an orange grove, and he worked hard on that, and that's how he made his living.  And he had accumulated land just by his--as they would call it then--his... the common kind of sense that you had.
Speaker 1: And did he have like a lot of people who worked for him picking oranges and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, he used a lot of young people and paid them, you know, small wages to get by.
Story_ID: 165901
Speaker 1: Did you ever pick oranges?
Speaker 2: No, but my brother [Jerome Kelsey] and sister [Harriet Milbry] did.  And I was more protected, because I had--suffered with asthma a lot.  So, there were some things I didn't have to do.
Speaker 1: And what was it like growing up with asthma during that time?  Were there a lot of... did you take like medication every day?  Like a lot of kids nowadays, you hear about them taking medication every day, that kind of thing.  Did you have medication back then?  Or what was that like?
Speaker 2: Back then, it was real hard.  I remember the struggle that my father [Sylvester Kelsey] had, because he wasn't able to get the medication.  And the remedies that they used, they would sit up and fan me at night.  And there were some kind of herbs that they, I think that they picked and made tea and things like that.  And even at that time, I couldn't even go--going to the hospital, they had maybe just a little room where they--at that time, it was "Colored."  And you didn't get the proper care.  And I had a really rough time, but the medication was the problem.  If I could have gotten medication, I think I'd have did much better.
Speaker 1: Was it a problem financially for your family?
Speaker 2: Financially, yes.
Story_ID: 165902
Speaker 1: Tell me, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I think my earliest memory of growing up--I guess with my dad [Sylvester Kelsey] and going with him everywhere.  And I think the first time that I wanted to wear lipstick, he didn't want me to do that.  I think because... I guess he felt that was a sign of my growing up.  And those were good memories.
Speaker 1: Can you share some other memories with us?  Like, what were holidays like in your house, like Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter?  Were they really special times?
Speaker 2: I think they were special times, although we were poor.  My father tried to provide as best as he could.  And he would cook meals.  And at that time, you had credit.  You'd go to the country store and buy things, you know, once a month, and it had to last.  So even if we didn't have a turkey during Thanksgiving, whatever meal we had, we felt blessed.
Speaker 1: What was Easter like at your house?  Did you guys get new clothes, and that kind of thing at Easter time?
Speaker 2: Not really.  But really, it wasn't very difficult for us growing up, because other children didn't either.  We didn't feel really... we really didn't think about it that much.
Story_ID: 165903
Speaker 1: You talked a lot about your father [Sylvester Kelsey] teaching you how to cook and clean, and that kind of thing.  So, where was your mother [Wilhelmina Scott Smith] throughout this process?  Did your parents divorce?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.  My father, he received custody of us at a very early age.  We were very, very young.  My sister, Harriet [Milbry]; my brother, Jerome [Kelsey] and myself.  And there was another brother [Roy Brooks], but he was adopted.  And my father got custody of us, and he took care of us.  And as I said before, his life was just dedicated to us.  We don't remember him dating other ladies, or anything like that.
Speaker 1: And could you kind of describe just what daily life was like?  What was a typical day like for you as a young girl, as a school girl?  You'd wake up in the morning... and then what would you do next?
Speaker 2: A typical day for me as a young girl was sort of different, because at that time we didn't have a mother.  And being the oldest girl, I took that mother role.  So, I'd get my sister up.  And my father would be gone early to work.  And I'd try to get ready for school, because we walked to school from where we lived.  And I tried to study, but I would have to cook in the evening when I came home, and clean.  And those were the things that, that was a typical day.  It wasn't like a typical day for a young lady that had parents--a mother and father in the home.  So, it was different.
Speaker 1: And what impact did your parents' divorce have on you?
Speaker 2: It had a great impact on me as a young woman.  Because at times... there were times... crucial times for my dad, when he, when I was growing up.  Those were moments that he didn't want to have to deal with--where if I had a mother, she would tell me about--things about early womanhood and what to expect.  And it was difficult not having a mother.  Because mothers can tell and do so much different with their daughters.  But those are the things that were very hard on me.  I resented it, but we got through it.
Story_ID: 165904
Speaker 1: Could you please give us your siblings' names and their birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: My brother, Jerome, he's the oldest.  And he, his name is Jerome Kelsey.  He was born in April; I don't remember, I don't know the year.  He's a year older than I am, so he was born in April of '44 [1944].  My sister--
Speaker 1: Next is you.
Speaker 2: Next is me, yes.  I'm Sylvia Voncill Kelsey Tucker, and I was born on June 20, 1945.  And my brother, Roy Brooks, whom was adopted.  And I don't know, I don't have the birthdates.
Speaker 1: And that's why, so you can... so he's next after you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And who's after him?
Speaker 2: My sister, Harriet.  And my sister, Harriet, her birthday is September 29th.  And she was a couple years younger, so she was born in about '47 [1947], I think.
Story_ID: 165905
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about the community that you grew up in.  Do you remember the name of the street that you lived on [in Melbourne, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yes, Colbert Circle.
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe the street for us, and your block and your community?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a very wonderful... that's the first home that my father owned.  And everybody in that community... there were new, I think, subdivisions for African Americans, where they could own their homes at that time.  And everybody really took pride in their homes.  And it was a neighborhood that they knew that my father were rearing his children alone, so they looked out for us.  And of course, if they saw something, they told... would tell my father.  I found it to be a community of a lot of caring and love.  If you did something, you knew the neighbor was going to tell your dad.  Or... and I remember we lived next to Mr. Elkins, who was the agriculture instructor.  So, my father [Sylvester Kelsey] was happy about that, because he would always talk to him about how he wanted his children to become an educator like he was.
Speaker 1: And what else can you tell us about your street?  Like, was there a corner store or anything like that?  What else can you tell us?
Speaker 2: Well, there was... right across the... on the other street was a place called the Holland Drive.  And that was for teenagers, which I never got a chance to go, because my dad was strict.  But they would sell ice cream and beverages.  And down the corner was, it was called the Blue Flame.  And that was, you would call it like a juke joint at that time.  But the store where my father had credit was on the other side of town.  He would have to get a ride, and we would go.  But that was the store owned by an African American that we were real proud of, that we shopped with him.
Story_ID: 165906
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: The sights that remind me of growing up, I guess are the trees.  Because around Florida, it was a lot of trees.
Speaker 1: Fruit trees, or just trees in general?
Speaker 2: Fruit trees.  You'd see orange groves and grapefruits--all those everywhere in our area.  And the sight--now, what did--?
Speaker 1: The sounds and smells.
Speaker 2: The sounds.  I think the sounds are--and that's why I like it today when I hear water, the sound of water, because it's a lot of water.  And I know we used to have to go with my aunt fishing, which I didn't like.  But you would always hear the sound of water.  And the smell that remind me of water--anytime someone is frying fish or--that reminds me--
Story_ID: 165907
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about elementary school.  Do you remember the name of the elementary school that you attended?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I attended one school.  It was Stone High--well, it was Stone School, because it was only one school.  It was segregated then for African Americans.  It was from first through twelfth, and that was Stone High School [Melbourne, Florida].
Speaker 1: And during the elementary school years, do you remember some of your teachers?
Speaker 2: I remember one in particular, because they showed an interest in me.  And that was Mr. Borders [ph.].  He always urged me to study, because he knew that I was really, like, being the woman of the house.  And he would always do extra things, get extra books for me to really study.
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about... what type of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I was an average student, because I had a lot of things going on that other students didn't have.  But I did well considering.
Speaker 1: And what type of child were you during the elementary school years?  Were you very obedient and well-mannered, or mischievous?  What type of child were you?
Speaker 2: Well, I think was a little different, because I felt the role that my father had placed on me as being the person to really help... and that he depended on.  Because when he would tell me to do something, I was afraid not to.  And I was more, like, I mean I was more quiet.  And my sister and brother were different.  So, they made up for the other part.
Speaker 1: During the elementary school years, did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: What were they?
Speaker 2: Well, I always wanted to do better.  I wanted to be able to finish high school, to go to college, because it was sort of a dream that I felt my dad always wanted for me.  And I knew from his teaching that, at that time, if you were African American and you weren't educated, you could not get a decent job.  So, those were my dreams.
Speaker 1: And did you ever dream or think about what you wanted to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to be a nurse.  I, I, I've always wanted to be a nurse.  I don't know if it was because of my illness and how people had took care of me and how I was strong; I didn't let that keep me down.  If I was sick, I'd still keep going.  And I always wanted to give back to people.  That was one of the things I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 165908
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.  My father [Sylvester Kelsey] would make sure that we went.  It was a must that we would go to church on Sundays.  We had to walk.  And there was a lady by the name of Mrs. Gibbs [ph.] that was just--kept us working in the church, and making sure that if we didn't come, she'd call my father to find out why.  But he always wanted to make sure that we went.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was Scott Chapel AME Methodist Church.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like there?
Speaker 2: My experiences there were beautiful.  Because I remember during the summer months... and that was the only time that it seems like I could get away.  We would go to--they had a camp that Mrs. Gibbs would take the teenagers to every year for a week in Gainesville, Florida.  And we would stay there for a week.  We would be in workshops and... well, they didn't call them that then.  But that's what it added up to.  She taught us how to be a lady, how to--taught us the "dos" and the "don'ts" and how we had to make men respect us, and then vice-versa for the young men.
Story_ID: 165909
Speaker 1: What about during the junior high school years?  Who were some of your friends during junior high school?
Speaker 2: Well, my best friend during junior high school, her name was Betty Lou Thompson [ph.].  And I still think about her today.  She and I were very close, because I think she had--we had similar issues.  Her mom had to work; her parents were divorced.  So we would, we could communicate with each other, and we felt that we were not being judged by not being able to participate and do everything like other... the children that... financially could afford it.  And she is still living, she's in California.  And I talked with her about three months ago.  We got in... she got in contact with me.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did you guys like doing, growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we liked make-believe... that we were...  She... her make-believe was that she was going to be a movie star, because she could sing well.  And my make-believe, I was going to be a nurse.  And we would just make believe... dreams.  I guess you'd call them fantasies.
Speaker 1: Who was influencing you most as a young person?  Who do you think was really having an influence on you?
Speaker 2: I think the lady that I talk about a lot, Mrs. Gibbs.  But the person-and I always go back to that--is my father [Sylvester Kelsey].  He had a great influence on my decisions in my life.
Story_ID: 165910
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the high school that you attended?
Speaker 2: Stone High [School, Melbourne, Florida].
Speaker 1: Right, that's right, I'm sorry, you said one school.   And what were your experiences like at Stone High?  Were you active in any clubs or activities?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I just, my struggle was to get through school.  And I think, well, the one dream I had was going to the prom, and I did.  I was able to do that.
Speaker 1: What was that like?
Speaker 2: It was like, it was beautiful.  I had a new gown, new shoes, which my aunt and father purchased.  It was a very wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: And do you remember your prom date?
Speaker 2: My prom date is my husband [Raymond Tucker].  I met him and he was able to take me to the prom, with a lot of pleading from my father [Sylvester Kelsey].
Story_ID: 165911
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your teachers from [Stone] High School [Melbourne, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Mr. Borders [ph.], Mrs. Hill, Mr. Elkins, and Mr. Holmes.
Speaker 1: And what were some of your favorite subjects during high school?
Speaker 2: English, and homemaking, and history.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did you all do in the homemaking class?
Speaker 2: Well, we learned how to cook, to sew, and learned all kinds of--what is it--etiquettes, things like that.
Speaker 1: And what did you like best about homemaking?
Speaker 2: I think what I liked best was learning how to cook... the etiquettes.
Speaker 1: And what did you do in your spare time after high school when you weren't like caring for your siblings, or studying?  What kinds of things did you enjoy doing during your spare time?
Speaker 2: I guess I enjoyed talking with my friend [Betty Lou Thompson (ph.)].  And we would share our fantasies and what we wanted to do when we grew up, and that was a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 165912
Speaker 1: During high school, what were some of your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: Well, during high school and with our financial situation, I always wanted to go to college.  But I knew financially, my father [Sylvester Kelsey] was not going to be able to.  So--and I know he wanted to, so I never really pressed the issue about it.
Speaker 1: So, what were you thinking you were going to do with your life after high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I was thinking that I would work and go to a junior college and work my way through school.
Speaker 1: And, but then you met your husband [Raymond Tucker]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And how did you meet?
Speaker 2: Well, I met... my friend, Betty Lou [Thompson], and I were walking one day, and we met.  Anyway, they passed by, and we were walking towards the church.  And they got out and introduced themselves.  And from then on, my husband was very persistent.
Speaker 1: And he was a soldier?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was in the Air Force.
Speaker 1: So, was he stationed--
Speaker 2: He was stationed there at Cape Canaveral in Coco Beach, Florida, about twenty minutes from Melbourne [Florida].
Speaker 1: And was it uncommon--did a lot of soldiers come through Melbourne?
Speaker 2: Yes, but it was--a lot of them did come through.  Melbourne was a larger area city... so, from where they were stationed.
Speaker 1: So, you got married?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what did you do after you got married?
Speaker 2: Well, after I got married, I had my first child [Raymond Tucker, Jr.].  And my dreams were still there, about one day fulfilling them; I never gave up on them.  And we had a family of four, but I still had the dreams.  But at that time, I knew that we--that we had to work for our children to make sure that they got the things that we--that I didn't get.  And I was, I fought very hard for education for them.
Story_ID: 165913
Speaker 1: So, when you married your husband [Raymond Tucker], were you prepared for the life ahead--the, you know, the traveling and moving around?  How did you prepare for that?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't prepared for it.  I had never been out of the state of Florida until I met my husband.  And it was just an overwhelming, wonderful situation where I could travel, you know, all over the world.  And I wasn't used to that, so it was something new, and a different experience for me.
Speaker 1: What were some of the places that you enjoyed living, like were very different and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Okinawa [Japan] was very nice.  I was able to really have someone to come in and really help with my children.  It was just very wonderful.  And the people, we lived downtown with the people.  And Greece was a wonderful experience, too.  And we were, we lived downtown with the Greeks also.  So, those were different experiences.  We, they didn't have housing, so they had provided areas where the families could live.  And those were real high times.
Speaker 1: And, so what were some of the things that you were doing with your life?  Had you kind of resigned yourself to being a military wife?  Or what were some of your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: No.  I knew there were things that I wanted to do.  So, I always tried to do something educational.  I joined the Military Wives Club, which they had a lot of resources for the wives.  And I was always looking to--although I knew that my education and all that had to be on hold--so I took advantage of all the kind of things I could learn and do.
Speaker 1: And, so you were a homemaker from 1963 until 1978?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 165914
Speaker 1: In 1978, you went to work at Merchant's Bank in Richmond, Virginia?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about that, and what you were doing there?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked in the loan processing finance department.  And it was a wonderful experience, because I got to meet people, work with people.  And it was a job where I felt that I was helping people.  So, I enjoyed that.  And I knew then that... I kept praying that... I knew that I would not become a nurse at that time, but I knew that I hadn't given up.  I enjoyed the work.
Story_ID: 165915
Speaker 1: When did you first become involved in civil rights issues?
Speaker 2: Well, I first became involved even when I was a teenager at home.  Really, we spoke out, but my father [Sylvester Kelsey] at those times were afraid that--because when you did speak out in those days you were--your life could be taken, a lot of things could happen to you; he knew that.  But I think the first picket, as you would call it in those days, was at a drugstore.  And we all went up... because we couldn't go through the front door.  And we were marching and protesting.  But that was soon over, because the adults urged us not to, and we were obedient.  We didn't want to be, but we had to.
Speaker 1: What were some of your thoughts about what was taking place in the Civil Rights Movement in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Well, in the '60s [1960s] I knew that there arose a great leader, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr.  But in the '60s [1960s], everywhere, I think African Americans were speaking out more... and where they saw that racism was very high.  It was just something about it, you had to speak out.  And I thought that in the '60s [1960s] was a time of turning for African Americans in this country--that it was more issues being raised, more people protesting and really speaking out on the issues of what was being done, that was just blatantly wrong.
Speaker 1: And a lot of the racism that was taking place in the country, was it existent in the military as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was there, and even with the--I can experience even going to the PX [military post exchange], and things like that.  It was a lot of racism there.
Speaker 1: What would happen?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that you were African American, you were...  If you were in line, if a white person came up, they would say, "Next, please."  If you went up, they would say "No, I'm talking about this person."  And you didn't want to fight it, because you knew that your husband would get in trouble.  So, racism was there.
Story_ID: 165916
Speaker 1: What kinds of changes were taking place, religious-wise within you?
Speaker 2: Well, I think all my life I'd been taught the basics--that only God can change things, and to trust in him.  And it was a deep desire--the more that I trusted and believed in God, my spirituality just became really empowered me... that I needed to do something, or something was calling me to do for me to be or to do.
Speaker 1: So, can you--so after you worked at First Merchants Bank in Richmond in 1983, you then went to work at John Randolph Hospital.  How did that opportunity come about?
Speaker 2: Well, that opportunity came about--I saw that--I was looking for--I had wanted to get back closer, and I was looking in the wanted ads.  And I saw that they needed a position for a credit representative.  And I applied, and the manager that interviewed me, liked my experience.  And I was called the next day, if I wanted the job I could have it.

Speaker 1: In the late '70s [1970s], you became active in SCLC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  And what drew you to SCLC, and what were some of the kinds of things that you were doing with SCLC?
Speaker 2: Well, what drew me to that is I just saw a lot of injustice being done everywhere.  And I just felt I needed to do something.  I needed to be a part of trying to help those that couldn't help themselves--a voice for those that couldn't speak or didn't know how to speak, and strength for those that were weak.  So, I knew that I needed to do something, maybe to work in an organization and try to make a difference for others.
Speaker 1: And what was SCLC like?  What was, like, the structure like?  And what was it like back in the late seventies?
Speaker 2: I think that in the late '70s [1970s], there was a deeper commitment with men and women that just were tired.  And I think they had the--I think they had the Rosa Parks' mentality, that I'm just tired; I'm not going to go to the back of the bus anymore.  And going to the back of the bus didn't mean going to the back of the bus.  It means that you need to be treated equal; you deserve that; that's the way it's supposed to be.
Speaker 1: In the early eighties [1980s], were you involved with some of the protests on Fort Lee, Virginia with the SCLC?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact, there were only twelve persons that were... that really marched in that protest.  There were many people in Fort Lee that were being discriminated against.  But when it came time to march, they felt they would lose their jobs, and so they sort of reneged.  And in that march, in fact, my husband [Raymond Tucker] and I were in that march together.  And we thought about it as we went up to the--marched up to the gate at Fort Lee.  And there were young soldiers with guns, saying that we would not come on base.  And we thought about it.  We had four children at home, but we were both were marching for other people that would not participate.  So that was kind of frightening and hard, but we had made a commitment to do that.  And at that time, the general on Fort Lee made a decision just as we got ready to enter into... on post, to let us in.  So, we were able to go in and talk with the general and negotiate.
Speaker 1: And what were the protests about at Fort Lee?  You said people were being discriminated against.  What was the discrimination about?
Speaker 2: The discrimination was about there were white Americans that just had a high school education, and some did not.  And they were being promoted, while African Americans had bachelor's and master's degrees; they were qualified.  But because they were African Americans, they were not being promoted.  And it was just very blatant, what was going on.

Speaker 1: Tell us about the Miss SCLC pageant that you spearheaded with the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I'm the founder of the SCLC pageant.  I thought that that would be a way of raising money to keep the SCLC office open, and to do, be able to pay a staff person to really get out and work and do things.  And that was very successful.  In fact, we raised $20,000 at the first convention with the Miss SCLC contest.  And we were able to open up an SCLC office in Hopewell [Virginia] and hire a staff person.
Speaker 1: And what was the Miss SCLC pageant?
Speaker 2: Where was it?
Speaker 1: What was it?
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: How would you describe it?
Speaker 2: Well, what it was--we had women, young ladies, and it was like a pageant.  But the winner, the one that had the most amount of finance was the winner.  And we talked about the young ladies--some history of who they were and what they did.  They wore gowns, and it was sort of on the same lines of Miss America pageant.
Story_ID: 165919
Speaker 1: In 1982, you decided to go back to college?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Why did you wait so long?
Speaker 2: Because I had to wait until my children were out of college, and to make sure that they were academically sound before I pursued my career.
Speaker 1: And what was that like?  And you went to the University of Lynchburg Seminary [sic, Virginia University of Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Why did you decide to study theology?
Speaker 2: Because I knew that it was something that was a force that was within me.  And the more that I resisted, the more it had overpowered me.  And I wanted to be academically prepared, to have the right credentials.  And I kept thinking about the hospital setting, and it kept coming to mind, and it finally became a dream.
Speaker 1: So what was it, like going back to college?  Was it all that you had expected?
Speaker 2: Well, it was difficult because of my age, and because I had not been in a college setting.  But I adjusted very well, because I was determined.
Speaker 1: And you were working full-time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And we were also talking a little bit about why you decided to pursue a degree in theology.
Speaker 2: Because of the force that I was dealing with, and I really wanted to be academically prepared.
Speaker 1: So, but why theology?  Why did you give up the dream of nursing?
Speaker 2: Because there's something that... we don't always make those decisions.  A higher being... persuasion.  But I felt that I wanted to be able to work in health care and have a ministry there.
Speaker 1: And so, what were you thinking that you were going to... so you were thinking that you were going to do something in health care?
Speaker 2: Yes, visiting the sick and just being a comforter.
Story_ID: 165920
Speaker 1: --While you were at John Randolph [Medical Center, Hopewell, Virginia] and you were pursuing your degree in theology, how did the opportunity in pastoral care come about?
Speaker 2: The opportunity came about with the hospital being sold to HCA [Hospital Corporation of America].  And one of the things that HCA... really the way that it's pastoral care... because they believe that the spiritual part plays a great deal of healing.  And all of their hospitals throughout the country have full-time paid chaplains and directors of pastoral care.
Speaker 1: And so, you were talking about how the opportunity at John Randolph came about.
Speaker 2: Right.  One of the things that was very unique at John Randolph... I had been working there for quite some time and going to school.  And I had been doing a lot of speaking, but not only that, but had a great rapport with staff.  And when the opportunity came--
Speaker 1: So, you were saying you had established a rapport with the staff at John Randolph and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: And while I was in school--and when I was licensed to be a minister, I also signed up to be a volunteer chaplain there.  So, I had the experience of working with the staff, especially with families and patients.  And our CEO there, he saw that... my work.  So, they already knew me as a spiritual person.
Speaker 1: And so did they tell you that, you know, they were creating this position?  What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I found out that they were creating this position.  And I remember one of the chaplains recommending me, and also the CEO.  When I put in the application--when I filled in the application, I wrote a letter, a resume, of why I thought that I would be good for this position.  And they were impressed with that, and they hired me.
Speaker 1: And what did your responsibilities and duties include?
Speaker 2: Really, a full-time chaplain.  You're really a pastor to those that have no pastors.  I do, I pray for patients that request prayer.  I funeralize patients that have--if the family requests it, and they have no pastors.  It includes marrying persons.  I married so many of the staff there--counseling staff and patients' families.  It's just being a full-time pastor, but on a short term.
Story_ID: 165921
Speaker 1: You are the first female African American hospital chaplain in Virginia.  Why do you think there are so few African American hospital chaplains?
Speaker 2: I think that it's something that African Americans even are not pursuing, because that field has not been open to them, and it's something that is new.  And I think that more female African Americans are pursuing that now.  Because I guess in the past you could have applied, but you would not have received it.  This type of position is usually for white males, but the barriers have been broken through HCA [Hospital Corporation of America].
Speaker 1: And for a lot of African American chaplains, are they more in the industry of, like, corrections and the military?
Speaker 2: Yes, they are.  And, but I think that it's changing now more so than ever, because they are really pursuing it, especially women.
Story_ID: 165922
Speaker 1: Did you still continue to be active in SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: And you were actually appointed the--Can you tell us a little bit about your activities at SCLC?
Speaker 2: Well, we're constantly dealing with issues dealing with discrimination and racism.  And I became, I was put on the national board of SCLC, which at that time was a really new experience, to be able to work nationally.  And it's a never-ending kind of era for us.
Speaker 1: What are your responsibilities as the chaplain of the national board?
Speaker 2: My responsibility is to open up, you know, with prayer and to constantly deal with the religious part of our national program.
Speaker 1: And what's the religious component of the program?
Speaker 2: Well, we, for instance with our national convention, when we recruit pastors all over to do--we have a Sunday, an SCLC national Sunday--where from all over the nation we have different pastors to go in and do worship services on that Sunday.  When we have functions during our national convention invocations, the prayers and the blessings, I have to coordinate that with different ministers.
Speaker 1: And you were the first woman to hold this position with SCLC?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And it was, it was different.  Because that was something that sometime African American men are not willing to deal with, with women.
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: Sometime in leadership with women, and in any areas--area, sometime that's a resistant.  But I think that most of them have overcome that.
Story_ID: 165923
Speaker 1: So we were talking a little bit about--can you talk a little bit about if there's a lot of resistance to African American women in the ministry?
Speaker 2: Yes, there is.  I find a lot of resistance from African American men that are in the ministry.  And sadly to say, that has been a real down for me, because of the acceptance--and the roadblocks that have been put in my way because I am a woman, African American.
Speaker 1: Why do you think there is resistance?
Speaker 2: Because African American women that are in the ministry are trained.  And before they really, really go into the ministry, they really are seeking to be educated and go to the seminary.  And this is the thing that--and they're well-equipped.  So, I think that's one of the reasons.  And it might be that, from the old kind of school, that you do not accept women in certain professions.
Speaker 1: And through the years, do you think that it's gotten better, it's gotten worse, or it's stayed about the same?
Speaker 2: Well, to be honest, I don't think I see any difference.  I think it's the same.  I think there are a, still a lot of resistance out there.  And you have the myth of why women shouldn't be ministers.  And this is the thing that takes a lot of education and training for some, you know, people.
Story_ID: 165924
Speaker 1: And do you ever wish that you, like, pastored your own church opposed to what you do at the hospital as a chaplain?
Speaker 2: No, because I believe that God ordained me for this kind of ministry, because it's a special kind of ministry.  I've had co-laborers in the ministry to tell me that I couldn't do that all day--I couldn't deal with death and dying and sickness and all kinds of situations all day--where I'd deal with it all day.  God has special people to do that.  I think you have to be a special kind of person to be a chaplain.  Where if you're a pastor, you may deal with a funeral maybe twice a year, or somebody dying.  But I deal with it every day.  And I thank God for allowing me to serve in this, and giving me the kind of courage. When you see it day in and day out, you do--you may make get--what is it--stressed out or overwhelmed.  But God always gives you the strength to go back.  And I love caring for people, and I think that this is the best kind of pastorship, and I wouldn't trade it.
Story_ID: 165925
Speaker 1: And can you kind of tell us about some of the more difficult days you've had?  Some, you know, what has been like one of your most difficult days, or difficult situations that you've had to deal with as chaplain of a hospital?
Speaker 2: I think, and I think that's where most of us--dealing with children, even if it's an accident.  But more severe, for me, is dealing with abuse--when a child comes in and their life is gone because of abuse--where I feel it's senseless.  And that, that's hard.  You just can't--it kind of takes a while to move from that with children, dealing with their death, and dying.  I think the hardest situation is sometimes when I'm in a situation where I'm in an emergency room, and two or three people are critical or dying, and you've got to deal with those families.  And those are very difficult days.
Story_ID: 165926
Speaker 1: And generally, how does it work?  So you come into work, and if someone's very ill, what happens?  You know, how does it work?  How do you get notified?  How does it work?
Speaker 2: Well, we go--our program [at John Randolph Medical Center in Hopewell, Virginia], we go by referrals.  And usually when a patient is admitted to the hospital, they have a form, "Would you like a chaplain's visit?"  And usually the patient says yes.  And I get my referrals from the computer that I check every day.  But that's not an ordinary day for me.  Because the ER [emergency room] will bring in--if somebody has been in an accident and they have been seriously hurt, they'll call for a chaplain to come down and be with the family.  Or if somebody comes in that's dying, or if a patient's up in ICU [intensive care unit] or on the floor, we respond to all code blues.  And code blues are when a patient is in cardiac or any kind of critical situation.  So, it's non-stop.  You never know how your day is going to be.  A patient may come in for out-patient surgery, and that patient may have some kind of problems during surgery, and a chaplain is called in.  So, I never know how the day is going to go.  But of those are--as I said, children are very hard for me.
Story_ID: 165927
Speaker 1: Can you tell us or share some stories, specific, about, you know, incidences or cases of abuse?
Speaker 2: Due to the privacy act, you know, I can't really go into any detail.  But I have had to deal with a child being--children, you know, being abused.  But the hardest part as a chaplain, I have to deal with that family.  The abuser, I have to be there for them spiritually.  And I know one incident... even when someone has hurt someone else, they may say I want to see a chaplain, and I have be there for them, too.  So, it can be very trying.  It can be a very difficult situation at times.
Speaker 1: Have you ever refused?
Speaker 2: No.  And I, I could not refuse even the worse... a person that calls or needs my help.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Because my oath to God is that I must minister to all people.  There is no set rule for those that are good or those that are bad.  All people, no matter what color, race or religion, I have to be there for them if they call for me.
Speaker 1: And do you ever get the opportunity to deliver good news to families?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  There, there are times when you go into a difficult situation.  And then even... if you have a prayer with the families... loved ones.  And miraculously, God will change the situation.  They will say, "Well, Chaplain Tucker, oh, he's better," or "She's better, thank you for that prayer."  But instantly, I have to remind them that it wasn't me, it was from God working through me.  So, that's good news.  It's good news to be able to tell a family member that, oh, the news is not as dreary as it is, that this patient's going to be okay.  So, there are a lot of really good times.
Story_ID: 165928
Speaker 1: And what advice or suggestions do you have for those who are interested in a career in, like, hospital ministry?
Speaker 2: I think the advice I would give is first that it's... you have to really have a caring, kind spirit.  And it's something that you want to do--you love people, all people.  And it's not an easy task.  But if it's something that you really commit... you have to be committed to it.  And my advice would be to try it.  The reward is just so great in this kind of work.  It's the reward, it's not pay or money or... but it's just where someone can see you in a restaurant and say, "Chaplain," whether it's me or anyone, "I really thank you for that prayer you did for my family.  I really thank you for just being there, your presence."  So that's priceless.
Speaker 1: Do you think you would have ever chosen a different career path?
Speaker 2: No, no, because I'm just so committed to what I do.
Speaker 1: But if you could have, do you think that it probably would have been nursing?
Speaker 2: It probably would have been.  But I know that wasn't for me now.
Story_ID: 165929
Speaker 1: And what do you still want to do that you haven't done already?
Speaker 2: I think what I'd like to do that I haven't done is to travel to a country that I've always wanted to go to, and that's Africa.  But more than--I'd like to go South Africa where--just to be on the same land and soil that Mandela, Nelson Mandela--because he's one of my greatest heroes.
Speaker 1: And why do you admire him so much?
Speaker 2: I admire him so much because any time that a man can stand up for what he believes in, his principles, for twenty-seven years, and the same government that imprisoned him, he can--God can, just through him turn him into leading that country.  So, that's a remarkable person.
Story_ID: 165930
Speaker 1: Do you think that the church nowadays is doing a good job of taking care of the people--you know, its congregation--like feeding the hungry and caring for the sick and clothing the naked, that kind of thing?  Do you think that the... how do you think the church's role has changed over the years?
Speaker 2: Well, and that question, to give you an honest reply--no, it's not anywhere near to what it used to be.  I think now the church is sort of turning into a social club.  Those that do not have... it's the conscience.  And I think it is religion, but it's not Christianity.  And until the churches come back to Christianity--to really caring for those--and really from the pastors of the churches on down to the members.  It's more into the money-making and the appearance.  And there are so many people... but the church is really a hospital, and it should be for persons getting well.  And what I mean by a hospital, I'm talking about sin.  In the church, the pastor can be in ICU and not know it, or, in the emergency room.  Because anytime you have persons in your church that are hungry--no one should be hungry in church.  No one's lights should not be paid, if you can afford to pay them.  So it's something that I think we need to take a closer look at, because I feel that the Lord is looking at that.  It's a place of fashions, a place of--where the least of them are not counted.
Story_ID: 165931
Speaker 1: You know, as someone who went to segregated schools, this year we celebrate the 50th year anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education [of Topeka, 1954], essentially de-segregating schools and integrating schools.  What are some of your thoughts about Brown v. the Board of Education?  Do you think that African American children are getting the education that they deserve today?
Speaker 2: No, and it's very plain.  And it's always that role that the parents... the parents have to play a role.  But I do believe that the educators that are in the school system need to be committed.  And our children, African American children, are falling through the cracks because of the kind of counseling that they're getting.  A lot of our children are graduating, not with diplomas, but with just attendance, and I see it every day.  African Americans are graduating from--not graduating--but the diploma of attendance... I may not have that correct, but--
Speaker 1: They're getting, in Virginia, some students are getting certificates.
Speaker 2: Certificates is the word.
Speaker 1: Instead of diplomas.
Speaker 2: Certificates, and they can't even read.  And I just don't feel that that is [not] all our children's fault.  Because you take, to me, an oath when you say I'm going to teach, and you should do that.  And discipline that they're having problems with in the school system could be coming from racism, too.  Because you rebel... and I think... I don't see... I see a very challenged time for our people, African American young people.  And we have African American teachers that are not really coming up to their plate, too.  They have the feeling that "I've got mine; you should be able to get yours."  But that's not always the case.  I think you should--when you get yours, you should always be willing to reach down to bring others up.
Story_ID: 165932
Speaker 1: What are some of your thoughts about--we are a few weeks away from an election--in terms of African American voter turnout, that kind of thing.  What are some of your thoughts there?
Speaker 2: My thoughts are, I really feel very sad.  I do, because I think the mentality is still there, where my vote doesn't count.  Well, so many of our, so many African Americans died so that African Americans could vote.  I think that it's really sad to even imagine that African Americans that are educated, and who really have success do not vote.  I was very shocked and shaken when I just was talking to a couple that were really very professional people.  And I asked them if they were going to vote.  And they said they didn't vote, they weren't registered.  And if we--even today with this election, if we lose this election and some things are not other's fault; it's our fault.
Speaker 1: And do you think that the church--you know, the church once played a very vital role, in terms of educating people about voting rights and that kind of thing.  Do you think the church is still doing, playing that role?  Or do you think they can do a better job?
Speaker 2: I think they can do a better job.  Because I really don't think it's about the people.  Because when you think about the churches doing a better job, the election should not have gone the way it had gone in Florida.  Why?  Because ministers felt that it was better to be in the pulpit that Sunday than taking their congregation to register to vote.  And those are some of the tragedies that I see.
Story_ID: 165933
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you have done already that you wish you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: In what respect?
Speaker 1: In any respect.  Anything that--any regrets in life?
Speaker 2: Well, I think about it now.  For me to have done anything differently, I wouldn't be where I'm at today.  I wouldn't have my children.  To have done it different, it may have changed some of the things.  So, I think that I may have a few regrets, but they're small.  I think life in general has just been overwhelmingly good to me through the grace of God.

Speaker 1: What are some of your thoughts about the Civil Rights Movement?  Are you happy that you participated in that, and that you were a part of that?  What are some of your thoughts?
Speaker 2: I'm very happy that I participated in the Civil Rights Movement.  But I become sad when I find some African Americans are on ego trips--it's not about people, it's about who's in charge; and if I can't be in charge, I just will mess the whole program up.  And I become sad when I see leaders fighting among themselves.  I wish that we could learn to have more unity and work together.  And if we did that as a people, there would be nothing in this nation that we could not change.

Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way that you've lived your life, and what's been most important to you?
Speaker 2: Well, the way I've lived my life, I think I've done the best of what I had.  I tried to do the best--I've always tried to do what was right.  And the things that are most important to me--and I think family, the work I do--but first and foremost is my commitment to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
Story_ID: 165936
Speaker 1: And what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: My hopes for the African American community is that I think that we need to--as I said earlier--the unity, to work together, to know that one affects one African American indirectly will affect us directly, all of us.  My hopes are that I can see when my grandchildren become adults that they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character--that if they're qualified that it won't be because of the color of their skin; it'll be because of who they really are.  We can't live in a color blind society; I don't believe that that will exist.  But I believe, I would hope that our people will take hold that they're a special people, to be proud of who they are--to know that they can dream, and those dreams can become a reality; that they can  become the president of the United States; that there is no, that nothing is unreachable.  But it first has to-first, the unity is just not there.
Story_ID: 165937
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to be remembered as a good mother.  I think when it's all said and done--and I see this every day of my life--that when it's the end for patients and it's their time to die, they don't say "I want to know what I did or how many awards I received, how much education, how much money I made."  But the last thing that want to know is... if it's a mother, "Is my child there?"  Or if it's a father, and I think that they want--leaving--how your children felt about you.  And I, and that's one of the--I think that's how I want to be remembered, as a good mother.  I try to be a good mother, a good grandmother.
Story_ID: 165938
Speaker 1: And what message or lesson do you have for your children and your grandchildren?
Speaker 2: That if I can have a family--and I had dreams, and you keep working for those dreams.  They may not come right in.  But if you really want these dreams, you never give up.  And to succeed... you can succeed to live good, but to always be a good citizen, do the right thing.  First and foremost, give your lives, give your lives to our Lord, and I believe that you can do or be anything.  But you have to always remember to treat... if you treat others good and do the right thing in life, those things will come back to you.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you want to add that maybe we didn't touch on?
Speaker 2: No.  I think my life--I'm just happy at this point in my life to be able to have, to see grandchildren, to have grandchildren.  Our God has blessed me.  I used to always pray that my children would grow up, and I could see them do well.  And now I'm praying for my grandchildren.  So, I'm just thankful for all of God's goodness, mercy, and grace to me.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
