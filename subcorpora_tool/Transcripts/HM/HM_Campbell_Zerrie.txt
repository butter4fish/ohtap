Speaker 2: Arkansas.  Yeah, Arkansas.
Story_ID: 17072
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about your grandparents.  Give me on each side the names of your grandparents.
Speaker 2: So fortunate to have known all of them.  My maternal grandparents are Lorena L-O-R-E-N-A Hart H-A-R-T.  McDonald was her maiden name.  My maternal grandfather is Arzell Hart, also born in Chicago.  No, he was not born in Chicago.  He was born in Mississippi.  And I know that because of the connection to Emmett Till. So--and the date of his birth I do not know.
Speaker 1: And your grandmother was born here?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was born in Omaha, Nebraska. Thank you for that.  Omaha, Nebraska.  My paternal grandparents are Georgia and Hunnicut Huey.  Georgia--I was a great birthday present to her--I was born on her birthday February 9th [1917].  At the time of her death, she was sixty-eight years old.  And she passed in 1985.  Hunnicut Huey, I think in Michigan because of the connection in the families born in Michigan.  He passed about five years ago.  And at the time of his death, was close to--was in his seventies.
Speaker 1: Now did you say you were--you were your grandma's birthday?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I was her birthday present.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: So she was your favorite.  Right?
Speaker 2: Well, actually I knew so much love from both sides of my family that I have no favorite.  And that includes my aunts, my uncles my great-grandparents, I was fortunate to know.  I knew both my grandfathers and my grandmother's parents--mother's.  I have those very vivid memories of each side of them.  And we were shared between them when my parents divorced. When David [Lee Campbell] and Lorraine [Ardell Campbell Rice] divorced, Georgia Huey, who was David's mother, sat my mother down and insisted that we be a part of each other's lives.  And she always introduced my mother as her daughter-in-law and she introduced my stepfather [Robert Kelly Rice] as her son-in-law.  She was that kind of warm and loving person.  So that my sister [Beverly Campbell Jamison] and I would spend summers through our childhood through teenage with my father's side of the family . All holidays, all special occasions.  It just wasn't a division at all.
Speaker 1: That's great.  Now you say you knew both your great-grandparents and your grandparents. What is the difference in the way you related with them?
Speaker 2: Well my great grands--and they were pretty much up in age even at the time I knew them, were just absolutely doting.  Just doting.  The baking of the cakes, and the cookies and--I just have memories of being with them.  The smell of them even.  The keenness in their eyes.  The wisdom.  How watchful they were.  My grandmother--my maternal grandmother, of course, we spent a little more time with her, because she's my mother's mother--we called 'Mama'.  And I still miss her.  Indeed, I was the first person to be with her at the time of her passing.  And so I had some very private time with her.  My grandparents were a bit more--'cause my parents were young.  So my grandparents had a real hand in our development and the guidance that we received.
Speaker 1: Give me an idea what sticks out for you the most.  A grandparents story.
Speaker 2: A grandparents story.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) A grandparents story.  Your relationship with them.
Speaker 2: I remembers snuggling in the bosom.  That's what I remember most about Mama.  Snuggling in the bosom.  She--the song 'Grandma's Hands' [by Bill Withers], is so much her.  She was very much the big mama.  In fact, the grandmother on the television show 'Soul Food'--kind of tear up thinking about it--physically and in her presence reminded me very much of my grandmother.  She was such a baker.  You would nev-, she could have been very successful as a baker.  I remember that both of my grandmothers, 'M'dea' [Georgia Huey], was my father's mother was so particular.  They were so clean. These were--they were just absolutely pristine in the kitchen.  Their food when it was prepared looked so inviting.  That might be one reason why I chose to ate--eat so much. (laughs) It was just beautifully prepared.  And that's been passed on to my mother, my aunt.  The way we prepare food is just absolutely intriguing.  Everything's scratch.  My folks make--bake cakes from, you know, measuring a pinch of this and a pinch of that and some of--and I am absolutely appalled at myself that I have not mastered that art as they have.  My grandmother--my Mama to the end of her days was still ironing sheets, that she would launder.  Iron them and creases and pressing them. And a year before she died, one Christmas celebration--and we just do things in a big family way as you can imagine.  Her gift to me--and her gifts were always homemade gifts.  Her banana nut bread or her date nut bread or something that she made.  She crocheted a lot of things.  I still have things at home.  The 'Toiletpaper Johnny' and the little pin cushions.  She made a stool for Sydney [Adams], my daughter, when she was born, out of coffee cans. And then covered with some kind of foam.  And then a 'Winnie the Pooh' pattern.  It just looks like--it's the cutest little footstool.  We still have that.  That's what I remember most about my grandmother.  She was so hands on.  She developed arthritis in her later years.  But she may have been a little slower, but still provided that hand-made touch to things that she prepared.  So that Christmas, in a box--you know the box that greeting cards come in? I opened the box. There was a little pair of crocheted gloves and two little handkerchiefs that were mine when I was three or four years old.  That she had had--that she had kept and she gave them to me to pass on to my daughter.  I just absolutely lost it.  I just couldn't've imagined that she would hold on to and maintain and care for this delicate little item such as that.  I mean they're no longer--larger than my finger.  And when I think about it, I was just a mess.  Because it also in me some way signaled a transition was about to occur.  And she was giving away things that meant so much to her.  She had a deep contralto voice that just would rock the church in the choir.  And one day, very recently, as I (pauses). This is surprising me.  As I--I sing in the choir too.  Singing one of those good old church spirituals I could hear my grandmother.  I could actually hear her.  Her voice.  It may have been like 'The Old Rugged Cross' or something like that.  I had such peace, and felt such joy that I knew her and knew her so well.  My paternal grandmother for whom I'm named--and by the way, my grandparents were great friends.  Those two grandmothers were just were wonderful to each other.  My M'dea was real jazzy.  One of those pictures there you can get an idea of just a very snappy dresser.  Also a very, very immaculate person in her presentation and everything around her.  Another great cook. And her cake recipe to this day, is being used by my cousins.  Again, that may not have been one of my inherent talents.  I can cook.  I just don't have the time for it.  We'll put it that way.
Story_ID: 17073
Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well my favorite meat, red meat, really is barbecue ribs.  I really like barbecue ribs.  They're not good for me.  I know that.  And I've cut back quite a bit.  But macaroni and cheese, greens, vegetables.  I love vegetables.  I love vegetables.  Except carrots.  I never really developed a taste for carrots.  And Häagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream.  Not just any vanilla ice cream, and not just any ice cream.  Häagen-Dazs vanilla. It is just absolutely too rich for my system.
Speaker 1: And when you go on vacation, where's your favorite destination?
Speaker 2: Well, it used to be California.  Because my sister [Beverly Campbell Jamison] lived there for a while, and I would call that my California resort.  And I would go out and get away.  But now I like to cruise.  I've been on three cruises.  And I think everybody should every three, four, or five years go on a cruise.  It is just the most relaxing activity that I've ever engaged.
Speaker 1: I see.  And your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is any shade of purple.  Purple, lilac (pauses) any of those.  Magentas, all in that family.  The soft tones that bring me a bit of tranquility.  I also love red.  I looked and I have a lot of red.  I've developed--since I've been in my position, a fondness for black.  Aside from it being flattering, it is very functional.  So as you can see, I have many favorites in different categories.
Speaker 1: And what is your favorite saying?
Speaker 2: "Make it happen."
Speaker 1: How did you come to that?
Speaker 2: As we in life, personally, professionally, privately, come across many goals and objectives you want to attain, it's so easy to find a reason for it not to occur.  It's so easy to use any obstacle or barrier as something to distract us from the goal or to discourage us from pursuing it.  So I've develop a sense of learning how to move through things.  How to go around things using my spiritual base, as my motivation.  And as long as it's not illegal, immoral, or unethical and I believe we have a responsibility and an obligation to find a way to make it happen.
Story_ID: 17074
Speaker 1: Let's look at your growing up years.  What was it like in the Campbell household?
Speaker 2: (Laughs) I remember just having--just been--just being happy.  Being joyful.  My parents [Robert Kelly Rice and Lorraine Ardell Campbell Rice], my mother in particular, worked every day of her life that I knew.  Until they retired.  So I thought that's how all families functioned.  The weekends were family time.  We always--my parents always found places for us to go, things for us to do, picnics.  Going to Riverview [Amusement Park, Chicago, Illinois]. (laughs) The zoo. Just family.  We were so family-oriented.  And since I had three families, three sides of the family, there was always some family activity happening.  In my family, we make a big deal out of special occasions.  And we go all out.  We used to dress up for them.  It's a big meal. An occasion for a big meal.  When I saw the movie 'Soul Food' by myself, I went back and I gathered my mother, my father, my sister [Beverly Campbell Jamison], one of my cousins.  And I took them all to the movie.  I said, "We have to go see this." It is just so reminiscent of my family life. And I just made such a big deal out of it.  I'm sure the movie never reached the level of excitement that I had built for it.  But I just wanted us all to see it.  And we tend to do a lot of that together.  Whatever we do, we let folks know what's happening.  And we come along and we do it.  Now not exclusively.  And we all have circles to be sure.  But I just remember making sure I did all, my chores.  'Cause we had an allowance that we received.  But we had our work that we had to do, so that the weekend would be free and available for us to do what we had to do.  'Cause my mother--my parents were also disciplinarians.  They were not abusers, but they were disciplinarians.  They did not spare the rod. (laughs) When I think of it, we turned out okay for it.  But family dinners, I remember sitting down at the table having dinner.  It was dinner time.  And having to drink milk every day too.  I didn't like milk.  So I would sneak and when we cleaned up the table and drink out the grown-ups cups, Kool-Aid or punch. (laughs) I remember my mom--and this she got from her parents and grandparents.  There was always dessert in the house.  Always something sweet.  Something--a feel good kind of thing.  And again, I don't know psychologically what that means for us in our later years, and as we struggle with obesity.  But it was a happy, nurturing time. I remember a lot of laughter.  My parents used to entertain. I was the kid who would peek out the door while the adults were having their party.  I saw a lot of stuff. (laughs) I just revealed to my parents a memory I had from a party that they had.  They too were--were had--were such good people and had good friends that it modeled the behavior for me and for my sister to value people and friendships.  So it was--it was good.  I remember going back and forth to the West Side of Chicago.  Now we originally started on the west side.  Then we moved.  And that's when my M'dea [Georgia Huey] and my other side of the family--my father's [David Lee Campbell] side of the family was on the West Side.  In those days, that seemed like it was just a great divide.  I mean it was a long distance from the South Side to the West Side.  So my west side family would come and get us and bring us over, and because it seemed like such a distance, it was never just overnight.  It was always for a week--a holiday or a spring break for the summer or whatever.  So my memories of the family are so--I just love my family.  All quarters of my family.  And hoped that I passed that on to my daughter [Sydney Adams].
Story_ID: 17075
Speaker 1: Are you the oldest?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not.
Speaker 1: Oh you're the baby.
Speaker 2: Interestingly I am the youngest. But my sister [Beverly Campbell Jamison] is the baby.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: You understand now.
Speaker 1: You're the leader.  You're the take-charge baby.
Speaker 2: Well I'm--let's just say she was the first grandchild on all--on both sides of the family. And she was--he had that 'Lap Time', as [Dr.] Frances Cress Welsing calls it for a full two--two and a half years.  So she was treated like a princess.  And we call her to this day 'Diva'. (laughs) If you look at the pictures I think that will be very clear.
Speaker 1: So when you came along, you--did some of it flow off on you?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Sure.  There's enough to go around.  Interesting, on my father's [David Lee Campbell] side of the family there are eleven grandchildren.  Eleven of us.  We used to spend summers together in Michigan at my aunt's summer home.  Can you imagine that? In the 1950s we were colored children go to a summer home.  I guess we--I guess we--it's a farm.  Today we call it a summer home.  So we would do that.  And on the--my mother's [Lorraine Ardell Campbell Rice] side of the family, while there were six of us.  So we were still very close knit on both sides.  But Beverly is the oldest of the whole group.  My great-grandmother, 'Mama Lizzie' used to call us by number.  She couldn't remember--"Number one." She'd have us lined up.  "Number two, Number three."  I was Number four (laughs).  So she was--Beverly and she's a very smart woman. Very bright.  You know, that IQ [intelligence quotient] stuff.  Just almost too smart for herself.  And very wise.  And with such a kind heart.  So even in her own indulgence she's just a delight.
Speaker 1: What does she (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) But she was the first girl.  Excuse me. She was the first girl.  The only girl for a long time.  Because number two and number three were boys.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you and your sister and the other two grandchildren your grandmother had were boys.  So she had like two--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The first four of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the others came and it ended up being eleven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What does your sister do today?
Speaker 1: What did she do with that?
Speaker 2: What does she do? Career-wise?
Speaker 1: Oh.  She is a--now see I--She's in technology.  She's--oh gosh!  I don't know all those terms.  But she does programs. And she was one of the first African American females in the new age of technology back in--I guess it was about '69 [1969], '70 [1970].  There was a new--technology was on the cutting edge.  And there was a special program that was developed by the city [of Chicago, Illinois].  People from around the city had to test to be in this pilot program.  She tested in the top ten percent.  And they took all of these folks for a six-month training.  I believe it was for a six-month training in Schaumburg [Illinois] or somewhere.  And they received the training, came back.  She ended up being the programmer for the City of Chicago Police Department.  She moved to California and was one of the first managers--she was making fifty, sixty-thousand dollars back when that was equivalent of a hundred thousand dollars or a hundred-fifty thousand dollars. She stepped out in that corporate world.  But she's such a free spirit that eventually, she just withdrew from it.  And she went to school and became a nail technician. (laughs) She opened her own shop.  About drove my mother nuts!  But being how we do things, helped her set up her shop.  She had a--I'm sorry, it's not a shop.  Her salon in the--what's that building on Wabash [Avenue] and--Wabash and Washington [Street]? Pittsfield Building [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Pittsfield Building.
Speaker 1: She did that for about two years 'til she got that out of her system.  And now she's back in the corporate world. (laughs)
Story_ID: 17076
Speaker 1: Let's go back to the school years when you were taking off for school, first grade, kindergarten, first grade.  Second grade.  Did you have a delightful elementary school unclear)?
Speaker 2: It so amazing that I remember kindergarten. I attended Lucy Flower [Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois] when it was an elementary school.  Now is that dating me or what? Many people don't even remember that it was an elementary school.  And I remember my kindergarten teacher Mrs. Kim. No, Miss Kim.  She was--she couldn't've been more than twenty-two, twenty-three when I look back on it.  Just the nicest lady.  I remember sitting on that floor.  I never did understand why we had to sit on the floor (laughs) in kindergarten. But we did.  And those were half days.  They were half days then.  My mother [Lorraine Ardell Campbell Rice] worked days and my dad [Robert Kelly Rice] worked evenings.  So we were able to have a parent home.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).  So Mrs. [sic, Miss] Kim.  Do any of your other teachers stand out? At elementary level?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Elementary, let's see, (pauses) after Flower transitioned, then I attended [Jacob] Beidler [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  And  I don't remember the teachers there.  I do remember the schools seeming so huge.  So cavernous to me.  And all of the schools did.  And, of course, their not as--not nearly as large as they appeared.  But I remember all of our classes were integrated.  We had friends across the spectrum.
Story_ID: 17077
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I went to Beidler through third grade. 3316 West Carroll [Avenue] was our address. (laughs)
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I went to Beidler through third grade.  And that's when my parents Lorraine [Ardell Campbell Rice] and [Robert] Kelly [Rice] had a separation.  There were some marital difficulties.  And I'm not even sure what they were.  But they separated.  And my mom then moved to the South Side.  That right?--No. We went to live with my uncle and my aunt, Elmer and Lulabelle Hart.  These were my grandfather's--this is my grandfather's brother. 4617 South Champlain--South Evans [Avenue].  4617 South Evans.  So for one years I attended Forrestville [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] while my parents were working out their difficulties.  And, you know, thank God, they did reconcile.  And have now been together about--almost forty--a little over forty-five years.  Because we're planning a big fiftieth anniversary for them.  And that's when they decided to move south.  And we move to 75--75-- I can't remember it.  But 75th and Vernon. 7547 S. Vernon [Avenue]. (pauses) And that's my last elementary school was Ruggles, Martha Ruggles Elementary School on 78th and Prairie [Avenue].
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a very good student. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I was on the honor roll  a couple of times.  Not all the time.  But I was a very good student.  In fact, there were four eighth grade classes.  And they were--I look back at it now and realize that they were grouped according to academic ability and age.  And I was in the number one room.  The class has had a lot of very successful students come from there. Douglas Sengstacke comes--Junior was of that class, one of the Sengstacke heirs.  Several other very successful people in business and education came from that class.  Martha Ruggles was a great school at that time.  You asked about teachers who made an impression on me.  Lucy McKinzie was our eighth grade teacher.  And you know something? The teachers in those days lived in the neighborhood.  They lived in walking distance of the school.  So we may see them when we were riding our bikes on Saturdays, in the grocery store or walking down the street.  And they assumed that posture.  Boy, do I miss the days when we treated our elders and role models with that degree of respect.  And I find that I, I use a lot of those values myself.  And some of my expectations and indeed, the way I interact with young people is based on those models that I had.
Story_ID: 17078
Speaker 1: Well we were just talking about your natural leadership style and the people who impacted that role.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: First being your mother [Lorraine Ardell Campbell Rice] but the teachers mentioned--.
Speaker 2: In, in--at [Martha] Ruggles [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] Lucy McKinzie--Lucille McKinzie.  In fact, she lived right around the corner from the school.  And I mentioned too how much we valued the teachers who lived in the community.  Reggie Brown was our eighth grade science teacher.  He had a graduating class as well--formally principal of CVS [Chicago Vocational High School] I believe.  And I think he's at South Shore [High School]--was at South Shore.  Pardon me.  Our music teacher--Gosh! I've forgotten her name lived around the corner as well.
Speaker 1: Do you play an instrument?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  And it's all my fault.  Because my mother did spend years with piano lessons. Bought a piano, made the sacrifice.  And my sister [Beverly Campbell Jamison] was more attentive than I.  But neither of us reached potential.  And I regret that.  There's a certain discipline in children who play an instrument.  And also there's some analytical skills that are sharpened by being involved in music.  And so I do regret that.
Story_ID: 17079
Speaker 1: Middle school and high school--highlights.
Speaker 2: (Laughs).  I think in eighth grade I had such an array of friends.  See I was a transfer.  Most of those children had grown up together.  They were from the Chatham neighborhood [Chicago, Illinois].  I had, remember, lived on the West Side.  And we moved in fifth grade--when I was in fifth grade.  And that's when Miss Whitney was my fifth grade teacher.  And she saw something in my preparation or in my ability or in my aptitude.  And I was given a double.  I skipped six grade and moved to seventh grade.  And I was a part of that group that I mentioned to you where they were--who were kind of place in our classes based upon our academic performance, test scores and our ages.  And I was placed in that top class.  From which a lot of very successful people have come.  It's a great school.  Great neighborhood. So I'm just very pleased that I was blessed with the kind of social skills that allowed me to penetrate already-formed alliances and cliques and groups and so on.  And was received and welcomed very warmly.  Interestingly, my mother [Lorraine Ardell Campbell Rice], on the other hand, was not. It didn't daunt her, but my mother was younger than most of the others who were professionals in Chatham and who had--and were everything that comes along with that perception.  And my mother was not a professional.  She didn't have a degree.  She was not a teacher.  She and a couple of other mothers were not welcomed as warmly as they should have been.  And this was a time when parents--and that Chatham community at that time, very involved with the children.  Very involved with the school.  PTA [Parent Teacher Association] this, and chaperone that, part-time--not part-time, but involved in schools.  And as with most groups, you know, we've got X's and O's.  And we X's maybe all one category and off scattered doing our own thing.  As soon as someone who is different from us comes, being the O, then we all come together and make our group hard to penetrate, with no matter our differences.  And my mother was a particular kind of O.  Very attractive, younger, very confident, not at all daunted by her lack of professional credentialing.  But my mother attended Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois] for three years. Night school.  She just never completed the degree.  There was never any question of her aptitude or her ability.  She could've been so many successful things.  She could have been a successful accountant.  She's just taking on First National Bank--not first.  First--what is it called?  Bank One, now for clearing up something on her record that was placed there in error.  But she's not one just to kind of, "Oh well."  She's gonna resolve that matter in her favor.  But notwithstanding that, by the time  it was all over she, of course, was respected and admired as she should have been all along.  And did not suffer from the same kinds of social ills that many of them indeed where in their treatment of people who were not from that group.  I'm very proud of my mother, as you can see.  I just adore her.
Story_ID: 17080
Speaker 1: High school--.
Speaker 2: High school, then (pauses) we moved from 76th [Street] and Vernon [Avenue].  Did I say 75 or--76th and Vernon to 75th and Indiana [Avenue]--7549 South Indiana.  Well when  we crossed 75th Street, that took us one block out of the district for [Emil G. ] Hirsch High School.  Which is where I began my high school career.  May have been the best thing that ever happened to me.  Because I had to leave Hirsch.  At that time, you know, Hirsch was one of the coveted schools.  A lot of activity involvement, good academic program.  But I had to transfer.  Anyone who was less than a sophomore had to transfer to the school in his or her area.  And that for me, was [Francis W.] Parker High School [later Francis W. Parker Community Academy, Chicago, Illinois].  Now Parker High School was on 68th  and Stewart [Avenue].  That's where Chicago State [University] was at the time. That's where now Paul Robeson High School is.  It was another world.  Parker and Hirsch indeed were rivals in many respects.  Parker being in Englewood [neighborhood in Chicago], didn't have the same reputation as did Hirsh, but there was little that could be done about that.  Because we were not in the--in the regional area.  My sister [Beverly Campbell Jamison] was a senior and about to graduate.  In fact, she was in the last January graduating class in the public schools.  So they let her stay, of course.  So we were at two different high schools.  And that split my parents pretty well. but that was okay.  I was no longer "Beverly Campbell's little sister."  Because my sister is also a very gregarious, very sociable, a very outgoing person.  And she indeed had established her mark at, at Hirsch.  And, you know, it's kind of rough coming behind a big sister.  But at Parker I just absolutely blossomed.  That's when I really did see my leadership.  I didn't call it that at the time.  I just saw it as a way to navigate the environment.  I eventually--when I graduated was the president of the student council after having won in a real election with voting machines and everything--campaigned, it was great.  Some of my teachers are my friends today. And the woman who had the greatest impact on me, Jean Currie, was just in town yesterday, as a matter of fact.  She  was my sophomore English teacher.  And I loved me some Jean Currie.  I wanted to be just like her.  She was snazzy, she was sociable, she was firm, she was smart and she picked me. (pauses) And I believe that's why I pursued an English major when I went to, to college [at North Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois].  She identified in me the ability to write.  And she encouraged that.  She didn't stay long, because she married and moved away out of the city.  But she stayed in touch with me.  She helped to nurture me.  [Daughter] Sydney [Adams] and I visited her home in Houston [Texas] two years ago for the Easter holiday.  She came here for my President's Gala.  And she'll be back when Sydney graduates.  Just a wonderful, wonderful person. LoAnn King was a teacher.  LoAnn King is, you know, husband to Paul--I mean the wife of Paul King, UBM Construction [Inc.]. But she's also a sorority sister.  So I got to know her in a different capacity.  We thought she was mean when she was at and Parker, but (laughs) it's just amazing what a few years will do.  Lucille Moore who was a teacher at--she was my literature teacher.  I thought she didn't  like me because I had the ability even if I wasn't paying attention in class to respond appropriately.  Because I did my homework.  I did my homework and I liked to read.  So when we were discussing literature, I either had already read the book, or was ahead of at least the rest of the class (laughs), so I didn't do bad. Mr. Gibson in biology, eventually became such a friend of my mother's [Lorraine Ardell Campbell Rice], 'cause my mother's a golfer and so was he.  So they would meet up on the golf course.  And he remembered her from her visits to school.  She was always there.  Parents' day, report card pick up, open house, my parents were there.  And--what's her name? (pauses) I get her--Bingham and another lady mixed up.  But she helped to reveal the the thespian in me.  I was the leading lady in the senior class play, also. (laughs) And my family was right there on opening night front and center.  But I enjoyed high school.  It was the best time.  And there I met some of my best friends, who are still my friends.  And one in particular, Eugene Foney, who is in Houston now.  He's an art dealer.  But we met because I lost my bus card.  And he liked the picture on it--the bus card.  And he kept it until we could meet.  So he could--he put something on my locker and let me know he had it.  We've been best friends since.  In fact, we ran on the slate together for president and vice president of student council. To this--our slogan was, "Vote for serrie--Zerrie Campbell.  She's Mm-mm good."  And then we had pictures of cans of Campbell's soup.  And then his campaign slogan was, "Vote for Eugene Foney.  He's for real." (laughs) We had such a good time.  And he spells his name Foney, F-O-N-E-Y.  So high school was our world. It was our world.  Because we brought in--I love activities.  I love production.  In another live, I could have been a (unclear).  And we had a lot of activities.  We brought life in for students.  We even participated in 'The Great Walk-out'.  I forgot what the issue was.  It was something.  It was spreading to all the schools. So we all walked out. (laughs) But it was high school. It was great.

Speaker 1: So when you got ready for college--your college years, were they as enjoyable?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  I sometimes cannot believe the good experiences and good life I've had. When I hear--even when I was in the sorority house at Northern Illinois University [DeKalb, Illinois], you make assumptions that your experiences are shared by others.  And this is not the case.  So I've been naïve about some things.  and that naïvete may sometimes come across as being disingenuous.  And I really--I didn't know that folks didn't get along with their mothers.  Didn't like them.  I would never dream of talking to my mother [Lorraine Ardell Campbell Rice] the way I heard some other folks talk to theirs.  It just was foreign to me.  I didn't realize that some people had no place to go on the holiday, for, you know, the Thanksgiving holiday--it's such a short one.  People would spend it alone or on campus or in the--it just was not in my experience.  I did not--anything I wanted to do I've always been told I could do it.  So it didn't occur to me that it couldn't happen because somebody else said it shouldn't happen.  That's for me and this presidency, that's when I wanted to pledge the sorority.  One of the few people who pledged in the freshman year.  They don't do that.  When I wanted to--just--it didn't occur to me that I wasn't supposed to have it.  Shouldn't have it.  And that's where I found when I really dig in most to make it happen.  If for no other reason, to get that satisfaction.
Speaker 1: Who were the influential people in your life in college?
Speaker 2: How interesting.  One of my professors his name is [James R.] Giles.  And I was intrigued by the fact that this Caucasian man was teaching African American literature. So I enrolled in that class.  Aside from the fact that I was an English major. But I just couldn't imagine you know, a white man teaching African American literature.  And he did so so well that I enrolled in two subsequent classes of his.  Just one of the kindest men I've, I've ever met--kindest professors, educators.  I believe he's still there in an administrative capacity.  Because he once asked me to write a letter of recommendation for him.  For a promotion.  I--at times, he made it possible for me to earn a little money by babysitting for him. And his wife Wanda Giles also joined the English department there.  I don't know where their daughter is now anymore.  But I think he had the greatest influence on me.  And that may be interesting to say that he did.  Because he showed me that some things can be--while we--he was learning from us, as students.  From our experiences as we related to the literature.  And he showed us the way to explore and examine and critically think about themes and concepts as they were presented.  Yeah, he had a great following up there.
Story_ID: 17082
Speaker 1: When you graduated from [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois]--did you decide right away to do your masters [degree]?  How did you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes I did.  It became very clear to me the shelf life of a bachelor's degree was very short.  Also I had a degree in English literature.  Not a whole lot you can do with a degree in English literature that's hands-on.  Yes, having that degree implies certain critical thinking and analyses and certainly the ability to read and write, interpret and communicate.  So that's always been a strength.  But I didn't know what I wanted to do.  Those four years went by so fast that I don't think I was prepared to leave the nest either.  So I was able to acquire a graduate assistantship.  I was an assistant director of housing.  Not--Assistant Director--what do you call it?  Residence Hall Director of Stevenson South--I believe it was Stevenson South.  And that helped pay for my master's degree--my first master's--.
Speaker 1: Which was in--?
Speaker 2: In English. I have a--it was a secondary professional education.  Because having the secondary education degree with the bach-, with the English degree, then put me in there I could then have the option of teaching.  I could have the option of teaching, and I had a master's degree.  And many institutions--businesses just want the master's.  Because that takes it to a different level.  They feel they can train you in whatever or teach you whatever the profession at which you're pursuing. So I came back to Chicago [Illinois] to Malcolm X College, as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: Oh really.
Speaker 2: To get married.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: I was going to marry.  I didn't know how good I had it.  I was in--I had enrolled in a doctoral program at the time and I should have stayed there.  So I could have completed it.  Now that's my second regret. But I felt I needed to be back here with my, with my intended.  I should be back here with my fiance and make plans for this big lavish wedding I was going to have.
Story_ID: 17083
Speaker 1: We had been dating for about five years.  He was, he was a friend.  We didn't date until my senior year.  We were just great friends all through college [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois].  He was in another fraternity and I was in Alpha Kappa Alpha, so a lot of the social activity at Northern Illinois which had a very small minority population was centered around the sorority and fraternity activities. So we just had a great time.  In our senior year, we discovered each other, (laughs) and that  friendship became a blossoming love affair really.  I guess he really is the first love of my life.  And I'm still am very very fond of him today.  And we are still, when we see each other just pick up where we left off.  and he calls me on my birthday every year.  He didn't call this year though.  But he calls every year.  So I came back.  I interviewed here at Malcolm X College [Chicago, Illinois] for a faculty position.  But I didn't get that, I was offered another job in administration.  And that's when my love affair with Malcolm X College began.  Things did not work out with us.  Perhaps distance were better for it, but things didn't work out.  And then the reality of life kicks in too.  We really had it very well in our youth. (pauses) So I was here then for a while.  I'm sorry. Am I answering your question? Or am I rambling?
Speaker 2: Well I was asking about--.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: I was asking about--you're tracing your master's--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously)  Oh, oh.  okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear). And you were gonna--and I did wanna know--'cause I wanted to know at what point you had [daughter] Sydney [Adams] and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: How long were you with your husband?
Speaker 1: I'm not married.  I chose not to.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I--I'm what my aunt calls a late bloomer.  I made a deliberate decision to have her.  And her father is an old childhood friend.  In fact, his mother and my mother [Lorraine Ardell Campbell Rice] double dated on their senior prom. (laughs) So I was thirty-three years old.  I felt--I decided long ago that I would never marry just to be married.  I've been a bridesmaid about eight times.  Caught the bouquet and all that stuff. (laughs) But maybe it was the model of what I saw in my parents--'cause I was raised in a two-family home.  There was a lot of love and a lot of support.  But maybe commitment has been an issue for me.  I don't know.  Maybe making the commitment, you know, that kind of commitment has been a challenge for me.  But I also recognized that I wanted a child.  Because I thought I had so much to give.  And so that's what I did.  Now what's funny, my grandmother [Lorena McDonald Hart]--my 'Mama'--and having Sydney was a family decision.  We sat down--because my career was beginning to unfold and  clearly I would need help.  And I had no desire to do it  by myself.  Plus, you know, we keep getting the pressure.  You know we get the pressures--"When are you gonna--When are you gonna--?" And my nephew--my sister's [Beverly Campbell Jamison] son Kevin was the only grandchild at that time for my parents. and he's a boy.  And he was getting on up in age 'cause he's about sixteen years older than Sydney.  In fact, he insists that he's her uncle and not her cousin.  But yeah, I was involved in my profession, had my own place, traveling doing my cruising and having a great time.  Indulging myself with all the comforts of a single comfortable lifestyle.  But there's something missing.  I had wonderful friends.  And all of my friends were engaged in motherhood as well.  And (laughs) I never will forget my mom--I think I was being particularly critical of the way one child was being raised.  And I was--I just knew it all.  My mother said, "You know what? Since you know it all why don't you have one?  And then you'll see how easy it is.  Or how difficult it is.  You know, stop judging and put yourself in that--." And I said, "Well--."  And it happened.  Now when I say it was a deliberate decision, I did not intentionally set out to become pregnant.  In fact, I don't know if I should say this or not.  We can always edit it out.  Right? It was an end of the summer romance.  I certainly thought that we had potential since we had, had history and background.  And sometimes at that age, people start making practical decisions.  But as good a friends as we were, we just weren't well-suited as a couple.  So it was the end of the summer.  And it was, "Okay. Adios."  I was a bridesmaid again in a wedding, my cousin's wedding, and that was to have been our last date--if you will.  Well, life happens. (laughs) So when I realized that--and I was a clearly responsible adult taking birth control.  You know there was--but there was that percentage.  So I sat down with my family, and we sat around the table to decide if indeed I should do this.  Because at that time, until you see the child, it just really doesn't have the same connection.  At that time it really didn't matter to me one way or the other.  But I realized I was getting on in age and there was no one on the horizon that I would want to develop a relationship with.  And then that would have been a few more years.  And I'm not gonna be forty years old having a kid.  Not me.  So it was a family decision that we would do that.  My dad [Robert Kelly Rice] at first said, "How can you be pregnant?  You don't have a husband."  I said, "Yeah.  Let me give you a few lessons here in how it happened."  My grandmother never acknowledged my pregnancy.  I mean she was never--she--changed no different.  It was as though it wasn't--it did happen.  But from the first time she laid eyes on that child, that was her great-grandbaby.  That was just her second one after Kevin--sixteen years.  So it was--it was pretty interesting.  My mother, my sister totally supportive--everybody supportive.  'Cause I'm considered a middle-aged lady here having a kid.  Right?  It was fun.  I had a wonderful pregnancy.  I was so happy.
Speaker 2: So you got to work motherhood into your work--your career--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And how was that for you since you were making some inroads career-wise, was that stressful?
Speaker 1: Well, at the time I was in the classroom, so it wasn't so bad.  I had left administration and was in the classroom.  So it gave me an easier schedule.  There wasn't as much physical stress.  And I was doing something that I enjoyed.  I could do things such as grade papers and prepare plans on my time.  And her father was very, very supportive.  Extremely supportive.  We're--I mean we parent together.  We're just not married.  So I had in-home help after she was born.  And she was so cooperative.  She was born a week before the end the term.  So I could use my general summertime off for her.  And then when it was time to go back to school in August, I was ready to go back.  I never intended to be a stay-at-home mom, but it did--it gave me the opportunity to find in-home care.  I have to mention Dusty.  She was just great.  For the first two years--and I lived in Lake Meadows [a suburb of Chicago] at that time--the first two years Sydney had in-home care.  Well, it was clear that I needed more help because then I moved back into administration, which required more travel.  My dad retired.  My parents built out in their home a two-bedroom apartment in the basement of their home for me and for Sydney.  So that she could be raised as I had been raised.  With that whole family support, the backyard, the grandparents, the extended family.  Everything.
Story_ID: 17084
Speaker 1: So much in my path, in my, in my background says that I should not have had these opportunities that fall before me.  So it has to be divine intervention.  And I've come to understand that Malcolm X College [Chicago, Illinois] for me is a ministry of changing people lives.  Changing the quality of people's lives, helping to develop other women and men in leadership roles.  I've come to such a place with myself of security and comfort.  I could step outside of myself.  And while I enjoy an achievement or an accomplishment, recognize that it is only because of where I am and the position I have that many of these things come to me.  I dare say HistoryMakers is--as interesting as I may be, may not have that interest in Zerrie Campbell, lifeguard.  Then again, it may.  So obviously this job has given me a lot of exposure, a lot of opportunities that I may not have been privy.  And I believe all of it comes from the divine order of things.  'Cause I didn't pursue this job.  I didn't prepare the traditional path.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Trace the path you traveled from.
Speaker 1: When I moved back to Chicago and came to Malcolm X College, to marry, remember--and that didn't work out.  After working my fingers to the bone in an administrative job--and everywhere I've gone, I've been given opportunities based upon my performance.  The fact of the matter is I've enjoyed what I've been doing such that I do a good job.  I think I'm creative.  I believe that I'm--have--I take risks with new ideas and new ways of doing things.  And try real hard not to offend someone in the process.  I'm a real collaborator.  So it provides other opportunities.  When you volunteer, when you make yourself available, people who are in the positions to make a difference, realize that you can make them look good.  So they bring you along.  And then they reward that--I've been fortunate to have mentors who rewarded that.  So I've always been positioned where I could take advantage of another opportunity.  I was here as a tutor-counselor for a TRIO program [federal program assisting low-income and disabled students with higher education funding].  Then I moved to the director of that program.  From there, I was given an opportunity to become an Assistant Dean of Student Services.  So I've had the pleasure of being on both sides of the house, academic side and the student services side.  My successes in that role--because that's all over the map. that's the--any time you're the second person, assistant or vice or whatever (laughs) believe me.  You'll have all the opportunities to get experiences in many different venues.  From that I thought, "You know, I'm working way too hard for this."  As I recognized the teaching function.  And I decided, "Let me try it."  I've got this, this teaching credential.  "Let me try it."  So I did.  And I loved it.  There's something else that comes with teaching.  You change personnel or change students every sixteen weeks.  So you get to try it again.  You get to do it again.  Do it better.  Learn from--and we always--any teacher will learn from, from students.  I loved seeing the light bulb go on.  I really, really did.  And I like people.  I'm just a kind of a gregarious person.  I like talking as you can tell.  You don't have to pull a lot out of me.  And students give back so much.  I cannot tell you the number of students since I've been in this chair as President [of Malcolm X College] who have contacted me. Who have stopped by the college to tell me, "I was in your English class.  I was in this class.  Your literature class."  And, you know, I remember a lot of them.  I may not on the first introduction.  But as we talk further, there was always something about them that I remember.  So I went to the classroom not knowing that that is viewed as a demotion when you've been in administration and then you go back to the classroom.  That's perceived as some failing on your part.  Again, I didn't--it wasn't part of my experience.  I didn't know it, so I  didn't look at it that way.  And I taught for ten years.  That experience has been the most beneficial to me in being the president of this institution.  Because I can relate to my faculty.  I can relate to the students.  I can relate to the BS that goes on. (laughs) I don't have to guess at it.  And I've been fortunate enough to have taught in three of of City Colleges [of Chicago], as well as worked at the district office.  So what I've done is I've been able to--with the stability of being in this system to build a reputation and build upon each accomplishment, achievement, opportunity.  From the classroom, and having the memory of my being an administrator and an effective one, I was offered an opportunity by Wayne Watson, who's the Chancellor now [at City Colleges of Chicago], but at one time was the Dean here at the college.  As he was downtown at the district office, and there was transition in his office, then he offered me an opportunity.  It was gonna be a one-year temporary appointment as an interim Associate Vice Chancellor. Well, it took off from there.  And when we say to ourselves as women, "Oh I'm so lucky.  I was in the right place at the right time."  We diminish our achievements and our accomplishments.  We've gotta stop apologizing for our competence.  That's another one of my sayings.  When I give speeches I always include that.  Because any opportunity that came my way came from someone who recognized the talent in us in which that person could benefit.  And that's basically how things have happened for me.  When I went downtown and worked with the Vice Chancellor, I was then given exposure and given projects for the entire district.  That put me in touch then with statewide agencies.  And further expanded my horizons--if you will.  Being one of the few City Colleges employees who participated statewide in things, it gave me another profile.
Story_ID: 17085
Speaker 1: What is your educational philosophy from the teaching side?
Speaker 2: (Pauses) I don't know how to address that at this particular moment without sounding cliche.  'Cause my belief is that if you empower individuals with education, with the skills, with the knowledge that preparation and opportunity can be transformed into anything you want.  So can I coin that?  Our mission, our motto here at Malcolm X College [Chicago, Illinois] is "Empowerment through education."  We believe that every individual who walks through these doors leaves more enriched and empowered individual for having had that experience.
Speaker 1: And did you rework that motto and mission when you took office?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So this is what you've created.
Speaker 2: Let me take partial credit for it.  I was vice-president.  And was given the assignment of developing the mission through a retreat.  Now it was done--it was coined under my predecessor.  But I take a lot of pride in having led that process.  And it was a process that evolved into that statement.
Story_ID: 17086
Speaker 1: In your years in education, what would you consider your most challenging--call it a challenging opportunity? 'Cause every challenge is an opportunity.
Speaker 2: I think 1996 this institution had to undergo a North Central Association [Commission on] Accreditation [and School Improvement] accreditation process.  Malcolm X College [Chicago, Illinois] had for many years--decades suffered from a self-esteem problem. No matter that the college is named for one of the greatest human rights leaders--one of the greatest men in my memory, Malcolm X--El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz.  The perception of that man and the name as created by his detractors was not always a good one.  It just became popular with Spike Lee's movie ['Malcolm X', 1992] and so on to show pride in and strength in Malcolm X.  Before, when he was a Black Muslim, as they were called, with his fiery presentation, with his speeches, with his brilliance he scared a lot of people.  People did not listen to what he said.  They weren't listening to his message.  So much as they were listening to how it was being said.  Uncompromising, unapologetic and in your face.  But there was such brilliance in the things that he said and did.  It's difficult not to give him his rightful place in world history.  The city college--And really Malcolm X College is really the flagship college of City Colleges [of Chicago].  It started as Herzl [Junior] College, then Crane-Herzl  back in 1911.  So we're the oldest of the colleges.  Although we've been renamed and we're Malcolm X College only for about thirty-five years.  So we suffered from a perception of quality in the institution.  When Dr. Charles Hearst (ph.) was brought on as president, of the college, he too was unapologetic, uncompromising and very much a student advocate and an advocate for black people.  Remember this college--this building rose out of the ashes of the '60s [1960s] of civil unrest.  It had been Crane and it was renamed.  And there were two campuses.  Denmark Vesey campus and the Nat Turner campus.  Both named for slaves who refused to accept their lot and very violently over-, overcame that.  So the perception first off for the average person who was unenlightened and even those who were assimilating, may be one of (pauses) reticence to become known or affiliated or associated with the college.  At the time of its inception, they instituted a system of grading that was unaccepted in most higher education, A's, B's, C's were awarded.  No failing grades.  No D's, no F's.  If a student didn't pass, the student was withdrawn.  There were questions about the content of the courses that were taught.  Because the community was involved in teaching, notwithstanding credentials that are viewed as required in higher education.  The curriculum itself was very creative.  They taught courses such as "How to Arm Yourself in Urban Warfare."  And English classes were taught in an auditorium or a theater two or three hundred people.  Anyone who teaches composition knows that those classes are generally a little smaller.  Because you need more attention to detail and the, the fine art of writing grammar and syntax.  It had never achieved the maximum accreditation award of ten years.  Six years, seven years eight, seven, six.  It was always something which was identified as a qualitative.  Which prevented the college from achieving that level of accreditation.  And in 1996, in the middle of my presidency as we began to prepare for that in '94 [1994], got the entire college involved.  That was something else--in the past, the self-study was a--it's a two-year, three-year process.  A lot of research, self-study, involvement of everybody.  That had not been the case.  So, you know, democracy is painful.  And it takes a lot of time.  I insisted that we do that.  And with our team led by our Vice President [Dr.] Valerie Perkins, and she's still the Vice President.  That's part of our success that we've had--stability.  Our Executive Director of Business and Administrative Services, Victoria [Smith] Murphy, and others.  We--and Wellington Wilson.  I have to mention Wellington Wilson.  He is currently the President at Kennedy-King College [Chicago, Illinois].  But he was a faculty member here.  He was a faculty leader.  And he took on the challenge of being the self-study coordinator.  We got this entire college involved.  We imbued it with the spirit of pride and expectation.  That some of the folks who were considered long timers who may not have the energy to be as as effective as they were even came on board.  It was a major college event.  I myself became qualified to be a consultant evaluator with the NCA [North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement]. So I could go out on accreditation visits and know firsthand of the process, what the team is looking for, what is quality, borrow some ideas.  So that whole effort, it was like we were on a mission.  We were a mission.  We were driven.  There is always the pre-interviewer when the team comes to meet with the whole college.  They lay out the process.  And basically what they're doing is validating the self-study.  "Are you doing what you say you're doing? Are you who you say you are?"  So it's three days of intense investigation of every corner of the institution.  They were--and may ask for anything at any time.  You don't know what.  The conference room across the hall is set up for the team like a mini-library.  So that every document that we should have had and that they may request since the last visit, seven years ago, was available for their review.  'Cause they're comparing contracts.  And we send the documents to them a month--six weeks before their visit.  So they can review and examine and know what questions they want to ask.  It's a team of five or six individuals.  Someone looking specifically at student services.  Someone else at the finance.  Someone else at the academic programs.  But--so it's really intense.
Speaker 1: So you've been able to keep that accreditation process--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, at the exit interview when the team addressed the entire college, they go through a series of what they thought--they do the niceties--"Thank you so much for your hospitality, blah, blah, blah."  "These are your strengths--," always come with strengths first and then the challenges--opportunities.  And we had only two.  And they wanted a report.  And they announced that they were gonna recommend ten years--the maximum for this institution.  I think that was the high point for me, because it represented having brought the college together for the benefit of the institution.  Having changed the culture.  And I think I'm still riding that high.
Speaker 1: When did they make that, you know, that decision? 19--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That was in 1996-'97 [1997].  So our next visit is 2006-2007.  And what that means is it gives the college time to rest between visits.  Also time to put in place the recommendations that will show a distinct difference between visits.  Because in the next--each visit is preceded by a report from the subsequent team. So they're looking now.  "And now this was what was happening then and what was suggested that you improve upon.  And this is what your strength was.  So where is it now ten years later?"  And we have to breathe a sigh of relief, instead of going right back in to the process.  Now we did have to submit a report.  And we did that the two years they wanted it.  And we got a clean bill of health.  But I probably should have left then.  I don't think I can top that.
Story_ID: 17087
Speaker 1: What do you see as your legacy (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I think--I see as my legacy in the college [Malcolm X College, Chicago, Illinois] or that--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) In your college career first, then overall?
Speaker 2: In  the college that we were able to change the culture yet retain a culture.  Do you understand what I mean?  We were able to hold our heads up.  There was a time when people were asked where they were, and this is when I was faculty in another position--asked here, "Well where do you work?" "I work for the City Colleges [of Chicago]."  Now we proudly display our Malcolm X College roots.  We say that, "I want to share with you before you leave, hot off presses our new catalogue and our annual report."  It's almost like a different place.  Many--we've opened our doors to the community.  We truly are a community college.  Malcolm X College, I believe, is the hub of cultural activity on the west side of Chicago.  We built that by reestablishing credibility in our academic programs, in our business and operations services, in our consistency in student services. The way we treat our students.  Customer service.  All of that.  And it doesn't happen overnight.  And sometimes people are reluctant to give you another chance.  When I came back here, you could roll a bowling ball down the halls and not hit anything or anybody.  It seemed such a dark place.  At the time it was built, yes. The steel, the glass--this is the best structure of all of them.  And it seemed very stately and very dignified.  And that quickly changed to a place of--they used to call the president's office 'The Rotunda'.  Just as an example.  The perception has changed.  That this institution is one--and it's not that that we haven't always produced quality students.  That's not the issue.  Because our health curriculum is the largest array of associate degree health programs in the state.  You won't go in a hospital and not  come across a Malcolm X College graduate.  And that's for sure.  But people didn't know that.  We were a best kept secret.  We suffered from, as I said earlier, our own self-esteem.  We didn't think a lot of ourselves.  At the time that I was appointed, I was the fifth president in seven years.  So we felt thrown away.  We felt like the dumping ground.  People weren't always fired in the City Colleges of Chicago or encouraged to go on and pursue other initiatives. They were sent to Malcolm X College as punishment.  So we had an array of expatriates, if you will, who had no commitment to the institution.  They felt they were here to be punished, and took that out on our students.  This is a place now people love to come.
Speaker 1: Student retention.  Have you been able to achieve that?
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed. Our enrollment has increased for the last six consecutive semesters.  We're getting them and we're keeping them.  We conduct surveys with our students regularly, to find out from them how we're doing.  We do follow-up surveys with ours students when they graduate with their employers.  To find out how well they're doing?  Were they well-prepared?  And we guarantee if anyone is not prepared send them back.  And we will retrain them for free.
Speaker 1: Your student body is primarily working adults or do you have many more students coming straight out of high school?
Speaker 2: Well like most community colleges, the average age of our students is about twenty-nine years old.  But we have seen a great increase in the percentage of--oh no, the numbers of high school students.  Because we have deliberately--we've aggressively gone after them.  I have a program with the high schools--all of our service area high schools, called Adopt-A-School.  Each one of my administrators is a liaison and has responsibility for direct communication with that school.  We have a  wonderful relationship with the United Center [sports arena] wherein it leases our parking lot.  And our return on that is scholarship funds, vehicles, all kinds of things to benefit the institution, where we can respond to some of these budget cuts.  With that, we have--the United Center deposited $450,000, a lump-sum in an interest bearing account.  And we pay--we provide thirty-three scholarships.  Full tuition scholarships just using the interest on that to our high school--our general high school area schools.  It culminates with what I call my Principals' Breakfast, wherein I invite those principals from those high schools to a breakfast, to give them feedback on their students.  And we also award three, what we call 'Passport Awards'.  Using the quote from Malcolm X that, "Education is the passport to the future.  But tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today."  So we give that award to the top three high schools that send us students.

Speaker 1: For the students out there who will be hearing from you and seeing and knowing your story, tell us what they should look for in a community college and why they should pick a college--pick Malcolm X [College, Chicago, Illinois] or a college like Malcolm X?
Speaker 2: We are striving to be the college of first choice.  Because we are affordable, there is no place so close that can take you up as far as a Malcolm X College education.  And I give that quote to my dean, Lee Owen.  We--the cost for attending Malcolm X College or any city college or community college is one third the cost for a university--a public university.  Not withstanding the cost of a private university.  We also provide the kind of education and nurturing for students who may not have had as successful experiences in high school.  But who need a little more attention.  We provide that.  By legislation, universities cannot do that.  So the community college is a place where you can almost ensure your success at your pace and at your time.  We also for adults--so many adults have left school and have made changes and decided to come back.  This is an environment where you're not with 'teenyboppers'.  You know, this is an adult population.  Our teachers teach.  They are not research--this is not a research institution.  While they do conduct research, and while many of them are highly qualified--most--well, they're all qualified.  Many doctorate degrees, but the primary role and mission is teaching.  It's to make sure that the knowledge is transferred.  We also--you will find a community college in your neighborhood.  We are accessible.  We are easily accessible. And we provide the same curriculum in the first two years of a baccalaureate institution.  And our research has shown that our students do as well or better than native students in an institution which began as a freshman year.  We have so many successful people who began their lives--may have changed their lives.  There's been a lot of downsizing in our society.  People have had to change jobs two and three times.  A community college provides that opportunity to be trained.
Speaker 1: And you've had GED [General Educational Development examination] classes and--?
Speaker 2: Yes we do.  We have a four-prong mission quite frankly.  One-in college credit to transfer.  We have students who come to us specifically to prepare to transfer to a four-year institution.  Once they receive their AA [Associate of Arts] degree, their degree transfers in whole to the four-year institution.  Secondly, we provide the work force.  Many of our programs, the health career programs that I spoke of, we have to struggle to keep our students here for graduation.  So they can graduate.  'Cause once they have gone out to the hospitals for their clinical practice session, the hospital's they crib them and they wanna--they offer them salaries that they've never seen and never had before.  And peoples' conditions and lives cause them to make choices.  So we contribute to the workforce.  The average salary of our graduates is $31,000--entering position.  We also provide customized training to business and industry.  We can customize a course--a program, to suit the needs of the employer who wants to retrain his work force.  And we provide the basic education through GED and ESL [English as a Second Language] for the adult population, who has not achieved that.

Speaker 1: We were just talking about the increased national recognition, coming about your participation in major education organizations.  And one being the American Association of Community Colleges?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Now can you tell me how that helped shape and reshape the reputation?
Speaker 2: Oh Absolutely.  It had a major role.  Just as the State Association of the Illinois Council of Community College Presidents [sic, Administrators] helped to launch us through the state.  My participation on the national level also raised the profile of not only Malcolm X College [Chicago, Illinois], but I think the City Colleges of Chicago as well.  I have been a board member on the American Association for [sic, of] Community Colleges.  And that sets distinction, because it's an elected position.  We're elected to the board by our peers from around the country.  And that comes as a result of building networks and relationships, serving on national commissions.  I've served on the Commission for Community and Economic Development.  I've served on the Commission for Minority Affairs.  I've served on the Commission on Technology in the Classroom.  I also served on the American Council for Education.  On its commission on  the GED [General Educational Development] exam.  I'm a member of  the Kaleidoscope faculty.  Kaleidoscope [Leadership Institute] is a national women's development program for women of color.  And it is hosted and sponsored out of Georgia Perimeter College, in Atlanta.  Dr. Jacquelyn Belcher is the president there.  So I'm a faculty member.  I've participated in that program once a year.  It's a five-day program for women who are in mid-management positions, who want to pursue a presidency or some other executive level position.  We have been recognized by the Community College Consortium as a model college in transformation.  I took my whole team just two summers ago to its national conference.  As we spoke to two hundred other colleges from around the country about how we transformed Malcolm X College.  How we did it.  And while I was invited to speak, I insisted, "I'm the leader.  I didn't do it by myself."  So I took each of the constituencies from my college.  A twelve-person team as we made a presentation--day-long presentations, just about Malcolm X College.  We have recently been recognized by the College Compact as a model college, nationally.  In service learning.  How we've instituted service learning in our classroom, in our curriculum.  One of my deans, Dean Cecile Regner has just been recognized as a Fulbright [Association] Scholar.  I indeed have been fortunate enough to have been recognized by the American Association of [sic, for] Women in Community Colleges as the President of the Year.  That nomination coming from my team of people.  So our--our National Youth Sports Program.  That's our summer program for youths ages ten to sixteen received the Silvio O. Conte Award, as the best program in the nation.  And that's among universities and community colleges nationally.
Speaker 1: You also have a special program that's hooked into the space (unclear) for youth?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, we did for two summers.  We had the--(clapping hands) what was that called? It was a special grant that we received to expose our young elementary school students to science and math and aerospace and technology.  And I'm drawing a blank on it.
Speaker 1: Do you have more of those kinds of programs possibly coming?
Speaker 2: Well, we just received three National Department of Education grants.  Upwards of five million dollars for talent search.  For identifying the youth who have those kinds of aptitudes but who may have strayed away from college.  Also a Hispanic-serving--we're a Hispanic-serving institution.  We received that grant for outreach in our community bring all people in and concentrating on the Latino population.  And we have our--an EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] grant as well.  Equal Education Opportunity grant for those individuals who are not in a high--in elementary school but in high school who need that re--there is so much talent out there.  We are partners with the Board of Education, the Gear-Up grant.  And we have just submitted a grant to the--to NASA [National Aeronautics Space Administration]. A former college president who is a colleague and friend of mine is now a vice president of special programs there.  And we're hoping that we can expand even beyond the programs and services that we currently offer.
Speaker 1: And you also participate in Excel where you take high school kids (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.  In Project Excel as well as the College Bridge program with the Chicago Public Schools.  Yes we do.  We also participate through our Adopt-a-College, we develop our own programs with our different schools.  [Richard] Crane High School has a health initiatives direction.  We partner with them.  We've provided through the Excel our pharmacy classes and also we host an annual expo [exposition] for students to tour our health science labs.  As we help them, through tech prep [technological preparation], make some decisions about what careers they may pursue.  We hope that it will be Malcolm X College.  But we want to get there for college.  We sponsor an annual Senior Day. And we send out invitations to every high school in the city.  And while we have a region and an area, we believe that our boundary is the entire city of Chicago [Illinois].  And on a first-come first-serve basis, until we reach capacity, we invite the seniors from all the high schools to come here for a conference on college.  We send buses for them.  We provide lunch to them.  Give them--we run it like a conference where they go from one session to the other.
Speaker 1: And you just started that.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh. This is our eighth annual coming up.
