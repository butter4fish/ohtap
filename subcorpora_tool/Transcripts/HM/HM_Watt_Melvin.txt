Story_ID: 74018
Speaker 1: All right, before we get into depth, there are five "People" magazine-ish kind of questions that I'm compelled to ask you.  And the first one is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My favorite, uh, man, that's an interesting question (laughter).  I don't know.  I like lima beans (laughter), fresh picked from the field and cooked up by my mama; macaroni and cheese.  I mean I got, I could, I could go on and on now.  This, this, this could take two hours just to do my favorite foods here.
Speaker 1: A short answer is good.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.

Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Carolina blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Light blue.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Probably the North Carolina Mountains.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm inclined to tell my kids to keep it in the road, keep it in the road, which means stay on the straight and narrow, hope everything goes well.  It kind of captures the whole thing.
Story_ID: 74019
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, can you spell your, your parent's names for us and give us their dates of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, you--if you can give me, give me a little help there (laughter) with my--I can, I can spell their names.  My mother's name is, is Evelyn, E-V-E-L-Y-N.  Her maiden name was Mauney, M-A-U-N-E-Y, pronounced Mooney.  And she married my father whose name was Graham, G-R-A-H-A-M, Watt, W-A-T-T.  My father is deceased.  I don't, I can't recall what his date of, date of birth is.  My mother's date of birth is--was August 7, 1927.
Speaker 1: That's right, okay.  Do you know about, much about your--well, I know you do, so you know, tell us what you, well, what you will about your family background, 'cause I know a lot of research has been done.
Speaker 2: Well, I--there's a lot of research been done on my mother's side because my mother's family has had a family reunion for--going back almost a hundred years now.  We're getting ready to celebrate a hundredth in I think two or three years.  And that's been a family tradition every August.  Either the first, second, or third weekend of August the family has always gathered.  I don't know as much about my father's side of the family.  My mother and father separated when I was four, five, six years old I guess, and my mother raised me and my two brothers.  We kind of grew up together I guess is the way I always explain it, because my mother was thirteen years old when she had my oldest brother; she was fifteen years old when she had my middle brother; and she was--had just turned eighteen years old when she--when I was born so, and then three or four years after that she was separated and divorced.  So the three boys and my mother kind of grew up together is the way I, I describe it, because she was barely an adult herself at that time, so.
Story_ID: 74020
Speaker 1: Back beyond her [his mother, Evelyn Mauney], the family originated with one person from Africa whose name was Sylvie (ph.).  We don't have the benefit of her African surname because nobody's ever traced it back that far.  But Sylvie, who was the matriarch of the family, had seven daughters.  And each one of those daughters married somebody of a different surname, and so the family reunion has the different surnames of all of those people there.  The--one of them married a Roberts; one of them married a Mauney; one of them married a Costner.  I mean there's whole, whole line of people who are in the family.  My particular part of the family descends from Sylvia, one of the seven sisters.  And she had I think eleven or twelve--ten or eleven children, one of whom was Wesley Mauney, who is my great-great-grandfather, and then you kind of come down the, the ladder from there.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so tell us about your--well, well, first of all, be, before we leave that, are there any stories that they passed down from, from the days of slavery or, or Reconstruction that you remember?
Speaker 1: Well, my great-grandfather, Wesley Mauney, actually at age eighty-six dictated to somebody because he couldn't write of course.  He never learned to read or write, even though he was quite an entrepreneur.  He was a logger who hired crews to go into the woods, cut down trees, and ship trees all over--lumber all of the, the world.  But he never had the benefit of being able to read or write.  But when he was eighty-six years old, he actually sat down with somebody who could write and told about his life experiences in a fairly detailed manner, about his mother and how he and his brothers and sister had, had been split apart and sold and, and sent to different farms as part of slavery, about the time that he became free and returned to the home place here in North Carolina from South Carolina, which is where he had been a slave.  And--
Speaker 2: So he, he was sold away to South Carolina--
Speaker 1: He was sold away to South Carolina, right.
Speaker 2: --and considered this his home and came back.
Speaker 1: Yeah, came back to Cleveland County, North Carolina, which is two counties over from where Charlotte [North Carolina] is, which is kind of the home county where the Mauney plantation was, the Roberts plantation was, where all of these seven sisters were born.  And then each one of them kind of got split off and, and went--married different, different people.
Story_ID: 74021
Speaker 1: So, yeah, there's, I mean there are stories that go back for years and years.  My--Wesley Mauney, for example, talks about--and, and the stories have come down through the generations about shipping lumber that he was responsible for that--to, to all parts of the world and then having some of it go down in the middle of the ocean in a storm.  I mean there are all kinds of interesting stories that--and, and his account of, of coming home after slavery had been legally terminated was quite a moving story.  So--
Speaker 2: What did he say about that?  What was that like for him to come back and--
Speaker 1: Well, probably the best, the, the, the easiest way to do it is to read his words.  I mean I've, I've got 'em here.  It--I mean they, they, they, they kind of resonate.  If you, if you wanna hand me that book I'll read it to you (laughter).
Speaker 2: We can't--oh, he's got it already.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Which one is it, sir?
Speaker 1: Yeah, give me that one.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  This one?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  There's the picture of John Wesley Wesley Mauney and his wife, Naomi.  That's my, my great-grandfather.  I've grown my beard
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Can you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --for this occasion.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  --right there, that's it.
Speaker 1: Here, you got it?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Just hold it for one moment here.
Speaker 1: You kind of look a lot like him from here up, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--she was--had a lot of Indiana blood in her.  Let me see if I can find--yeah, the pinned picture of, of Wesley Mauney, an ex-slave.  "I was born a slave of Cornell A. Mauney in Gaston County, North Carolina, in 1849.  At that time the county they now have so many attractive homes, beautiful farms, and lovely highways, was a dense wilderness infested with wild beast and dangerous reptiles.  There were miles between plantations and homes, and it was a treat to see one another, one from another plantation.  My father was Samuel Mauney.  He was known as a real mechanic.  He was a blacksmith, carpenter, and wheelwright, and able to do anything needed on the plantation.  My mother's name was Pricilla.  My mother was one of seven sisters, daughter of Sylvie Fulling (ph.) Wilder Roberts," which was the plantation owner's name, not the African name.  "My mother had eleven children, five boys and six girls."  Let's see now, I'm, I'm gonna find the part that deals with, with coming home from, from slavery.
Story_ID: 74022
Speaker 1: Do you remember if he [Wesley Mauney], if he got anything, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh no.
Speaker 1: --from slavery?
Speaker 2: No, no, but he, interestingly enough, started to understand the value very quickly of, of accumulating land.  Because it's, it's interesting you would say that.  He didn't get anything.  He just got freed, and he left.  In fact, the daughters of the Roberts plantation here in North Carolina is who he had been sent with one of the daughters to South Carolina.  And they tried to get him to stay there, but, but he came back.  And then he says here: "When I married I had no real estate, little personal property.  My wife and I made up our minds to buy a piece of ground and start a real home."  And then he bought ninety-nine and a fourth acres from Abe Mauney, the slave master.  This was after slavery.  And he started fixing that up.  And then he bought a hundred acres more in Gaston County, North Carolina, so he ended up being a fairly substantial property owner.  Then he says he bought fifty-three acres in Cherryville [North Carolina], and a hundred and twenty-nine and a half acres in Cleveland County [North Carolina], so he was quite a businessman.
Speaker 1: And he made his money primarily through the lumber industry.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Harvesting lumber.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, says I contracted and delivered cross tires for sidetracks and main lines of the railroads by the thousands, cut and loaded and then to be shipped to France and other parts of Europe.  They tell me that some 22,000 of my cross tires shipped to France went down to the bottom of the ocean and never got there.  So, I still haven't found the part about him being freed from, from slavery.
Speaker 1: But basically though he just, he just had himself.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he just had himself.  I mean, and he came back and married Naomi, and they started accumulating land.
Speaker 1: All right, so, well, was your immediate family well-to-do--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --as a result of all this land that--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I--he, he talks, in fact he talks about being land poor, because what he was doing is that every, every piece of money he got he would go and, instead of buying personal property, he would buy more land.  And the--and, and then his, his children would all come--you know, they were all living in the same area.  And they kind of pitched in, and they had--they did farm, farm work and, and wood.  That was the, the essence of what they did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they were all able to, to basically make a living the same way.  I mean basically--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right, but acquired very little--I mean land was--was land very cheap in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean cheap by our standards today, but I'm sure not, not inexpensive by standards in those days.
Story_ID: 74023
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your, tell me about your parents.  Tell me about your, your--you say you don't know much about your father, but tell me what you do know about him.
Speaker 2: Well, I know that he graduated from high school here in Charlotte [North Carolina], from Second Ward High School.  I'm told he was a good student.  And he married my mother, who was ten years younger than him.  He was, he was twenty-three; she was thirteen when they got married.  And they had, they started having children when she was thirteen.
Speaker 1: Now did he serve during the war?
Speaker 2: He was in the [U.S.] Navy.  I don't know much about his military career, because I just never had a lot of, a lot of contact.  I mean I knew my father.  I would see him.  He would come to visit periodically, but--and he lived here in Charlotte [North Carolina] so I would see him around.
Speaker 1: Was he from Charlotte?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was from Charlotte.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, I, I mean there's just not much I can tell you about that side.  I mean I, I knew his parents, my grandmother and grandfather on, on my father's side; I knew all of them.  I, I know my cousins from that side.  I mean there's no animosity there, but I just, I don't know a lot about that side of the family.
Speaker 1: Now what did, did, did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was an employee at the General Electric Corporation, worked in the warehouse, and apparently was there thirty-five, forty years, up to his time of retirement.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how did he and your mother meet?  Was there a story about that?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I can tell you much about that.  I think he was kind of hanging around the school where she was trying to go to school, and wooing the young girls, and they ended up being intimate.  And I think they probably got forced to get married because I think he--my mother probably got pregnant, and you know, they just had a situation on their hand (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now was she, was she in school here in Charlotte [North Carolina] or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She was in school here in, in, in Mecklenburg County, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, is she--alright, okay.
Speaker 2: And then, of course, when she had a child then she dropped out.  She did ultimately--actually then, and she went back her GED [General Education Development] and her high school diploma after all of her children had graduated from high school.  And actually after I guess when I was in college that's when she did that.
Story_ID: 74024
Speaker 1: Okay, now what kind of person was your mother, and, and where did--what, what did she do for a living, and--
Speaker 2: Well, my mother didn't really have any skills.  She was--she started out--the first job I remember her having was as a custodian in one of the public schools.  And then she got a job as--in a warehouse, kind of a textile warehouse.  And she worked for a period of time at Lance Packing Company, the peanut and cracker packagers.  And then finally she took the civil service exam, the postal exam, and was able to get on at the post office.  And so she worked about I guess twenty, twenty-five years probably in the U.S. Postal Service as a mail sorter, and retired about five years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  He should spell Lance maybe.
Speaker 1: L-A-N-C-E.
Speaker 2: Yeah, those are those famous peanut butter crackers--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and cheese crackers things that you get in, in those stores.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But my--I, I mean my mother was kind of left in a lurch.  I mean she had these three, three kids.  She's eighteen years old, three kids, and then all of a sudden you're separated.  And--
Speaker 2: Do you have any idea why they separated or?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, my, my father was kind of a ladies man.  He liked the girls, so I mean I just think he, you know, he just liked to be--he was a kind of a rolling stone I guess at that time.  But that left the, the four of us basically, because we--I mean without education, without much of a job.  Without a, a marriage, there we were.  I mean we, we--I was born in a house that had no running water, had a tin roof.  I mean I could look down--and no electricity.  So that story in and of itself I mean is one of the, the strength of, of a mother who just stuck with it and--
Story_ID: 74025
Speaker 1: Now, now were you--you were raised in Dixie [North Carolina].  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, a little section of Charlotte [North Carolina] called--or section of Mecklenburg County called Dixie.
Speaker 1: It's like a suburb of Charlotte or?
Speaker 2: Well, it was kind of a section--
Speaker 1: Section, oh okay.
Speaker 2: --of the county (laughter).  To, to say it was a suburb of Charlotte would probably be an exaggeration.  It was just a little, little neighborhood that's called Dixie tucked between Berry Hill on one side and Steel Creek on the other side.  And you probably couldn't tell the difference between those three neighborhoods if you--I, I mean I don't even know what the difference is, where one stops and the other one picks up.  But we were born in a section of the county called Dixie.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you give us--can you just reflect back, and if you can give us an idea what some of the sights and sounds and smells of, of growing up in, in the Dixie community were?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean the sights and sounds and smells were the country.  I mean there was--you lived in the country; you went to an outside toilet; you didn't--you know, you pumped water; you carried water from--
Speaker 1: That, that's in, inside the city limits though, right?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no, this is still not inside the city limits.  That's why I keep saying this is Mecklenburg County now.  This is--we had a Charlotte address, but my mother still lives in the county.  She's still not been annexed.  It's out on the other side of the airport.  You came into the airport this morning.  She lives on the other side of the airport, not the--she lives on the country side of the airport, and she still lives out there.  In a much, much nicer house now than the one we grew up in, but, but she's still there.  And she does have running water and electricity and a phone (laughter) and all of that now.  But none of those things existed when, when we were growing up, at least not in my early years.  I guess when I was in the sixth or seventh grade maybe.  A gentleman who owned a bunch of land out in that area gave us, gave my mother a half an acre of land.  And she bought a house that was about to be demolished from the airport site.  And they moved that--it was really an Army barrack that had been on the airport site, and they put the, put it--they actually physically moved that barrack.  And my--and then we--my uncle put blocks under it and, and basically restored the house.
Speaker 1: So (unclear)--right there then I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, it was a, it was, it was a short part of the house at, at that--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So they took, took part of a barracks.  And then we finally got electricity, and then we got running water, and, and they built the septic tank and we got inside, inside facilities.
Speaker 1: And how long did it take for all of that to, to, to (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, once the, once the process started I guess, you know, that was all part of the process of getting the house, moving it, you know, two or three years I guess.
Speaker 1: And how old were you when you finally got--
Speaker 2: Probably eight, nine years old, somewhere in that range.
Speaker 1: So your early life you--it really was real rural living--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Story_ID: 74026
Speaker 1: Tell us about the bookmobile.  You know, just tell us that story again.
Speaker 2: Well, back in those days the, the bookmobile used to come around.  People say I used to do a lot of reading, but the reason I could do a lot of reading was that the books were readily available.  The bookmobile came once a week, once every two weeks just like regular milk delivery at some (laughter), at some points.  I mean that's a thing of the past now too.  But our neighborhood was really--our house, my great-uncle's house across the road from us, and our house adjoined the church lot.  And, and the house I was born in was on a ninety-acre tract of property that was owned by a white man named Mr. Goode.  He's the person that gave my mother this half acre of property ultimately closer to the church and closer to my great-uncle's house across the road from us.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name, Goode?
Speaker 2: G-O-O-D-E.  I think it was spelled G-O-O-D-E.  And so anyway, the bookmobile used to come by.  And I mean there wasn't any other houses close around so, in effect, the bookmobile would stop wherever somebody wanted to check out a book.  And then they'd come back the next week or two week later and, and stop again to pick up that book and let you check out books again.  Because I mean we didn't really have any, any convenient way to get to a library.  I mean the, the books in the schools were (laughter), were kind of second-hand, third-hand, fourth-hand.  So the books in the bookmobile were a lot more current than anything you could get at school at that time.  So, I used to, to check out books, and you know, that kind of put you on a, a regular schedule.  You had to finish those books because you, you know, the next time the bookmobile came you wanted to be able to turn those books back in and get some more books.  So, I was saying there, there was kind of a continuous cycle as long as the bookmobile was running, which lasted probably until I was in seventh, eighth, ninth grade.
Story_ID: 74027
Speaker 1: Okay, what, what were your favorite books?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'd read anything, I mean sports books, history books, I mean, you know, things that made you imagine being someplace else, I mean 'cause you wanted to be someplace else (laughter).  I mean, you know, you knew there had to be something else out there in the world.  I mean there had to be something else in the world that was better than where you were.  But not that you felt like you were in a bad place, because you know, looking back on it, I mean it's--that was the life of leisure.  I mean we didn't really have a lot to do.  You'd go down to the lake in the back of our old house.  On this tract of land there was a big lake, and we'd go back there and fish.  We'd run around in the woods.  I'd you know, make myself a little bat and hit rocks and you know, I mean that was--there, there were things to keep you occupied, keep you going during the course of the day.  And of course I had two older brothers who, who kept something going all the time.  And we had our own little play area under a big shade oak tree right adjacent to our house, so I mean we had our own world there, in effect.  So it wasn't a bad life, but you had plenty of time to read if you wanted to read.  I mean 'cause there really wasn't a whole heck of a lot else to do.
Speaker 1: Did your mother encourage you to read a lot?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, you know, in the sense that she--I mean my mother was,is very intelligent, but she just--you know, she, she had some tough breaks in her early life, and she just never got a chance to go to school past the fourth or fifth grade at that point.  And she was very intelligent, and that didn't, that didn't adversely affect her aspirations for her children.  She wanted her children to, to achieve, so she was, she was a Trojan, yeah.
Story_ID: 74028
Speaker 1: Now, now you say there was a church lot adjacent to your house?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --the Mount Olive Presbyterian Church.  It's still there.
Speaker 1: And did you all attend that church?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the church I grew up in.  I'm still a Presbyterian, couldn't--I tell people I couldn't have been anything other than a Presbyterian if I tried.  I mean, you know, when your front yard adjoins the parking lot of the church, I mean, in effect, we couldn't get out of our, out, out of our house without going across the church lot.  So you just didn't have much choice but to, to be associated with the church, and it had to be that church because it was right there.  And, and my mother's rule was hey--you know, as we got older--you can stay out as late as you want, but you gotta be in church on Sunday morning.  You know, if you come in at 4:00 in the morning, you're gonna be in church the next morning, you know.  So it was, it was just part of, part of the way we grew up I guess.
Speaker 1: Now that, that's not a--there, there, there's a--I, I don't think most people would realize that there's a strong black presence in the Presbyterian Church, probably not think that.  But, but it--now I've heard other stories about the Presbyterian Church.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well, there was a black, black Presbyterian church, and there was a white Presbyterian church, and they've kind of merged in recent years.  But, yeah, there's strong, strong Presbyterian tradition in a lot of our communities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I'm still a Presbyterian (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not that that matters I guess.
Speaker 1: Was, was, was it exciting being a part of, of having a church there in the community?  Did, did it stir things up a little bit?
Speaker 2: Well, it stirred things up on Sunday and--but you know, there was no close community there.  I mean to get to a community, I mean, you either had to go through the woods to visit our friends who were our age; you could go through the woods and get to their house in fifteen, twenty minutes.  And then there was just three or four houses on the, on the, on a road on the opposite side of the lake if you went through the woods.  The main Dixie community was probably a mile, mile and half, two miles away.  And then you got to, you know, lots of houses on two or three roads.  But we were kind of off from, from the community.  And about the only time you saw a lot of those, lot of those people was either at church or during the school year.  When you were going to school you generally ended up riding the same bus with--to school.
Story_ID: 74029
Speaker 1: Okay, now let's talk about school, and where did you go to school, and how did you like school?  What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to a school called Plato Price, which when I started was a one through twelve school, and it continued to be a one through twelve school until my--I was in the tenth grade.  So the first ten years of, of school I went to Plato Price.  And then the pressures were mounting by that time--this is 1961, that would have been--to desegregate the schools.  And they were--of course the establishment was doing everything it could to keep from desegregating the schools still--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --in 1961.
Speaker 1: Now you're in high school at this point--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in high school--
Speaker 1: --in 1961.
Speaker 2: --tenth, tenth grade.  So they decided they would split that school up, send half of the students to another high school, half to another high school.  So they sent half of us to York Road [High School], which is where I graduated from high school, York Road High School.  They sent the other half of the students from Plato Price to West Charlotte High School.  And, and then they made Plato Price a, an elementary school, which it really was, even for that, I mean it didn't even have the facilities to be an elementary school.  It didn't had, had no gymnasium.  You know, it was basically they just, I mean they didn't have the facilities to, to be a high school, but--and York Road and West Charlotte had better facilities.
Speaker 1: Okay, Plato Price, what's the history of it.  It's a public, a segregated public school?
Speaker 2: Segregated public school.  It--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --doesn't exist anymore now.
Speaker 1: Who was Plato Price (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I can't tell you who Plato Price was.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I don't know who Plato Price was.  I'm sure there's some history there, but I can't tell you what it is.  It was just a place that I went to school.
Speaker 1: I thought I'd ask.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  And of course at that time, students, high school students, typically juniors and seniors, drove all the school buses.  I mean that's unheard of these days.  They, they, they wouldn't think of allowing high school students to drive buses these days.  I mean adults drive buses, right?  But in our day, students drove the buses all the way up through the time I graduated from high school.  In fact, my junior and senior year I drove, drove the school bus, and typically drove a school bus past three white schools to get to my black school, which (laughter) leaves a kind of a sad taste in your mouth--mouth--when you, when you hear people talk about all of the perils of busing.  And I'm saying, what a minute now, we've been busing for as long as I can remember to keep from integrating the schools.  Why did busing become such a terrible thing when it--when you started busing to integrate the schools, I mean, you know.  So--but I used to drive, I used to drive the school bus past, past the, past other white schools to get to the black school, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were driving at an early age I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Well, you know when you were sixteen you, you go out and try to get your license because you wanted to be driving.  You didn't have nothing to drive necessarily, but (laughter), but if you--you know, you could drive--I could drive my uncle's truck, could drive, you know.  I can drive, I can still drive about anything (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did they give you some kind of test to drive a bus or just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you had to take, you had to take a driver's test, but basically all you had to do was have a driver's license, and then they'd give you a couple of lessons on the school bus and turn you a loose.  That's the way it was in those days.
Story_ID: 74030
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now those were--were, were you like keenly aware of what was going on with the civ--in, in the Civil Rights Movement across the nation when you went to school?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the Civil Rights Movement was starting to--was, was just starting, and we weren't paying a lot of attention to what was going on on a national basis.  The Civil Rights Movement really started to take fruition '63 [1963], '64 [1964], '65 [1965], '66 [1966], '67 [1967], when I was in college more than in high school.  But in high school, we were just trying to fight the battles in our little world.  I remember just the school thing that we were just talking about.  The white schools got all the new buses.  We always got the old buses, right?  And when I was a june--I think a junior or a senior in high school, I led a group of my other student bus drivers threaten to strike if they didn't give us a new bus, you know, you know, a small little thing, a little drop in the bucket here.  We weren't looking at any big Civil Rights Movement.  All we were thinking about was hey, you know, we see these big, new, pretty buses, you know, they--some of 'em had where we call 'em straight down the front buses, you know, didn't have the hoods on 'em; we call 'em straight down the front buses.  And we're saying, you know, why don't we ever get any of these buses, you know.  You--we'd get new buses into this county.  You give us the old buses.  I mean I was driving a 1959 bus, you know or a 1949 bus, you know, and so, so we got together and we threatened to, to strike.  And I remember going into the principal's office, and I said look, you know, we, we, we wanna get one of these new buses.  And the principal said well, what are you saying, Mel?  Are you saying--or Melvin; Mel is one of those later names you get as you go along in life--what are you saying, that you're not going to drive if you don't get a new bus?  And I said no, Mr. Stroud (ph.), I'm saying that if we don't get a new bus, none of us is going to drive.  And of course you (unclear)--if don't drive, the students don't get to school, right?  'Cause everybody, I mean everybody was being bused at that time.  So we finally got a new bus.  They gave us a new bus.  They wouldn't let me drive it because they thought I was the leader of the, of the, of the demonstration.  But that wasn't the point anyway.  I didn't care whether I got the new bus.  I just wanted a new bus for our school and our students, and we got a new bus.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 74031
Speaker 1: Now this is organizing though.  This is, this is--you know, these kind of actions take place because people organize other pe--people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: How did you get--where did you learn how to organize pe--people?  Did you--has it been from things you read or, or, or, or observed in the community or what?  You know, how did you--
Speaker 2: Well, they--I, I, I didn't really have any kind of organizational skills.  I mean I--you know, they say--I'm told that I was just--you know, you asked me what kind of student I was.  I wasn't never the most studious person, but I was always kind of out there articulating stuff.  I mean my mama says--I don't remember this, but if you, if you were to talk to her, she would tell you, you know, she'd bring us downtown to Charlotte [North Carolina], take us to Kress [S.H. Kress & Co.] the old department store, the original department store.  And there'd be a black--colored--water fountain there and be a white water fountain.  She would say, Melvin will always go over and drink water out of that white water fountain because one is, one, one--I, now I don't have any recollection of this, but I mean these are stories that she says.  And I was kind of the student, you know, activist in a sense.  I wanted to be the president of, of my homeroom class and the president of the student body, and you know, I wanted to be active.  And so, I mean you saw that things weren't, weren't the way they were supposed to be.  You weren't participating necessarily in some big national Civil Rights Movement.  You were just trying to address things that made your life better.  And here we were attending segregated schools, getting the worse books, hand-me-down books, having no chemistry facilities and labs in our school, none of the latest stuff, and the, the biggest insult was here we're driving rundown school buses past white schools to get to a black segregated school.  And that just didn't seem to me to be right, you know.  And so then you start just kind of agitating with your, with your other drivers.  And they say well, you know, we need this money.  We're getting paid to drive the school bus.  We weren't making but like $25 a month to drive, that it's like a dollar a day, you know, to drive these school buses.  But that was big money, you know, so you had to, you had to put something at risk to take on this cause.  And I'm not sure of what I would have done if, if they hadn't given us the new bus, but it sounded good, and it worked (laughter).
Speaker 1: But I was asking if you had a model for this anywhere, and had you observed this--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: I didn't observe it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Where did you get the idea for a strike at?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I have no idea, have no idea--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --you know, just seemed like the thing to do.  They needed to get those students to, to school; I knew that they needed us to get 'em there; and we had a little leverage in the process.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 74032
Speaker 1: Now when you were in, in school, had you, had you heard of the sit-ins at--in Greensboro.
Speaker 2: When was that?  What year was that?  Nineteen--
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty [1960] or sixty-one [1961]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960].  I, you know, I'll tell you when I started to, to, to hear about the sit-ins.  My oldest brother, who enrolled at Johnson C. Smith University [Charlotte, North Carolina], got caught up in the sit-ins.  That's, that's the way my mama used to describe it: He got caught up
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --in the sit, in the sit-ins.  And she would always scold him and, and tell him to stay out of that stuff; you know, don't get involved in that; you know, you know, we--you can't--we--you can't afford to go to jail, I mean, you know.  And the first time I remember really was--knowing cogently what a sit-in was, was my mama had told my oldest brother don't be involved in this stuff.  And then we'd go home that day and, and the news is on, and there's my brother sitting right in the middle (laughter) of the, of the sit-ins here in Charlotte [North Carolina].  Now that, that had to have been after the Greensboro [North Carolina] sit-ins, but you know, once, once the Greensboro sit-ins happened throughout North Carolina, they spread, spread fairly quickly.  So, my brother, my oldest brother, who is four years older than me, would have been right in the heart of, of those demonstrations.  I was still in high school at that time, so I was just trying to make it from day to day (laughter).
Story_ID: 74033
Speaker 1: Now when you were in high school who influenced you, or who tried to mentor you or took an interest in your development?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I--I mean I obviously had good teachers.  My eighth grade teacher, Roy McIlwain, was the first male teacher I had, because there just weren't that many ma--black male teachers in those days.  And then as I got on into high school, ninth, tenth grade, there was a guy named Bill Johnson--we called him Champ--who came into our school and organized the drill team that won the national championship.  And Champ was kind of the--he had just come out of the military, and he became the, the baseball coach, the basketball coach.  We didn't have a football team at Plato Price, so he organized a track team, drill team.  And the principal of the school, Mr. Clark--so there were role models, but by and large, it was, it was parents.  And you know, the parents of some of my classmates and schoolmates were actively involved in the Parent-Teacher Association, the PTA.  My mother was actively involved in it.  I mean, you know, any time something happened at school, she was gonna be there.  And so you got, you got a sense of parent involvement during those times.  And your teachers were always--I mean, you know, they may--of course we didn't know they weren't great teachers.  We thought they were magnificent teachers.  What we did know is that they had our interest at heart.  They were driving us; they were calling our parents; they were--you know, if you, if you had any kind of skill, they were gonna make you use it.  This thing of having to select between things that you were doing in school, I mean I see kids selecting today.  We did everything.  I mean, you know, I played baseball; I played basketball; I ran track; I sung in the glee club; I drove a bus; I--you know (laughter), you know, you had to do it all, and you're teachers were forcing you to do it all.  And if, if, if they had any sense that you had reasonable amount of intellect, then you became their special project.  So, there was no lack of role models I don't think.  I mean I don't think I ever really thought about it in terms of, you know, who's my mentor, who's my role model.  But the teachers in a segregated school setting were taking a personal interest in you and your family's well-being.  And the parents were being pushed to take an active role in your, in your well-being.  So, I mean, you know, I just, you know, I didn't feel like I was growing up any kind of disadvantaged world.
Story_ID: 74034
Speaker 1: So but when you, when you were a senior on the verge of graduation, what did you think you would do next?  I mean had you, had you decided to go to college at that point or?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew I wanted to go to college if I could afford to go to college.  I think in my junior year of high school during the summer I got a job working in some warehouse where I was moving 55-gallon drums and you know, physical labor kinds of things.  And, and I went into the warehouse, and there were these older guys who were working there who had worked there for years and years.  And, and so they kind of took me under their wing and said look, you know, this ain't what you wanna do, you know.  So they--and by the time I worked there one summer, I, I, I learned everything there was to learn at that warehouse.  I mean, you know, I, I, I could do shipping; I could mix the chemicals; I could do--you know, because, I mean, you know.  And these guys were saying, you know, how do you learn this stuff so?  Well, you know, I'm, I'm in school, you know.  So they were saying look, you know, you, you need to get out of here; you need to go on; you need to go to college.  And so I started thinking that, that college was a possibility at that time.  My oldest brother was--had, had gone--started at Johnson C. Smith [University, Charlotte, North Carolina] until he got caught up in demonstrations (laughter) and it, it--
Speaker 1: So that actually ended his college--
Speaker 2: Well, it ended it for that time, for, for the time being.  He went one semester at Johnson C. Smith and, and did very well that one semester, but then he kind of got caught up into the demonstration, and then he went into the military.  And so it took him awhile to get back to it.  He finally did come back, but not to Johnson C. Smith.  But he finally did get his college degree, after I got mine.  So, I mean I'd kind of watched his school of hard knocks.  You know, I was learning from his hard knocks, and in, in a sense I was a lot less reluctant to get involved in demonstrations.  I was, you know, I was more academically oriented because people were saying hey, you know, you need to, you need to apply yourself; you need to--and I was.  I mean I was interested in doing that.  So, and so then I got to--the senior year in high school I got a, a scholarship offer to Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama]; I got a scholarship offer to Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama].  And, and I had applied to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and I didn't think I would get in, but I did.  And I looked at those three options, and I'm saying, you know, the last place in life I wanna go in 1963 was Alabama.  Ain't no way I'm going to Alabama if I can avoid it.  And you know, the University of North Carolina had accepted me, and you know, the tuition was cheaper because it was in-state, and I didn't have any money.  And then I got this devastating letter from the University of North Carolina saying we can't offer you any scholarship assistance.  I mean they were basically discouraging me from going to college at the University of North Carolina.  So I'd been working in this warehouse, I'd, you know, been working cutting grass, you know, and cleaning up in a, in a restaurant and working myself to death, and I had, I had enough money saved up for one semester.  And I just, I sat down with my mother and I said look, you know, I wanna go to the University of North Carolina.  If, if you give me one semester, let me just try it.  So I talked her into it.
Story_ID: 74035
Speaker 1: I've read that you, that you say--you consistently say that your life has been a series of lucky breaks.  Can you talk about it (laughter) on some level?  'Cause it--I think the college experience, you know, is--there are a couple of breaks in the college experience that you--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I guess I think they are lucky breaks in the sense that they don't--you, you wouldn't necessarily assume that everything that you get involved in is gonna work out the way it's worked out.  I mean when I went to University of North Carolina [Chapel Hill], first of all I went there without any scholarship commitment.  I had a letter; in fact, I got the handwritten letter, the, the note on the typed letter from the Dean of Admissions saying we're not gonna give you a scholarship at this point.  If you do well your first semester, we'll consider you for scholarship assistance.  And, and I didn't really have enough money to do but one, one semester at University of North Carolina, so it was a gamble.  It was my first time entering into a integrated educational setting, so I didn't really know what to expect.  And I show up on campus the first day, and I'm assigned to a room with three white roommates.  And by end of the day, all of them are gone.  They, you know, they picked up their luggage; they've, you know, they're gone.  I mean they never spent not one night with me in the same room.
Speaker 1: Now you had a conversation with one of them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of 'em was his, his--he was actually from New Jersey, but as it turns out, his, his father was from either Mississippi or Alabama.  And I think he really wanted to stay in the room, but he had this conversation with his father.  And his father basically said get the hell out of that room with, with that nigger.  I mean, you know, he--you know, at that time, this is 1963.  So I just lost my roommates, I mean, you know, so that could have been devastating I suppose.  I mean I, I, I didn't get all that upset about it, but everybody around me seemed to be upset about it.  It's just a way to have a room by myself (laughter) it seemed to me.
Story_ID: 74036
Speaker 1: But they finally did move a graduate student in with me, and that was a good break for me because he became a lifelong friend of mine, first of all.  But second of all, he was always studying; I mean he didn't do anything.  I mean he was working on a master's degree in, in political science.  In retrospect, I, I tell him now he must of not been that bright because if he studied as much as he did, I mean and, and when I would get up in the morning, this guy would be sitting at the desk studying.  When I would go to bed at night, he'd be sitting at the desk studying.  So, consequently, my first week, two weeks, three weeks of, of, of college I thought that's what everybody did in college.   And so then I got into this mentality, well, okay, if he's studying, I'm gonna be studying until I go to bed.  So quite often I'd be--you know, he'd have his, his--we'd--he had his desk against one wall.  I had my desk against the other wall.  Our backs would be to each other.  He'd be studying.  I'd be studying.  I'd be sitting there reading,  I couldn't even stay awake, but this guy was not gonna let this white boy out study me.  I mean that was the bottom line on this, you know, except that he just had more--longer hours than I did.  As long as I was gonna be up, I was gonna be studying if he was gonna be studying.  And, and that really turned out to be a critical turning point I think in, in my college career, because I thought everybody was studying like that.  I mean anybody who is reasonably bright who studied as much as I did in my first year of college should have made straight As.  Now I--you know, as it turned out, I didn't make anything but As and Bs, but you know, it wasn't because I was that bright I didn't think.  I mean I still don't think it was because I was that bright.  It was because I studied, I studied harder than anybody who was there.  And the reason I did was because I thought everybody else was studying like that because I got this roommate.  I just was fortunate enough to get a roommate who set that kind of protocol for, for our room.
Speaker 2: And this roommate's name is Melvin too, right?
Speaker 1: Marvin.
Speaker 2: Marvin, okay, Marvin.
Speaker 1: Marvin Moode is his name, yeah.  He's still a good friend of mine, works the U.S. Department of Agriculture now in Washington [D.C.], and we, we still are very good friends.  And I kind of lost track of him over the years for periods of time.  And--but he's always been a prominent part of my life since 1963 because I credit him with being the person who, first of all, was willing to move into a room with--'cause they asked him when they (laughter)--you know, do you mind moving into a room with, with this Negro (laughter).  And so--and he say--you know, he was, he was late getting there so he said shoot, I just want a room, you know; he didn't care.  So he moved in, you know, and we became friends, and, and he set the study protocol for me.
Story_ID: 74037
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you, you, you initially got a scholarship, right, from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, after the first semester, I took my grades over, laid them on the, on the desk and said here they are.  You said you would consider me for a scholarship.  You either gotta give me a scholarship or I gotta go home.  And they did give me a scholarship, part loan, part scholarship.  And then a couple of years later I got a job as a floor advisor in one of the dormitories.  I was one of the first black students who became a dorm advisor in, in--at the University of North Carolina [Chapel Hill].  So I made a little bit of money from that, and I worked during every summer.  And I just kept, you know, muddling--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --my way through.
Speaker 1: How did the oth--the other students take your advice as a dorm advisor?  I mean how did they--
Speaker 2: Well, I really--you know, there really wasn't much advice, to be honest with you.  I mean you were there as a resources.  I was the kind of advisor if somebody wanted to talk to me, they came and talked to me.  But I wasn't, I really wasn't going out of my way to go and give people advice.  If they needed me, they knew who the floor advisor was.  My job was to kind of keep order on the hall--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and be a resource person if they wanted somebody.  And I was not an intrusive floor advisor, 'cause I knew most of the white kids in the--on my hall just didn't have much interest in, in being advised by me, and it was fine with me.  I mean I just get a check and didn't have to do a lot of work (laughter), so good enough.
Story_ID: 74038
Speaker 1: Okay, now what, what other activities were you involved in, in college?  Did, did you have any--
Speaker 2: Well, I went out for the freshman baseball team.  I played baseball all the way through high school and was a--I thought I was a pretty fair country pitcher, but I got cut from the freshman baseball team.  I, I, I'm not sure what I expected.  I mean this was 1963.  University of North Carolina [Chapel Hill] had never had a black athlete.  If I had made the freshman baseball team, I would have been the first black athlete at University of North Carolina.  As it turned out, two years later I guess Willie Cooper became the first basketball, black basketball player at Chapel Hill.  And then he was shortly after that followed by Charlie Scott, who is who everybody thinks was the first black athlete at [University of North Carolina] Chapel Hill.  And really it was Willie Cooper, who was a walk-on to the basketball team.  And Dean Smith was actively recruiting black students.  I mean he was in the forefront of recruiting black students for the basketball team.  But the, the baseball coach wasn't actively recruiting any black student for his baseball team, I can tell you that (laughter).  I think I, I, in retrospect, I, I think I probably should have made the freshman baseball team if, if the playing field had been level.  I wasn't, probably wasn't good enough to make the varsity baseball team, but I think if--but, again, you know, if I'd made the freshman baseball team, it'd have taken a lot of time.  So, in, in effect, that was another break that I got.  You know, it wasn't a--I never looked at it as a negative.  I never even looked at it, I don't think, in racial terms.  They had a bunch of white baseball players there on scholarship.  They had investments that they had made in those white students and--to play baseball, and they were gonna let those kids play.  I mean, you know, they weren't out actively recruiting any black baseball players at that time or any other athletes.  So the guys who were on scholarship were at, at an advantage.  They were at an advantage over black students or white students who didn't have scholarship.  And I, I don't think I ever really thought about it in racial terms.  And looking back on it, it's probably one of the better things that ever happened to me, 'cause I didn't have to spend a lot of time running around playing baseball that I should have been studying, and I was (laughter).
Story_ID: 74039
Speaker 1: So when you--so how did you do, I mean at--in--at North Carolina (unclear)--I mean at the end of the--
Speaker 2: I did very well.  I, I made the freshman honors fraternity; I made Phi Beta Kappa; I made the business honors fraternity; I had the highest academic average in the business school for a period of time, and that entitled me under the rules to become the president of the business honors fraternity, which probably hadn't been done since then by anybody of color.  But I mean it was a nothing job.  I mean, you know, president of the business honors fraternity, what do you do?  Nothing (laughter), but, you know, it was a good, it was a good honor.  And it was great to be, to be in the business honors fraternity, and great to be in, in Phi Beta Kappa, and great for me probably even more than either of those two things to make the freshman honors fraternity because that freshman year was--I mean, you know, to, to, to go from a segregated setting to an integrated setting, see your roommates move out on you, not know what to expect, and then do well, because, you know, there was a lot of insecurity at that time.
Speaker 1: Was there any outstanding instructors there at University of North Carolina that you remember that influenced you?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think--I can't recall ever having a black professor at the University of North Carolina.  There was a really progressive white professor by the name of Lou Lipsitz who taught--
Speaker 1: Can you spell that?
Speaker 2: L-I-P-S-I-T-Z, young Jewish fellow who taught political science.  And you know, he, you know, he was, he was a progressive, he was a liberal, you know, he was encouraging kids to think and not just to go along with everything I mean, you know, so I remember him.  I remember the difficulty of my college chemistry class (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: You all didn't have any equipment in--
Speaker 2: No, we didn't, we didn't have any of that in high school, so just getting through a college chemistry class was, was something for me.  But I, I can't, I mean I really can't think of any college professors that really stood out for me.  I mean there were obviously people who took an interest in me and you know, encouraged me.  But to, to a large extent, it was me against the world, I mean, you know.  And I think it had, it had some impact because you felt--all the four years I was at [University of North Carolina] Chapel Hill I felt like I was in a bunker, you know.  It was never like I was a full part of the university.  I mean, all the black students would meet in the gym every Friday afternoon and play basketball.  We all knew each other.  We visited each other's families.  But that--it was, it was, it was a different time.  I mean there wasn't a lot of integrating going on back at that time.
Story_ID: 74040
Speaker 1: So, well, when you were on the verge of graduation, did you know what you wanted to do next?  I mean did you know where you going?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew I wanted to get out of North (laughter), get away from the University of North Carolina [Chapel Hill].  Actually--
Speaker 1: Try something new, try something new I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I knew I wanted to go to law school.  Actually I'd--when I was in the ninth or tenth grade I think, one of my high school teacher said, you know, kind of jokingly to me, you question everything; you don't take anything that anybody says without questioning it.  You must be planning to be a lawyer.  I didn't know what a lawyer was.  I mean there's no precedent for it in my family, so--but it sounded good, you know.  And, and adults would always ask you what are you gonna be when you grow up?  You've heard that question before I'm sure.  What are you gonna be when you grow up.  So any time somebody would ask me I'd just say okay, you know, I'm gonna be a lawyer.  So from the ninth or tenth grade on, all I ever wanted to be was a lawyer.  I didn't really know what it meant.  There wasn't any precedent for it in my family.  There wasn't anybody that I was emulating, that I could look to.  I didn't know a lawyer until I graduated from high school and was about to start college I met Julius Chambers for the first time.  And that was kind of happenstance too.  I happened to be going to the dentist's office.  His office was in the same building as my dentist.  My dentist took me too his office and introduced me to him, you know, and that became a lifelong friendship.  I ended up going to work in Julius Chambers' law firm when I got out of law school seven, eight years later, so it was a good break for me.  But I didn't really have anybody that I was emulating.  I just knew I wanted to be a lawyer.  And so when I got to my last year of undergraduate school, all I wanted to do was see where I was gonna be in law school.  I knew I wanted to go to law school, but I didn't know where I was gonna be able to get in.  So I decided I would apply to five different law schools.  I'd applied to the top two law schools in the country, Yale [University] and Harvard [University].  I figured no way I'm gonna get into these law schools.  I'd apply to a second tier of law schools, so I applied to Duke [University] and Columbia [University].  And then I applied to University of North Carolina [Chapel Hill].  I said now I know I can get in University of North Carolina.  I got a good academic record.  They'll let me in the law school here.  And as it turned out, I got into all five of 'em.  I had a good academic, I had a good academic record in undergraduate school.  I didn't do all that well on the law school admission test, but I had a good academic record in undergraduate school.
Story_ID: 74041
Speaker 1: Now why did you choose Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: Well, what I'd said to myself was, was two things.  Number one, I wanna apply to all five of these law schools, and I wanna have the option of going to the best law school in the country if I get in.  And so once I got into all five of 'em, I eliminated Duke [University], I eliminated Columbia [University], I eliminated Harvard [University] because it was too big, and I'd been in this gigantic setting at [University of North Carolina] Chapel Hill for four years.  I was tired of it.  And that left Yale and University of North Carolina still standing.  And most people think that, that, you know, that'd be an easy decision to make.  That was, that, that was a more difficult decision because I was applying for a Morehead Scholarship that only the University of North Carolina awards. [John Motley] Morehead [III], an old racist with plenty of money and Morehead Planetarium, had this scholarship program, the best scholarship of any, any scholarship in the United States really and one that any student would die for.  But he had never had a black student.  I mean he had an--he had a racially exclusionary policy.  I mean they had--and--but I applied for the law school Morehead.  And I said okay, if I get the law school Morehead, I can't afford not to go to college, to law school here because I mean you get a full ride; they give you extra money; they get you a job during the summer.  I mean, you know, there's all, all kinds of things that went with that.  And so I went through the application process.  And you know, one side of me is saying you're just deluding yourself; this is a charade that you're going through.  The other side of me is saying, yeah, I got a good academic record; I can, I can get this scholarship.  So I end up getting--not getting the scholarship, and so I'm pretty much decided, look, that eliminates Chapel Hill.  I'm going to Yale if I can figure out a way to financially afford to go to Yale.  And so I'm sitting there in that posture, and then the dean of the law school at Chapel Hill calls me in.  And he says, "Mel, I know you're disappointed you didn't get the, the law school Morehead, but we're gonna offer you the next best scholarship that we have.  We have three law school Moreheads.  You didn't get any one of those, the next best scholarship we're gonna offer you.  And if you go to the University of North Carolina, you'll do well.  If you go to Yale or Harvard or some- one of those other law schools, maybe you won't do so well."  And I looked at him and I said, "What," (laughter)?  I said to myself is this guy kidding me (laughter).  I mean that was, that was really kind of the straw that broke the camel's back.  I mean I already decided that I wasn't going to Chapel Hill, but that was the, kind of the nail in the coffin, you know.  And so that's really how I made the decision.  I mean I, I wanted to go to the best law school.  And then he kind of drove me away from, from--you know, I was still sitting there--maybe I should go to Chap- Chapel Hill.  It'll be cheaper, you know.  Maybe I'm gonna practice law in North Carolina.  It'll be some advantage to have gone to the University of North Carolina's law school, you know.  You know, I was still kind of in that decision making mode, although I was leaning heavily toward Yale when I didn't get the, the Morehead scholarship.  And then he nails the coffin for me, and I said okay, I'm gone (laughter).  So a year, a year and a half later I was back at the law school speaking to the, to the students there and talking trash because I had made--you know--not trash.  I wasn't talking trash, but you know, just kind of--they invited me back to speak at the law school.  I was writing my way onto the Yale Law Journal, you know.  And this guy--and, and, and to his credit, I mean he's a great guy.  He was the dean of the law school, and I'm sure he never, he never really intended to offend me.  He probably didn't even realize that he was driving the, the nail in the coffin, but he did.  And ironically, years later, he had, he had ceased to be the dean of the law school, went to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and he was the judge who wrote the redistricting case opinion that upheld my congressional district.  It got overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.  But, you know, it's, it's interesting the way these cycles go around (laughter).  You never, you just never know how these things work out.
Story_ID: 74042
Speaker 1: So how did you like Yale Law School?  How did you find it?  I mean was it vastly different I guess?
Speaker 2: It was vastly different in the, in the sense that my four years at the University of North Carolina [Chapel Hill] for me never was about the intellectual pursuit of ideas.  It was always about survival and grades, you know.  I knew that I needed good grades to stay in undergraduate school and good grades to go to law school, and I aspired to go to law school.  And so my course selections, everything I was doing was calculated to get me a good grade.  You know, I was--nah, nah, I'm not saying I wasn't working.  I was working at this; I mean I was studying; I was--but I was studying for the purpose of getting a good grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I got to Yale, it was a different kind of atmosphere because the--you know, people say you know, Yale [University] and Harvard [Universtiy] gotta be very difficult.  The truth of the matter is they are a lot easier than undergraduate school for me, because in undergraduate school it was about survival.  In law school if you got in, everybody assumed that you deserved to be there.  The biggest obstacle was getting in.  So then you could--you didn't have to worry about the grades.  You could worry about the intellectual pursuits.  And for the first time in my life, at least since high school, I could learn for the sake of learning rather than learn for the sake of getting a grade.  And that opened up a whole new world for me because then it was, it was trying to figure out how the world was put together, where I fit into this world, how I could take this, this case and do something else with it, how I can innovate, you know.  It wasn't about whether I got a B or a C or an A in a class.  You know, you knew you weren't ever gonna get anything less than a C if you (laughter), if you did anything.  I mean, you know, you had to be--I mean you had to work hard to flunk out of Yale Law School.  I mean, you know, that's just the way it was because the challenge was not staying in.  The challenge was getting in.
Story_ID: 74043
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it was, it was different, and you were exposed to people who just, brilliant minds from all across the country.
Speaker 2: Who were some of the minds?
Speaker 1: Well, the--supposedly the smartest guy in my class was a guy named Duncan Kennedy, who is a, now a professor at, at Harvard Law School, has his own theory of, of law (laughter) that he's written extensively about.  I mean this was a, this guy was a classmate of mine.  He was a, you know, he was probably the, the--generally regarded as the brightest guy in the class.  But then there was a guy named Paul Gewirtz, who is now a professor at Yale's law school; one of my best friends, a guy named John Keker, who prosecuted Oliver North some years ago.  He's now representing [Andrew] Fastow, the guy with Enron who stole all the money (laughter), they say.  I shouldn't say he stole all the money.  They say he stole all the money.  But I mean that, you know, there, there are still people--the guy who represented Bill Clinton in the impeachment hearings.  A guy named [David E.] Kendall was a classmate of mine.  I mean I just--I keep running into people who were in law school with me.  Hillary Clinton was first year when I was third year.  [President William] Bill Clinton came the next year after I graduated from law school.  He came to the law school.  I mean, you know, so there, there's a circle of, of people that still to the day just the value of being able to go to school with these people, and to say that they are your friends, and to call on them.  I mean I got a--in my front political fundraising there's a whole base of support, Yale Law School people that, you know.  And, and so it touches you in intangible ways that, that benefit and show you the, the privilege that people have had for years and years by virtue of going to these, to these Ivy League schools.  And, and I, I, I mean that's not a knock against University of North Carolina.  I have the same kind of circle of friends from the University of North Carolina.  It's just there weren't as many of us there then to take advantage of it.  And that was the--that, I guess that's the, that's the irony of this.
Story_ID: 74044
Speaker 1: Oh, I wanted to ask you about Robert Bork again (laughter)--(unclear)--Robert--
Speaker 2: Wanna get that on tape, huh?
Speaker 1: --Robert Bork.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Robert Bork was, was my constitutional law professor at Yale.  And it's a great way to learn, to take constitutional law from somebody who is conservative, who disagrees with, with everything that you stand for.  I mean, you know, he, he had this strict construction of civil rights and what the Constitution should be doing in the civil rights area.  Fortunately, he didn't grade us on what--on whether we agreed with him or not.  He graded us on, on whether we could defend what we were arguing.  And it was, it was a great way to learn about the Constitution and one of my, my more interesting classes at, at Yale Law School.
Speaker 1: Okay, what--do you have other experiences at Yale you wanna share with us before we--
Speaker 2: Oh no, I think I'll pass up some of that.  I mean by the, by my third year of law school, I just wanted to get out of there.  And you know, the classic you think you're ready to go practice law, and I thought I was.  And so I just wanted to be gone.  And then, of course, that was also the year that we didn't take final exams, my last year, because of the Vietnam War demonstrations.  So it was quite an activist time because of the war demonstrations that were going on.  I wasn't all that involved in it.  I mean by that time I'd gotten married, and I was living off campus.  And so I, I kind of stayed away from the controversial things.  I just went to law school, took my classes, and went home.
Story_ID: 74045
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did you, you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: My wife and I actually met in high school.  I took my first cousin to her prom, and my wife came--went to the same school that my first cousin went to.  And she was with some other guy (laughter), and I liked her better than (laughter)--I certainly was trying to make, make some progress with her.  I wasn't trying to make any progress with my first cousin.  I was just, I was just an escort for my first cousin.  So we ended up trading phone numbers, and so I started the active pursuit, and it continued all the way through undergraduate school.  She went to Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, and I was at [University of North Carolina] Chapel Hill.  So there was a lot of separation, and we were on again, off again, on again, off again, you know, long distance romance, how that is.  And finally we got it together.
Story_ID: 74046
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So after Yale Law School, you, you, you ended up working with--you start working for the firm with Ferguson and--
Speaker 2: Ferguson--
Speaker 1: --Anderson.
Speaker 2: --Stein, Chambers--it was called Chambers, Stein, Ferguson, and Becton at that time, because [HM Julius] Chambers was still the lead lawyer in the firm.  He subsequently left and went to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund as director counsel in New York, but the firm is still there.  I actually turned down the first offer I got from the law firm.  I wasn't sure I wanted to come back to North Carolina actually.  The truth be known, I think if--when I left North Carolina to go to Yale Law School, I thought probably I would never come back to North Carolina, not, you know, to make a living, not to live.  What I think I realized over the time that I was out of North Carolina was that I, I wanted options.  I wanted to be able to go anywhere I wanted to go.  And by the time I got out of law school I had offers in New York, and California, and Atlanta [Georgia], and you know, Cleveland, Ohio.  I mean I could have gone just about anywhere I wanted to go, and then I could look at North Carolina in a different way.  And, and Julius Chambers of course was there saying look, you know, there's work to be done here in North Carolina.  We need you to come to North Carolina.  If you come here, they'll be plenty of things that you can do, and you can see the impact of them.  And so he kind of talked me into coming back to Charlotte [North Carolina].  And it's been a, it's been a good ride.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what, what, what kind of law were you trained to practice, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I actually came back--my undergraduate degree is in business administration.  I took a lot of kind of taxation business courses, wrote a Law Review article on taxation of minority businesses, investing in the community.  And so I wanted to do business law.  Yet the law firm was, was known for its civil rights reputation.  They were handling the Charlotte [North Carolina] school case and "Griggs vs. Duke Power," a landmark employment discrimination cases.  And they were also doing a lot of criminal work.  But my niche when I came back was to do business development and business law.  And I kind of--we treated the representation of minority businesses and small businesses as part of the civil rights mission.  I never really thought of it as anything other than the practice of civil rights law for--law, although I was doing business stuff, traditional business stuff.  It was business development.  Sometimes it was hard to understand the dividing line between legal advice and business advice when you're advising small business clients.  But, so you're always kind of walking that thin line between giving legal advice and giving business advice.  But I developed a nice little business practice, minority businesses primarily, and a lot of them are still existing right here in, in the Charlotte [North Carolina] community.
Story_ID: 74047
Speaker 1: Now, during that time period you met Harvey Gantt too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually [HM] Julius Chambers, like he talked me into coming back to Charlotte [North Carolina], talked Harvey Gantt into coming to Charlotte.  Harvey had clerked for a, an architectural firm here in Charlotte for one summer and was kind of ambivalent about what he was gonna do.  He had gotten--he had gone on to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to graduate school and got a city planning degree.  And then he'd gone back to work at Soul City.  Remember Soul City?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Up in Warrenton, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Now Soul City, explain--now that was a project of CORE, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Roy Innis, right?
Speaker 2: Floyd McKissick--
Speaker 1: Floyd McKissick.
Speaker 2: --was kind of the moving force behind Soul City in North Carolina, and Harvey was working up there.  So, I was actually with Julius [Chambers] when he--we went up to Soul City one night, and we met with--he met with, with Harvey [Gantt].  I never met Harvey at that time.  And he kind of put the same sales pitch on Harvey that he had put on me, and then the next year Harvey moved back to Charlotte [North Carolina].  And then a couple of years after he came to Charlotte, he was appointed to the Charlotte City Council.  Fred Alexander, a black member of the Charlotte City Council that run for the State Senate and was going to the State Senate, that left a vacancy on the Charlotte City Council.  So, and there was a massive division in the black community about everybody knew that they wanted somebody black to have that position, but the black community couldn't marshal its forces behind any candidate with kind of factions in the black community.  Each faction had their candidate.  And Harvey wasn't associated with any of the factions really.  He was kind of the compromise candidate.  Most people don't realize that.  They forget about.  He was the downtown business community's candidate more than he was the black community's candidate.  He wasn't even, he wasn't a Charlottean.  He wasn't any of the factions, but he got appointed to city council.  And then he had to run for city council for the first, and he came and asked me if I manage his campaign for city council.  And of course, I didn't know anything about managing a campaign.  I told him that.  I said Harvey, I don't know anything about managing a campaign.
Speaker 1: I was gonna ask you if you've ever participated in a campaign.
Speaker 2: Never, never participated in a campaign prior to that time.  And he said well, and I said well, you know, you know, you need to go and get one of these guys who's associated with one of these factions, I mean, you know, and build a base of support that way.  And Harvey said no, I want somebody that's not associated with any of the factions because I wanna try to appeal to all of the factions.  So we both kind of got into this brand new.  He was a brand new politician.  I was a brand new campaign manager.  He said it can't be all that difficult.  I mean, you know, we'll make good decisions.  We'll sit down and think about how to run a campaign, and we did.  And so Harvey won the city council race.  And every two years from that point on, he was back asking me to manage a campaign.
Story_ID: 74048
Speaker 1: And then in 1979 he [Harvey Gantt] came to me.  This was I guess the first time he ran for city council, like '74 [1974] maybe.  In 1979 he came and said I wanna run for mayor.  I said Harvey, you have got to be out of your mind, you know.  Charlotte's twenty-two percent black, you know.  These white folks ain't gonna select you (laughter)--elect as the mayor of Charlotte [North Carolina].  That means you gotta be crazy.  And he said well, I gonna run for mayor.  I'm the best candidate.  By that time he had actually put together a coalition of community groups.  He'd shored up his support in the black community.  I mean, you know, and he had taken leadership positions by virtue of being a city planning--planner.  You know, he was very articulate on planning issues in particular.  And so, he decided he was running for mayor, and I said okay, well, if you're running, you know, I'm managing the campaign.  So he ran against a guy named Eddie Knox, who everybody was speculating would be the next governor of North Carolina.  And everybody knew that his guy was using the mayor's race as a steppingstone to run for governor.  That was a blessing--it was a curse, because everybody wanted this guy to be the may--the governor of North Carolina.  At least people in this area wanted him to be the governor of North Carolina.  And so we ran that campaign, and we lost in the primary against a Democratic opponent by ninety-five votes, ninety-five votes out of over 100,000 votes cast.  And so Harvey was out of politics for two years.  Two years later he ran for city council again.  The guy who was running for mayor, he was not gonna run against him an incumbent mayor, ran for city council again, overwhelming support from the community, became the mayor pro tem by virtue of having the highest vote count.  And so, then two years after that, it was a done deal.  I mean, you know, four years, you know, he had lost by ninety-five votes.  He had become the mayor pro tem.  The guy was running for governor.  Harvey was running for mayor.  It was, you know, it really not that difficult a campaign in 19--that would have been 1983 I guess.  So he becomes mayor.  I managed that campaign, managed subsequent mayoral--mayor--campaigns for mayor.
Story_ID: 74049
Speaker 1: And then in 1989, Harvey [Gantt] comes to me and he says, Mel, I'm gonna run for the United States Senate.  I said, Harvey, you are out of your mind (laughter), you know.  Jesse Helms is the U.S. Senator from North Carolina.  There's no way these white folks are gonna elect you to be the Senator from North Carolina.  Harvey says I'm running.  I said well hey, if you're running, I'm there; I'm your campaign manager.  So, I ended up managing a U.S. Senate campaign, statewide campaign in 1990 against Jesse Helms.
Speaker 2: Now this is a campaign that caught the attention I understand (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I became a national--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --national campaign.
Speaker 2: In fact, the entire--
Speaker 1: Nation, yeah.
Speaker 2: --all of America--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --because of the reputation of Jesse Helms.  He was the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --first conservative white--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --candidate who--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Started out being anti-Helms sentiment that'll base some support for Harvey Gantt.  And, and then when people started to hear Harvey and how articulate he was on the issues, all over the nation it became a cause.  It became perhaps one of the most, perhaps the most exciting political campaign I've ever been involved in, including the ones that I've, that I've been in for myself sense then.
Speaker 2: Certainly the most publicized.
Speaker 1: It was, it was a very publicized campaign.  And most of the campaign we were leading in the polls.  Unfortunately we lost.  I think the final margin was like forty-seven percent to fifty-two percent or something like that, some fractions, forty-seven and a half to fifty-two and a half.
Speaker 2: It was close.
Speaker 1: Yeah, very close.
Story_ID: 74050
Speaker 1: And then in 1991 and 1992 the pressure got turned up on the state legislature to create minority congressional districts or congressional district, at least one congressional district that a minority candidate could win in.  Because, as we were talking before we started the interview, the last member of Congress North Carolina had ever had was George White in 1898.  We hadn't had anybody.  Even though the population of North Carolina is about 23, 25 percent African American, no African American had ever been elected to Congress from North Carolina in the 20th century.  And so they drew one congressional district.  The Department of Justice said no, you can draw two minority influenced congressional districts, so the legislature went back in, drew a second minority district.
Speaker 2: Now, now, now one of the statistics on--out of North Carolina in terms of population, you know, who are--what per- percentage of the population is black or--
Speaker 1: Generally about twenty--somewhere between 23 and 25 percent black population.  And of course, those blacks had been dispersed in so many ways to create Democratic congressional districts.  And--for the first time in 1991, 1992 districts were redrawn in such a way that you could elect a minority candidate out in the 1st district, out in eastern North Carolina, and in the 12th district, which is the district that I now represent.  Well, long story short, a lot of people think that the district was drawn for me.  Truth of the matter is district was not drawn for me at all.  I thought it was being drawn for Harvey Gantt.  And so as soon as the district was drawn, first thing I was doing was calling Harvey Gantt saying, "Hey, I'm ready to manage another political campaign, let's go," (laughter).  Harvey says, "No, I'm not running," and about an hour into the conversation he talks me into running, and here I am, a member of Congress, 12th district, North Carolina.
Story_ID: 74051
Speaker 1: Was it a tough campaign?
Speaker 2: It was a great campaign.  No, I wouldn't say it was a tough campaign.  It was--the 12th district is the most progressive congressional district North Carolina has ever had.  And you had four of the most progressive candidates North Carolina had ever had for Congress in a Democratic primary.  And it was a highly contested primary because everybody assumed that whoever won the first time would be able to retain the seat.  So the 1992 campaign was a very hotly contested campaign between four candidates.  And you essentially had a candidate from each of the four population centers in the district.  I was from Charlotte, had a candidate, Jones from--who was a cit--city councilman in Greensboro, Mickey Michaux, who was a member of the state legislature from Durham, and Larry Little, who was on the city council in Western Salem.  And the four of us kind of fought it out, not in a physical sense.  It was, it was an exciting campaign because for the first time you had a progressive articulation of the issues by people, all of whom would have been, any one of whom would have been qualified to, to serve this district well.  And it, so it turned out that I was able to win it.
Speaker 1: What were some of the key issues that, that you articulated?
Speaker 2: Well, for the first time people were talking about affordable housing and mass transit, not just roads, and economic empowerment, and employment opportunities, and you know, affirmative action, and schools, and education and the federal government's role in education.  I mean it was a, it was a, it was a, it was a wonderful articulation of, of progressive positions in what was the first progressive congressional district, the most progressive congressional district North Carolina had ever had.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And continues to be.
Story_ID: 74052
Speaker 1: Okay.  What have been I guess--you, you were elected in '92 [1992].  You--
Speaker 2: Ninety-two [1992], started--
Speaker 1: --serving in '93 [1993].
Speaker 2: --in '93 [1993], right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So you were, your, your term has been pretty much consistent with the Clinton Administration until the last, last couple of years I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and also, but more importantly, I think, consistent with--at the same time minority districts were being created in North Carolina.  Minority districts were being created in a number of other states, so I came into Congress with seventeen new minority African-American, members of Congress.  It increased the--it almost doubled the size of, of the Congressional Black Caucus.  So the Congressional Black Caucus became a much more powerful force in terms of numbers.  Some people say not so, not as powerful in terms of direction because a lot of the minority representatives represent a different kind of constituency than the Congressional Black Caucus had been.   If you think about pre-1992, all of the minority representatives were from large northern cities or large southern cities.  Atlanta [Georgia] and New Orleans [Louisiana] were the southern cities that had representation.  Dallas, Texas, had representation.  Houston [Texas], I don't--
Speaker 1: Houston (unclear).
Speaker 2: Houston had representation, right.  But all of large cities, I mean New York [New York], Cleveland [Ohio], Los Angeles [California], that's what the Congressional Black Caucus was.  And then all of a sudden you get rural representatives.  Like Eva Clayton from Eastern North Carolina had a rural constituency or Sanford Bishop from Georgia, who had a rural constituency.  And so it's kind of harder to coalesce the Black Caucus behind all of the issues that it had historically been coalescing behind.  But there was an interest, and it's always--it's been an interesting time to be a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.  And, and as you said, it also coincided with the Clinton Administration.  Ninety-two [1992] and ninety-six [1996] were his election years.  And so that was interesting to be involved in that.  But it also coincided with the loss of the Democratic majority in the House.  In '93 [1993] and '94 [1994] we were in the majority, but in the '94 [1994] election Republicans took over the House of Representatives, and so we've been in the minority ever since.  So, you know, there's, there's been some good, there's been some bad as, as part of this transition.
Speaker 1: Now was J. C. Watts, Oklahoma elected about the same time or did he came in to manage--
Speaker 2: J. C., J.C. was there a little bit before I got there.  I don't know exactly when.  I mean--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --he might have been in--
Speaker 1: --Watt or Watts.  There's probably some confusion that people have about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a lot of confusion about that when I first got there.
Speaker 1: They're definitely different.
Speaker 2: I got a lot of his mail.  I'm sure he--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --got a lot of my mail.  I got a lot of his phone calls.  I'm sure he got a lot of mine.  But yeah, we are philosophically and politically different.  He's a Republican and I'm a Democrat.  And he's, you know, regarded as a conservative, although I'm not sure J. C. is as conservative as people think he is.  He actually did some pretty good things for us while, while he was there, especially on the affirmative action front.  So, everything he did was not bad.  I mean he, he, he did his share of bad things, [quote-unquote] "bad" being synonymous with Republican identified things (laughter).  But J. C. and I are good friends, and I think he, he, he did some good things while he was a member of Congress.
Story_ID: 74053
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now what, what are the highlights of your, of your terms in Congress so far?  I mean what would you think they are?
Speaker 2: Well, you know--
Speaker 1: What are you proudest of I guess I'd ask you?  What, what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I think the thing I'm proudest of is, is to be able to go into my constituency, into a community and have people for the first time believe that they have a representative.  There's a sense of disenfranchisement in our community for years and years.  I mean nobody ever thought that they would see a member of Congress in the community in, in the places, in their barbershops, in you know.  And I think that the thing I'm proudest of is, is the notion that, that they have taken ownership of this congressional seat, and they believe that, that I speak for them, and they believe that their voice will be heard in the process.  Now that's, you know, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's something that's difficult to grab a hold to and, and put your arms around.  And a lot of reporters, when I say that to 'em, say well, you--that's just because you haven't accomplished anything.  We actually have accomplished a lot.  I mean we've done a lot in housing, and transportation, and community development, and you know, I was in the heart of the impeachment fight and this and that.  But in terms of the thing that I'm proudest of is just to be able to stand on the shoulders of people and feel confident that I am their voice and speaking for them.
Speaker 1: Now, now there's an interesting--you've, you've taken some interesting approaches to gauging the, the ideas of the people that you serve.  One approach is Trading Places in which you--which I think started off as a gimmick you say--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --but, but, but tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I started it out because I never could get, could, I never could get reporters and the media to cover anything substantive.  So we were looking for a way to get media coverage, and so we decided okay, let's go out and actually work in some work settings, go into warehouses, work beside people, bus tables in restaurants, wash hair in beauty salons (laughter), go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Did you do that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah--be a greeter on the, on the bus, you know, when people get on.  Well, you know, I've, I've done a--make candy in the candy factory.  I mean, you know, there are all kinds of different things we've done over the years.  And so it was kind of a gimmick starting out.  What I started to realize fairly quickly, is a wonderful way to get close to constituents.
Story_ID: 74229
Speaker 1: I was asking you about Trading Places, and you were telling me that it started off as a gimmick and to get the media to give some attention maybe to what you all were doing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then what we found was that it was a wonderful idea to just get out there and get close to people to get them to express themselves and talk about issues and to understand more about the diversity of the district that I represent.  So, I mean I end up in--my, my staff pushed together all of these wonderful work settings, and I get to find out all of the diverse things that are going on in my congressional district that otherwise I probably would never get, get information about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in Wake Up 911, I think, from what I've read, you, you had some concerns about civil liberties being lost to some of the [unclear - background noise].
Speaker 2: Well, I think, you know, you serve on the judiciary committee, which is what I do, you are always, from day one I've been one of the advocates for personal liberties, civil liberty, constitutional rights.  And when you get--when you have something happen like happened on September 11, the natural tendency is for the government to feel like it can intrude more on the personal lives of people.  They say they are protecting you from (laughter), from terrorism.  The question I sometimes ask is okay, if you're protecting me from terrorism, who is protecting me from you?  And who's protecting the--me from the government intruding into my personal life?  And who, who is protecting citizens from having their phones tapped and their phone calls listened into, and their mail looked at, and--you know, so we--
Speaker 1: We have a history, I mean as black people we--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, there is--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --a history of that, yeah.  There is a history of that, so--and that history plus my legal background plus my service on the judiciary committee would naturally put me in a position to be one of the people who would be expressing those concerns.  And I have expressed some of those concerns, yeah.
Speaker 1: Have there--have things materialized like--I mean in, in a way that, that causes some apprehension about those, those rights being--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I think the Patriot Act gives the attorney general and the president--President--of the United States an unprecedented authority that the attorney general has never had before to designate people and organizations as terrorist organizations or threats to the United States and use that as a basis for monitoring their telephone conversations, monitoring their personal activities, monitoring the organizational activities in much the same way that J. Edgar Hoover was doing it improperly during the Civil Rights Movement.  So yeah, the authority is there now, and some people say the authority is being abused.  I mean we've locked up a lot of people without bringing formal charges against them.  We've locked them up without right to counsel.  I mean and those are, those are things that I think we have to be very concerned about in, in a Democratic society.
Story_ID: 74230
Speaker 1: Okay.  Have, have you taken a position on reparations?  That's a topic of discussion in the black community--
Speaker 2: Well, take--I think I've taken a position that we should study the issue.  There really never has been a reparations bill introduced.  The bill that has been introduced has gotten so much--so--been so mischaracterized is a bill that would provide for the creation of an independent commission to study whether repar--reparations is something that might ought to be considered, and I support that.  And then I would await the result of that commission study and look at those, look at what they find and decide whether I support reparations or not.  I mean there are some practical problems with reparations - who gets the money?  What do they get (laughter)?  You know, I may be preferable after a study to, to continue the methodical process of affirmative action that was designed to in a sense be reparative of, of some of the setbacks that we suffered during, during slavery and after slavery, as a result of discrimination or as a result of slavery.  So, I, I mean I don't, I don't have a, a firm opinion that reparations in and of itself is a good thing, but I do think that it should be studied.  And I think that's what a commission could do in ways that, that you're not gonna be able to accomplish in a public debate about it.
Speaker 1: So, so you're saying that you don't--you're not sure if the black community is owed anything in or--I mean until after a study's been--
Speaker 2: No, I'm not saying that the--oh, yeah, I know the black community is owed a lot.  I just haven't taken a firm position on reparations as a means of compensating them for it.  It may be that the methodical process of going through affirmative action and getting--affirmative action in a sense is designed to give people, a class of people a one-up, right?  So that might be a, a logical way to address the disparity of that's being created by discrimination.  But there's no question that black people have been--they are owed a lot, yeah.  The question is how are you gonna pay 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay, the method of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or how it's gonna work out, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It sort of suggested that education might be a way--
Speaker 2: Might be.  That--
Speaker 1: --or some other, any other combination of the housing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --education--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --things (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's what 40 acres and a mule was supposed to be, you know, a, a, a, a form of reparations I suppose, nev--never got delivered unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 74231
Speaker 1: What, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope that this generation of young people will, will be better off educationally, economically, emotionally, prestigiously (laugher) than, than my generation.  I mean I think that was my mother's aspirations for me.  She wants me to be better educated, better employed, better able to cope with the future than she was able to be.  And I think that's my aspiration for, for my children.  But I don't think we can leave it all to the next generation because we too are citizens of this country, and we deserve to, to share in the bounty of this country while we live.  And so I don't wanna see any discrimination.  I want affirmative action to make up for discrimination that has taken place in the past.  I want my people to have dignity.  I want my people to have a voice in the political process.  And I want us to be--to have the benefits of everything that the founding fathers of this country said that they were giving to us as a nation.  And when they said 'em, obviously they meant them, meant to be saying them only about white men.  We now have to take that constitutional framework and apply it to every single citizen, whether they are white men, white women, black men, black women, Asians, Hispanics.  I mean our--the constitutional ideal is a wonderful ideal.  We just need to make sure that it--that, that ideal is equally available to people.
Story_ID: 74232
Speaker 1: Okay, I wanted to ask you maybe some questions and follow up--backtrack and follow up on a couple of things that you said before.  You mentioned a role in the impeachment hearings and so forth.  What, what, what, what was your role in--what, what did you--what was your take on that?  What did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I was on the judiciary committee, the House Judiciary Committee that had the original responsibility for hearing the case.  And I thought we did a terrible job of, of hearing the case.  I mean we never looked at any evidence.  We had a bunch of people come in who knew very little about what was going on, and then we took a vote.  And my role in the process was to keep reminding people that the President of the United States of all people deserves the entitlements that, that the Constitution assures to him, and that if we short circuit the process this time, then we've set a precedent for short circuiting it in the future.  So, regardless of how we like or don't like what the president did, our responsibility is to follow the process that the founding fathers set up for us in situations of this kind.  And I don't think we did a very good job of doing that.
Speaker 1: Now what, what was your assessment of the Clinton Administration?
Speaker 2: I think the Clinton Administration was by and large a successful administration.  Despite the personal issues that the president had that resulted in the impeachment process, most everything else that the president touched had us heading in the right direction, in the right direction.  I mean economically we were doing well; employment was low; inflation was low; we got the deficit down; we were doing better in terms of education.  I mean you know in any, any criteria you can measure this on, with the exception of the pers--the, the president's issues that led to the impeachment process and possibly the criminal law front where we were harder on, on crime without any real--I mean I think we, we made matters worse in the criminal law area in, in some respects by mandatory minimal sentencing and ending up with more and more people in jail.  But except for that and, and the impeachment, I think everything else the president touched turned to gold.
Story_ID: 74233
Speaker 1: It's a popular saying in the black community that we--that Clinton was our first black president and we--would you agree with that--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, I think he was the first president who could go into a room of black people and feel as comfortable as he did going into a room of white people.  And that is not always a given for a white person, president or otherwise.  Black people kind of take that for granted because we live in a white world.  I never get concerned if I walk into a room and I'm the only black person in that room.  But white, white--
Speaker 1: It happens all the time.
Speaker 2: It happens all the time.  But white people aren't, aren't accustomed to that, and, and, and Clinton was.  I mean he was, he was at ease; he was at home; he was--you know, and I think a lot of it had to do with, with his upbringing, which has, you know, a lot of parallels with my own upbringing.  I mean I, I--there are people who--there are black politicians who I don't feel always are as comfortable in the black community as they are in the white community.  You understand what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And, and so, I mean this--in that sense, no, I mean no, Clinton's skin was not black, but he, he was the kind of person who could be at ease in any kind of setting.  And I've seen him in blacks, in completely black settings absolutely as, as much at ease as he would be in completely white settings.  And that's a, that's a unique talent.  It's a unique gift to have.
Speaker 1: Do, do you think that Hillary Clinton is, you know, is, is gonna--has this, a, a similar connection to the black community or no?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't--I mean I think it would be difficult for, for most white politicians to have that kind of level of comfort in the black community. I mean, it may--
Speaker 1: So you saying basically that Clinton had it and everybody else has got to try to find it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I think they've got--he set a high standard, and the black community is gonna be looking for it.  They're gonna be looking for candidates who can meet that standard and exceed it.  I, I tell some of the candidates that are running for president now, or may be running for can--president now, that what they wanna do is, is meet the personal comfort standard and then surpass the delivery standard.  What they deliver needs to go beyond what Clinton delivered, but they've gotta first meet that personal comfort standard, and--because the black community's is gonna be expecting that from now on.  I, I mean I think that's, that's one of the things [President George W.] Bush is suffering from.  I mean he just--people--he doesn't feel comfortable when he gets with us (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, people have criticized Al Gore for not being comfortable with anybody.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: That's, that's a popular assessment of him.  I don't know if I, I don't necessarily think it's always true 'cause it's the popular assessment of it.  And--
Speaker 2: Well, he certainly was not a Bill Clinton when it came to interfacing with the black community I mean.  But he was not that much different interfacing with the white community either.  I mean I, I just think he--you know, some people are people, people persons and others are not.  And Bill Clinton is a unique people person in my opinion.
Story_ID: 74234
Speaker 1: Now, the Bush Administration came out of the blocks appointing black people in these high positions, you know, Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell and others.  What, what your assessment of that and, and, and  how that's--and does that, does that make the admin--the Bush Administration more palatable to black people or--
Speaker 2: No, I, I mean I think to a large extent that's a re--as a result of the [President Bill] Clinton standard that was set.  I mean in terms of appointments, I don't think we're ever gonna go back to where we were, where you just have one token black person in an administration and say that that's sufficient.  You're gonna have diverse administrations going forward, and I think that's a tribute to, to Bill Clinton's Administration more than it is to anybody else's.  And so in that sense--now what I like about what Bush has done is he's taken, he's taken it to some other standards, because he's, he's appointed black people to positions that were not quote-unquote "stereotypical" black positions.  I mean, you know, it's one thing to appoint somebody to be director of HUD [The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development].  It's another thing to appoint somebody to be a national security advisor.  And that's why I think the appointment--Clinton's appointment to commerce was so critical.  I mean, you know, no black person had ever been appointed as Secretary of Commerce.  So, I think we, we've gotta, we gotta keep this process moving so that people get evaluated based on the quality of what they can deliver and not, not blackness or, or whiteness.  And I think that's gonna get you a diverse administration henceforth now and forever more.
Speaker 1: Do you think--well, this, this--(unclear)--well, do you see the, the country electing a black president in your lifetime?
Speaker 2: I think it's possible in my lifetime.  I think the most probable route is via the vice presidency first.  And then if the president dies, you've got, you've got a black president.  And I think that black president could be reelected the next time because he would be running as an incumbent president.  I think it's gonna be difficult to straight out of the blocks elect a black president who's running as the presidential nominee.  I think it's more likely you end up--and, and I think there's gonna be pressure in 2004, both on--you know, suppose [Vice President Richard "Dick"] Cheney ain't able to be the vice presidential nominee.  Who's, who are your likely char--choices?  And if you get a black pres--a vice presidential nominee out of the Republican Party, you're gonna have a vice--black vice presidential nominee out of the Democratic Party.  The pressure will be so great.  If it doesn't happen in 2004, it'll happen in 2008.  Somebody's gonna recognize the political potential of having a, an African American on the ticket.
Speaker 1: Are, are there any good candidates now that you think--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, I think there, there's beginning to be a cadre of young black people who--they'll be, they'll be talent around.
Story_ID: 74235
Speaker 1: Now you've--you're on the verge now of--today of traveling to Asia.  And you've, you've, you've traveled extensively in Africa and, and in Europe already.  What, what about African American relationships to Africa right now?  I mean where, where, where do they stand in terms of economic ties and, and cultural ties (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, not as strong as they probably will be in the future, stronger than they have been in the past, but not as strong as they need to be.  But they're growing.  You know, fifteen, twenty years ago Africa wasn't even on the map as far as U.S. relations.  I think we gotta keep pushing the Africa development agenda, and the Africa trade agenda, and the Africa AIDS agenda.  And we gotta keep pushing the viability of democracy in Africa, because I mean, you know, just I don't want a, a black dictator more--anymore than I want a white dictator.  I mean, you know, there needs to be governmental accountability, whether it's Africa, or in the United States, or South America, or Asia, or Europe.  And the best process to bring about accountability from my perspective is, is Democratic elections that are fair and, and transparent.  And, and that's not happening consistently everywhere in Africa.  I mean some countries are doing it, but other countries still have a ways to go.
Story_ID: 74236
Speaker 1: Now, I know you have a lot to still do, but we always ask this question, and the, the, the question is what would you consider as your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I even think about that question at this point.  I mean I--hopefully my legacy is to do something good every day, then let it speak for itself.  I mean I don't--you know, I don't--I'm sure that when the history books are written, Eva Clayton and I will go down as the next Africa-American members of Congress after George H. White.  And I wonder whether George H. White realized that he was writing a legacy when he rose on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 19--in 1898 and gave his defiant speech saying that Phoenix-like, someday we will rise up and come again, you know.  He probably thought he was just being eloquent on that day.  So I don't--you know, I don't try to, I don't try to get carried away with what I'm doing.  I mean I try to do a good job.  We just do.  We don't write legacies (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do, do you feel--I mean how does it make you feel being the first African-American congressman in North Carolina in ninety-one years?  I mean that people put a lot of the trust and a lot of their hopes and dreams ride with you, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, there was heavy--it's a, it's a heavy experience, and it was definitely heavy the night that I won the election because--and I think I said this the night I won the election in 1992, that a lot of this has to do with timing.  It's, it's not about Mel Watt, because there are a lot of people over that almost hundred-year history between George White, and Eva Clayton, and Mel Watt on the other end.  A lot of people who have been magnificently qualified.  But for the fact that they were black, they would have been serving in the Congress of the United States.  They were qualified; they were articulate.  So, there's nothing unique about us.  We just happened to be the beneficiaries of being in the right place, and people fighting, and agitating, and demanding a place in a democratic government.  And to think that there's something unique about me that allows me to, to have achieved this on my own is just to delude myself.  I think--and, and, and to some extent, that's what I meant when I've said that historically, I mean, you know, you--I've lived a charmed life.  I've been in the right place at the right time.  I've tried to prepare myself, and I tell young kids this all the time, what should--and they ask what, what should I do to become a congressman of the United States?  Live your life one day at a time.  Do what you can do that one day, and be prepared for the opportunities that present themselves to you the next day.  And that's all I've done.  I mean I, I've tried to live my life one day at a time.  And when opportunities present themselves, I try to be prepared to, to step forward and meet the challenge.  And that's what I'm gonna keep trying to do.

Speaker 1: Now did--your mother is--how did she feel about your, your big success?  Did she, you know, did, did she say that she knew all along that you'd be successful like this?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think my mother's proud of me.  But you know, my mother, she, she never did trust lawyers (laughter), and I'm not sure she really trustS politicians either.  So (laugher), so but notwithstanding that, I mean there's a great deal of pride.  And one little interesting story that you may be interested in.  Finally after, you know, in the 1990 census and when they drew the congressional districts, my mother's precinct was not in my congressional district.  This time I was able to get the state legislature to, to put her into my congressional district.  So this is actually the first time--this year was actually the first time my mother has ever had the opportunity to vote for me.  And so I think she was very proud about that and very upbeat about being able to rally the community that I grew up in to go out and vote, and rally the church members and do that kind of stuff.  But my mother's cool.  She's, she, she doesn't get too carried away with this stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She'll tell you in a minute I never trusted lawyers (laughter), and I never trusted politicianS (laughter), and my son was both of em, so.  No, but she loves her son, and she, she's proud of me.
Speaker 1: Now, now, now is your father still living?
Speaker 2: No, my father died probably eight years or so ago.  My stepfather is still living, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.
Story_ID: 74238
Speaker 1: So, now this question is a little bit different from the legacy question, but I know you're a self-effacing man and everything, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I actually would like to be remembered just a regular guy because that's what I am.  I mean, you know, I--my life experiences is about being a regular guy.  I think that's my benefit in the political process.  I take that to the political process.  I like for my constituents to think of me as just one of the regular guys that they can talk to.  And I don't, you know, I don't have any exaggerated notion of how I would like to be remembered.  I'd like to be remembered as a good guy who stood up for what he believed in in every setting, and ended up standing up for what he believed constituents believed in in the congressional setting.
Speaker 1: That's not all, that's not all that common these days, you know.
Speaker 2: Well (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: I gotta be, I gotta be (laughter) who I, who I am.  I can't be whether, whether it's common or not (laughter).

Socialserve.com is a, an organization that puts online information about housing, affordable housing in the community so that people who are looking for affordable housing can go to a website and search out that website, see the home, and they don't have to go and actually visit the location.  They can narrow their choice down just from the website.

Speaker 1: Myrick, MYRICK, first name Sue.  And the mayor's name is Pat McCrory, Patrick McCrory, MCCROREY, I believe it's spelled or C-R-O-R-Y, I think, not R-E-Y.
Speaker 2: This is myself and my wife, Eulada, with Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton.  And that was taken during Hillary Clinton's campaign, so that would have been '99 [1999] or 2000.
Speaker 1: Two thousand [2000].
Speaker 2: Two thousand [2000].  That was after he was not president anymore I believe, or maybe, maybe he was still, still president, yeah, yeah, I guess he would have been still president.  But he was not running at that time.
Speaker 1: That's me in Kumasi, Ghana, when I was in enstooled, E-N-S-T-O-O-L-E-D, enstooled as a, an African chief.  What do they--

Speaker 2: Ashantehene.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Okay, the year?
Speaker 2: That was probably 1986 also.  But my staff might be able to give you more definition on that.
Speaker 1: That's my wife and me and our oldest son, Bryan Watt, in the middle there.  And I think that was--that might have been the first time we were headed to Krefeld, Germany, I believe.  So that would have been maybe 1990 or thereabouts.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  I think we should probably get a spelling on Krefeld.
Speaker 1: K-R-E-F-E-L-D.
Speaker 2: That is me and one of my favorite teachers, Mattie Grigsby, G-R-I-G-S-B-Y.  She was my high school algebra in the Charlotte Mecklenburg schools.  That's what the CMS stands for up in the corner of that billboard--was doing a tribute to teachers.  So they did billboards around the city, and they did a big taping of me and my favorite--and one of my favorite teachers.

Speaker 2: Two thousand and one [2001].
Speaker 1: I think that's Jason--that's Bryan Watt, my oldest son in the far left.
Speaker 2: That's Jason Watt next to him, my youngest son.
Speaker 1: That's Jason Watt as an, as an adult.
Speaker 2: That's down in the far right-hand corner is Jason and Bry--Bryan and Jason as adults.

Speaker 2: A couple of my staff people are on it, Tawanna (ph.) Wilson Allen.  This is the group that traveled to Kumasi, Ghana, and--when we were formalizing the Sister City arrangement.  That would have been about 1986 or thereabouts.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  And you're not in that photo, correct?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not in that photo.  You've got Tawanna Wilson Allen, who's one of my staff members; Tracey Lovett, who was a staff member; Dawn Baker back here hiding behind this gentleman is my district director.  This lady here--my staff can give you here name--is the director of the Charlotte Sister City Program.

Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Is Lovett L-O-V-E-T-T?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: That's Jason Watt surrounded by young kids from Kumasi, Ghana.  Jason is a elementary school teacher and educator, and kids just kind of flock to him.  I mean, you know, (laughter) I, I don't think you could have staged a picture like.  That was all impromptu.  The kids were just flocking to him because I mean I think kids really realize when people like 'em.  And that would have been '86 [1986] too probably.
Speaker 1: My high school graduation picture, 1963, York Road High School graduation picture.
Speaker 2: --from Vineland, New Jersey (laughter).
