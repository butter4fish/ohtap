Story_ID: 860
Speaker 1: You know, Mrs. Farris, in your book, you talk about that this is a time of reflection.  And you're in that season, and so I think it's very appropriate that we're doing this interview today for the National Park Service.  So I'd like to start at your birth home.  Well, I'd like to start at 501 Auburn Avenue.  And I want you to tell us about what your earliest memory is of growing up there.
Speaker 2: Well, it was home.  My memory of, it was a very close-knit family.  Of course, my parents lived in the home with my grandmother and grandfather before he left us.  And it was a very comfortable place, fun place.  We always had neighbors who would come in as family, and we played with the children in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Well, let's--can you give your parents' names and your grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: Okay, my grandparents.  My grandfather was Reverend Dr. A. D. Williams and that was Adam Daniel Williams, and his wife, my grandmother, Jennie Celeste Williams, okay.  My father was Martin Luther King, Sr.  And my mother was Alberta Christine Williams King.
Speaker 1: Now, I want, do you have an earliest memory of being at the house?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Can you tell it?
Speaker 2: The earliest memories at the home?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, I fondly remember that because that's where I grew up.  It was a very nice two-story, as they call it, Victorian-style home.  And my parents lived with my mother's parents.  So we all shared that.  There was Rev. A. D. Williams, my grandmother, Jennie Celeste Williams, mother, dad and the three of us and my grandmother's sister who we referred to as Aunt Ida.  She lived there.  So it was a pretty big family.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me something about each one of them?  Can you do that?  Like, let's start with Aunt Ida.  What was she like and--?
Speaker 2: Aunt Ida was very quiet and reserved, but she loved the children.  And so she would oft times stay with us when my parents had to go away.  And she would read stories to us and very interestingly enough, sometimes it wouldn't be stories.  She would read from the encyclopedia.  So we learned lots of history that way.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the stories she read or learned?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I remember that she would show us maps, and we would see different places across the world, particularly, Africa.  But as books, as children have them now, I don't think there were too many of those children's books.  So she relied on the encyclopedia.  We learned lots from that.
Speaker 1: Now, what about your grandmother?  What was she like and what was her role in the household?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, she was a typical minister's wife.  And so, of course, she had the skills of being a hostess and very receiving and cordial to people because people were always in and out of the home.  So she served that role very well I think.
Speaker 1: And was she the-- would she take care of preparations of food and everything?
Speaker 2: Yes, lots of times she would prepare.  In fact, they all shared in that, my mother too.  But that was one of the chores that they all joined in and prepared the meals.  So we had good, home-cooked meals starting with breakfast and dinner.
Speaker 1: What would be a typical breakfast?
Speaker 2: Cheese and eggs, bacon, toast.
Speaker 1: Now, what about your grandfather?  Was he a--
Speaker 2: I don't remember a lot about my grandfather because he left when I was very young.  But I do remember him as a stalwart kind of giant in my estimation, and he was very strict.  But, you know, he died when I was very young, so I really don't have lots of memories of him.
Speaker 1: Do you remember how young you were?
Speaker 2: I guess I must have been about six or seven.  We could research that and find out exactly when he died.  But I was the one that discovered him when he passed because I was the first grand [grandchild] and so my grandparents just took me over, more or less, and of course, we all were there in the home, house.  And they stayed downstairs.  Sometimes I would stay downstairs with them.  The particular morning when he passed, I was in the kitchen with my grandmother as she prepared the breakfast.  And this was on a Sunday morning, and he was preparing to come to church, get ready for church.  And all of a sudden, we heard this loud noise that really shook the house.  And the kitchen was not far away from the bedroom where they stayed.  He was there dressing, and when this noise came, my grandmother said, go and see where your granddaddy is.  And I went.  And he had fallen.  And, of course, I guess he was taking his last breath because I remember this kind of loud noise that he was making.  And I went back, and I said, "Granddad is on the floor sleeping."  And, of course, my grandmother rushed and that's when he'd had this stroke of apoplexy.  And shortly after that, he was gone.
Story_ID: 861
Speaker 1: And that was probably frightening for you as a young child?
Speaker 2: Not really because I didn't envision him being dead.  Like I said, he was on the floor snoring, so.
Speaker 1: Now, describe your mother and, you know, let's describe your mother and, you know, what she was like and if you would give her name too?
Speaker 2: Alberta Christine Williams King.  And my mother was a typical minister's wife.  She took care, of course, of the activities in the home, like cleaning the house, cooking and taking care of us children.  And, of course, she was a musician so she often would play the piano.  And she wanted all of her children to take the piano lessons.  And, of course, I think I did better than the boys in learning to play the piano.
Speaker 1: And your father?
Speaker 2: My father was very strict.  And, of course, we, you know, obeyed him, but he was a very strict father, but very caring about the children, the welfare.  Whatever we needed to do, he always saw to it that we did it.
Speaker 1: So, Mrs. Farris, you talk about a family where there are two ministers' wives and two ministers there, you know, in one household.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what was the sort of a typical day?  I wanna get to Sunday later, but let's talk about sort of a typical day at the house.
Speaker 2: Well, the women were there at the house because my father and my grandfather, they were out.  I mean my grandfather would come down the street to the church.  And my father was then about his schooling at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and so forth.  So it was the women typically who took care of the home, the cleaning, the cooking and so forth.
Speaker 1: Do you remember holidays at all and what they were like?
Speaker 2: I remember Christmas was a fun time and, in fact, there's a picture in the birth home, a family picture, and we were all dressed up.  This is right after Christmas, and we had gotten these new clothes and things, and we were all dressed up and had a picture on Christmas.  And, of course, you got the children's things, the dolls and the trains, electric train, and things like that, tricycle.
Story_ID: 862
Speaker 1: And do you, I wanna go to a question that we ask sometimes, and that's what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up?  Can we--you know, it doesn't matter what order they're in, but--
Speaker 2: Sights, smells, sounds.  The sights I remember our surroundings, the houses across the street, down the street.  And they're very much like they were when we were there.  I mean they've kind of restored them, but what they called the "shot-gun" houses where you could, you know, look from the front door to the back door, straight through the house.  So those were typical homes, and as I said, it's very much now like it was then.  I mean all of those houses that are there now, within that block, are the houses that were still there.  So and we would go from house to house, in fact, stand on one side of the street and talk across the street to children on the other side of the street.  And they would come, we would all play in our backyard most of the time.
Speaker 1: You mean the children would come over to your backyard primarily?
Speaker 2: Yes, the backyard.
Speaker 1: So, what about sounds?  Any more--
Speaker 2: What kind of sounds?
Speaker 1: Um-hum, that remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: A lot of talking, loud talking back and forth across the street, you know, hollering across the street to the neighbor across the street.  The sights are very much like they are today.  We had, in our backyard, we had some fruit trees, like a peach tree.  And, of course, we used to play in the backyard a lot and children from around would come.  And we'd play baseball, using a tennis ball and a wooden thing as a bat.  And then the boys would run around, climb the tree.  There were peaches, and I remember them, you know, getting those green peaches and sometimes cutting them, eating green peaches.
Speaker 1: What about sounds?
Speaker 2: Sounds were children talking and hollering and we didn't have, you know, there were no trains or things like that.  And, of course, no transportation was running past our house.
Speaker 1: What about smells?
Speaker 2: Smells?  Flowers.  What kind of flowers were they?  I don't remember, but we always had flowers in the yard and all around the neighborhood.  So, you know, you'd smell those flowers.
Story_ID: 863
Speaker 1: How about the block that you, because really your life was probably that block, right?  Block or two?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So who were the neighbors?  Who were some of the people on the block?
Speaker 2: There was the people who lived next door to us on either side on the, to my left will be the, at that time, the Zachery's.  And then on the right-hand side, this lady had a bigger house, and she had roomers.  And I cannot think of her name right now.  Ms. Darden, yeah, Ms. Darden.  She had a big house, big two-story house, and she would always have boarders there.  Then I didn't know many of the people.  I don't remember many of those who were across the street in what they called the shot gun houses, but on the corner, on the next corner, there was this apartment house.  And one of our church members lived there, Ms. Rutland, and she had some nieces and nephews.  And they would come over, from time to time, and we played a lot with them.  And then further down toward Howell Street was Professor Harper who was the principal of Booker Washington High School at that time.  And his grandson, his daughter and her son, who was Professor Harper's grandson, and his name was Emmett Procter.  And we played together.  And, of course, he was very close to my brothers.  And then two doors to my left was an apartment house.  And in that apartment house on the second floor lived a young friend of mine, Emma Jean Sims, and we used to play together, do things.  We went to elementary school together.
Speaker 1: Now, when you-- do you remember when your brother [Martin Luther King, Jr.] was born, both of your brothers?  But do you--
Speaker 2: No, I can't remember when they were born.  I was too young to remember that.
Speaker 1: You were too young.  So do you remember playing together or would they--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, we played together all the time.
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite games?
Speaker 2: And then Dad [ would play with us a lot, Chinese Checkers, he would play, and then later, Monopoly and so we played, you know, those kinds of games.  And, of course, we'd play our version of baseball, you know, with the wooden bat and all of that, and played out in the yard with that.
Speaker 1: So would you play with them all the time or did they play more with themselves and other boys?
Speaker 2: Well, I would go out from time to time.  And then the girls around there, we would play together, but the boys, you know, they played lot baseball.
Story_ID: 864
Speaker 1: Now, did you parents talk at all about your role as the youngest [oldest]?  Were you required to sort of look after your younger brothers [Martin Luther King, Jr.] [Alfred Daniel]?
Speaker 2: Well, in a way, yes.  I recall that someone had made a good cake and given it to our family.  And it was so good, the boys were just eating it away and slipping and getting it.  So Dad [Martin Luther King, Sr.] called us together, and so he told them, "You know, now, you're not supposed to--you know, you don't eat cake without permission.  You need to check with your mother or something."  And so as they were putting the cake up and my brother M.L., [Martin Luther King, Jr.] who you would refer to as Martin, but we called him "M.L", he said, and so Dad told him, now, Christine is the oldest.  So she's in charge.  So you'll have to check with her.  And, so as we were putting up the cake and everything, and there were crumbs around, and so it was so interesting and pitiful and M.L.  said, "Well, Christine, can I have some of these crumbs?" (laughter)  And, of course, I said, yes.
Speaker 1: So, were you a good big sister?
Speaker 2: I was a good, big sister, yes.
Speaker 1: Were you a disciplinarian yourself?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really.  That was supposed to be my role, but I wasn't really a disciplinarian cause a lot of times I would be with them.
Speaker 1: Tell me about what the relationship, you know, because siblings have relationships.  So can you talk about each of your brothers and yourself as young people?
Speaker 2: Well, we were very close because the three of us, I mean oft times, you know, we would go with my parents to places.  And so we were, were very close, and, of course, I'm being the only girl and the oldest, and Dad would stress that, "She is in charge".  Of course, they, you know, leaned on me a lot.  But we played together.
Speaker 1: So was M.L. or A.D. [Alfred Daniel], were they mischievous like boys are or--
Speaker 2: Typical boys, typical boys.  And I would want people to understand that.  I mean he was, he was normal, typical boy, played and things.
Speaker 1: So give an example because we all have memories.  So give an example from your memory.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I mean M.L. played those games, baseball, basketball.  We had a basketball thing out in the yard, and they would play that.  One day, and, of course, they were always, as I said, a little on the mischievous side.  We had a garage in the backyard, and it had a slight incline.  Dad kept the car in the garage, and, of course, typical boys wanting to explore and see what it was, they got in the car.  And apparently, Dad had left the keys in the car, and they turned on the ignition, and they went straight through the back of that garage.  And, of course, you know, they were taken care of when Dad found out (laughter) what had happened, yeah.  They were typical.  They were always exploring, seeing what things were all about.  And, of course, like all boys, they wanted to drive a car.  They weren't old enough to drive, so they were experimenting with the car, carried them right through the back of the garage.
Speaker 1: So how old were they about that time?
Speaker 2: Hum, I guess about nine, ten.
Speaker 1: So your father was pretty upset I bet ya.
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely (laughter).
Speaker 1: So they got a little hand to the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they got a little taken care of on that one.
Story_ID: 865
Speaker 1: So, now, let's go to some celebrations, like do you remember certain birthdays that were held, you know, there, either your birthday or do you have a favorite birthday?  Or do you remember your brothers' birthdays or?
Speaker 2: Well, on all of our birthdays, there would be the birthday cake, and we'd have birthday cake and ice cream.  I remember that very vividly, and occasionally, you know, maybe a church member or two would come by and bring us something.  But that was always a fun time, birthdays.
Speaker 1: Now, what is your earliest memory of church [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, I can remember coming to church.  We, that was a part of our life.
Speaker 1: But do you remember--
Speaker 2: We were in church every Sunday and Sunday school.  And then we would, after Sunday school, then we would go into the regular church service.  And then from the beginning, because my mother [Alberta Williams King] being a musician, then when we were old enough, then we started singing in the choir  We had a, you know, a young people's choir.  And we would sing in that choir.  And then Martin [Martin Luther King, Jr.], he was a soloist.  And Mother would take him to conventions, and it's interesting that he was a soloist.  I later became a soloist, but he would go around and sing.  And his, one of the favorite songs that he could sing, "I wanna be more and more like Jesus, I wanna be more and more like him".  And he would sing at those conventions.  And people would just, you know, marvel at him singing.
Speaker 1: Now, how old was he when he was singing?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: How old?  How old was he?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was young, I guess about nine, ten, something like that.
Speaker 1: So, now, with church, let's talk about the preparation for church, you know, like what time would people, I just wanna know the order of things.  Would your father be out the door or, you know, what was--
Speaker 2: Yes, he would always be out the door first.  And then Mother would see that we were properly dressed, and then he would follow.  But Dad [Martin Luther King, Sr.], since we lived only a block away from the church, he would be ready, and, you know, coming.  He would leave us and be on down to church, and we came with Mother to church.  And as we got a little older, then M.L. [Martin Luther King, Jr.] and A.D. [Alfred Daniel] would go along with Dad, and I would come along with Mother and my grandmother.
Speaker 1: And what was the position in the church?  So you would first go to Sunday school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, Sunday school.
Speaker 1: And then Sunday school would start when and after--
Speaker 2: At 9:00 o'clock, Sunday school started at 9:00 o'clock.  And church, I guess would be about 11:00, 11:30.  So it wouldn't be much time between Sunday school and church because Mother was always getting the choir prepared.  So, and that was a typical day.
Speaker 1: And then what--now, who taught you Sunday school?  Do you remember and were the boys separate from, well, you were in different classes, right, in Sunday school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I really don't remember all of the Sunday school teachers.  One was Ms. Lillian Watkins.  And she taught us, she's the only one that I really remember.  And she was also the church secretary.  So she was very close to us.
Speaker 1: Was she somewhat like a family member in some respects?
Speaker 2: In some respects because, as I said, she was the church secretary.  So therefore, we were very close to her.
Speaker 1: And then church, how would church start out?  What would be the beginning of the service, and where would you be expected to sit as a family?
Speaker 2: Okay, when they started out, they would have preliminary, what they called "prayer service".  The deacons would lead that, and they would sing hymns and pray.  And this was before the actual service began.  And, of course, as I was growing up, I would sit with mother and my grandmother, and it'd be mostly my grandmother because Mother was always playing the organ.  And then the boys, you know, it was hard to keep up with them, and as they grew older, then they wouldn't sit with us, you know, my godmother and my grandmother.  But the boys, they would sit with the other children, and they would be up in the balcony.  And I remember some of the times when the boys would sit up in the balcony, and they would be up there kind of playing.  And so Dad would stop, and if he was making an announcement or whatever, and he said, "M.L., you and A.D. come down here and sit with your grandmother."  And so they had to come from the balcony, come down and sit with mother, my grandmother.
Speaker 1: So what age were they?  Were they still around that nine, ten, that he was calling them down, you know?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum, right.
Speaker 1: And so you're about eleven, you know, and you're getting more mature.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 866
Speaker 1: Now, did you, when did it become apparent to you that you were, had a special role, you know, in the community and a special role in the church, you know, because preacher kids, sometimes it's hard to be a preacher's kid?
Speaker 2: Yes, but Ebenezer has always been like family, and so you didn't feel apart from them.  You just felt like, you know, you were part of that family.  And those church members would really see about us and watch over us and take care, bring us goodies and all that.
Speaker 1: So did you, I wanna ask you, what--do you remember any specific service around that time or, you know, sometimes when we hear music, it reminds us, you know, of growing up.  I mean, is there any--or the baptisms, I mean what--can you just sort of talk about what reminds you of church around that time, of Ebenezer?
Speaker 2: Well, the service was very much like it is now.  I mean you'd have the singing.  Ebenezer has always had good choirs and good singing.  And so we would be a part of that.  When I got old enough, then I became part of the choir.  And as I said, M.L. [Martin Luther King, Jr.] used to sing and Mother[Alberta Williams King] would take him with her to conventions, and he would sing solo, "I wanna be more and more like Jesus, I wanna be more and more like him".  So we were very much a part, you know, of the regular service.  And when we got old enough, then we became part of the choirs.
Speaker 1: Now, at this time that you're part of the choirs, is your mother still directing the choir or someone else has taken over?
Speaker 2: Someone else was probably taking over, yeah.
Speaker 1: And why do you think she, did it just become too much, you think, you know the--
Speaker 2: No, she was head of the Music Department.  So the church was expanding, and they had, you know, they had Choir Number 1, Choir Number 2 and finally, a children's choir.
Speaker 1: So you're talking about being part of the children's choir at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 867
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, let's, I'm gonna go back to the house a little bit just to talk about the family.  So the family never, did you have others that would stay with you from time to time?
Speaker 2: From time to time.  My father was very generous so some minister friends would come and stay and Mother had some friends who would come.  So we always had visitors in the home.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of those visitors and who came, you know, came in the home?
Speaker 2: Well, Reverend Roland Smith.  Of course, they're all deceased now.  He was a minister, and he used to come and in fact, he stayed with us for a while.
Speaker 1: And when you say "a while", how long is a while?  And so would he stay for several months?
Speaker 2: Several months, yes.
Speaker 1: And do you remember discussions around the dining room table cause the dining room table was very important for you, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's where we had our meal, and we learned many lessons around the dining room table.  And sometimes we would talk about experiences that we'd had at school, and then some jokes would be told, and we'd get a kick out of laughing about those.  So it was, dinnertime was kind of a fun time.
Speaker 1: So what time was dinnertime, usually?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would say about 4:00, yeah.
Speaker 1: Four o'clock?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And so it would be served.  In meals, would your mother [Alberta Williams King] serve the food or was someone else--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, they'd put the food on the table, and then you would help yourself.
Speaker 1: And could you eat, I mean everyone had to be seated before you could eat, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, had to be seated and say the grace.  Dad [Martin Luther King, Sr.]  would most of the time say the grace.
Speaker 1: Do you remember a time when you had a special visitor or there was a special discussion that, you know, sort of stood out?  Or was there ever any heated discussion that sticks with you or--
Speaker 2: Not specifically, but I mean since Dad was interested in the going's on in the community, and he would often talk about voting and the persons, you know, to whom he would be supporting.  And so we had that kind of consciousness because we always knew what was going on in terms of voting.  And that was, when we got old enough, that was one of the things that, you know, we had to do, was to vote.
Speaker 1: So what was the Atlanta that you grew up in like?  You know, when you're hearing these discussions, what are the things that your father's talking about and the things that are of concern, and you know.  Can you talk about that a little bit?
Speaker 2: Segregation, and he was always fighting against--
Story_ID: 868
Speaker 1: --the role that we were placed in, and how it was unfortunate.  And then sometimes, the word got out--the Ku Klux Klan was still active.  And it used to be frightening to hear them talk, although I never really experienced it because they would say, "The Klan is going to ride tonight", and they would ride in neighborhoods with their, you know, white hoods on and everything.  And that word would get out, but they never, ever came to our neighborhood.  We never, never saw that.  But it was kind of frightening to hear it, the word would get out in the community, "the Klan will be riding tonight".  But fortunately, they never came to our neighborhood.
Speaker 2: And when you start hearing these types of discussions, are you and, you know, your brothers and you between seven or eleven or are you a little older at that point?
Speaker 1: Yes, between seven, eleven and older because Dad [Martin Luther King, Sr.] would keep up with whatever was going on, and of course, he had a social consciousness, and, you know, that would be much of the talk at the dinner table, who was running for a particular office and who we would be voting for.
Speaker 2: And is this, what period are we talking about?  We're talking really around the, let's see, we're in the--
Speaker 1: Thirties [1930s].
Speaker 2: --1930s, okay.  And what is Atlanta like?  Do you have, did you have an idea or do you have an idea?  What are the issues at that point?  There's the Klan.  There's segregation.  What are the things that he's talking about?
Speaker 1: Yes, that's what, my father was very active in, you know, working on desegregation and everything.  And so that would be a lot of the dinner talk, about what was going on, you know, in the community and who, you know, to vote for, who would be the person that would probably serve the interests of minorities and so forth.  And then I remember Dad organizing members in the church and taking them down to the courthouse to register to vote.  And he was very active, you know, in the community in that way.  And I'm sure my brother [Martin Luther King, Sr.] [Alfred Daniel], you know, saw this, both my brothers.
Speaker 2: That that influenced them?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because you can't be around it and not--
Speaker 1: Right and not be a part of it.
Speaker 2: --be influenced by it.  Okay, now, the dinner table, was there a special way, seating for the dinner table that was expected?  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Okay, at one head of the table was Dad.  Mother [Alberta Williams King] was at the opposite end.  And when my grandmother [Jennie Celeste Williams] was with us, then she would be on one side, and I think I would always be on the side by my grandmother.  And then M.L. [Martin Luther King, Jr.] and A.D. [Alfred Daniel] and Aunt Ida, she was next to mother, my grandmother, and then M.L. and A.D. would be on the opposite side.
Speaker 2: And that was the way each dinner went?
Speaker 1: Each time when we sat for dinner, that's the way we sat.
Speaker 2: Now, did you, do you remember anything about--you know, cause a lot of times, you know, with holidays, and was it different in terms of dinner where like for holidays, you know, you bring out the silver or was it--
Speaker 1: Well, we had silver every day.  The table was set, set up with silver every day.  And then, of course, at the end, you know, you had to clear the table, wash the dishes, put whatever food was left away.  So that was typical.  We knew that, you know, we had that.  And then we had turns washing dishes.  And like a lot of times, sometimes M.L, when it was his turn to do the dishes, then he had to use the bathroom.  And so then he would (laughter) get out of it that way.
Speaker 2: Well, I was wondering, did the boys do, I mean their chores were to do dishes too?
Speaker 1: Yes, they tried to do, but they were typical boys, you know.  They'd try to get out of it any way that they could, you know.  So it fell on me most of the time.
Story_ID: 869
Speaker 1: And did you, these, let's say in these discussions around the table, were the children allowed to participate or were they to be, you know, seen but not heard?
Speaker 2: No, we were always open to be heard and that's what I credit with my father with.  He would explain situations to us, and we could ask questions, get in the discussion.  And so my brothers and I came up, you know, being very social conscious because of that.
Speaker 1: And that was, a lot of times back then, it was the opposite in some respects about children, that you, you know, you couldn't necessarily (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Right, the idea that children should be seen and not heard, but it wasn't like that with us.  We were always allowed to ask questions or question whatever we didn't understand.
Speaker 1: Now, were some of the discussions, were they difficult to understand or did you always understand the nuances.  And I also wanna know what is the relationship between your father and the white community at this point?  Or are a lot, or is it sort of the white community is there?  But I'm just, because he had a relationship with--
Speaker 2: My father, you know, he was very forthright in speaking out and questioning, you know.  Sometimes he might have gotten in trouble with that, but he would always, you know, he had a way.  And interestingly enough, the white people did respect him.  And he would talk to them and form some kind of relationship.  I remember when I had finished school, and I came back to Atlanta--
Speaker 1: You mean finished Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes, when I finished Spelman, and I went on to graduate school at Columbia University [New York, New York].  And when I came back after receiving my first Master's, I wanted to teach.  And I put in my application, and I didn't get a job.  And my friends around me, they were able to get a teaching job.  Well, I couldn't understand that.  And, of course, I would help out around the church doing things like secretarial kinds of things.  And so, but I was still not pleased because I wanted to teach, to work.  And so Mother [Alberta Williams King] told Dad [Martin Luther King, Sr.] that I was unhappy, and I wanted, because I couldn't get a job teaching.  And that was very interesting because my other friends were able to get a job.  And I couldn't get a job teaching.  And so Dad, Mother told Dad, says, you know, Christine is not teaching.  "Well, she doesn't have to work.  She can work down at the church.  She can do this.  She doesn't have to."  And she said, but, you know, she's trained and she wants to work.  So he said, okay, I'll see about that.  And so what he did, now I had put in my applications, and they had been turned down.  So what my Dad said, "Does she really want to teach?"  Okay, I can take care of her.  She doesn't have to--but Mother said, she's trained.  She wants to work.  So he said, okay.  So I had filed applications, and they were just ignored.  Didn't have a job, couldn't get one, and my friends around me were getting jobs.  I mean some of them were not as smart as I thought I was, and they were getting jobs.  So I didn't understand it.  So Dad said, well, if she really wants to teach, I will see about that.  So he got on the phone and called then Mayor Hartsfield [Mayor William B. Hartsfield, 1937-1941 and 1942-1962], who was the mayor.  And he said, "Mr. Mayor, I don't know what's going on, but my daughter is trained.  She even has a Master's degree, and she cannot get on in the Atlanta public schools.  I don't understand this."  So he said, the mayor listened to him, and he said, give me a few minutes and I'll call you back.  Apparently, the mayor must have made contact with the superintendent of schools, Ms. Ira Jarrell (ph.).  And so he called Dad back in some few minutes, and he said, have your daughter to come down to the school office in the morning at 9:00 o'clock and meet with the superintendent, Ms. Ira Jarrell.  So the next morning, I went down to Ms. Jarrell's office and within about 10 or 15 minutes, she said, you will report to W. H. Crogman [Elementary] School in the morning.  And I had a job just like that.  And then, of course, that's when I got started teaching.
Speaker 1: So how did you-- (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  You forgot to mention, Mother, that the reason why it was so hard for you to get a job--
Speaker 2: Well, yes, the reason--
Speaker 1: What had happened, he had been axed.  He had helped to integrate, right?  He had worked to--go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yes, my father had worked, taking people down to vote.  He was very active.  And they had seen that and because of that, and he led a committee on the equalization of teachers' salaries because at one time, the white teachers were getting more than the Negro teachers.  And my father led a movement against that.  And because of that, they had to equalize those salaries.  And so that was a part--my name was "King", and so that was a part of, you know, the reason that they weren't hiring me.  However, I wasn't thinking about that.  I just knew that I had a Master's degree, and I couldn't even get on in the school system.  And because of that, and Dad, he said, always go to the top.  He said, I always go to the top.  So he went to the mayor and the mayor then went to the superintendent of schools.  She had me down to her office.  He called Dad back and said, have your daughter to meet Ms. Jarrell in the morning at 9:00 o'clock in the school office.  In the morning at 9:00 o'clock, I met Ms. Jarrell and in 15 minutes, she said, you will report to W. H. Crogman tomorrow.
Speaker 1: So there was your job?
Speaker 2: There was my job.
Speaker 1: Right.  I wanna go--there's a 20 year gap, but I wanna, since you're talking about your father's [Martin Luther King, Sr.] role, can we talk about the role of the black minister, you know, let's say even his role here in Atlanta because I think a lot of times people, the minister was probably the most important person in the black community, right--?
Speaker 2: Very effective, yes.
Speaker 1: --at that time, especially, in this case where they're playing a role in social, what we call now social activist?
Speaker 2: Social change and activist.
Speaker 1: So now, in that, you know, cause we had last sort of ended when you were around the 11 period.  I wanna, what are your brothers like, you know, when everyone's in the puberty phase?  What are you, you know, are the boys liking girls?  Are you liking boys?  I mean, you know, who are your friends?
Speaker 2: Typical, you know, starting to looking at boys and the boys were looking at the girls.  So they had the little friends and everything, yes.  That was, had a typical growing up in that respect.
Speaker 1: But wasn't your father, he was very strict on you, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was very strict, and I guess much more strict on me than he was on the boys.  So that if I'd have a boyfriend, I guess they would have to pass by Dad (laughter).  But he, you know, he finally, you know, came over to the fact that I had to talk to some boys (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you think your mother, your mother probably helped in that regard, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Story_ID: 870
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the other thing is, you know, do you remember, and this is, you know, we can go the eleven to because you go, well, you start Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta Georgia] at age sixteen, but we can start with that.  But what is, do you have memories of sort of tragic or unhappy times, you know, growing up or times that there was sorrow or, you know, maybe someone passed away and, do you remember any of that with the family?
Speaker 2: I think the first time that we really faced it was when my grandmother [Jennie Celeste Williams] passed.  And, of course, we were so close to her.  And she passed on a Sunday.  She was to do a women's day address at a church not too far away from here.  And so I don't think we were going.  My mother [Alberta Williams King], there was something going on.  But my grandmother went alone to that church where she was to speak.  And that Sunday, my brother, M.L. [Martin Luther King, Jr.], there was some kind of parade or something going on downtown.  And he went with the boys downtown.  I guess, I don't where, A.D. [Alfred Daniel] must have been with him.  But anyway, I was at home, and my grandmother went alone to this church.  I mean she might have had some church members with her, but none of the family was with her.  And when she got there, she sat down and apparently, she had a stroke.  And she just left us right then.  And, of course, we were very distraught when we heard the news.  But my brother, M.L. was, when he found out, because he had slipped away and gone down to the parade.  And so he felt guilty because we were so close to my grandmother, and we called her "mama", and, of course, we called my Mother, Mother Dear.  And somehow the word got to him that mama had passed.  He never, you know, he was just very emotional and shocked about that.  And he felt so guilty.  It was, that was, you know, one of the very tragic times in our lives, the first time that anybody that close had passed.
Speaker 1: Now, so her passing was much different than your grandfather's passing?
Speaker 2: Yes, we were older.
Speaker 1: You were older then too.  That's right.
Speaker 2: We're older, yes.
Speaker 1: And she had been, you know, as a lot of matriarchs, very essential to the family.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, was she--how old were you and how old was M.L and--?
Speaker 2: We were just beginning teenagers.  I don't remember the exact date.  I could, you know, find that out, of course, by checking out the dates.  But we were just teenagers, beginning teenagers.
Speaker 1: So how was the seating then around the dinner table after that because she, you know, she had had her role at the dinner table.  Now, how old was she when she passed?
Speaker 2: Sixty-something.  I don't remember.
Speaker 1: And both she and your grandfather died of strokes?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so how did that, because that probably was a very, the house felt differently, I think?
Speaker 2: Very different because Mother, I mean my grandmother was such a, you know, a part of that family.  So to lose her, it was just tragic.  And, of course, my, her sister, who lived with us, Aunt Ida, she never, I never saw Aunt Ida go outside of the house, except around in the house.  But I mean as far as going places, she just stayed there, did whatever she needed to do in the house, take care of us or whatever.  And the first time I saw Aunt Ida out of the house was to go to my grandmother's funeral.  And, of course, after my grandmother passed, she never really got over it.  And so, about a year or two, then she was gone.  It was, you know, that was kind of a very sad time around us when we lost my grandmother.  And what they did, I mean, they brought her home.  I don't know whether, they must have embalmed her in the house.  I don't know, but she was placed in her bed, and she stayed in the bed, all dressed and everything until the day of the funeral before they put her in a casket and brought her here to church.  And that was very unusual.
Speaker 1: So why do you think that was done?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was customary, you know, that families--you know, they used to bring caskets into people's homes.  And so I guess in that spirit, you know, it was just like she was lying asleep.
Speaker 1: Now, who do you think was responsible for that?  Do you think your mother was responsible?
Speaker 2: My mother, I'm sure she was.
Speaker 1: And did they, why did people bring caskets into homes back then cause it's not done as much now, you know--
Speaker 2: No, very seldom do you hear of that happening now.  But it was just like, you know, they're lying asleep.
Speaker 1: And people would come and visit in the home with the casket there?
Speaker 2: Yes, in the home.  But she's laid in the bed.  They put her in the bed, and she was in the bed until the hour or so before the funeral.  And then they brought the casket and placed her in the casket and brought her to the church.
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember the service that day?
Speaker 2: I don't remember too much about that service.  I really don't.
Speaker 1: And so you're saying, you think M.L, more than A.D. [Alfred Daniel], suffered from your grandmother's death?
Speaker 2: Yes, because he felt guilty because he had slipped away to that parade or whatever was going on and he was so distraught.  He really was, especially because we were so close to her.
Story_ID: 871
Speaker 1: Now, when your, was it always assumed that you and, you know, that your brothers would go to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and you go Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, that was a given.  That was in the family.  Mother [Alberta Williams King]  went to Spelman.  My grandmother [Jennie Celeste Williams] went to Spelman and her sister went to Spelman.  So there was no other way.  Dad [Martin Luther King, Sr.] was Morehouse.  So that was cut out (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what was discussed when you were growing up about Spelman and Morehouse?  What did you learn about the tradition and, you know, the campus?  Were you over on the campus as much when you were growing up?  And--
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to Spelman nursery school.  And so I was right there on campus.  And so we were, you know, all around there, and of course, after elementary school, there was nowhere else for me to go but Spelman.  That was cut out.  Of course, my father being a Morehouse man, you know, my brothers [Alfred Daniel] [Martin Luther King, Jr.] had to go to Morehouse.  I mean that was a given.
Speaker 1: Now, what are you learning about those two schools?  What are your parents saying about, you know, what is your mother saying about Spelman?  What is your father saying about Morehouse and what it is to be a Morehouse man and what--
Speaker 2: They just talked about the school, and that's where you would go.  I mean there was no choice.
Speaker 1: Can we hold just one second?  Do you want me to go into cause there are questions about--
Story_ID: 872
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to just the neighborhood here, this Auburn Avenue.  Now, the--how did your parents come to purchase this home?  And did they purchase it and was it purchased outright?
Speaker 2: Which home?
Speaker 1: On Auburn Avenue.
Speaker 2: Oh, my grandfather [Adam Daniel Williams] purchased that home.  And, you know, and, of course, when, you know, he left, of course, the home was left to Mother [Alberta Williams King] being the only child.
Speaker 1: So, were there any stories about how he, cause it's a big home, you know, how he purchased it or who he purchased it from and--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't have the information on that.  I just know that that was a part of, you know, his being a minister, and he entrepreneurial skills.  So he owned, my grandfather owned that home.  And, of course, it was left to Mother.  And then my father [Martin Luther King, Sr.], you know, being a businessman, he wanted his home--he always talked about a brick home.  In his book, he talks about he used to play down in Stockbridge, little white boys.  And they would play, and they would run, the boys would run to their homes.  And they were all playing together so my father would be in with them.  And they would run to get something, lunch or something.  And when he got there, you know, they wouldn't let him go in the front door.  He would have to go to the back.  And he didn't like that.  And he said he made a vow that "when I grow up, I'm gonna have me a brick home".  All right, well, when he first married Mother, of course, his, you know, my grandfather wanted the child, the only girl, only child, to stay with them.  So they stayed with, you know, that's how they stayed in the birth home, until shortly after my grandmother passed, then Dad got his brick house up on Boulevard, 193 Boulevard.  That's where we lived until they were beginning to develop that space up there.  And then that's when we moved Dale Creek.  But right now, it's the place where there's a big, condo things right facing the expressway.  Dad was so proud of that home on one, it was a really nice home, 193 Boulevard.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you move into that home at 193 Boulevard then?
Speaker 2: Shortly after my grandmother's [Jennie Celeste Williams], let's see?
Speaker 1: Her death?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was shortly, well, cause Aunt Ida didn't go with us to Boulevard.  So, I mean I'd have to get some papers to see when we moved to Boulevard.  But he finally got that brick home that he wanted.
Speaker 1: So who stayed in the home then at 501 Auburn then?
Speaker 2: Okay, there were some people who, you know, were boarders.  And then after that, when my younger brother, A.D. [Alfred Daniel] married, then they moved and stayed on the upper level.  And there were still some people renting on the lower level.  So A.D., when he got his start, at the birth home.
Story_ID: 873
Speaker 1: Now, this community, it's important for people to understand that it was all black.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was all black.
Speaker 1: Now, where was, how far was it black and how far was there white?  You know, was it, like was there a--
Speaker 2: There were no whites around.
Speaker 1: No where.  But where was the white area?  Was there a place that you could not go past to go to?
Speaker 2: Well, we just didn't go.  I don't know that they, you know, said you didn't go, but mostly, when the blacks were going there, they were going to work, you know, as housekeepers or servants or something like that.  But as far as I know this area was black.
Speaker 1: And it was, it had everything here, right?  I mean you had a bank, you had, you everything around?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, we grew up in Citizen's Trust, Yates and Milton store.  In fact, every Sunday when we would leave church, we'd go down to Yates and Milton which was on the corner of Auburn and Butler, and go down and get ice cream sodas or something like that.  And then across the street from the church, over there, there was a Greek fellow, Pete Shinos, who had a store and a ice cream fountain and all of that good stuff.  So we spent lots of time over there.
Speaker 1: And then what was the corner store that was owned by a white gentleman?  What--
Speaker 2: That was across from the birth home.  And I think they were of Jewish descent, and they had, you know, they would have stores in the communities.  And they had the store, just a general store, I mean more groceries and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: And didn't your brother develop a friendship with their son?
Speaker 2: Yes, they, yeah, they played together until one day, you know, they told him that they couldn't play with him anymore because he was black, that they were growing up.  And that, this is what I talk about in the children's book.
Speaker 1: And he was, so how old was M.L. [Martin Luther King, Jr.] at that time, and was it just that it happened to M.L. and not A.D. [Alfred Daniel] M.L. was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, M.L. was more close.  Of course, they all played together, but M.L. had become closer to this fellow.  And I guess, you know, they were about nine or 10, something like that.
Speaker 1: Do you, did he cry?  Do you know if that--
Speaker 2: He was very sad about that.  He didn't, I didn't see him crying, but, you know, he was just shocked and sad.
Story_ID: 874
Speaker 1: Now, I will also say something that's sort of, I think it's unique to the South, but the use of initials, M.L, A.D., now what were you?
Speaker 2: Christine.
Speaker 1: Christine.  So they didn't give you a--
Speaker 2: No, the boys, you know.  He took on my father's name, you know, M. L. King, Sr., [Martin Luther King, Sr.] and finally, they started saying senior, and then M. L., Jr. [Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And then A.D. [Alfred Daniel]  was named after my grandfather, A. D. Williams Kings [Adam Daniel Williams], A.D. Williams King.
Speaker 1: And we were talking also about, let's go back to the church for a little bit.  What were the-- what was the service like?  You know, can you describe the service and the traditions and, or even some of the sermons?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it's much like it is now.  I mean you'd have the choirs singing.  And you'd have scripture reading.  And then my father [Martin Luther King, Sr.] initiated something called meditation.  And just before the sermon, it would usually be just music from the organ, the piano and I guess people could meditate.  And then he would go into his sermon.  And so my brother followed the same procedure, typical service.
Speaker 1: Mrs. Farris, to describe it, it sounds so--now, this is of the Baptist tradition.  I mean what was the sermon?  I mean often, like do you have a favorite sermon of your, you know, father's that you remember, and--
Speaker 2: Right now, I can't remember the titles of the sermons.  But I can remember a number of phrases that my father used to use.  And one of his favorites was "Don't forget about the least of these.  We must care about the least of these", speaking of those who were less fortunate than the others.  And then he said all the time, thank God for what you have left.  And then he would use some experiences, and sometimes he'd have people laughing.  He said, you know, somebody was thinking about, you know, not having any hair, but he said, thank God you got a head.  So he was, you know, very typical.  And then, you know, after my brothers were taken, then he'd come back with the sermon, thank God again for what you have left.  And he said, I don't--after Martin passed, he had come around to thanking, you know, thinking about the "least of these" and to care about the least of these.  I mean those, his sermons were very, very practical ones.  And of his, you know, own making.  And thank God for what you have left, and he was talking about this man who used to have hair, and he didn't have any hair, but thank God, you've got a head.  So--
Story_ID: 875
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember when M.L. [Martin Luther King, Jr.], your brother, M.L., decided that he was going to seek, you know, enter the ministry?  Was that something that was his own decision or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  It was very much his own.  My father never tried to influence him..  I remember he was coming toward it when we started to college, in our freshman year.  And he suddenly decided that he wanted to go into the ministry, and he took it very seriously because we used to go to parties and everything.  And then he decided, you know, that he's not going to parties.  He'd be sitting there reading the bible, and we'd go on out to parties.  We couldn't get him to go.  That was temporary.  But that was, you know, when he decided to go into the ministry.
Speaker 1: And what age was he?  So, at this point, is he at Morehouse with--
Speaker 2: Just beginning to go to Morehouse, at the beginning, his freshman year at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And that's when he began to become more serious about the ministry.
Speaker 1: And didn't you enter school around the same, no, you, wait a minute?
Speaker 2: No, we were at the same time.  What happened is that I went to Washington, Booker T. Washington High School, and he did too.  First, we were, Atlanta University had a laboratory school.  And we went to Atlanta University Laboratory School, which was a private school.  Well, they had to close, so when they closed, then we had to go to the public school, Booker T. Washington High School, which incidentally, my grandfather, A.D. Williams is responsible for that school being promoted.  But anyway, we went to Washington High.  I was a grade ahead of him.  And I graduated from Washington High.  And, of course, was going on to college.  Then, of course, he's, you know, keeping up with me, and they had, they gave a test that would, if you passed that test, then you could go on to college.  So he never graduated from high school.  He took the test, and went straight on to Morehouse as a result of passing that test.  In the meantime, Morehouse students were going to the tobacco farms at Simsbury, Connecticut during the summers, and they would pick that tobacco at the tobacco farm and make money for their tuition.  And he went that, after he finished the eleventh grade, and I had graduated from high school.  And they offered a test.  And you could take that test, and if you passed it, then you could go on to college.  You didn't have to go through the twelfth grade.  And he took that test, and he passed it so that's how we got together in college.
Speaker 1: But what age is he at that point cause I thought you went at 16.  And he was--
Speaker 2: He was just about a year or two behind me, yeah, maybe 15.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you remember his, were you seeing him a lot during that time or you're sort of on different paths at that point?  Were you--
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: You and he, were you seeing each other?
Speaker 2: We were still at home, so we were, yeah.
Speaker 1: Commuting?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you remember his first sermon?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: I really don't know the title.  I can look that up and get it, but we were at Morehouse, I mean Morehouse and Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  It was our senior, junior year, yeah, our junior year.  And he had told my father that he thought he had received what they called the "call", received the call to the ministry.  And so in order for you to practice any kind of ministry, you would have to, you know, give a trial sermon, be ordained, be licensed to preach.  And this happened our senior year because it was a requirement that, at Spelman, you had to stay on campus your senior year.  And so I was on campus, and I remember getting ready to come over here, permission to get off campus, come over and hear his trial sermon.  He did his trial sermon while we were still at school, at Spelman and Morehouse, respectively.
Speaker 1: So how did do then?
Speaker 2: How did he do?  Well, he did a good job.  Yeah, he did a good job.  After you do your trial sermon, then you have to go through, be ordained to preach.  And in order to be ordained, you had to meet before a group of ministers, you know.  And they question you, and then you do your speech, your trial, trial sermon.  And he did that, and he passed.  So they, you know, he was soon ordained.
Story_ID: 876
Speaker 1: Were people saying when he gave his first sermon that he [Martin Luther King, Jr.] was a cut off the old block, you know?
Speaker 2: Yes, they felt that he was.
Speaker 1: So he had the gift?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: And so, what, was it at that point--did your father take him under his wing, and you know, sort of groom him because there's a whole, I mean there's a whole tradition around the Baptist church tradition, not that he didn't grow up around it, but really, even knowing how to give a sermon?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, well having sat under my father [Martin Luther King, Sr.], it wasn't hard for him.  And, you know, there was a protocol--well, I shouldn't use protocol, but there was procedures that ministers followed.  And so he had all of that.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that a little bit because I'm wondering, you know, like you're eating with your father every night.  There's these discussions going on, you know, a lot of activism, and then you see your father in the pulpit.  And often Baptist ministers, it's like larger than life, you know, in some respects.  Was there, you saw the same thing happening with your brother?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  I mean they were, to us, they were not larger than life because they were still family.  Until the day my brother left [died], I mean there was never, you know, I'm, you know, (laughter) Martin Luther King, Jr.  He wasn't that kind of person.  And, of course, he wasn't taught that way because my father, you know, he'd say you have to be humble.  And so he never forgot, you know, from whence he came, and so, you know, it was just a marvel to see him develop.  But I mean the ground was there because my grandfather [Adam Daniel Williams] was an activist.  He was responsible for Washington, Booker T. Washington High School.  He was also responsible for getting the "Atlanta Journal Constitution", which was called "The Georgian".  They were segregating and wouldn't do anything about blacks.  And so my grandfather led this movement to close down the paper.  And then, in order to get the Washington, Booker Washington High School, there had to be a bond issue that was passed to raise the money to build the school.  And my father, grandfather was in the forefront of that.  That was the first black high school here in Atlanta.  And so Martin saw all of this.  He was a part of it.  He saw the activism of his grandfather that's passed, and then of my father.  I mean my father would take members down to the courthouse to register to vote.  And then he'd encourage them to buy homes, to own your own home instead of renting, that kind of thing.  Well, my brother saw all of this, and he was highly influenced by his father.
Speaker 1: So when he took the call, cause I think that's important to understand cause a lot of times, when you think of your brother, you think he just sprung out of nowhere.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Most people say that (chuckle), and that's why it's very important that they understand from his grandfather to his father, I mean he grew up under this.  I mean my father would take members down to the courthouse to register to vote and then encourage them to vote.
Story_ID: 877
Speaker 1: But what do you think was because, you know, you're telling this story that really began, well, and your part of the story began in the '30s, [1930s], but it began before that even with, you know, your grandfather [Adam Daniel Williams] at a different time.  But, so what do you think was unique about this time, you know, where we're in the late '50s [1950s], you know, period?  What is really happening cause your brother [Martin Luther King, Jr.], he studies at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  You actually study here at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  You graduate from Spelman.  You go to--
Speaker 2: To Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now, and why don't you explain why you ended up going to Columbia as opposed to staying in Georgia?
Speaker 2: Okay, why did I go to Columbia?  Okay, I wanted to go to grad school.  I mean my parents, you know, wanted that to happen; couldn't go to the University of Georgia because blacks could not go to the University of Georgia.  But what happened, instead of going to the University of Georgia, they would pay, and I mentioned this in my book.  And I can't think of the name of that ruling that made it possible.  You know, if you were black and you wanted to pursue graduate studies, they would pay for you to go to another school of your choice.  And that was fine because here, from the University of Georgia at that time, was nowhere near Columbia University.  They paid my tuition, my room and board, everything because I couldn't go to the university.  So I got two master's [degrees] on the basis of the Georgia, you know, paying for that.  And I've got to, and I don't know whether I researched it in my book, the name of that program that made it possible for, you know, for us to go to grad school.  So they would just have to pay.
Speaker 1: And was that the same thing with your brother too or not?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure that's for theological school.  And I think that Dad had to pay for, you know, M.L. [Martin Luther King, Jr.] at Crozer [Crozer Theological Seminary, Upland, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And why Crozer?  Why was that chosen at that point because it's still the South versus North, and what you spoke of was this peculiar tradition in the South that allowed people to go to schools, totally free, like you said, and much better schools?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, he had his, you know, I guess his mentors at Morehouse.  They were the ones that acquainted him with Crozer.
Speaker 1: You're talking about they acquainted M.L.?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.  But, well, you know, those graduate schools.
Story_ID: 878
Speaker 1: Do you think Dr. Benjamin Mays had any relationship, and what was the relationship between Dr. Benjamin Mays and your family?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a very close relationship.  My, Dr. Mays was very close to my father and resulting from that, you know, he was, my brother [Martin Luther King, Jr.] was influenced by Dr. Mays, and being his, you know, his mentor.  And Dr. Mays, you know, stood with my brother when others were trying to pull him back, you know, from being an activist.  And Dr. Mays supported him 100 percent.
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk, that, I think you touch upon an important point because often we think of the Movement, you know, that we talk about, you know, as coming out of the church.  But at the same time, there were, there was a conflict within the religious community about people either wanting to play it safe, you know, who were not against, you know, who were not supportive of the Movement.  And then you had people like your father and your brother who were very active.  So can you talk about that some?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father, you know, being an activist as he was, you know, some of his minister colleagues weren't as active in the Movement, so to speak.  And there was some conflicts there.  But I think often of Dr. Mays and people like that who were very encouraging.  And particularly, you know, when my brother had to stand out and Dr. Mays stood right with him.  There was a time when they were after my brother in Montgomery [Alabama] and he happened to be here, and there was something that happened about the boycott.  And they were--
Speaker 1: Is this the Montgomery Bus Boycott?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was following the boycott.  They were still after, you know, after my brother, and it was getting dangerous, you know, for him.  And we, as a family and Dad, you know, tried to keep him here.  And so Dad called the college presidents of the AU Center, Dr. Mays, I think Dr. Manley at Spelman, and I can't remember the rest of them.  But I do remember, and M.L. [Martin Luther King, Jr.] was here, and it was a dangerous--they had said that if he came back into Alabama, they were gonna take his life or something like that.  You know, these were underhand threats.  And Dad, of course, and we were all very nervous about that, and so Dad called these presidents to our home over on Dale Creek.  And he explained his position, and he didn't want his son to go back because they were after him.  And they were gonna try to kill him and everything.  And my brother kept saying, you know, but I cannot stay here and my people are down there.  "I cannot stay here".  And I'm gonna have to go back.  And so Dad was trying to get the opinions from these presidents, you know, guidance and direction.  And all of them, you know, they, you know, said, you know, that he shouldn't, you know, he shouldn't go back.  Dr. Mays was the only one that stood out and said that, "That's on his conscious.  He believes it, and I stand with him.  He should go back."  That was the kind of, you know, things that we had to go through.  So Dr. Mays backed him 100 percent.
Speaker 1: Mrs. Farris, when, in your mind, did the movement begin under your brother's direction?  Do you think there was a pivotal point?  When did it happen?  I mean he had been, he had finished theological seminary.  He had gotten married, right?  A.D. [Alfred Daniel] had gotten married.  He had gotten married.  You're not married at that point?
Speaker 2: I'm not married at point.
Story_ID: 879
Speaker 1: And, but I'm wondering what, can you pinpoint anything, you know, cause, I mean you hear about the, you know, Montgomery [Alabama].  You hear about Selma [Alabama].  You know you hear about them, but what in your mind--and you hear about Rosa Parks, but what in your mind was your brother's [Martin Luther King, Jr.] start with, you know, what we, you know, have come to know as the Movement?
Speaker 2: Well, he had studied the whole philosophy of nonviolent social change.  That was a part of him.  And when they, you know, asked him to serve as the leader, you know, of the Montgomery Improvement Association, he had just recently gotten to Montgomery as the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.  And they asked him to serve as the leader.  And, of course, he accepted that.  And that's when it all began, when he started with the Montgomery Improvement Association.  And then he had a chance to put into practice what he had studied and what he believed in, you know, the approach, the nonviolent approach.
Speaker 1: How did it differ from what, or was it just a continuation with the name?  How did it really differ from your father's teaching and philosophy and his activism?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Martin Luther King, Sr.]  was an activist, very much of an activist.  So I'm sure my brother got a lot of that activism from him.  But he didn't, my father didn't have an opportunity to get into the practice of nonviolence as my brother did because after my brother had studied about this, and he writes about his learning about the practice of nonviolence from Mordecai [Wyatt] Johnson, who was the president of Howard University.  He went and heard a lecture, and that really set him on his course of nonviolent social change.
Speaker 1: Now, what about that lecture?  Did he tell you of the lecture or he had spoken of the lecture, but about that lecture set him on that path?
Speaker 2: Well, he went and heard him.  And he said, you know, this is, it was in his mind, you know, that this is the way that you go and, about Gandhi and his practice of nonviolence.  And from that, you know, he had an opportunity.  When he had, went to Dexter, he had no idea that, you know, the situation with Rosa Parks would come up, but it was the opportune moment for him to put into practice what he had learned, what he believed in.
Speaker 1: And had he known Rosa Parks before Rosa Parks happened because what we know--
Speaker 2: No, he didn't know anything about her.
Speaker 1: He didn't know her because this was, you had the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], you know, trying--
Speaker 2: Yeah, all of those, um-hum.
Speaker 1: --to do things.  So--
Speaker 2: And she was very active in the NAACP.  And also, she had also become, you know, acquainted with nonviolence because she went to the Highland Folk School in [New Market] Tennessee and studied about it.
Speaker 1: Now, this is important to understand because all around the South, I mean the problem was that black people were subject to lots of violence.  Violence was every--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, you hit me, I'll hit you back.
Speaker 1: Right.  It was an everyday threat.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, whether it happened or not. So, what is, how is the family involved with your brother at this time, and what are you seeing, either from afar or, you know, up close that we may not know about?
Speaker 2: Like what?  I mean we were a very close knit family, supported, you know, each other, one and all.  And I mean he brought Dad over to more, of nonviolence, cause Dad, I mean very forthright and speaking out.  And, you know, my brother brought him around to, you know, the nonviolence approach.
Speaker 1: And what did he espouse as his position?  What did he, I mean we hear a lot of his position in his speeches, but he's gaining more notoriety, you know, cause he was at Dexter how many years?  He was there--let's see--
Speaker 2: I don't know remember how many years off hand he was at Dexter.
Speaker 1: And then he came back here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he came here.  He felt that he needed to broaden the base, and he talked with Dad about it.  And Dad said, well, you know, you can come and be an associate with me.  And, of course, he discussed that with the church.  And the church had no problem, you know, with that.  And that put him into the Atlanta situation.  That's how, when he left Montgomery to come and co-pastor here with my father.  And that's how that all started.  That got him, you know, to Atlanta.  And then they had formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC].  And so that came to Atlanta.  So Atlanta became the focus then.
Speaker 1: So SCLC (Southern Christian Leadership Conference] was really started in, was it started in Montgomery and then it--?
Speaker 2: Right over here in the Education building.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So talk about the beginning of the SCLC.  Can you talk about that, like?
Speaker 2: Well, he, you know, had these big, called these ministers together, and they formed the SCLC, as I said, over in the Education building.
Speaker 1: How many ministers were at the beginning of the forming?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  We could easily research that.  That's easy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then when you, so SCLC, it also starts attracting a lot of young people.  I mean this is the thing, you know, right?  These are--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it attracted some, but, you know, they were going SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and Stokely Carmichael, were joining, young people--
Speaker 1: But wasn't it, you had Andrew Young [Former Mayor of Atlanta] who was part of--
Speaker 2: No, well, Andrew came much later.
Speaker 1: Later, but you're talking about the original SCLC?
Speaker 2: Yeah, original SCLC, Andy was not a part of the original, no, no.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  So this--
Speaker 2: You had Joe Lawry, Ralph Abernathy and folk like that.  That's the original.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Okay.  And so, that was formed in, I think it was like 19--
Speaker 2: It was 1960-something.
Speaker 1: Let's see, maybe like even '61 [1961] or something like that.
Speaker 2: You can easily get that.
Story_ID: 880
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what is happening then?  Can you talk about, and I'd like to also know the role of your family because I don't think that is as much discussed, you know, but the role that your family, as a close-knit family is playing?
Speaker 2: Yes, support role.  That was our role to support Martin [Martin Luther King, Jr.].  In whatever he was doing, he had, you know, our support.  You know, as I write in my book, people say, we never see you on the marches and everything.  I was right there, but not to be out front.  I mean it was a support role, to support Martin in whatever needed to be done, see.  I mean he couldn't have lasted if we didn't support him.  He had to have support because many times, he was out there by himself.  So that's, that's what we did.
Speaker 1: Were there any things that, you know, either your father or you or your mother said, you know, maybe you shouldn't do that, Martin?  You know, maybe you should, you know, like maybe take it a little slower.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We're concerned, you know?
Speaker 2: There were times, there were times when, you know, that was said, and I mean just like that, as I just referred to, Dad calling that group together.  These were, you know, people that he respected.  And they all met, but the lone one that stood out in support of Martin was Dr. Mays.  He said, you know, we were all afraid for him to go back because they had said what they were gonna do to him.  And we were all afraid, and Martin said, well, you know, I can't stay here and those people down there are still, you know, suffering.  I cannot stay.  I have to go back.  And the others, presidents, said, you know, well, we think it's, you know, not safe.  It's is dangerous, and Dr. Mays, about the last one to speak.  And I remember him saying, but, you know, "Martin has a call, and he feels he has to go, and I support him 100 percent."  And, of course, then, you know, we had no alternative but to go with him.  So Dad got a couple of deacons here to drive him, you know, back cause they had said what they were gonna do.  And so, they drove him back, and he was able to get back there and continue, you know, his work.
Speaker 1: Now, when the
Story_ID: 881
Speaker 1: This trip that you took--
Speaker 2: Yes, to London [England].
Speaker 1: --what period are we talking about?
Speaker 2: That was in the '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s], '50s [1950s], '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: You went on a cruise ship?
Speaker 2: Yes, French liner, the Flounder, to the Baptist World Alliance, and I had, I was teaching then, but it was in the summer, in the Baptist World Alliance.  I think it was in July.
Speaker 1: Oh, but you were teaching?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was teaching then.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you were, so this is not in the--this is '50s [1950s], right.
Speaker 2: I guess it was the '50s, [1950s].
Speaker 1: Yes, early '60s [1960s], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, because Martin, M.L. [Martin Luther King, Jr.] didn't go.
Speaker 1: He didn't go.  Was he active already?
Speaker 2: What was he doing?  I think he took charge of the church while Dad [Martin Luther King, Sr.] was gone, I think.
Speaker 1: And were these Baptists all kinds of Baptists, black and--
Speaker 2: From all over the world, Baptist World Alliance.
Speaker 1: And so what happened?  Are people preaching or they're--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're having meetings and they're having preaching, services.  You know, it was like a convention.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, let's go back to what role A.D. [Alfred Daniel] played in the Movement.
Speaker 2: Okay.  He was very supportive of M.L. [Martin Luther King, Jr.], and he pastored in Ensley, Alabama during that time.  And, of course, his home was bombed.  Fortunately, you know, they didn't, no tragedy happened, except, you know, his home was bombed.  But he was, you know, he was very supportive of his brother, very supportive.
Speaker 1: So, you know, I say that because people, you know, can you give instances of A.D.'s involvement in the Movement, I mean what role he played, vis-a-vis, you know, his brother?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, he was very supportive, but he became very active in the Birmingham [Alabama] situation because his church, he had a church right outside of Birmingham in Ensley, Alabama.  And so his house was also bombed as a result of that Movement.
Speaker 1: And then, did your, you and your father go to Birmingham after the bombing?
Speaker 2: Yes, Dad, we had a member of our church to drive.  And, of course, I went there with Dad.  Mother didn't go.  And we got there, and it was kind of an eerie time.  And we went, you know, looking for M.L. cause we didn't know where he was.  And we went to the parsonage, and of course, he wasn't there.  And, of course, the members told us where he was.  And he staying some church members.  And incidentally, about the same time we got there, Coretta's [Coretta Scott King] parents had come, you know, from Marion, and her father said, "We've come to get Cora and the baby", and, you know, Dad was saying, we came to get M.L. (laughter) and all.  So, but they weren't moving.  They said they weren't coming.  They weren't leaving.
Speaker 1: And, now, I wanna go to, let see, okay.  I wanna go to--do you want me to ask anything more about the Movement at all? (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  No, I'm fine with the Movement.
Story_ID: 882
Speaker 1: Okay, you're fine with the Movement, okay.  You don't?  Okay.  So, let's go, let's come back to the church and the home, okay, some things that we missed.  I'd like to, since we're talking about M.L. [Martin Luther King, Jr.], can we go back to why his name changed from Michael to Martin?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, my father's[Martin Luther King, Sr.]  name changed.  After he went to the Baptist World Alliance, not the one where I went with him.  There was one in the '30s [1930s] [1934], and he went to Europe [Berlin, Germany].  It meant in--
Speaker 1: Berlin.
Speaker 2: Berlin.  And he traveled there, and then he had a chance, you know, to see, you know, the works of Martin Luther.  And his name, he was born, Michael, and after that, after that experience, you know, of seeing about, you know, the work of Martin Luther, when he came back, then he changed his name, and, of course, since M.L. [Martin Luther King, Jr.] was named after him, then he became Martin Luther.  That's how that happened.
Speaker 1: So, but Martin, M.L. at this point is relatively young.  So that wouldn't have been--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: But what did this come out of though?  Was it just because of this experience at the convention, the experience?
Speaker 2: At the experience.  You know, he had studied about Martin Luther, but to have the opportunity to be there where Martin Luther was, then I think it had quite, you know, an impact on my father.
Speaker 1: So it was almost like a religious experience?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and then he and his son.  Okay, now back to the church.  Can we talk about some, you know, funny stories, like, that happened at the church, if you remember any or--
Speaker 2: Do you remember any I talked, Edna? (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Funny stories?  Anybody shouting, anybody--
Speaker 1: Yeah, there used to be, you know, people who expressed their emotions a lot, you know, and shouting and all.
Speaker 2: And what would, give a specific example?
Speaker 1: Well, they would just, you know, people were moved by the sermons or the music, you know, and they would literally get up and shout.  You don't see much of that now. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Was it somebody that knocked somebody's wig off or something?
Speaker 2: I don't know nothing about that, Angela (laughter). (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear)
Speaker 1: No, I don't know about that because wigs then weren't that popular. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Some of the things that you all would laugh about, Uncle M.L. would laugh about y'all would get home and talk about so and so and laugh about that.
Speaker 2: I have to think about.  I have to think about those things. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Anybody's attire or (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Like the way either they came dress or? (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Sometimes kids go home after church and pretend to preach--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  -- because I used to do that, like after a sermon, would come (unclear), I mean that was things they, after church experience, a lot of kids used to--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they did that when they were grown.  Andy talks about the day before he was assassinated, how they were, you know, and how they were preaching each other's funerals and all of that. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  So you don't remember any funny stories?  I mean when you all were children, what was funny about church?  Was it always serious or was there anything--what would you laugh about?
Speaker 2: Anyone who, what about someone in the choir who sang off key or was there any of that or?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I know one day we were looking in encyclopedias which we, you know, often looked at the encyclopedia.  And so there was a lady at church, and then-- (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Don't call the name.
Speaker 2: --no, I can't call her name-- (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Are we recording?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --she, I mean she looked very much like, you know, she had some forms like, kind of like a gorilla or something like that (laughter).  And so, when we were looking at the encyclopedia (laughter), and A.D [Alfred Daniel]. and them say that looks like Mother whatever (laughter).  We used to laugh about that all the time, but it, you know, she did look just, a lot like a, you know, (laughter)
Speaker 1: So it was good, ole honest fun in (unclearly) and a lot of respect.
Speaker 2: Yes, honest fun, yeah. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And what about the--well, I guess you can't tell that one.
Speaker 1: What? (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  There's a story about a lady, there were some bulldozers across the street--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, I can't use that word, I can't use that.
Speaker 1: Why can't she tell the story? (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  It's not politically correct.
Speaker 2: Why can't you? (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  No, it's not politically (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Well, look, you've got your mother laughing.
Speaker 2: I can you all about it, but I don't want this to go on this thing.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  No, (unclear) at the time (unclear) it would be totally insensitive.
Speaker 2: This lady, she, you know, her English was not the best, you know.  And so she would get all confused.  In fact, she lived right across in that apartment across from the birth home on the corner. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  But don't say it, it's culturally insensitive.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Hah? (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  It would be culturally insensitive to say it today.
Speaker 1: To say it today? (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  She can tell you all afterwards, to say it on tape--
Story_ID: 883
Speaker 1: Okay, it would be culturally, okay.  So what about homecoming?  Can we talk about homecoming?  And guys, she has to look at me, I'm sorry, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What about homecoming?  Do you have a homecoming story?
Speaker 2: Yes, homecoming was a vital part of Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church].  In fact, Ebenezer still celebrates homecoming, but not the way because we used to have all the good food.  And members would just cook their favorite dishes and bring them and it always a joyful time because after the service, then we would, you know, engage in sampling and eating the different foods.  So, that was a joyful time, homecoming, and that was always in November.
Speaker 1: What was the tradition around homecoming, Mrs. Farris?
Speaker 2: We would have regular service, but then, as I said, families would bring their food, their favorite dishes and, you know, you'd just go around and fellowship and eat.  That was, well, we still have homecoming, but we don't have the ability to have it like it used to be.
Speaker 1: And what about Women's Day, what role did Women's Day play?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother, I think initiated Women's Day.  That was when women led the service, and I think then, sometimes they would have men to bring the address, but later they moved to a women, you know, because for a long time, you know, women weren't active in the pulpit as they are now.  And so Women's Day was always a time when the women would take charge of the service.
Speaker 1: And do you--
Speaker 2: And that was initiated here, under my grandmother, Jennie C. Williams.
Speaker 1: So that tradition goes back quite a while?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, was your grandmother in the house prior to the funeral that you spoke of?
Speaker 2: Was she what?
Speaker 1: In the house? (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  What do you mean by that question (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Okay, sorry, sorry, okay.  She was, okay. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, ask a question about baptism.
Story_ID: 884
Speaker 1: Okay, yes.  Can you talk about the whole tradition of baptism and what that was like, and how it was done?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, when members would join and they would either come by baptism, by letter--by letter meant they would come from another church, and the other church would say they left in good standing and so forth.  But the baptism, well, before we did some renovation on the church, the baptistery was downstairs in the basement.  And it was below the pulpit area, so to speak, so when they got ready to baptize, then they would let up, you know, a little door.  And they'd run the water in and baptize people like that.  The most interesting time that I remember is, you know, when you were baptized, you had to go under the water.  And they would tell you to hold the breath, you know, show you, you know, to hold your breath.  And sometimes the minster would try to, you know, hold your nose for you.  But once, when we had baptism down there, it was a very robust woman.  She was very fat, and I think she was afraid of the water, you know, and when they put her down, (laughter) to be baptized, then she got frightened, and she started kicking and everything.  It was, you know, it was a very interesting sight to see her, you know, fighting against the minister, and they were trying to hold her down.  It was, that, I mean that was one of the interesting things.  That didn't happen under my brother.  That happened under Dad [Martin Luther King, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, were her hands and legs flailing and all kinds of different directions?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was, she was, you know, she was getting out cause she wasn't, you know, gonna be down there.  Somebody, see usually, the minister would kind of hold your nose and dip you up, but apparently, they couldn't get to her, so she was really fighting in that water.
Speaker 1: So for those of you who don't understand the Baptist baptism, can you just describe, you know, what the service, ceremony was like (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, the minister, you know, would baptize you, "I baptize you in the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Ghost", and then put you in the water and up.  That's it.  That means that you're at the beginning of your new spiritual life.
Speaker 1: And the people would usually sing around that, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There would be singing.  It was a regular service.  I mean we still have baptism, Baptist, even in the new church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you want me to ask any of these questions here about how important was Ebenezer to the sustainability of the Sweet Auburn Community?  What-- (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  She's talked about that already.
Speaker 2: Right.  Did the churches cooperate with each other?  Did SCLC bring a different type of culture? (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  No, I think you've already talked about that.  I think it'd be good to end up with--
Speaker 1: Joel King, you want? (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, you can go back to the house and mention her uncle.
Speaker 2: Uncle Joel. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And then, when you come back to the church, the only thing, the tithing, the tradition of tithing--
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll go to the church now. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  --and where the tithing box possible was located.  And then maybe you can end it, wrap it up with her talking about her mother.
Speaker 2: Okay, good, okay.  Okay, so let's talk about tithing in the church and the role of tithing and where the tithing box was located?
Speaker 1: Well, they had, when it first initiated, it had what they called a tithing box.  And they would, it would be up on the side with the baptistery, I mean the pulpit.  And those who, you know, believed in giving one tenth of your salary, and you would put it in the tithing box.  It was a kind of ceremonial kind of thing.

Speaker 1: Did you, you know, we're in the church that you grew up in.  Can you sort of close your eyes and take yourself back there cause, you know, I remember when you came in, you said there was a clock right--
Speaker 2: Yes, a clock there.
Speaker 1: --facing.  Are there other things that you would describe about this room?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that they've done a pretty good job of bringing it back to where it was.  I mean, of course, it's had some transformation since my brother was here, just a little bit to make it more comfortable.  In other words, we had cushions in the seats, rather than just bare pews.  And that was a great day at Ebenezer when they did renovations and brought in pew because before that, I think there were chairs that would sit, and so the pews.  That was a great improvement.
Speaker 1: Is there any song that you associate with this church?
Speaker 2: Oh, we sang all of the hymns, "Amazing Grace", "I Need Thee Every Hour", "My Faith Looks Up to Thee", there's a number of hymns.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about Joel King?  We didn't touch upon, you know--
Speaker 2: My father's younger brother.  And he kind of handled him like he was a son.  And so we kind of grew up with him because he would come and stay.  And he then went into the ministry following, I guess, in my father's footsteps.  So he stayed with us for quite a while.
Speaker 1: How long is quite a while?
Speaker 2: For several years.  While he was, you know, going to Morehouse and everything, he stayed with us.  And Dad treated him, you know, like he was--because if he sometimes had to spank the boys, he'd try to spank Joel.  That was his younger brother.
Story_ID: 886
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, just hold.  You had originally, I think when we started, you were wanting to--someone had mentioned the death of her mother.  Is that-- (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  That's how she wanted to end up.  We're ready for that now.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Mrs. Farris, after the death of your brother, which I guess we just won't talk about, but you, there was a Sunday, on a Sunday here, that your mother was, you know, was killed.  Can you talk about that day?
Speaker 1: Yes, my mother [Alberta Williams King] had retired from the active involvement of the choir director.  But then that didn't last long so she came back, and started working with the choir which was called the M. L. King Choir or Choir Number 2 became the M. L. King Choir.  And so she had been rehearsing them for this particular Sunday.  And it was going to be a very exciting time.  My father [Martin Luther King, Sr.] had a speaking engagement in New Jersey, which he was going to have to leave right after the service or maybe during what would have been the service time.  So he had someone to stand in as preacher for the morning, which was Calvin Morris.  Dad was, he didn't go into the pulpit that morning.  He was sitting on the front pew on the side near the Education building because he was gonna have to leave to catch a plane to get to New Jersey.  Mother had been working with the choir, kind of like a comeback.  And so they were gonna, they were singing that morning.  And because of that, I had to get here early cause I wanted to, you know, be right here.  So that particular morning, I came, and I put my children in the nursery, which we had for young children.  During the service, they would go to the nursery, and someone would take care of the children.  And so I came after, you know, leaving them in the nursery, then I came over, and I was on the side of the church by the Educational building on the front pew.  For some reason, the organ, the regular organ that was in the choir loft, was not working or something, some reason.  But anyway, there was Hammond organ, and it was on the floor.  And it was right on the opposite side of where we were sitting.  And Mother was playing there.  So I was rushing getting here because she had been working with the choir, and they were gonna do, her former choir, and they were gonna be singing that morning.  And so I got here.  Dad was already here as he's always accustomed to.  And I left my children in the nursery in the Educational building.  And I came over, and I sat on the pew with Dad.  He was sitting out because he was gonna have to leave on his way to New Jersey to do a speech.  And I sat on the end of that pew right in view of where Mother was cause she was on the floor, the organ was on the floor on the opposite side.  And so I could see, you know, directly see her, and I made sure that she saw that I was here.  I had intended to be here exactly when they started, but I got held up.  But anyway, I think she saw me.  And as a custom, the prayer was, we were doing the prayer, morning prayer had been said.  And after the prayer, we would always chant "The Lord's Prayer".  All heads were still bowed.  And so after the prayer was said, and getting ready to do the chant, and I looked over and I saw this man who was sitting next to my mother on the pew that was next, adjacent to the organ.  And he got up and stood on the pew.  And he said, "I'm taking over here this morning", and he started, you know, to shooting.  And, of course, the people were then getting panicky, and they were hollering and moving.  And some of them were going out of this back door, among whom was one of the deacons.  And as he got to that door, you know, this Marcus Chenault shot him.  And then he started turning around, and he shot my mother.  And the only reason I knew she was shot because I saw her place her hand on her cheek, her jaw.  And then I understand, you know, he shot her again.  Then he pushed over the organ.  It was a Hammond organ.  He pushed that organ over on her.  Then he moved towards the pulpit area, and he was on his way up to the choir.  The choir was behind the pulpit, and his gun, the shots, you know, they gave out.  But I didn't realize at the time, and people were just panicking.  They were hollering, moving.  And I got, somebody said, "get down, get down", but I was looking for my mother to see what was going on.  But they eventually pushed me down.  And, you know, subsequently after that they got the organ off of her, and by that time, the ambulance was here.  And my husband, you know, he was one of those that pulled the organ off of her, you know.  It was this, like a Hammond organ.  It wasn't one that was, you know, nailed down.  And he knocked that organ over on mother.  And then I started looking for my children, and I didn't see them when they took her out, you know, to an ambulance.  But after I found my children, and they were all right, and then we went on to the hospital.  And the irony of this is that when we got to the Grady Hospital, they put us in a room.  And then they came to get me and said, "Now, you can, you know, go and see your father".  Somebody, I guess, had taken him there cause they took Mother, and I think he rode in the ambulance with her.  And so they came to get me to take me over to him, and he was sitting, you know, in the, it was off from the emergency room.  And somebody came out of the door, and she was just crying and crying.  And this was the wife of the deacon who had been shot and killed, and they had already declared him dead.  And she was crying, and I'm just consoling her, not having the slightest idea that, you know, subsequently, I would find out what happened to Mother.  So after I was giving comfort, and then they pointed me to where Dad was.  And I went in there, and he was sitting up in the room, and I guess he had been praying.  And he wasn't crying.  He was, you know, back to himself.  And I said, where is Mother?  And he said, "She's over there, Christine.  She's gone."  I don't know how I made it.  He said, but, you know, you can go and see her.  And they let me go over and see her.  And I just came and embraced her.  She was very, you know, didn't have a frown on her face, and she was still very warm.  And I will always, you know, remember that.  And then after that, they came, you know, and told us to come up into the chapel.  And we, in the chapel, and we had, you know, a little service up there in the chapel.  And I remember, I was still looking for my children.  Well, I remember seeing Angela, and she was sitting there just as poised and quiet, like she knew what was going on.  And we had a little service in the chapel.  And after that, we went home, and as soon as we got to home, to Dale Creek, Rosalind Carter, President Carter's wife--Jimmy Carter was the governor at that point, and she was there, you know, to console us.  The President, I mean Governor Carter wasn't in town then, but she came.  So there it was. [pause]
Speaker 2: Hard for the family.
Speaker 1: Yes, it was hard, it was very hard, very hard.  And I hadn't experienced anything like that, you know.  And Mother, and I was so pleased because that afternoon, that Saturday afternoon, I had decided to get out of the house and take the children, my son and daughter, over to K-Mart over on Bankhead.  And I said, let's stop by and see your grandmother.  And that was a good thing cause that was the last time that I saw her, last time that I was able to see her.
Speaker 2: Whatever happened to him, the guy?  He was out of his mind, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, we never brought, you know--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) charges?
Speaker 1: --went against him.  We never did, you know.  And he died several years ago, but I always said, you know, we did not believe in, you know, the death penalty, and so he lived out, you know, his life.  He finally died several years ago.  We did not testify against him.  So, that was that, the way that happened. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Good times, bad times, happy times, sad times.  That's life (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, but still--
Story_ID: 887
Speaker 1: --that the family had?
Speaker 2: Pets, we had, you know, we had a dog.  My father [Martin Luther King, Sr.], somebody gave him a monkey, and he brought that monkey home one day.  And, of course, the monkey was not, you know, acclimated to home environment, so when he turned him a loose, that monkey jumped up on the piano, up on top of the piano and all around.  He didn't stay with us long.  I think it was just one day, and Dad took him back wherever he got him (laughter).
Speaker 1: I bet your mother [Alberta Williams King] had a lot to say about that.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what about your dog, the dog. Did you have a name for the dog?
Speaker 2: Mickey.  And he got killed, you know, run over, a car ran over him.  So we didn't have, you know, too many pets.  When we later moved on Boulevard, somebody gave us, not a deer, but something similar.  What kind of animal was that?  It was a little deer.  And so we left him out on the lawn so that he could, you know, stay out there.  The next morning, we came and he was gone.  I mean he was out there, but he was dead.  Those dogs had come and taken over.  So we were real sad about that cause we didn't have that pet.
Speaker 1: And then there was a story of your brother, you know, jumping out the, I think it was out the window or trying to--
Speaker 2: When my grandmother passed, he was, he felt very guilty because he wasn't there.  You know, that was his favorite, you know, my grandmother [Jennie Celeste Williams].  And there was a window where, now, in the birth home, there's a door.  But there was a window.  And he was so distraught, and he just jumped out of the window, down a story.  Of course, he didn't get hurt or anything.  But that was the depth of his feeling badly because he wasn't around.  And, you know, we were looking for him, and he had slipped away and gone to a parade downtown.  And when somebody found him and told him, you know, he was very distraught because as I said, we were very close to my grandmother.
Speaker 1: There's a story that you tell in the book about the, you know, how women used to wear those furs--
Speaker 2: Yeah, furs.
Speaker 1: Right, can you talk about that.
Speaker 2: Yes, I guess we were trying to find something to do, and, of course, my brother, A.D. [Alfred Daniel] was always the most mischievous one.  And so my grandmother had a fur piece that she threw around her coat or jacket.  And the fur piece, it was, had a fox, and the fox had these glass eyes.  It was actually, you know, the face of a fox, and on the, attached to the fur piece.  And so the mischievous boys thought about it, and so one day, we went out, got my grandmother's fur piece, wrapped it around a broomstick and then we got behind the hedges.  And as people were going up and we would take that broomstick and the fur piece on the bottom of it and kind of push it out in front of those hedges like it was some kind of snake or something coming out.  And as they would approach it, they would see this coming out, and they would just start hollering and, you know, jumping back, and, of course, we got so much fun out of that.  But there was one man, and he was upset when he found out what was going on.  And he passed by us and went in the house and found my father and told him what we were doing.  And, of course, that stopped that because my father took care of us, you know.  And so we didn't do that anymore, but it was a lot of fun to see those people jumping in awe.  They were just, and it was just about dusk, so it was almost night.  Well, they were almost up on it before they saw it, when they saw this coming out.  It was, it was hilarious.  But that was our creative way of having fun.
Story_ID: 888
Speaker 1: I have two more questions, and one is, if, you know, the facility has been built there, you know, and we have the Center and we have the National Park Service.  What are your feelings about what has been done here in honor of your brother [Martin Luther King, Jr.] and your family?
Speaker 2: Well, I feel very good because I was right on, in from the beginning.  I worked with my sister-in-law [Coretta Scott King], we worked through the design and what it should be.  So, it's a humbling experience, but I think one that, you know, that we're pleased with.  And all the time we were building this and thinking about the entombment, I was the one, along with my sister-in-law, who my brother was moved to his final location.  It was about three times.  We first moved him from South View Cemetery [Atlanta, Georgia].  That's where he was entombed at the beginning.  And we decided that we had to move him there because hate was still on the move.  And one day we discovered that there were bullet marks in that mausoleum.  Of course, you know, it couldn't get through, but just the idea of somebody--we didn't know what they were trying to do.  So we said, we've got to get him away from where we can protect him more.  And so that's when we first brought him over--there was a vacant lot right next to the church [Ebenezer Baptist Church].  And we put him in a mausoleum there temporarily.  He stayed there for several months, and then we built, there was space further up.  And while we were constructing the King Center, as it is now, that's where he rested in that space.  And we put a picket fence around it, and, of course, people are coming visiting.  And then finally, we moved him to where he is now entombed.  And I was at the forefront of all of those moves, you know, along with my sister-in-law.  And when we first moved him from South View Cemetery, we did it early in the morning, and right then, it was unusual for much traffic to be out like 1:00 and 2:00 o'clock in the morning.  So we met, got a few deacons from Ebenezer.  And I went along with Coretta, and I think that was all, along with those deacons.  And Ralph Abernathy was with us at that point, and brought him from South View Cemetery to the funeral home, which was on Bell Street, Hanley Bell Street, and brought the casket there.  And they sprayed it because it had a little bit of mildew or something on it, and, of course, Coretta and I did not look at him.  I think Ralph looked at him, and I don't know, but Coretta and I sat in the back.  We didn't look at him, yeah, my father.  I mean my husband.  And then after that, and then we brought him over here.  And, of course, we had somebody guarding it, you know, overnight because it was not protected at all.  But he's been moved from South View to this temporary location, and then a little bit further up.  So about three times before he was entombed where he is now.
Speaker 1: Oh, the last question was gonna go (laughter).  I was wondering also about, you know, what you think your father, your brother, you know, your family would think about the work that, you know, has been done even by the National Park Service?  What do you think they would think?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a humbling experience, and I think that my brother Martin [Martin Luther King, Jr.], you know, he would be very humble and not thinking that he deserves this.  I mean he was self effacing.  He didn't look for praise and honor.  He felt more like it was a call for him.  He was not doing it for the limelight like I see a lot of people now who do things.  But it's, you know, so that I can get on camera or whatever, but my brother was not like that.  So he would be very humbled by this experienced.  And as I, I reflect on it, and I look at it, and it's very humbling to me because I'm saying, "This is my brother, and here he is up here among, you know, presidents." It's really something just growing up, you know, a normal individual, and never would have thought that anything like this would have happened in our family.
Speaker 1: That's it.  Okay, thank you.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks Mrs. Farris.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't so bad, was it?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 673428

Story_ID: 673429
Speaker 1: So, Mrs. Farris [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris], you gave us an excellent interview last time, so I would like--well, that's (unclear)--but I would like to--I was trying to think where to start.  I'd like to have you--I'd like to have you talk--well, let me start--because you had written the book ['My Brother Martin: A Sister Remembers Growing Up with the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,' Christine King Farris] in the meantime, and then if, if this doesn't strike a bell, we'll go further.  But in your book you talk about Willis [Willis Williams], Lucretia Williams--in your book; do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Lucretia Williams?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and Willis--and Lucretia Williams; that was your maternal (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That was my grandmother?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Your great--
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: Great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Can you tell me a little bit about her?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: No?  Okay, don't worry.
Speaker 2: I don't know anything about Lucretia.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, don't worry--okay.  So, I want to talk to you--I'm gonna spin forward a lot more.  I wanna talk about your work on--with the King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia], and what--if you could talk about how soon after your brother's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] death the plans for the King Center came into being.
Speaker 2: How--
Speaker 1: How--how long--you know, how--when did you start planning, you and Coretta [Coretta Scott King], the start of the King Center?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a--let's see; he was taken from us, I think, in April--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and we opened the King Center in January of--what was in 19--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  It woulda been 1969, but we've always been under the impression that it started the same year.  So you're saying it started the following year, or you're saying the programming started in January?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the programming started in January.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS): Right.
Story_ID: 673430
Speaker 1: Now, what did you establish when you were talking just now?  So, did it start--did it start--'cause I had read that it started in '68 [1968], too--that same year.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, Mom [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris], what do you recall about the very beginning of the King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia]? So uncle ML [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You know what?  We need to say who you are.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, just say who you are.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I'll just--I'll yell and say I'm--this is Julieanna Richardson and--from The HistoryMakers, and Matthew Hickey is the videographer, and with us we have your daughter, Angela Farris Watkins, okay--and she's gonna help me.  Okay.  So go on.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Okay.  So, it was April of 1968, Uncle ML was assassinated.  There was a funeral, there were several parting memorial services.  And when did the King Center start?  How did that begin from the very, very beginning?
Speaker 1: I think the King Center started in--like in the fall of '68 [1968], um-hm.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  What was that like?  What--when you say it started, was that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we decided that we needed to have--memorialize him.  Coretta [Coretta Scott King] and I decided that, and so we started making plans for the King Center.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Okay.
Speaker 1: And then what--what--Dr. Farris, what was--so, was it just the two of you planning and making plans, or were there a bunch of people also who came to--did you form a committee and--you know; I'm just trying to understand how it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Initially, Coretta and I talked about it, and then we brought in friends who assist us.
Speaker 1: And who were some of the friends?
Speaker 2: Walter McCall [Walter R. McCall].  I don't remember who else right now.
Speaker 1: Was Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] involved (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Not at that point, but later (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Not at that point.  So you, so you had--so you start thinking--so, what were your thoughts about what you wanted the center to be?
Speaker 2: Like wanted the center to be?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Well, we thought about--what we thought about was a living memorial to my brother's life and work. And from that, that's how we started the King Center--as a living memorial.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  What does that mean--a living memorial?
Speaker 2: Well, we tried to keep up with his work--his mission, and so we wanted to continue that and express that through the building of--the beginning of the King Center.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, where did it begin?  Did it begin on Auburn--the beginning of the King Center?  Where did it begin?
Speaker 2: Yes, it began on Auburn.  And I think initially we were at the birth home at 501 Auburn Avenue [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Were you on Sunset [Avenue] at any point before you moved to Auburn?
Speaker 2: Yes, we were on Sunset, and we would go from Sunset to Auburn.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.  So it started on Sunset.
Story_ID: 673431
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And so what was that like in the early days?  What did you all do?  What do you remember doing?  So you had a conversation that you wanted to begin a living memorial.  You gathered some friends, and what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, we talked about his life and his work, and we said that, you know, we need to continue his life's work, and that's what we tried to do.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, what did that look like?  Do you remember any of the plans early on?  Did you start immediately trying to build a building, or was it the archives that you started working on?  What were you--what was the business?  And then you were the financial person?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We started the King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia], and that was like a memorial to his life and work.  And I served as the vice chair and treasurer of the King Center.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, what did you do on Sunset [Avenue]?
Speaker 2: Well, did most of the work on Sunset because we--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And what was that?
Speaker 2: Well, I was just keeping the records--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --since I had my accountant background, and so forth, and so I would do the business side of--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Where did the money come from?
Speaker 2: It came from different places--people who wanted to make a contribution to the life and work of Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Was it a lot of money early on?
Speaker 2: Not a lot, but enough to get us started with something.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I mean we didn't have a, a campaign or anything like that in the beginning--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and so we just started asking friends, and those who were interested in doing something about his life and work.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  How did the archives begin?  Did you all just start gathering materials--your own materials, Aunt Coretta's [Coretta Scott King] materials, friends?  How did the archives develop?
Speaker 2: Well, since we wanted to memorialize him, we knew that we had to get his work, so we started gathering his writings, books--things that would memorialize him.
Story_ID: 673432
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, it's the fall of '68 [1968].  And then January of 1969 was his birthday--the first birthday after he was assassinated.  So you put together a program--a series of programs that year?  How did you all decide to do that?  And what, what did that look like?
Speaker 2: Well, we wanted to memorialize him--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so therefore we had--on the birthday, we had a celebration service, and after that, it just grew into various things, but it was always around his birthdate, January 15th.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  How do you--how did you all decide to do it around his birthday as opposed to around his death date?
Speaker 2: Because we wanted to make it like a living memorial.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  What did those programs look like in 1969, 1970--the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] birthday program--what did it look like then?  How was it different from what it is today?
Speaker 2: It wasn't much different.  We called on those who knew him, and eventually those people who knew that we were having something on his birthday, then they started coming to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And so it grew.
Speaker 2: It grew.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Was it a solemn program?  Was it a celebration?  What was the mood of the program?
Speaker 2: I think it was more of a celebration; it was not like a memorial service--it was a celebration of his life and work.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Were you on those programs?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was on the programs, and we had--we would have a program around his birthday or near his birthday, and I was the one who presided at the programs.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Who were some of the guest speakers?  Do you remember any of the guest speakers early on?  Were they friends of his, friends of you all's?
Speaker 2: They were friends of his.  We tried to bring in friends that were his that were close to him and who knew him.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, how did you get from Sunset [Avenue] to Auburn [Avenue]?
Speaker 2: From Sunset to Auburn?  At that point, we had decided to--the National Park Service had established ML King Memorial [Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, Washington, D.C.] and we, at that point, had started to having memorial services about the life and work of Martin.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So you partnered with the National Park Service?  That's how you got on Auburn?
Speaker 2: Yes, 'cause that--National Park Service, you know, assisted us in doing--having a celebration.
Story_ID: 673433
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Now, at that time your mother and father were still living.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  What were their names?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Sr. [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], and my mother's name was Alberta Christine Williams King [Alberta Williams King].
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And were they a part of the building of the King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia]?  And if so, what, what role did they take?
Speaker 2: Well, they were part--they would assist us--encourage us in doing whatever we wanted to do, so we began having the services around his birthdate, January 15th, and we would have that as a service.  And that continues to this day.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Now, the birth home was there where you were born, your brothers, and your parents were still living.  What role--what, what was the involvement of the birth home with the King Center at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, the government, I guess, had started the, the memorial--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  But what about the birth home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we wanted to have a memorial--the birth home, so that people could come and see where Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] grew up.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.  And your other brother [Alfred Daniel Williams King] lived for just a little time as you all were building the center, so he was found mysteriously drowned in his pool, or near his pool at home--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, at his home.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  --and what was that like?  So you all are building a King Center; one brother is assassinated, and about a year later, another brother; and yet you were trying to build an institution.  What was that like?  What were you feeling, what were you thinking--what do you remember about that?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a difficult period, but we knew that we wanted to make sure that the work of Martin Luther King, Jr. would live on.  And to this day, whatever I can still do to make sure that his work lives on, I'll do that.
Story_ID: 673434
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, what do you remember about your contributions to building the center?  What specific things do you remember?  Challenges, triumphs--do you remember any days where you were frightened about something, or hesitant about something while you were building the King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia]?  You were in and out of meetings, I'm sure.  What do you remember?
Speaker 2: Yes, we were meeting; we were in meetings, and we would go and ask for assistance, and the response was very welcome, and we were able to bring in funds when it was--as a memorial to, to Martin's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] life and work.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So you were also teaching--were you?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was teaching, at that point (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Where were you teaching?
Speaker 2: I was teaching at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.  In what area?
Speaker 2: Department of education.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, you made a decision to still work and build the King Center?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  How did you juggle?
Speaker 2: As I think back over it, it was a little challenge, but we were determined that we were gonna build a memorial to his life and work, so whatever it took, we gave ours--as much as we could do.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  That was a lot of sacrifice.
Speaker 2: It was a lot of sacrifice, but we felt that we had to do it.
Story_ID: 673435
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And what was sort of the reward?  Were there any, you know, kinds of rewards that kept you going?  Did you see anything, or--what kept you going?  Because you were teaching, you would go to work, right? And then leave and go to the King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia]; you had a family--a husband [Isaac Newton Farris, Sr.], children [Isaac Newton Farris, Jr. and Angela Farris Watkins].  What really kept you going?
Speaker 2: I guess it was a determination to make sure that my brother's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] life's work would live on.  And I have continued that through this day.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And do you think his life work has lived on?
Speaker 2: His life work has lived on.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  In what ways?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was really brought to recognition when his birthday was declared a national holiday [Martin Luther King Jr. Day].  And, of course, as it became a national holiday, then we had a service, like a memorial service, to his life and work.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, how did the national holiday help the center, or how did it help your brother's life work to be realized?
Speaker 2: Well, we determined that his, his life work needed to be remembered, and so the King Center was really a living memorial of his life and work.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Can you say more about what of his life work remains?  What specific parts of his life's work remains?
Speaker 2: Well, his life work established in what he did to make life better for a lot of people, and so the King Center has made an effort to do that.
Story_ID: 673436
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, for someone who doesn't really understand what Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] did--and you said that you all worked hard to make sure his life's work continued, but if there's someone that doesn't know what he did, what would you say?  How would you summarize his life's work?
Speaker 2: Well, his life was about making life better for others, and so whatever--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  In what way?
Speaker 2: By sharing and giving.  And so we would have--we first had a memorial service on his birthday, January 15th, and we would always have that service.  And it was like a commemoration of his life and work, and it remains that way today.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Okay.  Can you say more about what he did? Some things that you remember that he did that made a difference?
Speaker 2: That made a difference?
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.  Can you recall any one thing that he did?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a giving person, so he was always doing something, something to help others.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Could you give an example?
Speaker 2: He, he would do things that would help those who couldn't help themselves--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and he did that in a small way, and eventually it grew in a large way.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Eventually, his birthday was recognized as a national holiday [Martin Luther King Jr. Day]--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --therefore, his life's work was remembered, and is still remembered all over the nation.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Okay.  So, you said he helped people in a small way and it grew to be really something big.  So, in a small way, what are the kinds of things that he would do to help people?
Speaker 2: Well, when people were in need, he would do things that would help them--help them help themselves.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he was always willing to help, help someone.
Story_ID: 673437
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, Mom [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris], this was your brother [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  Where were you when you got the news that he had been assassinated?
Speaker 2: I was at home.  I think my grandmother [sic.] was still living.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Your mother [Alberta Williams King].
Speaker 2: My mother was.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Your mother.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And how did you receive the news?
Speaker 2: Well, like anyone receives news of a tragedy in a family.  I mean I was just really upset and torn.  And I wanted to go, but then my father [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.]--my parents said, "No, stay; we will be right with you."  And, of course, you know, they lost their son, so we all stayed together.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So he was assassinated.  Was that frightening for you?  Did anybody wonder whether whoever killed him would then try to come after you and your parents, and your other--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We didn't have time to think about that.  All we could think about was losing him.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And was that a big loss?
Speaker 2: It was a big loss to the family.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Why?
Speaker 2: Because he was our loved one; he was my brother and their, their son--my parents' son.  So it was a big loss, and we weren't prepared for it.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, you weren't prepared for it, and yet did you not hear of the threats on his life?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did hear that there was threats, but somehow we, you know, wiped that away and didn't live thinking about this could happen; we really didn't.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  That took a lot of courage.
Speaker 2: We--we went on doing, you know, what we could do.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, when you started building the King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia], how did you move past such a huge, tragic loss to focus on building an institution?
Speaker 2: Well, along with my sister-in-law, Coretta [Coretta Scott King], we said that we had to do something to keep his work and his memory alive.  And one of the first things we thought about was, of course, thinking about where he, he was born and raised, and we needed to do something about that.  And that's how we restored the birth home and then from there it just moved on into other areas.
Story_ID: 673438
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  All right.  Now, I wanna go back to when you received the news that he [Farris' brother, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.  So, your brother--your mother [Alberta Williams King] and father [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] said, "Just hold tight."  But somehow, you ended up on the plane, did you?  With your sister-in-law [Coretta Scott King] in Memphis [Tennessee].  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: How did it happen that we--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  How did you get there?
Speaker 2: Well, we knew we had to go, go to Memphis.  And with assistance, we were able to get a plane to carry us there.  And we went to Memphis.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And was that the same day that he was assassinated?  Was it night?  Did you get off of the plane?
Speaker 2: I think we got there in the evening--night.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Did you get off of the plane?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did; we got off, but not far from the plane.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And what was that like?
Speaker 2: It was just a horrible thought--unbelief, disbelief; but we kept moving because we knew that we had to keep moving.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Why did you keep moving?  So many--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Yeah, why did you keep going?  So many people sink and drop, and they're not able to keep going.  How did you--why did you keep going?  How did you keep going?
Speaker 2: Well, we felt that we had to do something to memorialize him, and that's how we came up with the living--what we call the living memorial to his life and work.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, are you saying that, because it was such a huge and tragic loss, that you then grabbed onto the thought of how do we keep his life going?  Even though his body is gone, how do we keep his life going?  Is that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we wanted to keep--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  --am I right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --keep his, his memory alive, and so we did all we could do to memorialize him.  And, you know, of course he was with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], so we did our work with SCLC and whatever else.  And then, of course, after that, then people all over the nation began to do things to memorialize him.
Story_ID: 673439
Speaker 1: You know, Miss, D- Miss Farris [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris], when you--how--can you describe your relationship with, with Coretta Scott King?  Can you--can you describe--like--because you--sometimes sister-in-laws don't get along, right?
Speaker 2: I don't know about that (laughter), but we did fine; we--she was like a sister that I--that I never had, so--and, you know, as--through his life and after his death we still remained very close.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, am I correct that when your brother got ready to propose, he couldn't afford the ring?  And what was your role in that ring?
Speaker 2: Well, I was willing to do whatever I could do; I mean I think I was teaching then, and so, you know, I gave my brother the wherewithal to get the ring.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Wow!  Wow!  Did you all ever share that story with your sister-in-law?
Speaker 2: I think we might have, um-hm.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And when did you meet her?  After he proposed?  Before?
Speaker 2: Yeah, after he proposed, um-hm.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Where?
Speaker 2: In Marion--in Alabama.  We, we drove there.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  You and--
Speaker 2: Mother [Alberta Williams King], Dad [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], A.D. [Albert Daniel Williams King].  In fact, you know, the family went to meet Coretta's and her--her family.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And that was after.  Did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I met her when I was in New York [New York] at Columbia, attending Columbia University, and it was sometime then that I met her.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And what did you think?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked her a lot, and I could see that ML [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] liked her, so that made it fine and, you know, she was introduced to the other family, and they all liked her.
Speaker 1: How would you describe her?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How would you describe Coretta?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Coretta was a--she was a, a vibrant young lady, and she was determined that--to continue her work.  She was singing--her major was music, and she wanted to continue that, and she continued that.  So, as I grew to know her, we grew closer.  I think--people used to say we were somewhat alike.
Speaker 1: What did they mean by that?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: What did they mean by that?
Speaker 2: What did they mean by that?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, that you were both some- somewhat alike.
Speaker 2: I think the manner in which she lived; that's all I can remember.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Did she cook?
Speaker 2: She was a good cook.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  What did she cook?  What were some of her good dishes?
Speaker 2: Collard greens, cornbread, sweet potatoes, yams.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Did your brother enjoy her cooking?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.  She really did.
Story_ID: 673440
Speaker 1: And so when you're planning the King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia]--the two of you were planning the King Center, who else is, is--oh, we were talking about how the King Center was started on--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Sunset [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Sunset, then moved to ITC, right?  And then Auburn [Avenue].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, how did it get to ITC?  How did you all move from Sunset to ITC?
Speaker 1: Well, we had to have a building--
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Why?
Speaker 1: --and of course Sunset was in the home, and we had--the building needed space--the building, and so we moved to ITC.  They gave us some space there for a little while.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And ITC is the Interdenominational--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Denominational--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  --Theological Center (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --Center.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Did you have friends there?  How did you land there as opposed to at another school or another building?
Speaker 1: Well, it was like a seminary, and since he [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was a minister and, you know, we are closer to the Interdenominational Theological Center [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Do you remember that space at all?  You remember anything about what it looked like?
Speaker 1: The space--it was just a, a regular building.  I don't know there was anything unique about it.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  What was there?  Was it just your office?  Your sister-in-law's [Coretta Scott King] office?  Was that it?
Speaker 1: Yes, at that point.  And of course, much of the work was done out of the home on Sunset--
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, of course, I would go on Sunset--
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in the afternoon after I left my work teaching [at Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Then I was teaching in Atlanta Public Schools--
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I would go there and stay there late into the evening, planning, and what--and what we wanted the King Center to be.  And we wanted a King Center, and that's how it got its name.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, when you moved to ITC, there were offices.  Was there a library or archives there?
Speaker 1: No.  We, we did--we had some space there, and we did all the work that we were doing in that small space we had until we moved to the birth home.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Next door to the birth home?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Okay.
Speaker 1: We had space there, and we moved there next door to the birth home.
Speaker 2: Is that the time that the National Park Service is involved?
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So they--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so--
Story_ID: 673441
Speaker 1: How much--you talk about, at the beginning, raising money.  How much money did you raise?  You said you, you had a small, small amount.  How, how much money did you raise at the beginning, you think?
Speaker 2: I really don't remember exact amount, but I know that there were thousands of dollars, and we were building on that, and we were able, with those dollars, to--to build the center--build.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Do you remember how much it cost to build the current King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] building?
Speaker 2: No, I don't have those figures right before me--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but I can, you know, I can get that.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Did that require a lot of fundraising--a lot more fundraising than in the early days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it required fundraising but it seemed like people were interested in it, and so the contributions were large, and people wanted--I guess they wanted to also build some type of memorial.  So that's how they came.
Story_ID: 673442
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, the King Center initially was the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Why that name?
Speaker 2: My brother's was--philosophy was about nonviolence, and so since that was his philosophy that he lived and preached, and this is gonna be named after him, that is how it came to be the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And, at some point, you had workshops and teach-ins going around the nonviolent philosophy?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Around his birthday we would have what we called workshops, and the workshops were about his philosophy.  And people were interested, and they came and were a part of it, and it grew, and grew.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Did you teach in the workshop?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, um-hm, teaching about his philosophy of nonviolence.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And then you were--did you write a work text [March On!: The Day My Brother Martin Changed the World, Christine King Farris] about his life and work?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Why did you write that?
Speaker 2: Because I wanted to be a part of continuing his work, and so I knew of--knew him and knew his philosophy, so I felt that I was the one to do that.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.  And that was for students?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.  And then you wrote another book?
Speaker 2: Another book.  I wrote somewhat like an autobiography [My Brother Martin: A Sister Remembers Growing Up With the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Christine King Farris].
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.  Children's books?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I wrote a children's book about my brother because when they found out that I was Martin's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] sister, schools around the city, and especially around his birthday--leading up to his birthday--they would invite me to come and speak and share.  And I enjoyed doing that.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And so because they were inviting you, you decided to put it all in writing.
Speaker 2: Yes, I decided--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  For children.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I decided to write--I first wrote a children's book, and later, of course, an adult book [Through It All: Reflections on My Life, My Family, and My Faith, Christine King Farris].
Story_ID: 673443
Speaker 1: Miss Farris [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris], with the--okay, I have several questions.  With the work--so you said that even after the, the deaths, that you weren't fearful?  There was--I mean because you have young kids; both you and Coretta [Coretta Scott King] have young kids.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, and, you know, A.D. [Alfred Daniel Williams King] dies, then your mother [Alberta Williams King] dies.  You're not fearful about the kids?
Speaker 2: Fearful?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: No, I really wasn't.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, your brother [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was mysteriously shot and killed--one brother was; then a year later, another brother was mysteriously drowned--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Drowned.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  --and then four or five years later, your mother was shot and killed in the middle of church; you were there--you witnessed it.  What happened to your fear?
Speaker 2: It was, you know, my belief in God, and that--that carried me through those times.  God will take care of you.  And that had been with me from then, and even to this day.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, you weren't worried that something would happen to your children, to your father [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], to your husband?  You didn't start getting like really cautious about where you went, where your children were?
Speaker 2: I think I would check out where I was going, but I--I didn't get so naive that I couldn't move and couldn't move about because the work had to go on.  And I continued, the best that I could, to keep going.  I wasn't gonna go and sit somewhere and become, you know, a pity--pitiful case.
Speaker 1: But where did that come from?  Because--you know, especially in today when everything is motivated by fear.  I mean where does that come from that that sort of--I mean I--I don't know many people who would have that ability, you know, that they would not be hurt in many ways.  And I'm just wondering is that--was that you, your person?  You know, was--was Coretta like you, also?  Or was she different than you in that?
Speaker 2: No, I think we were all like that, and my father led the way, and we, you know, led to believe that we weren't out here alone--that God would be with us no matter the way we moved and traveled.  And places where people would be fearful to go, we were able to go because of our belief.
Speaker 1: And your belief never--you never challenged God; you never asked--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Never, never.  You know, maybe--I guess some people might say, "Well, why me?"  No, we didn't do that.
Story_ID: 673444
Speaker 1: So, tell--why don't you share some stories of you and Coretta's times together.
Speaker 2: Well, I often say that Coretta [Coretta Scott King] was like a sister that I never had.  We were very close; we were close when my brother [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was living, and we were even closer when he passed.
Speaker 1: I notice that Angela [Angela Farris Watkins] is born--was born the same year as, as Bernice [HistoryMaker Bernice Albertine King].
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  One year after.
Speaker 1: One after.  Isn't there--I thought there was one--oh, so it's just a year after.  So no one was born the same year then.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you're--both have young, young ones.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, what was that like?  Did you all share stories of what you would--how you would raise your children, and--
Speaker 1: Yes, we would often talk about that, and she would give me, you know, hints about what she was doing, and that was very helpful.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Is that--is that how we ended up going to Camp Blue Star [Hendersonville, North Carolina]?  Did you all get together on that?
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hm.  In other words, I don't know how Bernice and Coretta knew about Blue Star but, you know, since we were so close, you know, whatever Coretta's doing with Bernice, then, you know, Angela was a part of that with, with Bernice.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And is that the reason we went to the same high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Atlanta, Georgia], same colleges [Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio]?
Speaker 1: Yes, that was--that was the reason, you know.  Bernice is about a year older (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Older, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So you all--you and your sister-in-law raised your children together in a similar way.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.
Speaker 2: But how, how did you go about raising them?  Because the children are seeing, you know, lost ones--you know, family members--leave them, so what are you telling the children?
Speaker 1: What did what?
Speaker 2: What are you telling your children?  What are you telling them that's important?  What, what kind of environment are you creating for them?
Speaker 1: Well, we taught them to trust in God, and to believe, and I think that they saw that in us, and so they became believers and--it was just a part of life.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So how did you explain the losses when one brother was killed and the other one [Alfred Daniel Williams King] was mysteriously drowned?  Your mother [Alberta Williams King] was shot--how--what did you say to your children about that?
Speaker 1: I did not want them to live a life of fear, and so I tried to encourage them and, you know, tell them to keep doing what they were doing because your grandmother would--this is what she would want done.  And you all just grew up around that life.
Story_ID: 673445
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  I'm wondering if--while Farris is here--do you wanna ask your grandmother [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris] some questions?

Speaker 1: (Laughter) Farris has asked all along the way.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Hm?
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS): I said I'm kind of sleepy.

Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Can you do one or two?  Just for historical purposes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: You sure? Yeah, for purposes.  Come on, Farris.  So, she's asked her grandmother a lot of questions, huh?
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Over the years.
Speaker 2: Well, she's, she's a, she's a good observer, too.
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  I don't know what to ask.
Speaker 2: You don't know? Well continue on--your mother's [Angela Farris Watkins] doing an excellent job. I'm about to give her a job (laughter).
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS): I ask her so many questions (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Shoot, usually I'm like, okay, let me take over.  I'm just sitting here going like (laughter) it's--that's history, that's the first time, I'm usually like (laughter) grabbing the thing back (laughter).
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Thank you, that is quite a compliment coming from you, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Instead, I'm just like, like this over here.
Speaker 1: What was that?
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  She was saying I'm doing such a good job (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Usually I'm grabbing the mic [microphone] back (laughter).
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Right, like, okay, let me have it, let me have it.
Speaker 1: I'm just sitting here going like this, good question (laughter).
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, for your sake, and for the sake of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You need to introduce yourself.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Yeah, introduce yourself--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  --and then think about, for your sake and for the sake of history, what questions would you ask your grandmother.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Okay.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  About her life, about you in her life.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We're rolling, you can ask whenever you're ready.
Speaker 1: Introduce yourself first.
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Okay.  So, am I introducing myself to her?
Speaker 1: Well, well you--we're recording it, so you have to introduce yourself, but, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Okay.  Hello, Grandmother.
Speaker 1: Hi, Farris Christine.
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  (Laughter)--My name is Farris Christine Watkins.  How any questions to ask?
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):   Just do two.
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Okay.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And speak loud.
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Okay.  What was the influence of being--not what was, because we know, but like since so many of our--the women in our family are educators, like what, what pushed you to wanna become a educator?
Speaker 1: To become an educator?
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  I guess that was a part of my life because my mother [Alberta Williams King] was a teacher, my grandmother [Farris' maternal grandmother, Jennie Parks Williams] was a teacher--
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  (Laughter) I know.
Speaker 1: --so, that was just the teacher coming along.
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  So, was there like one moment that you were like, "I guess I'll do this teaching thing," or you just kinda knew the whole time like you wanted to be a teacher?
Speaker 1: Was there a moment I was like what?
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  That you said that--was there like one specific moment that you knew that that was gonna be like your life's work, or--
Speaker 1: I guess it was, 'cause I--you know, I just kept going in the same direction, and I never looked at any other way.
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Any other way.  And that was because of your mother and your grandmother?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  That was because of your mother and your grandmother?
Speaker 1: I guess so; that's what I knew.  They were both teachers, so I guess that's what I knew.
Story_ID: 673446
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Can you explain the story of my birth?  How you and grandpa [Isaac Newton Farris, Sr.] came in (laughter)?
Speaker 2: How what?
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  How you and grandpa came into the labor room--the delivery room all frantic because the car alarm went off?  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: They had taken your mother [Angela Farris Watkins] on to the hospital, and naturally I was going, but I wasn't dressed to go, so I had to find something to put on, and your daddy was rushing; he--granddaddy was rushing, he wanted to go on and go, and so I guess we was still discussing that when we got to the--to the room (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Hm.
Speaker 2: --'cause Angela [Angela Farris Watkins] remembers something about that, don't you Angela?
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  About the car alarm?
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  I remember when you all came in, and I was in tremendous pain--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  --and you all were fussing about the car alarm going off when you got in the car headed to the hospital.  Both of you all were in a rush to get there, and you all came in the room. "We'd been on our way for a long time, but your daddy set the car alarm off."  "No, it was Christine [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris]; if she had just let me do what I was doing"--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  --and you all were going back and forth, and I said, "Guess what?  I don't care!  I'm in labor!  I'm in pain!"
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, that--that's a, a fun memory.  But do you remember when Farris [Farris Christine Watkins] was--when you could first see her.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  You were right in front of me when you could first see her.  Do you remember that?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  You saw her head?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I could see some hair, and I said, "Oh, it's a girl" (laughter).
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Were you looking forward to a granddaughter?
Speaker 1: I think I must've been looking forward to a granddaughter.
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  (Laughter) So, if I was a boy, you wouldn't have been happy?
Speaker 1: A little happy (laughter).
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  I'm glad I'm a girl (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Aw, man (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Oh, that's probably why she doesn't accept the dog (simultaneous).

Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  What about the expectations for your life?
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Oh, do you have--well, I feel like I have fulfilled majority of the expectations.
Speaker 1: Say what?
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Do you (laughter)--do you have any, any expectations for my life?
Speaker 1: Expectations for your life?
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  My expectation for your life is what your life is now.  You're going on; I'm anxious to see what you got to do after you graduate 'cause your mother [Angela Farris Watkins] and I both were teachers.
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I'm not sure that that's where you're going.  I, I don't know.
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  (Laughter) Well--
Speaker 1: I think--sometimes you think you pull back from that 'cause, mother's like that, grandmother (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Yeah, I mean that's why I asked that question, because for a lot of my life--everything but pledging AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] I was rebellious with--going to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], and wanting to be a educator; I think I was--even joining the church (laughter).  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Then, then you want to be an educator?
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Well, this past summer, you know, I worked with the music camp where I was basically teaching fourth (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  --fourth, fifth, and some sixth graders, and I loved it.  And it just really made me--like I loved it in a way that I had never loved anything in terms of--like--and a passion for giving.  So, I don't know; it's something I'm thinking about.  But that's why I asked, like every woman in our family has been an educator; so I feel like naturally, that would be in my DNA.  And even my, my boss for the music camp, she was like, "You've never worked with kids before?"  And I was like, "No."  She was like, "That's crazy because you're such a natural."
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  So--but it was something that I enjoyed doing.  Like, I would call Mom after I had got off work, like, "These kids just drive me crazy!  But I love them so much" (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Some of 'em I actually still like stay in contact with their parents because they're always checking on me, so--but I don't know, it's like--going the extra mile for those kids wasn't a burden for me, it was--natural.  So, we'll see.
Story_ID: 673448

Speaker 1: Well, I was going to the reception--
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  With?
Speaker 1: --the (unclear) reception.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  With?
Speaker 1: With some of my friends that I (laughter)--oh--

Speaker 1: No (laughter).
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  No?

Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  (Laughter) So, you saying Porter took you out and he wasn't interested in you; he was interested more in the food.

Speaker 1: What was it like going to--you know, at the time?  You know, because--what was it like going to school at that time?

Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Why not?
Speaker 2: That was just the dress code.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  What would happen if you did?
Speaker 2: Nobody ever did, 'cause you knew you would get, you know--be in trouble if you did, so nobody ever did it.  They slip off campus and do it, but when you got on campus, you had the clothes--the full clothes on.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Did you ever have to wear white gloves?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that.

Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  You won't get in the door.
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Yeah, sometimes you won't get in the door, yeah--it depends; it depends on the teacher.  Some teachers are very old school, some are late themselves, so (laughter), just depends (laughter).
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, this Coca-Cola bottle.  Someone told the story once that in your dorm, you all would use a Coca-Cola bottle and roll it down the hall for a certain purpose.  Why would you do that?
Speaker 2: I think we weren't supposed to be there--be out on the halls, and so that Coca-Cola bottle served as, you know, the in between.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  A signal--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  --to let somebody know that somebody was coming, or to watch out?

Speaker 2: Uh-huh, so they could know.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Smart.
Speaker 2: You could think of all kinds of things then--all kinds of things to do when you weren't supposed to go off campus (laughter).  And I think I got punished once for going off, 'cause I'd go off and catch a streetcar and come home (laughter).
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Oh, go home home.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And your parents [Alberta Williams King and Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] would look up and say, "What are you doing here?"
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, they, they knew I wasn't supposed to be there.  But the problem was getting back home (laughter), 'cause they would close those gates at a certain time.
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Oh, Lord.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, how did you get back home?
Speaker 2: Oh, we had ways of tricking to get on--get (laughter), get through those gates--slip back home.  I never got caught (laughter).
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  You were smart.
Story_ID: 673453

Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we would find out 'bout what time the streetcar was coming, run and get that streetcar, and go home.  And Mother [Alberta Williams King] would look up and say, "What are you doing here this time?"  (Laughter) 'Cause she knew I wasn't supposed to be there (laughter).
Speaker 2: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Did you go home because you missed your family?
Speaker 1: Huh?

Speaker 2: I don't think it has changed that much.  They had, you know, certain rules, or something that--if you were in education and you wanted to be a teacher, then sometimes you'd go off campus, but a lotta times we'd slip off campus.  I don't know how much slipping we did, but I never did get caught (laughter).

Speaker 1: Yes.  You never get really adjust--or used to it; I think I have adjusted to it, and then, you know how people say, "Oh, that's Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] sister!"  Yes, I am (laughter).  But I don't, you know, wear it like that--like a badge of honor.  He was my brother, and that's the way I take it.  I mean I can't--I'm so proud of everything that he did, but I cannot, you know, lead over the people say, "Oh, you're Martin Luther King's sister?"  "Yes, I am.  May I help you?"  (Laughter) That's it.
Speaker 2: Was it--there was--there was--there has been criticism of the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: There have been--there've been--there's been criticism, not so much of the extended family, but of the kids.  What have you--how have you handled and worked with this--the kids that way?
Speaker 1: How did I handle--
Speaker 2: Right, and work with--you know, with Bernice [HistoryMaker Bernice Albertine King], and before Yolanda [Yolanda King]--before she passed away or, you know, Dexter [Dexter Scott King] and Martin III [Martin Luther King III].  How have you worked with them in that way?  'Cause there's been criticism of them.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I've always--we've always been close, and so when they hurt, I'm hurt.  So when people, you know, lash out at them then, you know, I feel like they lashing out at me, too.
Speaker 2: Are there things that you--'cause I mean you talk about--I mean I think that--maybe we could just stay on that point that it's hard to be in the light--the public light, right?
Speaker 1: (Nods head).
Speaker 2: There are--like, you know, when you were talking about--and I don't think people think about that, you know, like the sacrifices--what it took to make the King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] what it was--you know, what it is?  And you--you're raising a family, you're teaching, you're going every night.  But sometimes people perceive that the--you know, the family is getting things and not giving or, you know, fighting amongst each other, and all of that.  What--how would you--what would you say about that?  Or is it more that they've had to live their private life on a public stage?
Speaker 1: Yes, that was--that was kinda hard for them.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, people say that Bernice, Martin, and Dexter are greedy--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Greedy?
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  --greedy, they're nothing like their father, what's wrong with them?  What's all the fighting about?  What would you say?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, people are responsible because they treat them that way.  I don't think they would be, be that way.  But people have built in their minds, oh, this is who they are, you know; this--this is them--never really knowing them.  I mean they are ordinary people just like them, but I guess it's because they're not close to them, and so they don't--you know, they don't understand.  And I get a little of that, you know.  People--some people (unclear), "Oh, that's Martin Luther King's sister!"  Yes, I am (laughter).
Story_ID: 673467
Speaker 1: So, tell me about the--tell me about the memorial [Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial], you know, and what--your feelings about the memorial, you know, that was built.
Speaker 2: Where?  In Washington?
Speaker 1: In Washington, D.C.  Can you talk about the memorial, and, and what that meant to you or, you know, whether you approved of it or not, and--'cause [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, she was upset about it.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  She was?
Speaker 1: The slogan.  Remember the name--the--do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was something that she was upset--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  I'm vaguely remembering that.  What was that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, we talked to her about that.  I don't remember exactly what it was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: It was the, it was the, the slogan on the side.  She said it was mis- you know, that it, it was the wrong--
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  I vaguely remember that, yeah.  And I think they corrected it.
Speaker 1: They corrected it.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Yeah, they corrected it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  It was a quote on the side of the memorial--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  --right on the side, and I forget what the quote was, but maybe they missed a word, or--I think it was a spacing deal.
Speaker 1: It was something and, and she was--yeah, she was upset about that.  But why don't you talk about your feelings about the memorial?
Speaker 2: The memorial?  Well, I think--you know, I'm pleased with it.  I, I don't think--you know, I'm, I'm not--I guess I'm not seeing anything like it, and it's just an humbling experience to me, that my brother [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is in the Washington, D.C.--the capital (laughter).
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It--it's amazing.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And you went up on the lift to see the head of the statue at eye level.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  What was that like?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was very moving--very moving.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  How so?
Speaker 2: Just--I, I, I just--you know, thankful, humble, you know.  This is my brother, um-hm.
Story_ID: 673468
Speaker 1: You know--and, and Mrs. Farris [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris], you've said--I, I'd like to also know the difference between the collections that are at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: The questions what?
Speaker 1: The difference between the collection at Boston University and what is at the AU Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia].  I would like--what is the difference between those collections?  I do remember you saying that when you went to BU, you felt your brother's presence.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But I would like to know the--what is it--well, actually, I would like to know what's at BU, at the AU Center, and at the King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia], and what the difference.  Because, you know, tonight Angela's [Angela Farris Watkins] talked a lot about the archives at the, at the, at the, at the King Center, so I would like you to set the record straight about what is where.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, there are papers at the Howard Gotlieb Center [Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Boston, Massachusetts] in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: In Boston [Massachusetts](simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  --in Boston.  And there are papers that were sold to the City of Atlanta [Georgia] that are now at the Atlanta University Woodruff Library [Robert W. Woodruff Library, Atlanta, Georgia].  And there are papers and archives at the King Center.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  What's the difference?
Speaker 1: What's the difference?
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, there's not much difference because they are the same--from the same--come from the same place.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So I don't know that it's, it's that much difference, of course--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, if someone had a choice to go to one of them--if they wanted to have some exposure to Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and they said, "I don't know; should I go to the Howard Gotlieb Center in Boston?  Should I go there?  Should I go to the King Center?  Should I go to the Woodruff archives?"  Which would you say?
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on what they're actually looking for.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: If they wanna know the real Martin Luther King, then go to the King Center, but if (unclear) do on another side, if they wanna know about his, his works and things then, you know, go to one of those other places.  But I think if you wanna know about the real Martin Luther King, Jr., then come to the King Center--Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, are you saying that the King Center has a more comprehensive history of his whole life, whereas the papers at the Woodruff Library and the Boston University Center are just a part--a little bit (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yeah, they are just--they are just a part of it.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Okay.
Speaker 1: If you really want to know about him, the best place to do is to come to the King Center.
Story_ID: 673469
Speaker 1: So, what are your hopes for the King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] going forward?  What are your hopes as you sit here and, you know, really almost on the fiftieth anniversary of his, his passing.  What are your hopes?
Speaker 2: Angela [Angela Farris Watkins]?
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  What do you expect that will happen with the King Center going forward?
Speaker 2: I would hope that it will continue to promote his work--his life's work--so that, you know, he did not live in vain.  I would hope that it will continue, and I hope the King Center will continue to do all it can do to preserve that.  So, if somebody wants to know really about Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], the best place is to go to the King Center; and then all the other places--they're okay, but if you wanna know the real story, King Center.
Speaker 1: So, what--okay, and today--can you cast it in today's world--like what would her brother think about today--you know--
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --can you cast that?
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Do you think--do you think that your brother Martin was in agreement with the building of the King Center?  Do you think he would have been pleased?
Speaker 1: I often wonder about that.  I think, you know, he was what I call a humble person, so he would be pleased to the extent that people would learn more about him.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's the way that he would, would approach it.  He's not interested in building a whole lot of it, you know, like this.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  So, today--the King Center's work today; do you think he would be pleased with it today? The King Center's work.
Speaker 1: I think so.  The King Center--you know, if you really want to know about Martin Luther King, the King Center is the place to go.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Not Washington [D.C.]--
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but the King Center.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  And do you feel that the King Center's work today is still relevant?  Is there anything that the King Center needs to be doing differently for this--for, for 2017, for young people in the ways that they are today?  Do you think the King Center is still meeting its objectives (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Well, the King Center does that on a smaller scale, and that's because, you know, they are not able to carry it out.  But if you really want to learn a little about the real Martin Luther King, then go to the King Center.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, what--what would your--what would your brother think about the political climate of today?
Speaker 2: Political climate?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Or where the country is fifty years after his death.
Speaker 2: I think he would be raising questions, you know, like where are we going?  Which way are we goin'?  I don't know where we are going.  I, I don't understand (laughter); I don't know where.  And I think that would be the questions in his mind.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And what does his death represent fifty years--what does his death represent fifty years--for the black community fifty years afterwards?  What--today what do you think his death represents?
Speaker 1: I really don't think that we have done the best job of putting him out there like he really was.  I don't think we've, we've done that--
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and that's what I'd like, you know, for it to be done.  In other words, I'm not sure that people, you know, knew Martin Luther King--how he grew up, how he came to be where he, he got, you know?  That's what I want people to know.
Story_ID: 673470
Speaker 1: I mean we've gone to the highest level in the country.  The president of the United States is a black man [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  I know when I was growing up I never even envisioned that; so I think the country has made some strides there.  And, every now and then you see, you know, that--that same kinda thing across the country.  But there's still that separation of black and white, and I don't know how we will overcome that.  We've come a long way from even when I was growing up--we've come a long way.  But, you know, it's still a white country--put it that way, even though blacks are around, but it's still white.
Story_ID: 673471
Speaker 1: And what do you--what do you want your legacy to be, Mrs. Farris [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris]?
Speaker 2: My legacy?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I really don't know.  I mean I hope that it will be seen that I was interested in building community like brothers and sisters, and I think--and to help someone; that's what I was taught, and that's what I try to do--to live to help someone along life's way.
Speaker 1: And when you think of your family--going back to even slavery and your--and the whole relationship with your family, both with Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], what would--and Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia] (laughter), and Atlanta [Georgia] and the world, what do you want your legacy--and you see your granddaughter here--what do you think your family's legacy is?
Speaker 2: Do I think it was?
Speaker 1: Is.
Speaker 2: I'd like to know what she thinks and what she--she's heard.  That's a good question 'cause I never asked Farris [Farris Christine Watkins] that, you know.  Farris--
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Hm.
Speaker 2: You get questions and something about the King family.
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Do I?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Hm, it depends.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  I said it depends.  I know when I was younger and--when I was younger they would ask a lot like--mostly like while Aunt Coretta [Coretta Scott King] was still living.  And then like right after she died, they would ask me like, "Well, do you remember her?"  And I'm like, "Well, yeah like she just died" (laughter).
Speaker 2: Say what?
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  People would ask about like my relationship with Aunt Coretta.  And then--I don't know; like some people would just ask like, "Well, what is Dexter [Dexter Scott King] like?  We never see him."  And I would just tell 'em, like, "He's, he's very smart" (laughter); "He's very intellectual, but he's very quiet and very shy--to himself."  But it wasn't anything--nobody's ever asked me anything that was like crazy or insulting.  All the interview questions are like, "What is it like to hold this legacy?"  And I'm like, I don't necessarily feel like it's a legacy; like it's a--more of a obligation; like we all have a duty to serve mankind, and we just have--we just so happen to have a member of our family be prominent in doing so, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't do it.
Speaker 2: Do they--at, at, at Spelman do they, they know you as Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] niece?
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They do?
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Yeah, but--I mean the way that y'all have raised me is like--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  I said the way that y'all have raised me is to not like use that as a crutch.  So it's not like I walk around campus like, "Oh, I'm Martin Luther King's niece."  Like, no, like, I'm Farris Watkins; my last name is Watkins, so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So--but what do you want the legacy to be?  Or what do you think it is?
Speaker 2: What, Martin's legacy?
Speaker 1: No, your family's legacy?
Speaker 2: I would like for it to be that, you know, that we are interested in building a better community, society, and that is being interested and kind to all people, regardless of race, nationality--whatever.
Story_ID: 673472
Speaker 1: Can you talk about your family?  I mean your, your dau- you know, we haven't mentioned your--I mean we've mentioned your son, but not by name.  So, can you talk about your, your son and your daughter, and your grand--you know, can you do just a little bit--just a little description like you--when he was born; he was the first-born.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My son was, was--you know, he was first.
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: Is Isaac Farris, Jr. [Isaac Newton Farris, Jr.], um-hm.  But I see a lot of King in him.  Do you, Angela [Angela Farris Watkins]?
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  I do.  I do, a lot.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm, a lot.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm, I do, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then Angela was second, right?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Angela--then Angela came?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Angela came on, and she took it, and she's really, you know--like--Angela, you know, she carries on the family legacy, and I'm proud of that, 'cause she reaches back and beyond.  Some of the family we didn't even know, and Angela somehow hooked up with 'em, like--what was his name?  (Laughter) Crazy boy.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  George.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: George.
Speaker 2: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm, a distant--very distant relative, um-hm.
Speaker 1: (FARRIS CHRISTINE WATKINS):  Last name?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  A very distant relative.
Speaker 2: That's right--last name.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Huh?
Speaker 2: Last name George?
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Will--no, Williams--George Williams [ph.], um-hm.  I think Farris [Farris Christine Watkins] was saying Gladys Knight is also a relative.
Speaker 2: Gladys Knight is a relative?
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm, she's a distant relative, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause she's from here in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Yep, um-hm, yep.
Speaker 2: And then your husband [Isaac Newton Farris, Sr.].  He's been your husband for fifty--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (ANGELA FARRIS WATKINS):  Fifty-seven years.
Speaker 2: That's a long time (laughter).
