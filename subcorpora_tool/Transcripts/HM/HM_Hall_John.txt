Speaker 2: It's the Nabrit-Mapp-McBay Building on Morehouse College's Campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 30655
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask.  It's kind of a warm-up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they only require short answers.  And the first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, paella.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, blue.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Autumn.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Barcelona [Spain].
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's from the poem, "I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul."
Speaker 1: Invictus.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, I'm going to ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 30656
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but separately.  So we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Mary Emma Hall, maiden name Watson.  That's M-A-R-Y  E-M-M-A  H-A-L-L, Watson, W-A-T-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was August the 22nd, 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born, I think she was born in Eufala, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Eufala?
Speaker 2: That's E-U-F-A-L-A, or thereabouts, but I'm not really sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's a good chance, though?
Speaker 2: A good chance.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family in terms of the generations that preceded her?
Speaker 2: Okay, I do know that her father was Acy, A-C-Y, Watson, and her mother was Fannie Mae Watson.  I do know that she had two brothers and two sisters and their names--I do know that her family were of Italian descent, and they...
Speaker 1: Italian and African-American, or...
Speaker 2: No, they were just Italian.
Speaker 1: So your mother was Italian.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the history of my family is that they were Sephardic Jews that had migrated from Spain--in fact, my oldest sister's name was Valencia--from Spain to Italy and then to the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they had migrated from Spain to Italy to...?
Speaker 2: To the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When did they come over?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Do you think it was around the turn of the century or so?
Speaker 2: It must have been.  It must have been somewhere around 1890, and when I look back at the census records, it must have been around 1890 or a little before that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright, now is there a story behind how they got the name Watson?
Speaker 2: I'm sure there is, but I don't know what it is.  I know that what we think is that they wanted to really fit into American society, because if you look back at the census records, her oldest brother is named Rosell, but they had him listed as a girl, as a female in the census record, named Rosa, R-O-S-A.  So, if you look at their names then and you look at the names that they took on later on, they were a little bit different.  Like, Catherina became Catherine, because they wanted to fit in.  And so, I imagine that was carried down from her grandparents, because I guess when people move here from other countries, they mostly want to assimilate into the American culture some kind of way.
Speaker 1: I've heard stories that on Ellis Island [New York] people sometimes were given names by the authorities because they couldn't pronounce the names they had.
Speaker 2: That could be the case, you know, and Watson is a good English-type name (laughter) that they could use.
Speaker 1: You know, I think about the writer, Irving Wallace, is really Irving Walinchinski, you know--Polish, Jewish, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: His son went back and took Walinchinski.  So, there's a story there somewhere that needs to be told, probably.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, did your mother, there's a good chance she was born in Alabama, so do you know what port of entry they came in, did they come into New York City, or...?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Because there are, I've heard stories of people coming in through the south--Mobile [Alabama], New Orleans[Louisiana], Biloxi [Mississippi], even.
Speaker 2: It could have been that.  I mean, you can look back, but it just stops around 1800.  You can't see any further back.  It's like they didn't exist before then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 30657
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, now what did your mother [Mary Emma Watson] say about growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, she said that she was ostracized a lot in school, and people made fun of her and called her different names, and she would talk about the names that they called her, but I didn't have any relationship to the names that they called her until I got to be older and found out that if we came from Italy, that made sense.  You know, it made sense. But, her father [Acy Watson] was--always had a job, and he worked as a fireman.  One of his last jobs was a fireman in Birmingham, Alabama.  And a fireman is a person who shoveled coal into the fire pit and then into the boiler, I guess, to make fire.   And she talked a little bit about school.
Speaker 1: So, was he a fireman on a train?
Speaker 2: No, he was a fireman--as far as I can make out, he worked in a building.  He shoveled the coal into the boiler to make heat for the building.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know that there's a job like that, too, on a train.
Speaker 2: Yeah on a train, he wasn't on a train because he didn't travel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she said they lived in a middle class neighborhood.  And, I know she went all the way up through high school.  She actually--her profession, she was a nurse.
Speaker 1: Did she have nurse's training outside of high school?
Speaker 2: Right, she had nurse's training outside of high school.
Speaker 1: Do you know where she went to school?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did her family, were they practicing Jews or..?
Speaker 2: No, they weren't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't practice at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they have any religion at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, primarily.  It was interesting because her sister's family became Catholic, which I guess is probably the logical choice, considering where they were from (laughter).  But they became Catholic and they still are Catholic.
Speaker 1: Okay, her sister's family?
Speaker 2: Yes, her sister's family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But the family, her immediate family?
Speaker 2: Her family, her immediate family, she did not practice any religion.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's interesting for the South.  Well, let me--what was--her father's name was Acy Watson and her mother Fannie May Watson?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 30658
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: John Henry Hall, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is May 15th, 1909.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Georgia.  He was born in, I believe it was Gibson, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, I know that his mother [Ruby Moore] died giving birth to him.  I know that his name--his father was really not the man that she was married to.  She was pregnant before she married him, with my father.
Speaker 1: Well, do you know the name of both of them, or...?
Speaker 2: The name of the man that was my father's father, was named Frank Ware.  And the man that she married was named Sam Hall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Wait a minute, I'm confused now.
Speaker 2: It is confusing (laughter).
Speaker 1: I've confused myself here.  Alright, we were talking about your...
Speaker 2: My father.
Speaker 1: And his mother died during--so your father's father could have been--was actually?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  So my father's father was actually Frank Ware.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: She married Sam Hall, and so my father's name became John Hall, although Sam Hall was not his real father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did his biological father play any part in his...?
Speaker 2: None whatsoever.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was raised by his stepfather, basically.
Speaker 2: Right.  Until the age of eleven, his stepfather died suddenly, tragically actually.  He was killed by lightning.
Speaker 1: So, what did he do after that, who did he live with?
Speaker 2: Well, so after his [Hall's father] mother died, Sam Hall, who was married to his mother, right, Sam Hall married his mother's sister, Sally.  And after Sam died, Sally married a man that I actually knew, but I don't know his real name, we just call him Uncle Red.  So, I actually knew Sally and I knew Uncle Red.  And actually when I knew them as a child, I didn't actually know that that was his mother's sister, nor had Sally been married to his stepfather, his adopted father.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did his real father have children with Sally?
Speaker 2: Yes, and his name was Clinton Hall.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's got a brother named Clinton Hall?
Speaker 2: Clinton Hall, C-L-I-N-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your dad, now was it difficult on your father, you know, with all the changes, and not having a mother in the beginning?
Speaker 2: Well, he left home when he was fourteen, because he didn't like living with Aunt Sally and Uncle Red, and he went out and got a job and started working.  I don't know exactly where he worked, he did odd jobs around, and he moved from Georgia to a place called Lake City, Florida, where he met a woman who took care of him, and let him live with her and her children.  And, I guess that was his second growing up, so he grew up--he lived there until he was in late teens, and somehow he found his way to Birmingham, Alabama where he met my mother [Mary Emma Watson].
Speaker 1: So he was about nineteen or so when he...?
Speaker 2: He was about nineteen or twenty.
Story_ID: 30659
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, is there a story about how he [father: John Henry Hall, Sr.] and your mother [Mary Emma Watson] met?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't have any idea about how they met.  They never talked about it, but they did meet in Birmingham [Alabama], and it was during the Depression [1930s], and my father was the only--my mother had two sisters, right, also had families, and my father was the only male that had a job, so he supported the family, he supported all the families while he had his job.  So, he became kind of like the patriarch of all of the families.  I mean, it's a maze, M-A-Z-E, a maze of people interactions.
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you, who was your father working for then, or was he still doing a number of, a variety of jobs?
Speaker 2: Okay, I can tell you that.  So, actually when he met my mother--you were talking about when he met my mother-- when he met my mother, she was pregnant, so he married her.  So, my oldest sister was my half sister, and she was named Valencia.  And she looked more Spanish than she did white or African-American, and I have no idea who her father was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father at the time worked for, he worked for the meatpacking plant in Birmingham, and it was his job to slaughter cattle and he talked to me a lot about that, how he really hated to do that.  You know, it was something he didn't want to do, and he felt that he--it was just horrible to him, but he was the only income that three families had, so he had to do it everyday.  And he did that for awhile, and he supported everybody, you know, bought all the groceries and did everything that he needed to do.  And he became interested in the labor union, and so he began to work with the union to organize the plant.  And by-- Now my sister, my older sister Valencia was actually sixteen years older than I am, so they were married for sixteen years before they had me.
Speaker 1: No other children in the middle?
Speaker 2: No other children in the middle.  My father actually thought thinks he had some type of medical condition.  And then one day he could have children, and then he had me, and the rest of my brothers and sisters came immediately after.  But they were trying to have children.  In fact, it was so long before they had me, that my mother's sister named one of her sons after my father, because he thought he would never have someone named after him.  But he started working for the meatpacking union and he became a representative for the union and they actually took him on as a representative, and he left the plant and went to work for the union as an international representative for the meatpackers association.  And, I was born in Birmingham, we lived in Birmingham, I was born in Birmingham, and we ended up in Atlanta [Georgia] shortly after I was born because the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigations] came to my father's home and told him that somebody had put a contract out on him because of his association with the union, and they advised that he move to another city, so we moved to Atlanta, and that's how I ended up in Atlanta.
Story_ID: 30660
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.  Now there are a lot of stories in this.  The first of which is an obvious one, I guess.  This is a mixed marriage in Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How does that work?
Speaker 2: You know, it's interesting.  I didn't know my mother was white until I was fifty years old, and it was interesting because I knew that she looked different than everybody else (laughter) but you know, you're all living together and you think--I mean, it's the context is decisive.  You know, like just because she was around black people and because we were her children and she was married to my father, everybody considered that she was black.
Speaker 1: You know, there are black people that we well know in the community that look like white people and if it wasn't for the fact that we knew who they were, we wouldn't know.
Speaker 2: Right.  Now my wife is deceased, but my wife was English, and the first time that I took her to meet my mother, when we left, she said, "John, I thought you said your mother was black."  I said, "She is."  She said, "Your mother is not black, your mother is not black."  The funny part about it is, my wife had spent two days in the tanning salon so she wanted to get dark tan, and when she got there she was the darkest thing in the house.  And later on, my mother pulled me to the side and she said, "I thought you said your wife was white."  (laughter).  I said, "She is."  She said, "That woman is not white, she's darker than we are." (laughter).  But it was--and then when she was going--my mother was very, very ill, and my wife and I would go see her, and we'd take Di, our friend from  England, my wife's best friend.  And we'd get there, and the doctors would all talk to them, because they thought that she was their mother and not my mother.  I was like--but by that time I knew that she was not black.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did she, when did she ever say--so I guess she never mentioned it growing up?
Speaker 2: She never talked about it. The only thing she talked about was the names that people called her, which were all derogatory names.
Speaker 1: What were they, like Dago or...?
Speaker 2: Like Dago and Wap.  And I didn't know what they meant, because you know, I was black and they never called me anything like that.  And she'd say, they call you names and stuff like that, but it didn't mean anything to me.
Speaker 1: Did she ever mention the fact that they were from Italy?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't until her sister died, who was Aunt Thelma, that Aunt Catherine, her other sister, started telling us this story about their history and where they came from and who they were.  And I was like somewhat suspicious, but then when I looked up their genealogy, their names were not English names when they were young, they were Italian names.
Speaker 1: So that's interesting.  It was never raised in the household at all?
Speaker 2: It was never talked about.
Speaker 1: Now were her sisters married to African-American men as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's probably why it was never an issue.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did they have anyone in the family that went on to become a white person?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Everybody pretty much resided in the black community?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Even her [Hall's mother: Mary Emma Watson] father [Acy Watson]?
Speaker 2: I don't know about her father, probably so.  I would think so.  Because you know at that time in the South, there were kind of like two races, white and non-white.  So, if you were Italian, you had dark skin, which Aunt Thelma was brown skinned, but Aunt Catherine and my mother were white.  You know, they would lump you together as the non-whites.
Speaker 1: This is interesting, too, because I heard once on public radio, a woman from Sicily [Italy] called, and they were discussing race, and she said that it wasn't that long ago that Sicilians were not really considered white people, in Chicago [Illinois].  She remembered this during a time in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s] when there was some question as to whether they were really white.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, you know, being dark, they certainly were not from northern Italy (laughter), because there were too many dark brothers and sisters.  Now, her oldest brother was definitely African-American, but we think that his father was not Acy, it was someone else because the other children were definitely not African-American.
Story_ID: 30661
Speaker 1: Okay, that's an interesting family story.  Now do you have an earliest childhood memory, earliest?
Speaker 2: Well, the earliest childhood memory I have is the memory of going to school.  I didn't like going to school very much.  We actually lived on Fair Street, which runs right out here, and I went to school, a private school, Rush Memorial Baptist Church private school.  And I just didn't like going to school.  I remember sitting out on the wall thinking about I'd rather be doing something else.  In fact, I used to run away from--I used to run home from school, I'd run away from school almost everyday and go home, but that's the earliest.  And I remember my mother [Mary Emma Watson] driving us to school in this 1952 Plymouth, or 1950 Plymouth that looked like a tank.  It was very hot on the inside, and she would take us to school in that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, I have memory earlier than that.  Before school we were living on Fair Street, about half a mile east of here, with a woman named Mrs. Harper.  And I remember being in the house, and I remember that my father [John Henry Hall, Sr.]  went to work everyday and I didn't know what he did.
Story_ID: 30662
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was your father [John Henry Hall, Sr.] still working for the meatpacking, in the meatpacking industry?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he became, he retired...
Speaker 1: Oh, with the union.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he retired from the union, and actually he was the first person inducted into the Georgia Labor Union Hall of Fame, and he kind of revolutionized what it was to go on strike.  What he would do, he would take the union dues and he would use them to pay people's rent, electricity bill, and to buy groceries, so people would stay on strike literally forever, because they could get their necessities taken care of.  So, when my nephew, which is my oldest sister's son, went to Colgate University [Hamilton, New York] and they started studying American history, one day they had a class about my father, and he was just freaked out (laughter) because he had no idea what my father had done.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, okay.  Alright, was there any cross hatching or cross association with the civil rights movement in the labor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.  There was a lot of that because, you know, the people that worked in the plants were both white and black, so there was a lot of the civil rights movement being involved in supporting my father and supporting both the blacks and the whites in the plants to get better wages and to get vacation, and all the things now that people kind of take for granted.  And my father would come home and talk about how these people were worked literally thirty days out of thirty days and have very little time off, make maybe the equivalent now of like fifty bucks [$50] a month, and that all people basically wanted was to just have the necessities of life taken care of, and that's why he did what he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm going to pause here for a second.
Story_ID: 30663
Speaker 1: Can you describe--you grew up basically in Atlanta [Georgia].  How old were you when you came to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: I was less than a year old.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, what part of town did you all live in?
Speaker 2: We first lived in this part of town, right around the college, and then we moved to Northwest Atlanta, which is only about five miles west of here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were most of your childhood days spent here, around Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Well, many of my childhood days were actually spent in Birmingham, Alabama.  We went to Birmingham for every holiday and all and every summer, every summer holiday, Christmas holiday, Easter, Thanksgiving, because basically our family was there.  And the only reason my father [John Henry Hall, Sr.] and mother [Mary Emma Watson] were here was because they had to be here and they couldn't be there, so we went back continuously.
Speaker 1: Were there any evidence of a contract being out on your father?  Did he tell you any stories about anybody trying to hurt him?
Speaker 2: Well, he didn't--not about that one.  There was another situation where he was actually attacked, but he was being guarded by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigations].  I was actually in college then, when he was attacked by a guy who was--just physically attacked, but those were the only two cases that I know about.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Well, when you--so, it's just your sister, who's sixteen years older than you, and you?
Speaker 2: No, I have another sister [Bobbie Rashad], who is two years younger than me, and I have a brother [Sam Hall] that's three years younger than me, and another brother [Larry Hall] that's five years younger than I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you came it started a trend.
Speaker 2: I started a whole other family (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you grew up with other brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: As the oldest of...
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's it.  And my oldest sister, her daughter, oldest daughter, is actually my age, so I grew up with--so they grew up with me--they're my nieces and nephews but they grew up with me like peers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, can you name your brothers and sisters, starting with the oldest.  I guess there would be--Valencia is the oldest right?
Speaker 2: Valencia is the oldest, yes.
Speaker 1: And then here comes you, sixteen years later.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sixteen years later.
Speaker 1: Are there any behind you?
Speaker 2: Then Bobbie, B-O-B-B-I-E, Bobbie is my sister.  Then Sam, named after Sam Hall, his name is actually Samuel Hall, is my brother and Larry Hall is my youngest brother.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, your father must have--Sam Hall meant a lot to him, apparently.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it did, yeah.
Story_ID: 30664
Speaker 1: Okay. So, when you think about your parents' talents, their looks, their dispositions, their habits, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Uh, I think that in terms of my philosophy of life, I take after my father [John Henry Hall Sr.].  And I think in terms of a lot of habits I have, I take after my mother [Mary Emma Watson], because I love to cook, particularly Italian food (laughter) or Spanish food, like paella is my favorite dish.  And my mother was really good with numbers, calculating, and she did a lot of reading, and I do that, and in terms of my view of a family and what it should be, I take after my father, I'm sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Growing up?  Oh, baseball.  My father loved baseball, he took us to baseball games all the time, even when Atlanta [Georgia] didn't have a team, we would go down and see the Atlanta Crackers play.
Speaker 1: (laughter) And that's really a team, too, isn't it?
Speaker 2: The Atlanta Crackers?
Speaker 1: Was that one of the Negro League teams?
Speaker 2: Well, they had the Atlanta Crackers, the Atlanta White Crackers, and the Atlanta Black Crackers.  So, I never saw the Atlanta Black Crackers, I think they disbanded before I was old enough to go to the games.  We used to go see the Atlanta Crackers play, and I think they were the farm teams from the St. Louis Cardinals, and so I got to see the St. Louis Cardinals come and play in Atlanta, and people like Ken Boyer and all the old guys.  I saw the right-fielder who was so famous.
Speaker 1: Kurt Flood?
Speaker 2: No, this was before that, this was Ted Williams.  I saw Ted Williams play and a lot of people--I saw Kurt Flood a lot--I saw Willie Mays play, Peewee Reese play, because my older sister Valencia moved to New York.  So whenever we went to New York, we'd go to see the Dodgers who were then the Brooklyn Dodgers, and then we'd also see the New York Giants play.  So, I actually saw the Brooklyn Dodgers play in Brooklyn, and the Giants play in the Giants Stadium before they moved to California.  So, baseball--and my mother cooked a lot.  There were a lot of smells of cooking around, and living in Georgia at that time, there were a lot of fresh meals around spring time and in autumn.  I think that's probably why autumn is my favorite time of the year.  And we traveled a lot, because my father traveled a lot with his job.  I didn't think much about it, but you know, we traveled to Colorado, to New York.  We would travel a lot of the times.  My father flew on planes, which was kind of unique back then, in the early '50s [1950s], that people would go on plane rides, so we grew up traveling.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is unique, especially--well, a lot of people, you know, flew places...
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But not in the black community, anyway.  I didn't know anybody really who flew when I was growing up.  I can't think of anyone.
Speaker 2: So, it's interesting.  My whole attitude when I was growing up is that there was no more for me to do, just to go flying somewhere, to drive somewhere, to go to Colorado and spend some time there and to go to Florida and spend time there, and fish.  And, you know, we dealt with a lot of things that black people had to deal with in traveling back then, because you had to time your stops so that you could go to a place where you could actually use the bathroom, or you had to time your stops where you could go somewhere where maybe it was a little bit safer than somewhere else.  But I mean, that never stopped us, and we never thought about it very much, we just did that.
Speaker 1: Do you remember a document called the, I mean a pamphlet called the Green Book?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just saw it at the museum over here.  They actually made a book, it was a guide to black families as to where they could stop in different states.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: It was made during the late '40s [1940s] or early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: It would have been nice to have that book (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, okay.  So, now, was church a part of growing up at all?
Speaker 2: No, it actually wasn't.  My father was a member of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s church, and he went sometimes, but I don't ever remember my mother ever going to church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to church quite a bit when I was young before the age of fifteen sixteen, because most of my friends did, and that was a way to socialize.  I went to church, and then one day I just decided I didn't want to go anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, your family's moral code came from basically doing what's considered to be right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Not necessarily from religion?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Story_ID: 30665
Speaker 1: Now was popular culture a big part of growing up?  I mean, did you--radio, television, magazines or anything?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  My father [John Henry Hall, Sr.] liked to sing, and my brother and I were musicians.  My brother is still a musician.  And so, we would play music around Atlanta [Georgia]. I was playing in places like the Elk's Lodge and some nightclubs and stuff when I was twelve.
Speaker 1: Now what did you play?
Speaker 2: I played guitar.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were good enough at age twelve to play at the Elk's Lodge?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I didn't think anything of it.  And my brother was playing, too.  He was a little bit younger than I was, but we didn't think anything of it--we just-- that was a way to make money and they wanted us to play.  We had a little group, and so we would play. I had to go down to the police department and get finger printed and all of that and join the union and make it legitimate, and there were only certain places I could be when I was in there.  I couldn't be around alcohol and stuff like that, but yeah.  I had to have a chaperone there with me to make sure that I was okay, so an adult had to accompany me to the lodge and to the nightclub.
Speaker 1: Okay, how did you get started with the guitar?
Speaker 2: My brother Larry who is five years younger than me, when he was five years old, he got a guitar for Christmas and he loved playing the guitar.  And from that moment on, he's been a musician, he's been a guitar player.  And I wanted a saxophone, and my father [John Henry Hall, Sr.] came home with another guitar, and I never figured out, I kind of made up that maybe he didn't have the money to buy a saxophone so he bought a guitar.  And, so, okay, so I played the guitar.  My brother had been going to music lessons for about a year.  At this time he was about seven, no, six.  He was six, and he had been going for a year, and he would come home and teach me everything that they taught him that day.  So then I went to music lessons with him, and the music teacher was like, "My God, you know everything that he knows, and you don't have to start all over."  He thought he was going to have to start all over again, so we started playing for him.  His name was Wesley Jackson, the famous guitar player in Atlanta [Georgia] at the time, and so he taught us music like for the next ten or twelve years.
Speaker 1: Um, that's something.  What was your specialty?  Now those are the early days of rock and roll, I mean...
Speaker 2: There was Elvis Presley, rock and roll, rhythm and blues.
Speaker 1: When you say rock and roll in the '50s [1950s], the image that comes to mind is mostly black people, to me, playing, but then you got Elvis, too...
Speaker 2: Elvis Presley, Bill Haley and the Comets, and you got Fats Domino, and...
Speaker 1: Chuck Berry.
Speaker 2: Chuck Berry was a big one.  And the thing about music though is, we played everybody.  You know, it was like we'd be playing at a home and some area of Atlanta would be predominantly white, and we'd be playing Dixie (laughter).  I mean, look, you had to learn Dixie, okay, no matter how old you were.  If you didn't play Dixie, then you'd just, you know, just couldn't be like, diverse in your clientele, in the people that you served.  So, it was a must.
Speaker 1: You know the song was written by black people, did you know that?
Speaker 2: I didn't know that (laughter).
Speaker 1: A black family, the Snowden family, in Ohio.  They were from Dixie, but they were--there's a book about it, there's actually a book about it, published in '91 [1991], I think.
Speaker 2: So we played everything.  We played classical music, we played jazz, we played rock, we played all of it.
Speaker 1: So, you really had some good gigs.  You played for the mayor, so that's...
Speaker 2: We played for a bunch of people (laughter), so it was nice.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your group?
Speaker 2: We had one group in high school we had, we called it the Hitchhikers.  But we had a lot of different groups.  You know how musicians do, at least at that time, when there was a job to be done, we'd all get together and then just go do that job.
Speaker 1: So, what pieces were included in the group?  You had two guitars, right?
Speaker 2: Two guitars and sometimes I'd play bass, and my brother [Larry Hall] would play guitar, lead guitar.  We had drums, we had saxophones, one or two saxophones.  That was kind of like the decor.  Sometimes we would have a piano player or an organ player, and sometimes we'd have a trumpet player, but fundamentally who we evolved into was more like a rhythm and blues type band.  So, you had a drum, guitar, a saxophone and maybe a piano.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, performing under various names, and lots of different jobs and you all were in a union, the musicians' union.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in the union.  I'm sure my brother was too, you know.  Of course, my father would make it so that we had to do that.
Speaker 1: Now that's interesting, because I've interviewed like three or four scientists this week who played music--church--Luther Williams, the piano player.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of people, it's interesting.
Speaker 2: I think-- A lot of scientists I know play music, too, quite a few.
Story_ID: 30666
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: Grade school, elementary school, I went to Anderson Park, Anderson Park Elementary School.
Speaker 1: And you said you didn't like school very much when you started out?
Speaker 2: I did not like school.  I never got over that, either until I went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I did not like school, and I wasn't a very good student.
Speaker 1: I hardly ever hear that with people we interview.  Most of them are achievers, and hardly anyone says they didn't like school.
Speaker 2: I didn't like school.  I wasn't, I mean, like my mother [Mary Emma Watson] was always at the school talking to the teachers, trying to improve my performance, and I thought I was trying as hard as I could.  I was probably trying as hard as I wanted to.  And I would run away from school everyday almost.  I just didn't like it.
Speaker 1: So what was it about it that you didn't like?  Was it just the confinement of it, or what?
Speaker 2: You know, I didn't--I was nervous in school for some reason.  I didn't--all of a sudden I was around all these people, and I just didn't like being around all those people and, you know, they would--I don't remember much about the work except I wasn't very successful doing the work.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And that lasted until the second semester of the tenth grade.
Speaker 1: Now did you go to middle school?
Speaker 2: I went to middle school--well, there was no middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you just went right...
Speaker 2: It was Anderson Park Elementary School.
Story_ID: 30667
Speaker 1: Did that go to eighth grade?
Speaker 2: And then you go to eighth grade, which was at Henry [McNeil] Turner High School, which was at the time connected to Anderson Park Elementary School.  So, I didn't even get to change locales.  I do remember that my mother [Mary Emma Watson] tried to get us in a lot of other different schools, but they kept--and we would spend a day there.  They would find out where we lived, and then they would tell us we couldn't come back, and we had to go to the school that was in our neighborhood.  So, eventually we ended up at Anderson Park and then we went on-- and then I went on to Turner High.
Speaker 1: Okay, Henry [McNeil] Turner High School.
Speaker 2: Henry [McNeil] Turner High School.
Speaker 1: You said that something happened in the tenth grade that...
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, I had gone through eighth, ninth and half of the tenth grade.  I had failed algebra a couple times and I just, the only class I seemed to excel in was writing, in English.  And I didn't have any feeling for that, it's just that the teachers kept telling me that I wrote well and that I was a good writer.  But in the second semester of the tenth grade, I was in my biology class and the biology teacher said, "You know, you are a very nice boy, and if you would actually make good grades, then you could have a lot of friends."  And after that, I never made less than an 'A'.  It was like, people didn't know what happened.  I would be in class, and the teacher would say something like, "You'll never bet who made the highest grade on the chemistry exam."  And everybody would be trying to guess, and nobody would guess.  He would say, "Well, John Hall did, and he made a perfect score."  And, I didn't know, it didn't seem like I was trying anymore than I had been in the past, but I just started making these grades, and the only thing I can relate it to, is that when I was younger, I was sick a lot with asthma and I was never in school for the entire semester, you know, the complete semester.  But I don't know if that was it or not, but I just started making good grades.
Speaker 1: You didn't have to go back and kind of re-study some things that you should have learned before?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  Now this is the interesting thing about it, because even when I was making the bad grades, I would go to the library and I would check out books on electricity and magnetism and astronomy and stuff, and I would read those.  And I read a lot of comic books, particularly the comic books that had to do with science fiction.  And then I would read the parts in the comic books that had to do with the international geophysical year, and you know, I could tell you, like radiation emitted alpha beta and gamma rays and alpha rays were positive and gamma--you know, like that.  And, you know, 'cause I read that stuff, because I was interested in that stuff, and I read a lot of science fiction.  But as far as actually doing work in school, I just didn't do it very much.
Story_ID: 30668
Speaker 1: Did your parents, did your parents, can you credit your parents with exposing you to materials of scientific...?
Speaker 2: No, actually they didn't.  My father [John Henry Hall, Sr.] actually exposed me to the world, like travel and going around.  And my mother [Mary Emma Watson] was pretty good with numbers, but she didn't--she did more playing the numbers than she did in calculus, mathematics, you know (laughter).  But I just don't know how.  I loved comic books and I read a lot of comic books.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite comic book?
Speaker 2: I did.  It was like 'Superman' and 'Batman' and then there were these science fiction comics, I can't remember.  But they would have these things in them about the international geophysical year and about astronomy and about the universe, and I would read that, and that would be the most interesting part.  And then I'd go to the library and I'd check these books out.  I remember that one time I went to the library and I had these books on electricity and magnetism and chemistry and stuff.  I was like eleven years old.  And I went to check them out, and the librarian said, "Can you read these books, are you sure?"  And I said, "I think, yeah, I check them out every week."  And so, that was what I did.
Speaker 1: So, do you think maybe you were bored with curriculum and really wanted something else?
Speaker 2: I was pretty bored with school.  I just wanted to play baseball.  I played baseball a lot, and that's all I really wanted to do.  And then I'd go home and read my books at night because there wasn't a lot, much else to do.  Or, I'd watch TV.  There were a lot of exciting things to watch on TV back then, you know.  The things, it's interesting, the shows I most watched were like the 'Today Show' and I remember looking at that the morning they were talking about the polio vaccine.  They were tracking whether people had contracted polio from taking the vaccine, the map back then, and I remember you know, different things like that.  But it all had to do somehow with some science.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you watch 'Mr. Wizard' with Don Herbert?
Speaker 2: It was okay, I thought it was kind of boring (laughter), but I would watch it, you know.  There was a whole lot of watching TV.
Speaker 1: Did you ever watch, they had the Walt Disney science specials.  They were all on sometimes...
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would do that.  My mother, my parents bought me a chemistry set, and microscope sets and stuff like that.  They bought me a telescope when I was really young, and so they would do things like that, because that's what I wanted.  But you know, I didn't even know that there was a profession called scientist that I could have access to.  You know, I didn't know how these people got to be at the North Pole doing whatever they were doing.
Speaker 1: (unclear) Thomas used to go to those places on television...
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you know any of the doctors or the professors over here at the Atlanta Morehouse [College] complex?
Speaker 2: Not when I was in elementary school.  In high school I knew Samuel Williams, who was a professor of religion.  In fact, his son was my best friend, and I started to spend a lot of time--they lived across the street from the school, and I was spending a lot of my time over here at his house, you know, on the Morehouse campus, but he was mainly the only one that I knew.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in high school, did you become popular after you started making good grades?
Speaker 2: I don't think so (laughter).  I don't know, I think I was most popular for my music.  I think that's what really made me popular.  I don't think the grades did anything (laughter).  People-- Well more people talked to me because they wanted to know if I could help them with stuff, with their mathematics or with their chemistry.
Speaker 1: So your grades went up.  Did they go up high enough for you to be part of the National Honor Society?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I made the National Honor Society.  I was accepted at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I got a scholarship to come to Morehouse.
Story_ID: 30669
Speaker 1: Well, in terms of graduation, what were you seeing as your, did you see yourself primarily as somewhat interested in science when you were in school?  Did you see yourself as some sort of a scientist?
Speaker 2: You know, what I really wanted to do, I really wanted to go to the Air Force Academy [Colorado Springs, Colorado] and fly planes, that's what I wanted to do.  And I didn't think I could get in.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't know back then if a black person could actually get into the Air Force Academy, because you had to get a letter from your Senator, and there was a lot of stuff going on, and I didn't know if that was accessible to me.
Speaker 1: Your Senator's here in Georgia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that was, I think Herman Talmadge was the Senator then in Georgia.  So, I made up that I couldn't get in, and my chemistry teacher at [Henry McNeil] Turner [High School] was a Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] graduate.  He said, "Look, if you're going to Morehouse, I'll get you a scholarship."  I said, "Okay, I'll go to Morehouse", so he got me a scholarship.  So, that's how I got into Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Alright, were you a class officer or any of that sort of thing when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Actually, what was I?  I did, I was in the--I was an officer in the National Honor Society.  I did a lot of things in the English department.  You know, I always liked to do the Shakespearean plays and stuff like that, and recite poetry and stuff like that.  If we had an assembly where we'd have a play like Hamlet, I'd want to play some of the parts in that, and I would do that.  But, I wasn't very active as a class officer, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when graduation came, did you get any special honors or anything?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got a lot of honors.
Story_ID: 30670
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, when you graduated you came on to Morehouse, and...?
Speaker 2: I was a pre-med.
Speaker 1: And had you considered becoming a doctor?  Were you thinking about...?
Speaker 2: I did.  The first class I took at Morehouse was chemistry, from McBay, Henry McBay, at 8:00 [a.m.] in the morning. And after that class--well, actually it was from Joe Patterson.  McBay was the chair.  After that class, I changed my major to chemistry.
Speaker 1: Well what happened?  How did they make chemistry seem exciting?
Speaker 2: You know, it was really, really--well, let me say why I think it was exciting.  They told it from a historical point of view, so there was a story that they were telling that spanned, you know, almost a hundred years.  And every day we went to class, there was something new that I discovered about how things worked in the universe that I didn't know the day before.  But that was exciting to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're going to pause here again.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 30671
Speaker 1: I'd read in the newspaper that John [F.] Kennedy went to Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So I decided I couldn't go to the Air Force Academy [Colorado Springs, Colorado], so I decided I would go to Harvard University.  My deceased wife says, "That was just the craziest thing." (laughter).  She said, "That doesn't make any sense.  You decided you couldn't go to the Air Force Academy, so you would go to Harvard University."  She said, "That doesn't make any sense.  Your chance of getting into the Air Force Academy was hundreds of times greater than going to Harvard."
Speaker 2: Did you know Tyrone Hayes out at UC [University of California] Berkeley?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't, no.
Speaker 2: We interviewed him a couple weeks ago.  He only applied to Harvard when he came out of school.  He was in school in Columbia, South Carolina, the top student in his whole class and stuff...
Speaker 1: This is college?
Speaker 2: Applied to Harvard.  Yeah, you know he was in high school in Columbia and just applied to Harvard, and he was admitted.  That's the only one he applied to.
Speaker 1: (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, there was nothing--I mean, it was just amazing...
Speaker 1: And here I am and said "Well, I don't think I can go to the Air Force Academy, so I'll go to Harvard University."  So when I came to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], I came to Morehouse to go to Harvard University for graduate school.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You already had....
Speaker 1: I always--that's where I was going.
Story_ID: 30672
Speaker 1: Alright, so, okay.  So, here you got in Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Now, tell us about your relationship with Dr. [Henry] McBay.
Speaker 2: I was terrified of Dr. McBay (laughter).  He was, I had such a great deal of respect for him because he was clear.  In that, it was clear that he loved chemistry and it was clear what you had to do in his class to be successful, and if you did that, then you know, he was somebody that you could count on.  And he was a really great guy.  It was really an honor to be his student.  And it wasn't even in retrospect, it was like when I was actually here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think, someone-- I heard around campus today that Mayor Maynard Jackson always said that Dr. McBay was the reason why he (laughter) changed majors.  He got out of chemistry.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: He wanted to be a doctor, and he got out of it because of Dr. McBay.
Speaker 2: It's true because Maynard Jackson told me that, on the steps of the chemistry building one day when I first got out of graduate school and came back.  He, Maynard Jackson, I looked up and he was just walking down the walkway, and he was the Mayor, and he said, "You know I come over here and sit out here sometimes so I can think."  And he told me that story, that he was a-- he was mayor because of Henry McBay.
Speaker 1: (laughter).  Otherwise he'd be a doctor?  (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right (laughter).  So, it was really great.  He was really a great guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But if you weren't, if you didn't show the inclination to follow the program, you were out of here, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it didn't take long for you to get out (laughter).  But I was surprised, you know, everybody said that, all those students said that everybody flunked chemistry the first time around.  So, I was there just to see what I could do, and I figured if science wasn't going to be the profession for me, I needed to find out right away, so I could get in the right profession.  Then we took the first exam and I made a good grade on that, and I couldn't understand why people--you know, because--I just studied the stuff he said, and it worked.
Story_ID: 30673
Speaker 1: Now you said they had a historical approach to the teaching of chemistry.
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.
Speaker 1: What do you mean by that precisely?
Speaker 2: Well, if you look at the developments in chemistry, they follow a historical timeline.  And they would teach it along that timeline, particularly when it got to the area of quantum mechanics, and you know, there was the mystery about some experimental results around, at the beginning of the twentieth century, they would talk about that.  And then they would talk about how, you know like quantum mechanics cleared that up, and then they would go step by step through the years and along the way you would learn about people like [Albert] Einstein, who basically was one of the founders of quantum mechanics, and although people don't say that, he was, with his explanation of the photoelectric effect.  Most people think he got the Nobel Prize for relativity, but it was for the photoelectric effect.  Like, your garage door, and how it works, right? (laughter).  That's the photoelectric effect.  And so, it was exciting to hear about that.
Speaker 1: So, that is the remote control.  Is that what he really got it for?
Speaker 2: Well, it's the photoelectric effect, right?  You know, that's the effect that your garage door uses to actually close or to open up if you stick your hand in there, right?  And people don't know that, people think it was for relativity.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what every person thinks is true.
Speaker 1: E equals M-C squared is...
Speaker 2: He was already at the Nobel Prize when he did that, when he created general relativity, he did.  So, it was exciting.
Speaker 1: To learn the history of what you're doing, that helped give you groundwork in terms of what you were building on.
Speaker 2: But see, you know, I'm not naive enough to think that that would work for everybody.  You know, it doesn't work for everybody.  It worked for me for some reason, I have no idea why.  But I've always been interested in history, so maybe that's why it worked.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he talk about famous black chemists or important black chemists?
Speaker 2: Very few.  [Henry] McBay would never do that, because he said there were no black chemists and there were no white chemists, there were just chemists.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know during that time period, Percy Julian had made a mark in the country and sort of... Did you all know about him in terms of...?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did it, I mean, so, the chemists that you knew about when you were in college were the colleagues of Dr. McBay and other people in the HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] around...
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I knew about people like, well they went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  University of Chicago had a lot to do with the development of nuclear energy and power in this country, and even the development of the nuclear bomb.  So, I knew about people like Oppenheimer and you know, those types of people, and then Heisenberg, so I knew about those people as well as the people who were here.  And there were a lot of African-Americans here who were chemists.  So, I could clearly see that that was a profession that was achievable for me.
Story_ID: 30674
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have time for other campus activities at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I still was a musician, so I played a lot of places around Morehouse and Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and throughout the city, and I played semi-professional baseball. I never played on the baseball team here.  I played shortstop, third base and outfield.
Speaker 1: You didn't play here, but you played...?
Speaker 2: I played for some semi-pro teams in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause my home where I grew up was down the street from a semi-pro baseball stadium where all Negro Leagues played, and I spent every weekend there.  Well, I spent every week there, because they didn't play during the week, so we would play five days a week, and on the weekends we'd watch them play.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you consider--you were playing semi-pro ball.  Did you ever think that you might be good enough to make the pros?
Speaker 2: I thought about it, but you know, I was interested in having a profession that I would, you know, make a stable salary in, and back then, you could actually do better if you went to get a Ph.D. in chemistry (laughter).  What a big mistake.  I could have played two years and made more money than I've made in my whole life now.  But there were some other people.  There was another Morehouse faculty member, Charles Meredith, who went to high school with me.  He was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Don Clendenon became a major league baseball player was actually discovered when they came here to look at Charles Meredith play.  So, there was a lot of baseball going on in Atlanta [Georgia] at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Don Clendenon, he became the MVP of the 1969 [New York] Mets team in the World Series.
Speaker 2: Yeah, played here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 30675
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what about, did you have classes from Roy Hunter, or...?
Speaker 2: I didn't have a class from Roy Hunter, because he was a biology chair.
Speaker 1: What about Mapp?  He's a biology...
Speaker 2: I didn't have a class with Mapp, either.
Speaker 1: Okay, mainly, McBay.  And are there any other figures here that have served as mentors to you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Interestingly enough, Jeannette Hume, my English teacher, had a lot of impact on me.  Not because she really mentored me, but she exposed me to a lot of literature that became like a staple for me throughout my life.  There was someone else.  Well, Sam Williams, who was a professor of religion was also one of my mentors.  And Benjamin Mays was everybody's mentor.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about Dr. Mays that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: You know, there's so many stories.  Every time I heard him speak, there was, something opened up for me in terms of what I was-- what was available for me in terms of achievement in the world.  So, mostly, you know, what I got from him is that you could be anything that you wanted to be.  So, I don't have any stories about him, per se.  Who else?  Joe Patterson was a mentor of mine.  And then in physics, James Mayo, who is a Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] graduate and got his Ph.D. in physics from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], was one of my mentors.  I took a lot of course in physics just because I liked to be in physics with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is--you came here in 1969?
Speaker 2: Right, '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: 1965?
Speaker 2: 1969.
Speaker 1: But you graduated in 1969?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I graduated in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: You came here in '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: '64 [1964], actually.
Story_ID: 30676
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay.  A lot of the civil rights activity around here in Atlanta [Georgia] was already over with, I guess, when you got here?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a lot of activity going on.  See, Charlene Hunter Gault and Hamilton Holmes went to the same high school that I did, [Henry McNeil] Turner High School.  So, they graduated right before I got there.  Almost everybody who graduated in my class went to some institution that had never accepted an African American, or had only accepted one or two African Americans, because that was just the timing.  Actually, my high school is now some type of state monument or something, because there were so many people that went to that high school that made a difference in the civil rights era.
Speaker 1: Just for the record, that's Henry McNeil Turner High School?
Speaker 2: Henry McNeil Turner High School.
Speaker 1: The great A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] bishop, the man that said "God is a black man" from the pulpit.
Speaker 2: (laughter) Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, I had forgotten that.  When you said Henry Turner, you didn't put the 'McNeil' in.
Speaker 2: I didn't put the 'McNeil' in, that's right, that's right (laughter).
Speaker 1: It didn't register, now I know.
Speaker 2: And the principal was Daniel F. Davis, who was a Morehouse graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I guess you then followed, you know, what happened to Charlene Hunter Gault very closely?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: She integrated it in, what year was it when she came through there?
Speaker 2: That must have been '65 [1965], '64 [1964]--'65 [1965], '63 [1963], somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, between '63 [1963] and '65 [1965].  I think it's '63 [1963], I think.
Speaker 2: And see, the Holmes family, Hamilton Holmes' father was a good friend of my father's [John Henry Hall, Sr.], so I actually went to school with Michael Holmes and Herbert Holmes at Turner, and Michael was in my class, in my homeroom class, so I knew him very well.
Speaker 1: These are heroic figures in the history of the Civil Rights Movement of this country, no doubt.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, when you got here at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], were there still like local demonstrations around?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, there were a lot of demonstrations.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  I didn't realize it.
Speaker 2: A lot of local demonstrations.  When I came to Morehouse, there was a service station down the street that you couldn't use the bathroom in, and you know, Muhammad Ali had just started his career and he spoke at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] a couple of times when I was here.  And Stokely Carmichael spoke here, it was a lot going on.
Story_ID: 30677
Speaker 1: Now did you get involved in any of the civil rights activities?
Speaker 2: Um, not like that.  It seemed like it was always a part of my house because of what my father did.  We weren't arrested and we didn't go to jail and we didn't do things like that, but you know, we always were dealing with--you know, my father was always dealing with, how do you make life better for people.
Speaker 1: During those days, I know in '64 [1964], '65 [1965], that's when you were still in high school in '64 [1964] but during those days people were sometimes recruited from the black colleges to go south for the Mississippi Summer Projects [aka Freedom Summer] in '64 [1964].  In 1965, I know they were in Alabama pretty much, and some were still in Mississippi.  Were you ever tempted to participate in those, I guess, missionary type...?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't.  I never thought about that.  Maybe it was because I went to Birmingham [Alabama] every holiday (laughter).  And we had family in southern Georgia, we had a lot of farms around Gibson, Georgia, way across Georgia, I don't think they have those farms there anymore, but, you know, I never thought about that.
Speaker 1: You had Birmingham--Fred Shuttlesworth's activities, and the bombings of the Sixteenth Street Baptist church, and in '63 [1963], students being sprayed with the hoses--all this is in '62 [1962], '63 [1963].  So, were any of your relatives involved in any of that?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [John Henry Hall, Sr.] was involved in some of those activities.  You know, I don't know, I think he kind of sheltered us from some of that because of what had happened to him and what he had had to deal with in his life when he was our age.  But he was very actively involved in that.
Speaker 1: Do you think, I've heard-- We've interviewed other science people, it seems, and I don't know, maybe it's just me, but it seems as though the students who were in the hard sciences were kind of sheltered by the schools in terms of that kind of thing.  They encouraged you to go on and get out of here, and get your degree because you're doing something.  If you're in math and science or heading towards medical school, they want to make sure you get out.
Speaker 2: It could have been.
Speaker 1: Do you think so?
Speaker 2: I don't know, nobody ever said that to me.  I was just so busy trying to get, trying to do my studies and I had this objective to go to Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and I just was working hard and, you know, playing my music and trying to finish college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sure that something like that probably did go on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you pledge a fraternity or anything?
Speaker 2: I did not.  It's funny because I was asked to pledge by two fraternities, which will go unnamed.  I just didn't--because everybody in my band was in a fraternity, and they kept saying, "Well, why don't you join?"  One day they said, "If you just join, we won't do anything, we won't ha--, just join."  And I said, "No, I don't think so."  And I've never been one who actually joined stuff.  The only Greek organization I belong to is Phi Beta Kappa, and I was invited to do that. (laughter).  And [Henry] McBay actually helped, he actually was the one who recommended me for that, because Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] didn't have a chapter when I was here.  After I got my degree from Harvard, he came back and said, "Look, I want you to (unclear)."
Story_ID: 30678
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, okay now, anything significant about your stay before I graduate you and we move on to...?
Speaker 2: About my stay where?
Speaker 1: Here at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] as an undergraduate, before we move on to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  You must have been an excellent student, I take it, if you were admitted to Harvard graduate school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked very hard, and how I actually got there, I only applied to Harvard and [University of California] Berkeley for graduate school.  And how I got there was a Harvard professor came down to give a seminar at Clarke College [Atlanta, Georgia], and I had applied so he wanted to meet me.  And he came by and he talked to me and then he asked me a question, a chemistry question.  He asked me to prove the variational theorem of quantum mechanics.  And so, I did (laughter).  And he said, "Okay."  And he went back and said, "You got to admit this person, because I asked him to prove the variational theorem of quantum mechanics, and he did."  Most graduate students couldn't do that, but you know, I had gone to Morehouse with [Henry] McBay, so I knew how to do that (laughter).  So, out of all of the work that I did, which I had to do in order to be eligible, I think that definitely made the difference.
Speaker 1: So, do you think when you look back at it, and as I'm looking at this now as somebody from way outside of it because I wasn't around here, and I'm not a chemist--but it seems to me that Dr. McBay had something special going on here?
Speaker 2: He did, he did, very special.  There were a lot of us who went on, over fifty of us who went on to get Ph.D.s under him.
Speaker 1: You know, that is special.  So, you applied to Harvard in 1969.   After graduation you go on to Harvard University.  It says here on our note that your research advisor there was William N. Lipscomb.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 30679
Speaker 1: Now, tell us a little bit about your relationship with William Lipscomb.  Who was he, and how did he help you?
Speaker 2: Oh, he's, first of all, he's from Kentucky, and he's an official Kentucky colonel, the first one I ever knew in my life, so we all called him the Colonel.  And I was trying to figure out who I was going to work for at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] as a graduate student, and I was interviewing these faculty members, and I don't remember talking to anybody but him.  And when I sat down to talk to him, I said, "You know, I'd like to work for you."  And he said, "Well, what do you want to do?"  He said, "I do everything, I'm a chemist."  He says, "I'm not a physical chemist, I'm not a biochemist, I'm not an organist chemist, I'm a chemist, so I do everything, so whatever you want to do, you can do it with me."  And, I said "Okay."  And, he was really great, he was a great mentor and I really liked working for him.  I liked the people in our group, and you know, it was very different from me going to Harvard because there was no other African-Americans in the department, student or faculty member.  And it was Boston [Massachusetts] and not Atlanta [Georgia].  It was a very different culture, and I didn't talk a lot and make friends very easily, so it was kind of difficult for me to make friends.  But working for him, I did get to meet a lot of people, and make a lot of friends.  And he had a very diverse group of people working for him at that time, and I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: A diverse group, now these would be like other nationalities?
Speaker 2: It would be people from other countries.  There was one African-American post doc who came on to work for him, too.  And people from the Philippines and from all over worked for him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we were the theoretical group.  He did do everything.  He did protein chemistry, he did organic chemistry, he did inorganic chemistry, and I was part of the theoretical group.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, he had been mentored at Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California] by Linus Pauling?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he worked for Linus Pauling, yes.
Speaker 1: Linus Pauling is a Nobel Prize Winner who...
Speaker 2: Right.  And so is Lipscomb.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Lipscomb, had he received his Nobel Prize by the time you...?
Speaker 2: Well, he received his Nobel Prize two years after I left, for the work he did on boron hydride structure of chemical bonding, the theoretical and experimental work.  So, in his paper to, in acknowledgement of the Nobel Prize--we all got acknowledged, because it fundamentally was a culmination of the work that a lot of us did in the theoretical group over the years and the experimental group over the years, which was great.
Speaker 1: So, would you describe chemistry in some ways as a group activity?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's definitely a group activity, because it's kind of like the historical thing again, right?  I mean, this work took place over thirty years, and it went--and each new graduate student that came in contributed something new and built on top of what other people had actually done.  And, you know, when you put all that together, he did a lot for clarifying the role of chemical bonding, the role of structure and function and enzymes, and... It was really exciting to go to work, too, because every day you would go there and you would work on something.  You would do something that people hadn't done before, like it hadn't been done the day before, like, this is a new way to look at molecular, at chemical bonding--nobody's looked at it like that before.
Speaker 1: So you all were on the cutting edge of chemistry?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how did it feel being on the cut-- Well, I guess you said it was exciting because you knew you were on the edge of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, it was like you weren't there to reproduce something that somebody had done.  It was like this had never been done before.  This is the first time that this has ever been done.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to pause here again.
Story_ID: 30680
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about some of the other African-American personalities on the campus because some of the people we've interviewed have been Archie Epps, who was admissions director for many years.  I guess before you got there, he brought Malcolm X to campus and all that sort of thing, a very Harvard man.  Allen Counter, you said you did know.
Speaker 2: I did know Allen, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was a biologist, you said.
Speaker 2: I know he wasn't a chemist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At least not at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], when he was there.
Speaker 1: But you say you were very much involved in the chemistry department?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was.
Speaker 1: And it was real intense work, I take it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I enjoyed it, it was really great work.  I mean, I had a great time.  I was lonely a lot at first, my first year, when I was just taking courses, and I was a long way from home in a new environment with a whole new group of people, and that was a little scary sometimes and that was exciting sometimes.  And there were people in my class, like this one guy in my class, his father was a famous conductor in Europe, and he drove a Rolls Royce with the steering wheel on the right side of the car.  And then another guy, his family had something to do with the founding of a major computer company in the United States (laughter), and there were people from Germany, and so that was exciting to get to know these people, and it was a little scary, too.  And I enjoyed the research that I did at Harvard because as I said, it was like nobody had ever done this.  Everyday we got to go to work and do something that nobody had done, ever.  And that was great.  And [William] Lipscomb was a great mentor about life, not just about chemistry.  And still, I missed Atlanta [Georgia], but it was great.  It was--there weren't very many African-American graduate students at that time.  Well, there could have been, but it didn't seem like it to me, coming from Atlanta (laughter) where, you know, I was in a totally African-American environment and then all of a sudden I was there at Harvard.  It was great.
Speaker 1: I think the president there was Dennis Bock?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any other people at Harvard we need to talk about in terms of being important in your stay there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were a number of people.  There was Roy Gordon, who was a theoretical chemist at Harvard.  Bill Reinhart was the guy that came down and interviewed me, and we're still friends to this day.  I don't see him very often, but he ended up at the University of Washington in Seattle.  So, Roy and Bill Reinhart--let's see who else--Frank Westheimer was also influential, and [Robert] "Bob" Woodward was my advisor when I got to Harvard, a very well-known organist chemist, and they kinda just took care of me.  I remember the first week I was there after we took all of our preliminary examinations, the department met with each one of us individually.  And I remember going into this room, and there was like these twenty people, all men, standing there and sitting there, and four or five of them had Nobel prizes, and I was sitting in this chair looking at all these people and wishing I was back in Atlanta.  And Bob Woodward, who's one of the smartest chemists that ever did anything in chemistry, said "You know, you are the best prepared student we've ever had."  And I was like, I didn't even understand what he said.  I said, "What is he talking about?"  He said, "We've never had a student that was as well prepared as you are with the background and courses that you've taken."  And that didn't mean a lot to me then, you know, all I was concerned about was "Okay am I going to be really able to do this, right?"  But then later on in my life when I thought about it, that was a huge statement for him to make about Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], not about me, but about Morehouse College.
Speaker 1: That is quite a statement.  But, did you find that to be true?  After you got there did you find it true?
Speaker 2: I was very well prepared (laughter).  I was very well prepared.
Speaker 1: Did you think that when you were here at Morehouse that something special was going on?
Speaker 2: I kind of thought it was, because we'd had a lot of students to go on to graduate school.  I spent a summer in Chicago [Illinois] with a couple Morehouse graduates.  I was working at IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] Research Institute, and they were at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  There were Morehouse graduates at [University of California] Berkeley, you know, they were all over the place.  So, you know, I had a sense that there was something special going on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's quite a remarkable statement.  Here's Harvard, this premier institution in the U.S., and they tell you you're most prepared student they've ever had in grad school.
Speaker 2: Yes, and it just didn't really hit me.  Later on, you know, in my life when I thought about it, it was like I was there with people from Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California], you know, Max Planck Institute, all over the world, and that's what they said about Morehouse , you know(laughter).
Story_ID: 30681
Speaker 1: That is something.  So, was there any phase of your studies that gave you difficulty, basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a lot of difficulty with organic chemistry (laughter).  And the thing about it is that Bob Woodward was an organic chemist.  So, he told me, he said "Look, you're never going to pass organic chemistry."  He said, "I want you to take another course instead."  I said, "What?"  He said, "I want you to take this course in biochemistry."  So, I go and take this course.  It was in enzymology, from Frank Westheimer.  And I go and take this course in enzymology, a graduate course, and I am lousy in organic chemistry, and I'm in this course and I couldn't understand anything that they were saying for a whole semester except enzymology is about the kinetics of chemical reactions, enzyme reactions.  And I could do all the math, you know, I could do all the math.  I could write all the right equations, I could do all the matrix inversions of stuff like that.  And that's how I got out,  because everybody else in there was a biochemist.  There were only about six students in the class, and they'd all been admitted into the department as biochemists, and they knew the biochemistry, but I knew the math, and that's how I got out.
Story_ID: 30682
Speaker 1: That's interesting, okay.  So, what was your primary focus at Harvard?  Did you focus on one aspect of chemistry?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  Theoretical chemistry of boron hydrides.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay.  Now what is that, for those of us who don't know, which is most of us who are going to be watching this?
Speaker 2: Well, a boron hydride is a compound that contains boron and hydrogen.  We also did carboranes, are compounds that contain carbon, boron and hydrogen.  And the initial interest in these molecules was that they could be used maybe for rocket fuels or explosives.  They were very volatile molecules.  And we did the quantum mechanics of those molecules, so we used high speed computers.  Now they were high speed back then, they were probably about a hundred times or two hundred times slower than your laptop that you have at home now.  We used these computers to calculate the molecular properties of these molecules.
Speaker 1: Now, these are the big main frame computers with the punch cards?
Speaker 2: Yeah, these computers with punch cards, they took up a whole auditorium of space, and we'd get to do one calculation a day and we'd walk over to the computer center with this box of punch cards and put them on a table.  Then we would go back to the office and we'd come back the next day to find out that we had punched a '2' on a card rather than a '3' and we had to do it all over again (laughter), because the calculations took all night to do.  And you could do them now on a laptop in like three or four micro seconds, but back then that's what it took to do the huge computers.  But, everything that we did was something that nobody had ever calculated before.  Every property that we calculated, it was something that hadn't been calculated before.
Speaker 1: Now when we think of a chemist, most of us think of someone with test tubes in the laboratory.  Now, how much of your activity is...?
Speaker 2: Zero. (laughter).  I had zero experience in the laboratory, and no matter how much I asked--I begged [William] Lipscomb to put me in the laboratory and he never would. I think he knew what was best for me.
Speaker 1: So, as a theoretical chemist, you deal mostly with calculations and...?
Speaker 2: All we did was program computers, you know, like, that's all we did.  We wrote computer programs everyday, and did calculations.
Speaker 1: So you were writing like Fortran, or...?
Speaker 2: We wrote Fortran programs, all our programs were in Fortran.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  I never think of a chemist as doing that, but you know, 'cause I'm so far removed from it.
Speaker 2: Huge programs, hundreds of thousands of statements long.
Story_ID: 30683
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you go straight through to the Ph.D. program?
Speaker 2: I did, yes.
Speaker 1: Now I was told earlier in the week that there were a lot of places where if a scientist comes in, if he gets a master's, that means he probably couldn't make the Ph.D.  So, they give him a master's to get him out of there.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But, the idea is that if you go, you're going all the way.
Speaker 2: Well, Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] wasn't like that.  They told me immediately when I got there that they didn't admit people that couldn't make it.
Speaker 1: So, they wouldn't even...
Speaker 2: They said everybody doesn't get a degree, but it's not because we kick them out.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting (laughter).
Speaker 2: I said, "Boy, that's pressure."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it says here in 1972 you published your first paper and I'll let you give us the title of it.  Do you remember it?
Speaker 2: Was it 1972?  The first paper I published was an "Ab initio self consistent field study of B2H7 minus," I believe.
Speaker 1: Was that it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you always remember your first one (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well that's calculations of the energy formation of B2H2 [sic, B2H7].
Speaker 2: Okay, right.
Speaker 1: And it appeared in 'Inorganic Chemistry?'
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did publish it in 'Inorganic Chemistry.'
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the other authors on the paper were D.S. Merenick, and William Lipscomb?
Speaker 2: Right.  Dennis Merenick was my best friend in graduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was the--can you give us like the gist of that?
Speaker 2: Uh, the gist of that well, that molecule is the only molecule that has two fragments, like a BH3 and a BH3 connected by central three-center bridge hydrogen bond.  So, there was some doubt as to whether the molecule could exist.  So, what we actually did was calculate the energy of formation to show that at least theoretically, the theoretical approximation, that molecule was more stable than two BH molecules and a hydrogen atom.  So, we predicted that that molecule is stable, and could be isolated.
Speaker 1: Okay, could it actually...?
Speaker 2: I don't know if anybody ever did or not (laughter).  I don't think so.  But you know, it could exist in the gas phase of the trans intermediate that's what we said.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what does--is there a practical application of that, or has there been any practical application for this research as of today?
Speaker 2: Well, the boron hydrides did not fare well as rocket fuels because they were too explosive, so nobody would want to sit on a rocket with boron-hydrides in it.  I think that the biggest contribution that boron-hydrides made was to the study of chemical bonding, because of the unique bonds.   Also, because of the fact that they are electron deficient, they have more atomic orbitals available for bonding than they do electrons, that they offer a unique picture of chemical bonding and for the most part, the properties that we calculate at work are much more accurate in comparison to some other systems that didn't have this favorable ratio.  But mostly they contributed a lot to what we know about chemical bonding.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, now in '72 [1972]....
Speaker 2: Now, one other thing about that.  The boron-hydrides, particularly the very symmetrical high symmetry boron hydrides of carboranes now, are now compounds that people are looking at for a new nanotechnology applications.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What I understand about nanotechnology is that it's about making things smaller?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What are they thinking about, how do they fit into that?
Speaker 2: Well, they're looking at, you know, how these molecules can be used to make nano materials, or even in nano engineering.
Story_ID: 30684
Speaker 1: Okay.  1972, you're about twenty-five years old, the National Organization for Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers is founded.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you a part of that formation?
Speaker 2: I wasn't part of the group that founded it. I just happened to be around with a lot of my friends who--people who were my teachers, like Charles Meredith, William Jackson, Thomas Cole, who was also president of Clarke Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia], Bill William Guillory, an African-American, who was at that time the chair of chemistry at the University of Utah [Salt Lake City, Utah], and those were the people that really--but I was kind of like always around the fringes, watching what they were doing, but I didn't have anything really to do with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  McBay and Meredith were from Atlanta, you know.  Well, McBay was from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Meredith was from Atlanta University?
Speaker 2: Meredith graduated from Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Meredith also graduated from [Henry McNeil] Turner High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It says, well, was he at Atlanta University then teaching?
Speaker 2: He taught class--well, at that time Atlanta University's chemistry department was on the third floor of the now Morehouse College chemistry department.  So, Morehouse occupied the first two floors and Atlanta University occupied the third floor.  And, so people taught things, taught courses, back and forth.  Tom Cole, who was an Atlanta University faculty member, taught the organic chemistry course at Morehouse College.  And Charles Meredith, who was a Morehouse College faculty member taught like advanced inorganic chemistry at Atlanta University.  So, it was like this complete faculty exchange.
Story_ID: 30685
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you had said before that you worked on the project for which Lipscomb won the Nobel Prize?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked in chemical bonding.  He basically got it for his contributions to chemical bonding that spanned a number of years and a number of people.
Speaker 1: Okay. But at that present time you were on that...?
Speaker 2: I'd like to think that we pushed him over the top, you know (laughter). (unclear)
Speaker 1: Alright.  There's a paper that he cited here on the outline called, a '74 [1974] paper by Hall and Lipscomb entitled 'Localized Orbitals of Boron Compounds. I. A. Comparison of the Edmistron-
Speaker 2: Edmistron-Ruedenberg and Boys Localization Procedures (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What's the significance of that?
Speaker 1: Well, we were looking at how electrons are distributed in a chemical bond.  See, it takes two electrons to make a chemical bond normally, right.  And I think that the view that we were able to promote was that sometimes chemical bonds are formed by fewer than two electrons, 'cause an electron in quantum mechanics is a smeared out piece of electronic density.  So, sometimes it might take a fractional part of an electron to make a bond.  So, we kind of transform generalized people's views of chemical bonding.  And no longer was there only this two electron bond, or as [William] Lipscomb may have pointed out, the three center two electron bond.  See, first they say "Well, I got two atoms and two electrons to keep those two atoms together, right?"  And then Lipscomb came along and said "Well, you can have three atoms, and two electrons keep those three atoms together."  And then with the localization methods that we use, we were able to see that you could have three or four atoms connected by sharing electrons.  So, it generalized our view of chemical bonding.
Story_ID: 30686
Speaker 1: Alright, in 1974, you received a Ph.D. in theoretical computational chemistry from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: It was actually physical chemistry.  They don't really have a theoretical computational chemistry, it was actually in physical chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, I'll make a note here.  The actual title was physical chemistry, but what you actually did was theoretical computational chemistry.
Speaker 2: That's what I did, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Well, tell us about what your dissertation was about.
Speaker 2: Oh, well.  Well, two of the papers that you just cited, 'B2H7 Minus' and the Edmistron-Ruedenberg and Boys Localization and Method Comparison were in my thesis. So, my thesis was basically about the calculation of one electron properties of atoms, I'm sorry, of one electron properties of molecules.
Speaker 1: One electron molecules now what is that?  That's something like the dipole moment of a molecule or the magnetic susceptibility of a molecule and studying the chemical bonding of molecules using those localization methods.  So, it was all about really shedding light on the nature of the chemical bond.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was your thesis, I mean, your dissertation published ever?  Was it broken down into an article for a journal?
Speaker 1: Well, the thesis itself is published at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and there are a number of papers that are chapters in the thesis and the thesis itself.  I think there were eleven publications-- eleven or twelve publications that came out of the work that I did on that thesis, scientific publications.
Speaker 2: Alright.  It says here that you delivered a paper at the Second Annual Meeting of NOBCChE. I probably did.  What was that on?
Speaker 1: (laughter) Yeah, it was a report on phosphine.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that was the one electron properties of phosphine, PH3.
Speaker 1: Yeah, PPPH3, right.
Speaker 2: That was from my thesis as well, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, the thing is that, before people could really start to talk about the experimental side of this, you know, we had to show that you could--well, we didn't have to show--what we did was calculate those properties that were related to the experimental properties that people go and measure.  So, these were the first accurate calculations of those experimental properties for phosphine.
Story_ID: 30687
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now '76 [1976], this is when William Lipscomb wins a Nobel Prize in chemistry.  Now, did you all have celebrations around here around that, or...?
Speaker 2: I was down here and he was up there.  I talked to him and I'm sure they had celebrations up there, but we didn't do much around here.  I was the only one down here, so I didn't do much.
Speaker 1: Okay, you all went to Oslo [Norway]?
Speaker 2: (laughter).  No, I didn't go over there.  I should have gone, but I didn't, it would have been nice.  They would have made me pay my own way. (laughter).
Speaker 1: You all didn't get rings or anything? (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, we didn't get rings, you know, we didn't get sweaters, tee shirts neither.
Speaker 1: I think it's been said that Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], the most expensive item he owned, was the watch he won from the Nobel Prize Committee.
Speaker 2: Probably so.
Speaker 1: That's something to say about--a lot of people think of him as, I know the Marxist used to always say he was middle class and he was Bourgeois, but you know, King really didn't own that much.
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.
Speaker 1: Didn't own that much.
Story_ID: 30688
Speaker 1: Now in 1976, you were selected as a Danforth Fellow.  This was like post doc or what?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's kind of like, I don't know, an honor that they bestow upon you and, there was another guy, Joe Gills (ph.) and his wife were also Danforth Fellows and we did some seminars and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: So, it wasn't a post doctorate kind of thing?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't a post doc thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, where did you do your post doctorate studies after you graduated?
Speaker 2: I really didn't do a post doc.  I just came to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and started doing some different research, looking at some of the problems in atmospheric chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you just came right directly to Morehouse, and the Danforth Fellowship was more of a lecturer style...?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was more of like, you know, the Danforth Fellowship was awarded to you and your wife and sometimes we did seminars on different topics, but we didn't do very much with that, my wife and I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, so you co-published a paper with William Guillory.  Now are you back in Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm back in Atlanta, right.
Speaker 1: And you had a, from what I understand here, this is for a contract with NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  Is this true?
Speaker 2: Yes, what did we do?  That was...
Speaker 1: A study of reaction of chlorine atoms and the ozone.
Speaker 2: Right, that was a contract that we had with NASA.  That was a Morehouse graduate, Jim King, was the director of the labs at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory [JPL], and he was interested in what happened--well, this is what--let me back up.  The first original space shuttle was supposed to dump hydrochloric acid in the atmosphere as an exhaust product.  So, the jet propulsion laboratory, some scientists at the jet propulsion laboratory, had determined that chorine would catalytically deplete ozone.  So, they were worried that the space shuttle might wipe out the ozone layer.  And the guy at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who discovered this was named Bill Demore.  And so they asked Charles Meredith and Bill Guillory and myself to do some experiments, some matrix isolation experiments.  Matrix isolation was an experimental technique that was developed by [George] Pimentel at [University of California] Berkeley at the time, and really developed even more by a guy named Adolphus Mulligan who was a Morehouse graduate who worked for Pimentel at Berkeley and who went on to become a very famous scientist at the National Bureau of Standards.  So, we were going to use this matrix isolation to see if we could shed any light on whether the chlorine would actually catalytically deplete the ozone layer, and that's how we got into ozone chemistry and stratospheric chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think we have to pause here again for a notation.
Story_ID: 30689
Speaker 1: This is like a house of cards.  I mean, the ozone, just explain how thin the ozone...
Speaker 2: Well, we brought all the ozone down to about four feet above the ground.  At this temperature and pressure it would envelop the earth in a sphere that would be about one millimeter thick.
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of it.
Speaker 2: There's not a lot, so it's very small.  And so they wanted us to look at that because NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] was concerned, they didn't want it to get out that the space shuttle might catalytically deplete the ozone layer and then people would start to have skin cancer among other things.  It might destroy plants.
Speaker 1: Well, this is the only thing, this is our last (unclear) on this skin cancer, this little thin layer of...
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is what environmentalists are talking about.
Speaker 2: Right, so they didn't use the hydrochloric acid, though, they scrapped that one.
Speaker 1: So, the way this--the hydrochloric acid, one molecule of that takes out how many...?
Speaker 2: Ten thousand ozone molecules.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it's the catalytic chain reaction.  And so we started doing this work and it was interesting because--we didn't think much of it, but it was really great work because we got to, I got a letter one day from Paul Crutzen in Germany, and he was interested in the work that we were doing, and he invited us over.  So, I went over and I met him and we talked about stratospheric chemistry.  And Jim King came to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] to work as the director of the Dolphus Milligan Science Research Institute, and he invited Mario Molina to come here and to work, and actually he worked in my lab for like a summer.  And that summer though, I happened to be at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory [Pasadena, California] working with a guy named Bob Watson, so I didn't meet Mario.  But you know, Mario Molina and Paul Crutzen won the Nobel Prize for their work in stratospheric ozone chemistry.  The one thing that I think we were able to contribute is that we isolated this molecule called the CLO dimer, in an (unclear) matrix and made that molecule a possible intermediate in the reaction of chlorine and ozone, which probably helped people a little bit in looking at the actual depletion mechanism for the ozone hole that we found in the Arctic.  It was good, it was some good work, we got to meet a lot of people, I got to travel and we got to make some contributions to science as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now were you, when you were working on this paper with Dr. [William] Guillory, were you in Atlanta [Georgia] here?
Speaker 2: I was in Atlanta, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, then was he appointed as a...?
Speaker 2: No, he just came out to help.
Speaker 1: Oh, he came out from, was he actually stationed in Utah then?
Speaker 2: He was at the University of Utah [Salt Lake City, Utah] and he just came out here.  I'm sure that Charles Meredith paid him a little consulting fee to come out and help us get the lab set up.  And he taught us basically how to do this type of chemistry.
Story_ID: 30690
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he's [Dr. William Guillory] your link to 1977 when you moved to the University of Utah as a visiting professor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went there as a visiting professor to work in his lab, and we did a paper together, I think it was C2H4.  We just exploded it with a laser and looked at the C2 fragments and got the spectrum of the C2 fragments.  That was pretty hot stuff back then because people were just starting to do stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you all worked fairly well together on these projects?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you're out there for two years, the University of Utah [Salt Lake City, Utah]?
Speaker 2: No, I was only out there for, let's see, I went in 1977, I came back in--I was only there for the summer.  When I came back, that was in '77 [1977] right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: When I came back in '78 [1978], Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] decided that they would start an earth and atmospheric sciences graduate program.  So, they hired a lot of people from Georgia Tech--not from Georgia Tech, from, where is that place?  From NCAR, National Center for Atmospheric Research.  And one of the people they hired was a guy named C.S. Kiang, a Chinese, and he brought a bunch of people to Georgia Tech from all over and he found out that I was here working on this chlorine ozone problem.  He knew Jim King very well, because Jim King actually started the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] program for upper atmospheric chemistry when he was at NASA, so the whole--he started that whole program, you know, giving money to people to do research in that area.  And he asked me if I would come to Georgia Tech and work there in their new school of earth and atmospheric sciences.
Speaker 1: This was in 1978?
Speaker 2: That was in '78 [1978], and I did.
Speaker 1: So, you were like an assistant professor at Georgia Tech?
Speaker 2: I was a senior research scientist, which is a research track, so I didn't have to teach, although I did teach.  And we then went out and we were successful in raising money from the National Science Foundation, from NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], and from a lot of different people to start the graduate earth and atmospheric sciences program at Georgia Tech, which is now the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech.  It's one of the top research-- earth and atmospheric sciences research departments in the country-- in the world, actually, because they've managed to hire some really, really, great people.
Story_ID: 30691
Speaker 1: Okay, now, we have here that in 1979, you actually came over to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] as an associate professor.
Speaker 2: I was part-time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What they did, it was interesting.  Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] paid 99 percent of my salary and Morehouse paid 10 percent, because Georgia Tech wanted to establish some type of real relationship with Morehouse.  So, they said, "Okay, if you pay 10 percent, then we'll.."  Because they felt like money was an incentive, and you can have all the goodwill in the world, but when it came down to, you know, making money and trying to get your research funded, you were going to go with your own institution.  So they did that, and they allowed me to work here.  We built a building called the science research institute and we brought some people over from Georgia Tech to work in the science research institute as well.  And people from the Center and colleges worked there and we primarily did research in information technology, in biochemistry and in atmospheric sciences.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, now did you know Dr. [J.K.] Haynes when you were down...?
Speaker 2: I knew Dr. Haynes, but I didn't know him very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just would see him come through looking in my door every now and then and trying to figure out what was that stuff we had going on (laughter).
Story_ID: 30692
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, so you had a NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Faculty Fellowship?
Speaker 2: At JPL.
Speaker 1: At Jet Propulsion Laboratory [Pasadena, California], okay.  Alright, but you were working here, though, right?
Speaker 2: I was working here.
Speaker 1: And you didn't have to move or anything?
Speaker 2: I went there for a summer
Speaker 1: Okay, Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  And that was at Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is its own site but it's close to Cal Tech and Cal Tech is really responsible for running JPL, Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Speaker 1: There's the famous JPL, Jet Propulsion Laboratory--what's the German scientist, what's his name?  One is Werner Von Braun, or is that the same JPL?
Speaker 2: It probably is, you know.  It's, they do the deep space missions.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is the office, I mean the place where they engage in a race, you know, to put a satellite, or to put a man on the moon or...
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  PBS [Public Broadcasting System] did a big special on JPL and all the scientists involved and associated with it.
Speaker 2: Well, a Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] graduate was the director of the laboratory there for like twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: Really?  Who's that?
Speaker 2: Jim King.
Speaker 1: Jim King, okay.
Speaker 2: That's someone you should talk to, Jim King.
Speaker 1: Is he...?
Speaker 2: He's here in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: If you can talk to anybody, talk to Jim King.  He's the first Morehouse graduate to get a PhD from Cal Tech.
Speaker 1: You say for twenty-five years?
Speaker 2: Well, he spent his entire lifetime working in California in Pasadena at Cal Tech in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and maybe his entire career.  He's retired here in Atlanta, so that's someone you definitely should talk to.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  I'll have to make note of that.
Story_ID: 30693
Speaker 1: Okay, at some point, when did you meet your wife and get married?  Did you meet her before, when you were stationed out in Utah, or...?
Speaker 2: No, I've actually been married three times.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: You have to think of which one.
Speaker 2: That's right.  I met my first wife when I was here at Morehouse [College, Atlanta Georgia] and she was at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  So, we got married, she went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] with me, and we have two children, two sons.  And then I was married again.  It wasn't very long, it was a brief one, it was a couple of years.  And then I married Susan, my last wife.  She's British, she was British, and she died several years ago from cancer.  And we were together for about eighteen years, and we have a, she had a child, a daughter Shanda (ph.), and so I have grandchildren from her.  They lived in Chicago [Illinois].  Her husband is a pilot, and the interesting about her is that she's a descendent of Robert E. Lee (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, she was born in England?
Speaker 2: No, Shanda was born here
Speaker 1: Oh, through her father...
Speaker 2: Her father's an American, and they were already living here when I met Susan in Utah.
Speaker 1: So, when you were, okay--in '79 [1979] you were married to, was it...?
Speaker 2: That was Cynthia, that was my first wife.
Story_ID: 30694
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, in '82 [1982] you were part of the first delegation of black scientists to visit China.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about this.  This is, I know that there were delegations of people in the arts and other delegations prior to '82 [1982], but this was the first delegation of black scientists.  Who organized it?
Speaker 2: Well, it was organized by C.S. Kiang, that's K-I-A-N-G.  C.S. was the person that was the first director of the graduate program in earth and atmospheric sciences at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia].  And he was very well connected in China, and we were actually pretty much the first delegation to visit China after the cultural revolution, so at that time, it was a big thing.  [George H.W.] Bush [U.S. president 1989-1993] was actually the ambassador, the first Bush, was actually the ambassador to China while we were there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's how long ago it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so he arranged that.  He took us over and we spent about three weeks there.  We developed a lot of friendships.  We've been going back and forth off and on for years now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who all went on the trip?
Speaker 2: Oh, there was a guy named Al Bridgewater who worked for the National Science Foundation [NSF]; Thomas Cole, who was president of Clarke Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  Back then he was president of the University of West Virginia, or West Virginia State [University, Kanawha County, West Virginia], I can't remember which one.  And Charles Meredith went; a guy named Jim Perkins who was the dean at Jackson State University [Natchez, Mississippi].  Bill Guillory went; Shirley McBay, who is the founder of the QEP [Quality Enhancement Plan] Program in Washington.
Speaker 1: Now that's the wife of Dr. [Henry] McBay?
Speaker 2: Right, that's Dr. McBay's former wife.  Shirley went.  Who else went?  Uh, "Bill" [William] Lester, who was a faculty member in theoretical chemistry at UC [University of California] Berkeley; Bill Jackson, who's retired but he's the professor emeritus at UC [University of California] Davis.  I think that was about it, I think that was it.  Of course, me and C.S. [Kiang]
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  C.S. Kiang, alright.  Now you're in '83 [1983], oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't ask you enough about that.  Where did you all go?  Did you go to Beijing?
Speaker 2: We went to Beijing, we went to Shanghai.  We went to Han Seoul, I'm not sure--I think we did, yeah.  And we met with some member of the public bureau, I can't remember his name right now.  But we were, it was really great.  We were received by the Chinese government quite well.  It was the first time that they ever had, it had been years, that they'd had Americans there on any type of delegation.  So, they were really great with us.
Speaker 1: I know there were students from Tanzania and maybe a couple of other African countries.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were there, right, because it was all part of the Communist bloc, so there were some students like that there.  It was very different, obviously, than the way it is today.  It's like no comparison.  It's just that you could never imagine the difference.
Speaker 1: Now this is before the protests in Tiananmen [1989] Square?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, before then.  I was actually there during the protests in Tiananmen Square, too.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's like 1989 or '90 [1990]?
Speaker 2: That was about 1989, something like that.  C.S. and I were, we had arranged the atmospheric science conference in Beijing, and Tiananmen Square happened while we were there.  We were actually staying at Beijing University.
Story_ID: 30695
Speaker 1: Alright, okay, now in '83 [1983] it says that you were promoted to director of research computing with Atlanta University Center?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, you received about two million dollars in funding from Digital Equipment Corporation, the National Science Foundation, and private donors to establish a research computing facility at the University of Atlanta Center, Atlanta University Center.  The position is a joint appointment from Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta Georgia] and Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So all these elements, you know, all these different groups are...?
Speaker 2: They all fit in together as a group, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how did that work out?
Speaker 2: That worked out pretty good.
Speaker 1: Is it still in existence?
Speaker 2: Well, we've moved on beyond that now because we don't do computing like we used to do, so there's no computing center like that.  That was...
Speaker 1: Is this still with the big machines and big...?
Speaker 2: That was still with the big machines, and they were big and they were slow, but they were all we had.  But it did a lot to really unite Georgia Tech and Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  But at the same time, that was the same year that we built the library.  So Charles Meredith was the chancellor of the Atlanta University Center at that time, and he raised twenty-five million dollars.  Well, [Robert W.] Woodruff gave him twenty-five million dollars to build the Woodruff Library.  We got a call from Woodruff one day to come down to his office.
Speaker 1: Was this Hale Woodruff, the artist?
Speaker 2: No, the Coca Cola Woodruff.
Speaker 1: Oh, Coca Cola.  That's a different one.
Speaker 2: Right, the Coca Cola Woodruff.  So, he went down to the Coca Cola building and it was right across from Georgia Tech and he went up to Woodruff's office and Woodruff had a suitcase, and he said, "There's twenty-five million dollars in that suitcase, and if you can carry it, you can have it."  (laughter).
Speaker 1: This is not a joke?
Speaker 2: This is not a joke, this is the truth (laughter).   So, Charles said he didn't know how he was going to get twenty-five million dollars back over here without getting mugged or something.  (laughter).  I said, "Nobody would ever know you got twenty-five million dollars in that suitcase, twenty-five million dollars in Coca Cola stocks and bonds."  He said by the time he got here, it was like thirty million dollars.  The stock had gone up (laughter).
Speaker 1: Wow, what a story, what a story.  So, do you have any idea why Woodruff would do that?
Speaker 2: I think he thought it was a good idea (laughter).
Speaker 1: And just, you know...
Speaker 2: Well, I think, you know, really, I think he considered the Atlanta University Center, which was then roughly the same size as Georgia Tech in terms of the number of students, and it was the largest consortium, well, the only consortium for black education in the world.  And it was one of the largest concentrations for black education in the country, and it clearly, for him, was important to the development of Atlanta [Georgia].  He thought it was a good idea, and it was, because we built a state of the art computer science department, put that computer I got down there, and...
Story_ID: 30696
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in '84 [1984], also, at age thirty-seven you're named one of the Top Forty Atlantans Under Forty [40 years old], by Atlanta Magazine.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a long time ago (laughter).
Speaker 1: This is 1984, and Atlanta [Georgia] is jumping.  People are, black graduates from a lot of colleges are moving to Atlanta and people are seeing Atlanta as a, my son calls it now, a black Hollywood, or something, in terms of--well, people are coming here from everywhere.  It's growing and growing.  Who was the mayor in '84 [1984]?
Speaker 2: I think it was Maynard Jackson.
Speaker 1: Was it Maynard Jackson?
Speaker 2: I thought it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Maynard Jackson.  This is sort of like a golden age in Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Shirley, the former mayor of Atlanta, Shirley Franklin, who was also one of top forty--so I have this picture at home with the forty of us, and I'm standing right next to her, and she's, she was on that list, too.
Speaker 1: You know these were the days of the, I think the downside of those days were the Atlanta child murders.  I think they were taking place.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was taking place at the same time too (unclear).
Speaker 1: In the '80s [1980s], I think the mid to late '80s [1980s].  I remember Lee P. Brown was the police chief here.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And there was Turner taking off with CNN [Cable News Network] and all that was going on (unclear).
Speaker 2: And we'd gotten, we started taking on the Atlanta Braves, and shortly after that--yeah, it was a very exciting time in Atlanta.  We got CNN News, all over the world, right downtown.
Speaker 1: Right, it was big.  It puts Atlanta on the map and people started really--okay, so for a scientist, you've got the Centers for Disease Control here, the Yerkes Primate Center...
Speaker 2: Yeah, Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] is on the rise.  You got a new school downtown and an office night school called Georgia State University, and look at it now.   You got the Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia], [Robert W.] Woodruff had pumped in a hundred million dollars into Emory for biomedical research.  There was a lot going on.
Speaker 1: The most coveted formula in town was still Coca Cola?
Speaker 2: That's right, the Coca Cola formula, that's right. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was there any chemical talk about how to decipher, I mean find out what's in the Coke, or something?  This is probably frivolous, but, you know.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  Yeah, you know, it never was.  It's interesting.  You know, that probably was one of the most important things that ever happened to Atlanta (laughter), Coca Cola.
Speaker 1: The formula for the Coke?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 30697
Speaker 1: Okay, but back to seriousness.  Now you published, in '84 [1984], a paper called "Ab-Initio Self-Consistent Field Studies of CLNOx [x= 1,2,3,] I don't know, the rest of it is a formula, and I'm not even sure...
Speaker 2: CLN03?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that was the paper that Paul Crutzen was interested in, the chlorine nitrate paper.  Chlorine nitrate was supposed to maybe trap some of the molecules-- see, there's a CLO in it, which is a primary intermediate and that was on the depletion cycle, so if it could be trapped in CLNO3, then it would lower the depletion rate, so it was kind of an important molecule then.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this almost like a cure for what the rocket fuel would do to the ozone layer?
Speaker 2: Right.  We had done some experimental work, too, where we said we isolated it in argon matrix at ten degrees K [kelvin], and measured the isotopic shift of two isomers.  Two different isomeric forms of the molecule and so--Crutzen was very interested in that, he was doing some spectroscopic studies of that molecule, too.  And that's how we got to go to Germany and visit him and get to know him a little bit.
Speaker 1: Now, who's this?
Speaker 2: Paul Crutzen.
Speaker 1: Paul Crutzen, okay.  Well, what was he like and what was..?
Speaker 2: He was a nice guy, and I particularly enjoyed the dinner we had at his house, it was really great.  And we didn't get to be really good friends, we knew each other and we exchanged data from time to time, but you know, I enjoyed the time that I was there with him.  I also had at that time some laboratories.  I had some monitoring stations in Italy, in Verona, and so I had to go over and check that out periodically, because you know, Italy is one of the largest rice producers in the world.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: And so some of the gases that are produced in the rice patties, like methane, we wanted to see, you know, how much was being produced so we could see if that had any impact on the chemical, the global chemical climatology, those types of, you know, growing those types of crops.  So that was really great, I enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: Methane is not good for the environment, either, is it?
Speaker 2: No, but it's a pretty good fuel (laughter).  So, we did that. And, yeah--
Story_ID: 30698
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, now in '84, you also published a National Science Foundation report entitled "Long Term Activities for Minority Institutions in Science and Technology" with C.S. Kiang and James Perkins.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was basically around the work that you all were doing?
Speaker 2: Well, we were looking at how do you develop research universities at minority institutions.  And, so what we came away with was that you had to be willing to create a certain infrastructure that would allow the institutions to participate competitively in research.  And, in fact, if you wanted to create a research institutions at any university, whether it be a minority university or a majority university, you had to create a particular infrastructure.  And so we looked at programs that the different federal agencies could create to provide that type of research infrastructure building to promote the expansion of science in the country.  So, it actually started as a project for minority universities, but it became something that could be applicable to any university.  And there were a number of programs that came out of that.  I mean, NSF [National Science Foundation] even today has infrastructure building research grants that it offers to universities for development.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, we have to pause again.
Speaker 2: Okay, great.
Story_ID: 30699
Speaker 1: The infrastructure changes that--
Speaker 2: see, if you look at a small college and a large college, okay--so fundamentally, you want to look at what infrastructure a university has to have to be competitive in research and develop research, okay.  And that would differ for a small university versus a large university.  For Morehouse College [Atlanta, University] versus Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio], right.  Now Tom Stelson, who was the vice president for research at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] at that time was the first person I ever heard talk about infrastructure and he's actually the person who hired me at Georgia Tech.  So, if you look at it now, you have to have a certain cyber infrastructure, you have to have computers, you have to have a certain connectivity, you have to have instruments, you have to have a way to maintain those instruments, and have them be accessible to the students.  You have to have a way to convert technology that's developed into commercial products, if that's appropriate.  So, there's a whole infrastructure that you build up around a university that's participating in this really high level research.  For example, a small business incubator could be part of that infrastructure, or a research park could be part of that infrastructure.  Obviously, buildings are part of that infrastructure, and then in that building, you've got to look at what you have to provide people in order to allow them to participate competitively (unclear).  A research office would be part of that infrastructure.  A sponsored program office would be part of that infrastructure.  So, we detailed out the infrastructure that had to be in place in order for a university to be competitive, and that was the Arrowhead Conference, because we were interested in building that infrastructure at minority institutions.  But what we said about minority institutions had to hold for anybody, and Tom Stelson was very good at that.
Story_ID: 30700
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 1985, now you're promoted to director of academic and research computing for Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] Center, Incorporated.  Now, how is that different from what you were doing before?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, this was the academic as well as the research.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's pretty easy to get a job like that.  You just get a computer and then they make you a director (laughter).  The position didn't exist before (unclear).  So now, we provide computing resources, or infrastructure, to students as well as for undergraduate education as well as to students and faculty for research.  In 1985, everybody had to know how to program, because the only access you had to having a computer work, was to know a programming language.  That's not true anymore.  See, now, basically most of the users don't know how to program, because it's not necessary for people to know how to program, they use a computer.  But, in 1985, you couldn't make the computer do anything unless you programmed it.  So, computer science was where the students learned the languages to be able to work with and to program and make the computers useful.
Speaker 1: Just for the sake of history, how much training, or how long of a training period was required, really to learn Fortran or COBOL in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, you could learn Fortran or COBOL in a couple of months.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it wasn't like, the average student could do that in a couple months?
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: And actually be able to program?
Speaker 2: Mmm Hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: But to really work with the computer at the lower level languages, it took longer.  You know if you're at the level of, what did they used call it, they called it similar language or machine language, it took a lot longer.
Speaker 1: Years longer?
Speaker 2: It could take years.  I know it took me years.
Speaker 1: Now, is any of that knowledge useful now at all?
Speaker 2: Not really (laughter).  The Fortran, or the visual basic, you know--I can program a visual basic, but the machine language is not useful anymore.  But it was a necessity, that was the only way you could actually do the work.
Story_ID: 30701
Speaker 1: Okay, now in the '80s [1980s], the early '80s [1980s] and the late '80s [1980s], you start to see the desktop model computers.  I don't know, they weren't like the ones of today, but they were, we did see those, the green screen, and you know...
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I stood in line to purchase, in Atlanta [Georgia], the first sale of IBM [International Business Machines] personal computers ever.  I stood in line.  It cost seven thousand dollars back in 1986, '87 [1987], and it had ten megabytes of memory, and no programs came with it (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's interesting, because I know in '82 [1982] or '83 [1983], I saw the first Mac Pluses, the Mac SC's, they were using those to do typesetting.  There was a small newspaper in Chicago [Illinois] that had a set of them.  And I would go in and rent time on the machines and do layout designs, where you could do it all, where you could see it, and it printed out for the first time.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And IBM hadn't gotten to that stage, I don't think.
Speaker 2: Right, there was no mouse.  There was none of the stuff that we have today.  There were ten megabytes of memory and a floppy disk, and that's all.  Well, we did have a hard disk, on it too.  But it's hard to imagine that we did anything, but there were no programs to buy.  There was a text editor, and I could use that to run my Fortran programs, or to--I basically used it as a terminal to talk to the computer that I purchased from Digital Equipment Corporation to do my electronic structure calculations.
Speaker 1: Okay.  seven thousand dollars.
Speaker 2: Seven thousand dollar terminal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And for another three thousand dollars you could get another ten megabytes (laughter).
Speaker 1: And that's a pre-2011 inflation seven thousand dollars.
Speaker 2: That's right.  For ten thousand dollars, you got twenty megabytes (laughter).
Speaker 1: To put that in perspective, ten thousand dollars in those days could buy you a really decent car.
Speaker 2: A very nice car.  I paid less than that for my 280 Z.  I paid seven thousand dollars for my 280 Z back then.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's the equivalent of thirty-five, forty thousand dollars.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Luckily, I had a grant.
Story_ID: 30702
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so, okay, 1985, you're promoted to principal research scientist at the School of Geophysical Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, do you actually leave Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and go to Georgia Tech?
Speaker 2: No, I still have the joint appointment.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's a joint appointment.
Speaker 2: And I'm principal research scientist.
Speaker 1: Alright, so that's interesting.  So, this consortium makes it possible to have a research scientist. I've heard scientists in the H-- traditional black colleges talk about how the teaching load is so great that you can hardly do research, you know.  So, these grants and this consortium of interest is making it possible to have a research scientist.  You worked primarily as a research scientist?
Speaker 2: Right.  Georgia Tech had the academic track and the research scientist track.  That was one of the things that Tom Stelson set up when he was there.
Speaker 1: So once you were promoted to principal research scientist, you then were...?
Speaker 2: They then talked to me about moving over to the academic track and I chose not to.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about the Dolphus E. Milligan Science Research Institute.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, Dolphus E. Milligan was a Morehouse graduate who got his Ph.D. from [University of California] Berkeley and worked for George Pimentel.  And he went on to the National Bureau of Standards to become a very famous chemist.  And Bill Guillory was one of his very good friends who also did the same type of research, it's called matrix isolation.  What you do is that, you isolate molecules at ten degrees above absolute zero, and then you take that spectra.  And because they're not moving around--the spectra are very sharp and well-defined.  And we use that technique to isolate intermediates for example, in the reaction of chlorine and ozone to model the stratospheric reaction between chlorine and ozone and then chlorine ozone depletion cycle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we built that research institute under the direction of Charles Meredith, who was then a chancellor, and it was the first institute that was solely for research, no teaching in the AU [Atlanta University] Center.  And we chose three areas that we would concentrate on--computer technology and software development.  We also chose biochemistry and we chose atmospheric sciences, and we also used the institute to incubate small businesses in Atlanta [Georgia].  And, it was pretty much a success, actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in 1987, you published a book chapter and the chapter is entitled 'Spectroscopic Identification of Products Formed in the Gas Phase Reaction of O-H with Atmospheric Sulfur Compounds.'
Speaker 2: Well, we were looking at acid rain, and the mechanisms of reaction of sulfur compounds and water and hydroxyl radicals, using the matrix isolation method.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  You become the visiting professor of computer science at Rice University in Houston [Texas] in '89 [1989]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How did this come about, and what did you do there?
Speaker 2: Well, the vice--let's see, Neil Lane was the provost, I think, who went on to become the director of NSF [National Science Foundation], and Ed Hayes was the vice provost, I believe.  And Ed Hayes had been the director of chemistry at NSF and he was the guy that gave me the money for the computer (laughter).  So, he got to know me from the proposal that I submitted to NSF to get the PDP, the DEC computer, the Digital Equipment Corporation computer.  Ed Hayes was also a theoretical chemist like myself, and he basically did the same type of work, he just didn't use boron hydrides.  And so, he wanted me to come to Rice University and maybe look at taking a position at Rice.  And the only position that he had to offer me was the visiting professor of computer science (laughter).  So, I went in as the visiting professor of computer science.  I was there for a summer, and I did a little work there and I left at the end of the summer.  It's so interesting because Neil Lane left and went to become the director of NSF, and Ed Hayes left and became vice president for research at Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio].  And then he asked me to come out and be associate vice president for research at Ohio State University, and that's how I got to Ohio State.
Story_ID: 30703
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is--in the interim, though you actually, you became a consultant and senior presenter at Innovations International in Salt Lake City [Utah].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, that's with William Guillory.
Speaker 2: That's the company owned by Bill Guillory, William Guillory. So, I went out there and I became a consultant.  Basically, what we did was diversity work.  We went into corporations, scientific corporations, and worked with them in the area of diversity.  Martin Marietta [Corporation, Bethesda, Maryland], Electronic Data Systems, Los Alamos--not Los Alamos--Sandia National Labs, we went to Sandia, so we became, we did that.  And that's where I met my wife, Susan.  She was also a presenter.
Speaker 1: Alright now, did you find that a lot of corporations and companies just weren't aware that there were any black scientists out here?
Speaker 2: Well, what we did, well, that was true.  It was very different back then than it is now.  I think people are much more aware of what's happening in the world, in the country.  There's much more diversity now in the country.  Back then what people were looking at was that it had been predicted in five or six years that the majority of the workforce would be minorities and women.  And these companies realized that they perhaps didn't know how to get the most out of and reward and promote, and really get the most out of minorities and women.  So they hired us to come in and to actually help them in that transition period.
Story_ID: 30704
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell us about what happened at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio].  You were there for, I guess about six years?
Speaker 2: I think I was there for seven years.
Speaker 1: Seven years?
Speaker 2: Almost eight.  I was hired as the associate vice president for research by Ed Hayes.  And after I was there a year--well, first of all, he made me the director of the office of technology transfer as well as associate vice president, and really my job was to hire somebody to be the director (laughter).  That was my only function.  So, I did that, and he asked me to develop for him, for the University, relationships with industries.  So I set up an office of industrial outreach and an office of responsive programs that just dealt with industry.  And he also asked me to be the lead in developing the research part.  But, all of that was because I had been at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], and Georgia Tech was kind of like the perfect model for how you should do this.  So we did that, and in my second year he asked me to be the executive director of the Ohio State University Research Foundation, which is the organization that actually manages the research and the research infrastructure for Ohio State University.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's an organization--I think we had about 165 or -seventy employees.  We had an annual budget of about twelve million dollars, and we managed about $400-$500 million dollars in research money every year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The president of Ohio State is Gordon Gee.
Speaker 2: Gordon Gee, who is actually from Utah.  He went to the University of Utah as a student like my daughter did, Shanda (ph.).
Speaker 1: So, there are a lot of connections, you just wouldn't know them, right. (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right (laughter).
Speaker 1: It's almost like genealogy, pretty much, once you know the story.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  It really is, it keeps going around, these people over and over again, you know.
Speaker 1: A lot of connections, so you're there for six years.  Did you have any, were there any relationship between Ohio State University and the two black schools there, Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was, and there is.
Speaker 1: And not to mention Cleveland State [University, Cleveland, Ohio], being majority black, even though it's not a ...
Speaker 2: It's not, they don't do much with Cleveland State, but certainly Central State, the most, I think, when I was there.  I used to go down quite often to Central State University.  It wasn't quite like it was here in Atlanta [Georgia] because of the distance, and it's just harder to sustain a relationship, you know, when you're like fifty, sixty miles away.  I can actually see Georgia Tech from my office here at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, University], so it's a bit easier.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's at least an hour and a half away to get to Central from Ohio State.
Speaker 2: But it was a great experience at Ohio State.  It's a huge university.  It's the largest university in the world, in terms of the number of students, and I think in terms of the amount of land, that's really huge.  And they do a lot of good stuff there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have much interaction with the black studies department there at Ohio State?
Speaker 2: I had some, not a lot, but I did have some.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was a Morehouse graduate who was provost, vice provost, Max Stewart, who I worked with from time to time.  He's also, I don't know the exact title, it's like director of diversity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think Max retired, he retired last year or year before last.
Story_ID: 30705
Speaker 1: Okay, in 2001 you came back to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Alright.  And what brought you back?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to teach again.  You don't do much teaching as an associate vice president for research and the executive director of Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio] Research Foundation (laughter).  And I just lost touch with being with students, and it's a lot warmer here than in Ohio and other places, so I thought this was a really good place to come back to.  Susan and I had always thought we would go back to Utah to live, but after she lived here for a year, she said there was no way she was ever going back to that much snow in her life, and this is just the greatest place to live (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came back in 2001.  Now, did you come back with tenure?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, I would think so.  And, says here that you received a hundred and a quarter [$125,000,000] million in funding from the United States Department of Defense to develop college level courses and the material sciences, and another four hundred thousand dollars from the Keck Foundation to develop a center of excellence for chemical instrumentation?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us what the Atlanta Undergraduate Research Alliance was?
Speaker 2: That was interesting.  We don't do much with it now, but it started something.  We were actually responding to an NSF [National Science Foundation] solicitation regarding undergraduate research centers.  So, Georgia State University, Ken Assad (ph.), Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology], Agnes Scott [College], Spelman [College], Morehouse [College], Clarke, Atlanta [University] [all in Atlanta, Georgia]--  all of these seven or eight universities in the city decided, kind of lead by Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia]--a dean there named Preetha Ram decided that we would just start working together and we would take down any limitations.  Like, if a Morehouse student wanted to work for a Georgia Tech student-- professor, to do undergraduate research, they'd just go over there and do it.  We created a website, and we were registering all of that and started looking at that  and we submitted a proposal to NSF.  We did get a planning grant, but we couldn't quite get it together to get the full grant and so we didn't get that.  And even though the [Atlanta Undergraduate Research] Alliance has kind of fallen apart, we still have a lot of connectivity.  We still--the Atlanta University Center participates in the American Chemical Society activities more than they ever did because of that activity, you know, getting together and looking at how we could assist each other.  And, we have a lot of students that still do research at the other institutions as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were the like chair of the chemistry department here, in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, you're a member of the Atlanta Mayor's Advisory Committee for Clean Water, under Shirley Franklin?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you want to say about that?
Speaker 2: Well, Atlanta was having a problem with its water.  And the main problem that it was having with its water, if I remember correctly, is that during thunderstorms, we would have sewer overflows, and it would overflow into the Chattahoochee River.  And the federal government didn't like that too much.  And Mayor Franklin put together a group of people to look at--lead by Wayne Cluff at Georgia Tech, to look at, what it should do to deal with that problem, because it had run out of options, and it was going to be fined by the federal government if they kept it up.  And that's what that group of people did.  So, Wayne put together a group of people and we created a plan, and we implemented that plan.
Speaker 1: Is it working?
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter).  I haven't heard anything else, but I don't think we're being sued, but I'm not sure.  We don't have as many overflows as we used to have, but we haven't had as much water as we used to have, either (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, Atlanta [Georgia] is curious in that it's not built on a body of water.
Speaker 2: No, it's not.
Speaker 1: And so, the Chattahoochee [River] is how far away from the city?
Speaker 2: It runs through the city.
Speaker 1: It does run through the city?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can go down there every morning and walk along the banks of the Chattahoochee from my home.
Speaker 1: Alright, I thought there was not a river running through, but the Chattahoochee does run through.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Atlanta is kind of interesting because Atlanta was like, even during--in 1800, it was like a central watering place.  Like Five Points is a place where water accumulated from different places and--it's been like a central hub, and you can see the success it's had in being a central hub for the airline industry as well.   But it's not a city that's located on an ocean.  Many of our large cities are like that, like Miami [Florida] and San Francisco [California].
Speaker 1: The gulf and the big lakes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you're named the Bruce Raneur Professor of Natural Sciences at Morehouse.  Who is Bruce Raneur?
Speaker 2: He's an entrepreneur who gave Morehouse a bunch of money for this chair (laughter).  He pays my salary.  And that's what he does, he just makes investments.  I had to look him up on the internet, you know, to really find out who he was.  He's really a very interesting person.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you also in 2005, you become the president of Transformational Consultants International, right?  Is that the same...?
Speaker 2: I actually started that company in 1993. That was the company that I started while I was in Utah.
Speaker 1: With William Guillory?
Speaker 2: No, I started that actually with Susan, my wife.  And that company was, well, the purpose of that company was to assist organizations and individuals to be more successful in business through personal and professional development.
Story_ID: 30706
Speaker 1: Now since you've been back here at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], since 2001, are you continuing your research?
Speaker 2: You know, my research kind of shifted more to like the studies of like how do you provide an environment for people to be successful?  What are the indicators of success?  Are there some areas of personal development that you can use to actually increase people's success so that we can have more students successful in STEM careers, science, engineering, technology and mathematics careers?  Like, what is, you know ,if you have an individual who is successful like an empowered individual, how do you actually make that individual from the ground up, how does that person become someone who is successful?  And we call it the Making of the Empowered Individual.  And using, you know, different assessments, like the Berkman assessment, to see how students differ now from students earlier in terms of their interests and their abilities, how they communicate with each other, how they like to do work.  And it was very interesting.  We found that the students were very different than their professors are, in how they like to do work.  And see, their professors were actually-- like me, were actually more similar to--when they were students they were more similar to their professors, and now with the all the technological changes that society has gone through, people are very different.  You know, students are now able to multi-task as a preference more than students did before, or even their professors did.  So, that kind of research.  And we still do some computations, particularly in the area of atmospheric chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to pause here a second.
Story_ID: 30707
Speaker 1: We were talking off camera, and this seems interesting because you said part of your research is, has to do with, I guess, the expression of individuals and, just elaborate on that for a minute 'cause we were talking about conciseness on language and, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, people, people have particular ways that they need to behave in order to be non-stressed.  And, of course, in addition to that, there's a, there's a group of socialized behaviors that we learn to do because that's what's acceptable in society, right?  And in many cases, the socialized behaviors and the way we need to behave overlap.  Because if they didn't, then we'd probably end up, you know, in jail somewhere or something (laughter).  So, what we were talking about off camera is that people have a certain need to be able to communicate in a particular way.  Like some people are very direct, and some people are not direct at all.  And people who are very direct have a need to be direct.  Then there are some people that have a need for other people to be direct with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then some people have a need for people to be indirect with them.  Now the problem arises is when you have a person who is very direct talking to a person who has a need to be--for you to be indirect.  Then that causes a problem.  Or, a person who is very direct, and somebody is talking to that person who has a need to be very indirect with that person.   What they don't understand is that if I have a need for you to be direct with me, and you're not, I literally cannot understand what you're saying.  I literally cannot read between the lines.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  And you'll just think that I'm not being cooperative.  So, we do that kind of research and we help people to match up and understand not only how they are--because most of us don't know how we are.  See, you actually don't know sitting over there in that chair whether you have a need for people to be direct with you or not.  You actually don't know that, because you can't see your needs.  Now you might feel that you get irritated by people who are indirect with you.  That would be a clue (laughter).  So, we do that for organizations or for people.  And my wife used to call what we do is that we build working relationships that work.  Because our view of another person is a perception of that person, it's not actually who that person is, and we build that perception by how, by how that person interacts with us.
Speaker 1: Is scientific research and interaction and projects, are scientific projects dependent on that kind of information?
Speaker 2: Well, what's dependent--no, no, not really.  Scientific projects are not.  I mean, you have people who are direct and people who are indirect, it doesn't matter, they can do science just as well.  It doesn't affect your performance, it only affects your ability to have relationships with other people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because if I'm direct, and you don't want--and you have a need for me to be indirect, then right there we have a cause for conflict.  And we don't even know why we're having conflict, we just know, I just know, that every time I talk to you and you don't like it because I'm so in- because I don't even know that I'm indirect.  I'm just saying what I have to say to get my point over.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Then after I finish talking, five minutes later you still don't understand what I said (laughter).
Speaker 1: Just for instance, for instance, we're all working on a project, say you and Dr. Haynes [HistoryMaker J. K. Haynes].  Both of you seem to be sort of gregarious, outgoing men, and there are people we've interviewed that are scientists who are not. They are very, just very--you know, they are, they are used to being alone, and they say this in the interview, and is it--so, your work, is it to bridge the gap between these two kinds of personalities or--yeah (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Because, you know, you have all kinds of personalities working in the workplace, right, working together?  And when people have conflicts, it's usually because a need is not getting met that somebody has.  Now, they don't know it's not getting met because they don't know they have it, but once they know that they have it, and they can see it in this assessment, it makes perfect sense to them why they've been acting the way they've been acting, and why other people have been setting them off the way they've been setting them off.
Speaker 1: So, do you have like assessment tools (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, we do, we have an assessment tool, yeah--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --that we use to do that with.
Speaker 1: And this helps individuals realize where they are on the spectrum and--?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) See, with the assessment tool, I can, I can tell--I can tell things like, okay, does the person eat lunch at the same place every day?  Or better yet, does the person order the same thing every day when they go to eat?  You know, because all I have to do is look at their thought score.  If it takes them a long time to make decisions, then they order the same thing all the time because it keeps them from having to make one decision.  Or, they'll lay their clothes out for the entire week because they don't, they get up in the morning and it would take them too long to make a decision about what they're going to wear, so they lay it out.  With me, I don't lay anything out, I just put (laughter) what- put whatever's there on, because I have a low thought score.  So it's a very great instrument.  We use it to coach the students, too, and to mentor them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it gives them a better understanding of who they are, what their needs are, and how they can interact successfully with other people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--well, part of what you're saying is that if we understand who we are, we actually can be more successful at (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Exactly, exactly.  So part of what makes a person, you know, that quote, unquote empowered individual is a firm understanding and inquiry into who they are and what are their needs.
Story_ID: 30708
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is the future trajectory of your research here?  Are you kind of like done with the project right now, are you still working on it?  And if you're still working on it, do you think someone else needs to pick it up and continue it?
Speaker 2: Well, I think somebody else needs to pick it up, because I'm getting interested in some other stuff (laughter).  We're becoming very interested in atmospheric chemistry from a different perspective, particularly the stratospheric ozone layer, from a different perspective.  Because if you look at the stratosphere, the temperature is around zero degrees centigrade, it's not very cold.  And that's because of the number of photochemical reactions that take place, and so we want to look a little more at that, at the photochemistry of the stratosphere.  But at the same time, we want to look some more at what makes people successful, and you know, how can we use our assessment and the knowledge that we've gained to start to create mentoring programs that actually work for people, like systematic mentoring programs, like you actually know what to do.  When somebody says you're going to mentor somebody there's some things that you actually know what to do rather than just talk to them like that.  And, then I'm looking forward to retiring so I can do some other things that I want to do that I haven't been able to do.
Story_ID: 30709
Speaker 1: Okay.  We always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Speaker 2: Ah, well, we are living in a much, much, more diverse and global environment than we ever have.  And my hope and my concern--well, my hope is that we will realize that, and be able to use, what we've gained through our struggle and process in American society to assist others in dealing with the development--let's see--to assist others in this global environment and dealing with their development as well, that's my hope.  So, we learned a great deal, African-Americans learned a great deal about how to move through society and how to progress and how to become successful.  And to be able to carry that on, to contribute that to the world would be my hope.
Story_ID: 30710
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: Ah, I don't think so.  You know, I don't think I would have been happy doing anything differently.  You know, I can look at some things and say, maybe I should have taken a job at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] rather than come back to Atlanta [Georgia], but I was happy doing that, and I think I'd do it again.  Or maybe I should have thought about becoming more of an university administrator, but I'm happy doing what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I have a great life and you know, what else can you want?  (laughter).  I'm learning how to fly now.
Speaker 1: Alright now likewise, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy would have to be the work that I've done in diversity and the work that I've done with the students here at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, any specific, in terms of your legacy here at Morehouse, can you name like a couple of things maybe that you're most proud of?
Speaker 2: Oh, what am I most proud of?  Well, I'm most proud of the students that have gone through the chemistry department and have gone out and now are making contributions in the world.  And I know for me personally it's affected my life.  My son was having an asthma attack once and I took him to the emergency clinic and I went in there and there was one of my Morehouse chemistry students, chemistry majors, who was in there as a physician.  And I was really glad to see him because I knew he was in good hands.  So, it's that kind of thing that I'm most proud of.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us a little bit about your family.  You said your wife passed not that long ago.
Speaker 2: Yes, my wife Susan died several years ago from cancer, and she was British.  She was still a British citizen, and she had a step-daughter, Shanda (ph.).  And Shanda has two children, so I have grandchildren from Shanda and Brett.  He's an airline pilot, that's her husband.  And it's just really great.  And I have a son John [Hall Jr.] who lives here, he's a salesperson, he sells cars.  (laughter).  He loves cars, and that's what does.  And he buys and sells cars, himself, personally.  And I have a son, Mo [Hall], Muhammad, he goes by Mo.  And Muhammad was actually named after the person that wrote the first algebra book, Muhammad al-Khowarizmi.  And Muhammad lives in New York with his wife, and he has a child and, essentially because his wife is Italian--so it's kind of like my mother [Mary Emma Watson] (laughter) and they live on Long Island [New York].  And that's my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother and father [John Henry Hall, Sr.] get a chance to see you earn a Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, they did.  Both my mother and father got a chance to see me get a Ph.D..
Speaker 1: What did they make of that?
Speaker 2: My father thought it was great.  He thought it was great, because he said I could never make it as an international labor representative, so it was good that I got a Ph.D. in chemistry (laughter).  He was quite proud, he was very proud, so was my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is there anything I need to ask you before I ask you my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Well, I'm engaged, I'll contribute that, to a woman who lives in March, England, so she'll be here in three weeks permanently.  Yeah, she--so I'm getting married again.  And let's see, I guess that's it.  That rounds out my family.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, last question.  It's similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as someone who did the best that they could to have people work together successfully and live together successfully.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, thank you for your story, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Alright, thank you.
