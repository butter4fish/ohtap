Speaker 2: I would say red is probably my favorite color.
Speaker 1: Like that great red hat you're wearing.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is cauliflower.
Speaker 1: Wow. Time of year?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a hard one because when you go through a lot of these seasons sometimes it seems like this is it, then if you live twenty more years and it seems like this is so it changes.  It's changed a lot, you know.
Speaker 1: Vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I'm not into vacations.  I used to go to--with my--Mrs. Rollins [Lucille Rollins], we used to go to a place called Virgin Gorda [British Virgin Islands].
Speaker 1: Oh, it's beautiful there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, for, you know--so we were there for a while but vacations is a concept that I'm not comfortable with, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there a saying or phrase that you prefer?
Speaker 2: It's all good.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 589353
Speaker 1: So I'd like to now talk about your family.  We'll talk about both sides of your family, and let's start with your mother.  Her name, when and where she was born and tell me about her and her family, please.
Speaker 2: Well I don't know a lot, but her name was Valborg [Valborg Solomon Rollins], V-A-L-B-O-R-G and she was born in St. Thomas [U.S. Virgin Islands] in the Caribbean, and her father was from Haiti.  Dr. Solomon from Haiti was her father.  That was her mother's husband, one of her mother's husbands.  So I don't know quite--as far as my grandmother [Miriam Hanson], I don't know if she's from St. Thomas or if she--exactly that.  But I'm pretty sure my mother is from St. Thomas.
Speaker 1: And Dr. Solomon, do you know what type of doctor he was?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: A medical doctor?
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah.
Speaker 1: And can you trace anybody further back?
Speaker 2: No, I can't really.
Speaker 1: What was your mother's work?
Speaker 2: Work?
Speaker 1: Did she work?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, she worked yeah, because she used to have me with her when she used to go down on Park Avenue [New York, New York] cleaning houses.  You know, she had nobody to take care of me, I was the youngest boy.  So I used to--she used to take me down there and I'd have to wait in the closet or someplace while she cleaned the house, you know, Park Avenue.  And she did that but she also--that's the only work, you know, other than that.  My mother went to night school; she was very--trying to always improve herself, and but--
Speaker 1: What did she study in night school?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I don't know; I have no idea what she studied.
Speaker 1: Did her work change after a while from cleaning?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  She was mainly a mother, as far as I know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you know of the circumstances of her moving from St. Thomas to America?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't really know.  I--my oldest sister [Gloria Rollins Anderson]--I have an older sister and an older brother [Valdemar Rollins] so they were both born in the Caribbean; I was born here. But my sister used to tell me that--what a difficult trip it was coming over, you know.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: The seas were very volatile and whatever and what a hard time it was.  So I would imagine that it probably has to do with economics.  Although my mother was a very--she was a person that always wanted to introduce us to culture and stuff like that, you know.  So she might have been thinking about a better place to give her kids a chance to do whatever we do in this life.
Speaker 1: To be exposed.
Speaker 2: Be exposed.  So I would say that but I wouldn't, you know, I don't know--
Speaker 1: And, and Dr. Solomon, you said he was from Haiti.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did he come to the U.S. as well?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  I don't think he--I think he lived and survived his life in Haiti as far as I know; he was strictly Haiti.
Speaker 1: Do you know the year of your mother's birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know the year of my mother's birth (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 589354
Speaker 1: So you, you know from when they were living in New--did they come to New York [New York] your mother [Valborg Solomon Rollins]--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, and your siblings?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  She came here with her whole family, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay and whole family meaning the children?
Speaker 2: The two older children, my two older siblings (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what are their names?
Speaker 2: My brother's name was Valdemar [Valdemar Rollins], V-A-L-D-E-M-A-R, and he's five years my senior.  Val is now ninety-one.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: He lives in New Rochelle [New York] or Mount Vernon [New York] somewhere there.  Anyways, and my older sister is deceased.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Gloria Anderson [Gloria Rollins Anderson].
Speaker 1: And so the, the--Dr. Solomon is your father?
Speaker 2: Dr. Solomon would be my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Your--sor- excuse me, right, your grandfather.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 589355
Speaker 1: Who is your father?
Speaker 2: My father was Walter Rollins.
Speaker 1: And where is he from?
Speaker 2: He's from St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands].
Speaker 1: Okay. So St. Croix and St. Thomas [U.S. Virgin Islands] are sister islands, right?
Speaker 2: Well they had three islands, St. Croix, St. Thomas and--
Speaker 1: St. John [U.S. Virgin Islands].
Speaker 2: St. John.  So--
Speaker 1: But people don't live on St. John, right?
Speaker 2: I don't know that much about St. John.  It looks more like a--
Speaker 1: I think it's a preserve.
Speaker 2: A preserve exactly.
Speaker 1: But St. Thomas is a bigger island, I believe.
Speaker 2: I guess so. That's the, that's the big island yes St. Thomas, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so your father is from St. Croix.
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: And his parents?
Speaker 2: Well that's where I'm lost after that I really don't know--
Speaker 1: You don't know his--
Speaker 2: --too much about his, his parents.  I met--his mother came to visit us a long time ago, Ms. Helena [ph.], and--but I never met my paternal grandfather, you know.
Story_ID: 589356
Speaker 1: Did your father [Walter Rollins] meet your mother [Valborg Solomon Rollins] in the Caribbean or in, in the states?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think he--I think they met in the Caribbean.
Speaker 1: And so they came with the family to New--to--
Speaker 2: Well yeah I guess so.  My father was a career [U.S.] Navy.  He was in the Navy all of his life and so he, he--I think that--I don't know if he came to the states with my mother or not, or but--later or something, you know.
Speaker 1: But he, he started in the Navy as a teenager?
Speaker 2: Yeah he was in the Navy as a youngster.  I think he was in the Navy when he was in the islands.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he became a naval officer, correct?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah he, he rose to the--at that time which was the highest level that blacks could reach in the Navy which was warrant officer or chief petty officer; it was the same thing.  So my father was chief petty officer, you know.
Speaker 1: And did he talk about his experiences in the Navy?
Speaker 2: Experiences in the Navy? Well, not--I used to go down--you said you're from Baltimore [Maryland], I used to go down when I was nine, ten, eleven, I used to go down to my--to Annapolis [Maryland]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --which is where my father was stationed at Annapolis for a while.  He had the officers' club.  So I used to go down there during the summer break from school and spend time with my father at Annapolis, you know.
Speaker 1: And around what year would this have been?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say it would be around '39 [1939], '40 [1940], '41 [1941], that era, that, that period.
Speaker 1: And he was allowed to go into the officers' club at that age at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, he, he ran the officers' club.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He ran the officers' club.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know my dad was an officer in World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they weren't--blacks weren't allowed to go into the officers' club.
Speaker 2: In the Navy?
Speaker 1: In the [U.S.] Army--
Speaker 2: Oh, in the Army, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: In the Army, where he was.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it--
Speaker 2: Well my father got into trouble because he had--it was an officers' club which he ran, and there was a lot of fraternization going on.  And some guy, you know, didn't appreciate that and told the authorities or somebody there.  Well, oh, man these--you know there is this black guy and there are some white women, you know the same old stuff.  So my father got in trouble for that but he was in charge of the--
Speaker 1: Of the club?
Speaker 2: Yeah North Severn officers' club.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did, did he talk at all about racial relations other than that in the Navy?
Speaker 2: No, no really not.  He was, you know, a good friend of his, Admiral Arthur M. Radford [sic. Arthur W. Radford] was the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he and my father came up through the Navy together.  And, and Admiral Radford used to come and visit us in Harlem [New York, New York] with his wife [Miriam Caro Radford].  He'd come visit us in Harlem.  So they were really tight from that time.
Speaker 1: So he had--so he had a good friend across the color line for sure.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah exactly, right yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Admiral Radford was the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Speaker 1: Of course. One of the highest positions you could have.
Speaker 2: One of the positions you could have.
Speaker 1: And did your father serve in World War II?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  He was career all the way up to--yeah, up to the '40s [1940s] sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Did he tell you any stories of World War II?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I think my father's position was sort of as, as a petty--chief petty officer and warrant officer, I think he was really taking care of cooking and making sure that the facilities were okay for the servicemen, the officers and all this kind of stuff.  So I don't think he was out on the field with a gun or nothing like that.  You know, I think he was in a different position--role (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Role, um-hm, um-hm.
Story_ID: 589357
Speaker 1: Did your family travel with your father [Walter Rollins] at all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.
Speaker 1: So you didn't live with him?
Speaker 2: No he would just visit us when he was in the area and had a chance to be off.  I remember my sister [Gloria Rollins Anderson] telling me one time that she was so upset about this, because he was trying to be able to stay with my family, get a job, I think was at the Brooklyn Navy Yard [New York, New York].  But they wouldn't allow him to do that, he had to travel.  He was trying to get a commission where he could stay with the family in one place.  So I remember my sister was really--took that pretty hard and she was telling me how sad it was and they wanted to be together but the [U.S. military] service wouldn't allow that to happen.
Speaker 1: I guess because he was in that work, he was able to provide for your family?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Daddy used to send us stuff--he used to send us blankets and all that.  You know, during the '30s [1930s] it was hard times there for everybody.
Speaker 1: Sure, the Depression [Great Depression].
Speaker 2: The Depression time and he used to send us stuff, yeah sure he was providing for us as much as possible.
Speaker 1: And how often would you see him?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I'd see my father maybe every two years or something like that.
Speaker 1: Oh, long periods.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 589358
Speaker 1: Where did you live?  Where did you and your mom [Valborg Solomon Rollins] and siblings [Valdemar Rollins and Gloria Rollins Anderson] live?
Speaker 2: Well, we lived in Harlem [New York, New York].  I was born on 137th Street between Lenox and 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard].
Speaker 1: In the Sugar Hill neighborhood.
Speaker 2: No, no.  This is down in Harlem proper.
Speaker 1: Okay 137th.
Speaker 2: A 137th Street between Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard] and 7th Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  It's not Sugar Hill; this is Harlem.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. And was this at your [maternal] grandmother's [Miriam Hanson] house?
Speaker 2: No, we had our own house.  My grandmother had--I don't know if she came to the United States with them, I don't know that. But she had her own place, own house.  My grandmother stayed with my mother's family at times, but she usually had her own dwelling, you know.
Speaker 1: So Mr. Rollins [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins], when you think back to your early childhood, what is--what would you say is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, my earliest memory was--gee I had a lot of early memories.  I remember we used to have a little pet mouse, Pete.  So we used to have him in a little cage and on the window, a white, a little white mouse.  So I remember when we were going out, going walking, going the whole family and one day it was hot in the summertime, and we came back and poor Pete had gotten--he died because of the heat, you know.  We didn't--I remember that that was a big thing I remember.  I remember my--I remember the music, I remember my mother [Valborg Solomon Rollins] taking us to see 'Pirates of Penzance' ['The Pirates of Penzance'] the Gilbert [W.S. Gilbert] and Sullivan [Arthur Sullivan] operetta up on, up in Colonial Park [Jackie Robinson Park, New York, New York].  I was really small then and we walked up to Colonial Park.  Later on, I pieced it together and remembered where that would have been, that was Colonial Park.
Speaker 1: Where's Colonial Park?
Speaker 2: Colonial Park was, was at 145th Street. It was 145th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was it an outdoor performance?
Speaker 2: It was outdoor, yeah.  Yeah, Colonial Park was a big area there.
Story_ID: 589359
Speaker 1: And as you were growing up in Harlem [New York, New York], when you think of your time as a little boy growing up, what are the sights, sounds and smells that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well it smells of course--the, the sounds is mainly I remember hearing a lot of music.  That's where--I heard a lot of music, of course Fats Waller when I heard Fats Waller and that's pretty young.  That was a--that turned a light bulb on in my head.  You know, and I said wow what is this?  You know, so I said well I've got to be a musician.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you had that thought?
Speaker 2: I must have been around three, maybe.
Speaker 1: Really young.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah really, really young.  'Cause we had a lot of music in my house.  It was a lot of music and--
Speaker 1: Was it on the radio? Your mother's [Valborg Solomon Rollins] playing albums? What--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the radio.  We had a Victrola, records but it was a lot--a lot was on the radio, you know. A lot was on the radio.  And of course movies, they always had some great--Louis Armstrong was always in these movies, and so--
Speaker 1: And your mother took you all to the movies?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh sure. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Would you go on Saturdays when the movies would come out?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, we--well, when I was that young I don't remember that she would take us.  But I know they used to give out dishes at the theater to the people--dish night.  You know, you'd go there and they'd have dishes they'd give to people as a, as some kind of a gift, I guess to give for coming to the movies.  They used to give out candy bars for coming to the movies.  But, you know, so I don't recall a lot until I got a little older--six, seven years old and I was beginning to negotiate all that stuff for myself.  The movies were our main thing.  My mother used to take me to some Caribbean dances, a couple of times I remember.  And there was just music, jazz music all around, you know.  Just even the player pianos they used to have, every house had a piano.  Every house had a piano, a lot of times player pianos.
Speaker 1: And what--you--what did you have?
Speaker 2: I, I think we had some player pianos.  It's hard for me to focus on that, because in those days a lot of people were evicted and out on the street you had all of these pianos.  You'd come by and just have a whole guy's--people--families, all the belongings: sofa, chairs, bed, everything and there was a player piano.  So there were so many pianos ubiquitous all over the place.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: So I think we had--I know we had some player pianos, you know, and it was a lot of jazz on these player pianos.  As you know the great James P. [James P. Johnson] used to do a lot of these rolls, they called them rolls, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On the player pianos?
Speaker 2: On the player pianos, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what about the calypso and j- not Jamaican--West Indian music because your family, your mother's from there?  Did she play that too?
Speaker 2: Right, right. Yeah, yeah that's what--she took me to some Caribbean dance and she had Caribbean records.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We had some Caribbean records and I liked that.  So I heard a lot of that music, you know, around the house as well as all other kinds of music.  But there was always some Caribbean music there.
Story_ID: 589360
Speaker 1: Now when--you said at age three--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you committed to, I want to be a musician.
Speaker 2: Oh, y-
Speaker 1: You heard Fats Waller and that was it.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: How soon after that did you start playing?  And you started with the piano, right?
Speaker 2: Well, they put me on the piano but I was--I wanted to play in the street.  I didn't want to really--my brother [Valdemar Rollins] and sister [Gloria Rollins Anderson], they were more scholarly, and they played piano and my brother played violin, classical violin.  You know, I'd see him practicing all the time, and my sister played piano in church and all that stuff.  And--but I didn't, I didn't want to do that.  Then jazz is what said I've got to do music, but I didn't want to really go through the--that--
Speaker 1: The classical.
Speaker 2: --formal studying, you know.
Speaker 1: So what'd you do?
Speaker 2: And my mother [Valborg Solomon Rollins] let me get away with that, 'cause I was the baby, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Right.  So what did she let you do?
Speaker 2: Well I wasn't doing anything.  I went to a couple of piano lessons but mainly I was just out playing ball in the street, you know, and like that.  But pretty early on I got my saxophone around seven or eight, I got my first saxophone.  'Cause I, you know, I heard another guy, Louis Jordan, who was a big influence on me.  And my uncle's girlfriend who I used to spend time with my uncle too, she used to have a lot of these blues records, and I spent--I'd spend a lot of time at my uncle's house.  See, I was the baby and everybody else was working.  My brother and sister were in school, all that stuff.  So I was around with either my [maternal] grandmother [Miriam Hanson] or my uncle.  So with Uncle Reuben [Reuben Hanson], I--spending a lot of time at his house and his girlfriend Lizzie [ph.], so she was playing all these records and boy I really loved that and then she had some Louis Jordan records.  And, and then we also had a Louis Jordan record at home, "The green grass grows all around and around. The green grass grows," ['The Green Grass Grows All Around'], you know.  We had that record at my house, but I got to like Louis Jordan.  And so what happened was that I used to hear a lot of these original blues records with guys like Tommy McClennan and Arthur Crudup, Big Boy Crudup, and Lonnie Johnson.  So she was playing--I would play those records all day long when I was at their house.  And then she had Louis Jordan and that--boy that was--course that was more like a citified blues, you know, with the saxophone.  See, these other guys were really country blues. Guys playing the guitar and Lonnie Johnson was a little bit--he sang a little more but these other cats Tommy McClennan and them, they were just strictly country blues, guitar (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So Louis Jordan spoke to you in a different way.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Louis Jordan spoke to me in a little different way, yeah.
Story_ID: 589361
Speaker 1: And so you get your saxophone when you're seven or eight years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is still very, very young.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who's teaching you?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a--there was a cousin.  I had a couple of cousins who played saxophone.  There was one guy that played saxophone who--he was a guy--his name was Hubert [ph.].  So I remember Hubert got me--my mother [Valborg Solomon Rollins] said, "Well, you know, whatever my--."  You know, I was--my mother really, you know, would give me anything.  So, she and I, "Oh Ma, I want to play saxophone." And she said okay, so Hubert got me a saxophone, you know, a used saxophone.  And I was about seven years old then, and I was already, as I said, into Louis Jordan.  I had heard him, and he was working right across from me where I was going to school, P.S. 89 on 135th Street and Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard, New York, New York].  Right across was the Elks Rendezvous nightclub.  Louis Jordan was appearing there so when I was getting out of school every day, I'd pass by and there would be this picture of Louis Jordan.  You know, he had on these cut away tails and stuff and shiny saxophone.  You know, I said wow.  So I knew, I knew where I was going.
Speaker 1: Were you able to see him perform?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no.  I was too--
Speaker 1: Because you were too young.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah I couldn't go in to Elks Rendezvous.
Speaker 1: You didn't sneak in?
Speaker 2: No I was too young for that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, I--
Speaker 1: But you were inspired by seeing that he was--
Speaker 2: By listening to--well his picture and I heard his music.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: So then seeing the picture and hearing the music was like a message, as good as--. You know wow this is my man Louis Jordan and so it all came together.
Speaker 1: And so you, you--Hubert got you the saxophone.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: When did you start--I'm sure you picked it up immediately but when did you--did you get formal lessons or are you teaching yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah I got some formal lessons, but you know when I got my saxophone--I got my sax, I went in the bedroom, shut the door and I started playing and I was playing, playing, playing.  I mean, my mother had to call me, "Sonny [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins] time to eat."  I'm in there in heaven and that's been my experience all my life.  I could, I could be there forever and that's now, meaning a lot of times that's what I do.  I play a long, long time; I practice for hours and hours of playing.  So I just get into that zone, and it's a spiritual thing.  And that's what has carried me through my life, see?  Because then I was able to fight to unite the spiritual with having to be a human being here on the planet.  That gave me a, a way to join, what they call in yoga--they call that joining--yoga means to join.  So that gave me my way of life.  I just mentioned yoga 'cause--
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: --I got into it later.  But that playing--the saxophone was it for me.  That gave me my release and my life.  I was able to live this life on earth as a musician playing saxophone.
Story_ID: 589362
Speaker 1: So you said you did--well that experience when you first got it--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) was, was the transformative moment for you.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I didn't, I didn't even know, my mother [Valborg Solomon Rollins] had to call me, said, "Sonny [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins], come on, eat.  Dinnertime."  I'm in there in seventh heaven.  I didn't know where I was, I was in another place; I was in another world.  And that, that's the way I've been all my life with my music.  That's been my salvation.
Speaker 1: And then you did have some formal training.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. I did, I did some formal training.  I had various teachers around New York [New York] and, and like that.  But I was, I was very much self-taught, but I did have formal teachers, you know.
Speaker 1: And you also had great influences and connections with some of the greatest musicians from, from the very beginning of your life when you went to junior high school, where--Edward Stitt junior high school [I.S. 164 Edward W. Stitt School, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Right. Edward Stitt junior high school, right.
Speaker 1: And, and around that time was when Charlie Parker's music became important to you, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was in the '40s [1940s] so I forget when--in the early '40s [1940s], I think, was when Charlie Parker came on the scene, and, and he became our prophet.  And--but I had been into music before then.
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: But Charlie Parker was our prophet, you know.
Speaker 1: And so what was it about his music that inspired you?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, music is a funny thing, I don't know.  You can't put into words.  Now I'm going to have to blow my nose a little bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  When I first heard Charlie Parker, I didn't--I liked it but I didn't understand it, took me a while to understand it 'cause I was listening to Coleman Hawkins who was my idol.  And then Charlie Parker came along who was more like the prophet of our generation, and--
Speaker 1: And how was the sound different can you describe when, when you--
Speaker 2: Charlie Parker's sound?
Speaker 1: So you were listening to Coleman Hawkins.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You described him as your idol.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Talk to me about the Hawkins' sound and then Bird's sound.
Speaker 2: Well they are very similar in a way.  The more you live and experience life as I'm doing, I understand that there's not this differentiation between stuff.  I mean, I see the unity now in everything.  When I was twenty-five years old there's a big difference between Charlie Parker and Coleman Hawkins or bebop and old time jazz and all that.  But as I have grown, it's not--that difference doesn't exist really.  I mean, I see the unification.  But--so they are not that much different; they are not that much different.
Speaker 1: But it--back when you were just learning about them what did you think the differences were?  What was attracting you differently?  Let's say that?  What was the different attraction to Hawkins and then to Yardbird?
Speaker 2: Right.  Charlie Parker, Yardbird, well the difference was that I think was a generational difference.  Every generation has--they go by who the person is in their generation; that's just sort of a--the way people on this planet, planet--on this planet--absorb things.  Every generation has something different and so, so on and so forth.  So in many ways that was the difference.  Now as I said, it's very much all of a piece, you know.

Speaker 1: So as you are growing up, you, you go to Benjamin Franklin High School [Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Throughout your early education, what is your music education?  What are you learning?  Who are you meeting?
Speaker 2: Well, I consider myself a jazz prodigy because from a very age, this ties up with what--from around seven, eight years old and going back, I knew that I would be a prominent jazz musician.  I knew that from that early time.  Okay.  So by the time I began listening to Charlie Parker and of course we had our little band and all that stuff but I was always the--often I was always the leader.  I wasn't always the oldest guy, but they'd always make me the leader in the band, and not only that in other things too.  We had a stickball team and made me Sonny [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins] I'm the captain; guys in there three or four years older than me.  So I don't know what that's about.  That may be something inherent in my personality or something like that.  But your question was about--
Speaker 1: About the--yeah.
Speaker 2: Learning from these older guys.  Okay so outside of the little formal training and a lot of teachers, few--you know. I learned from these guys.  I was a quick study, and we, you know, in those days used to listen to records and slow the record down so we could get how the phrasing and how the guy was phrasing so we used to do that.  You know play the record and slow it down so you could exactly know how these musical patterns were being produced, you know.  So that was my thing.  I got--I did a lot of that and was able to really understand, assimilate that easily.  And as I got a little older I got to know some of these--well as a little boy I remember going to Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis' house from school.  I would go by there with my horn trying to wake him up so he could show me something.  Here's this guy that's been working in the club 'til probably--got home at five o'clock in the morning and here I'm at his house three o'clock in the afternoon this kid he's sitting with.  So I did that, so I was a pest.  But--
Speaker 1: But he taught you.
Speaker 2: Well Eddie didn't--he taught me but not--I could never get in to see him, I just couldn't get in.  He wouldn't answer the door.  But Denzil Best a drummer, I used to do that with him 'cause he used to play with Coleman Hawkins.  So Denzil--somehow I knew some people that knew him.  I'd know where he lived at so I would go by there, banging the door, man, that--I mean, not banging but I'd be ringing the bell over and over so finally he had to let this guy in.  So here's this young guy, you know.
Speaker 1: And you're a kid.
Speaker 2: I'm a kid.  I mean, at that, around that time I must have been fourteen or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're a teenager.
Speaker 2: Right, teenager, and--but they were all--.
Speaker 1: And while you were in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) good to me.
Story_ID: 589364
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) While you were in, while you were in high school, you--was that when you met Thelonious Monk?
Speaker 2: I met Thelonious Monk, yeah, during the time I was in high school.  There was my buddy who played trumpet, a fellow named Lowell Lewis, a fine trumpet player.  So Low got a job with Monk.  Monk had a--he needed a trumpet player and Monk hired Lowell Lewis, and they went out of town to Chicago [Illinois] for a week.  So we were both in high school then, we were both in Benjamin Franklin High School [Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, New York, New York] towards the end of our--maybe we're seniors at that point.  So Lowell said, "Oh Sonny [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins], I'm going to get you into Monk's band, you know.  You know, I'm going to find a way to maneuver you in and move out the saxophone player."  Now, I mean, it sounds sort of bad now when I think about it, you know (laughter).  But, you know, I was young and I wanted to play so he said, "You can play better than this guy." Said, "Come on--."  Anyway, I finally got into playing with Monk.  But I had met Monk earlier right around that period.  Monk was playing a job, (unclear) playing on Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard], some little club there and Monk was leading and we played like intermission, something like that.  So Monk heard me and I could tell Monk liked me, you know.  So that, that's my first encounter with Monk.  But then later I don't know whether he remembered that or not but later I got a chance to get in his band, you know.
Speaker 1: And about how old were you when that happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I must have been around eighteen, yeah seventeen--
Speaker 1: Just after high school.
Speaker 2: Seventeen, eight- right.  Right after high school at the end of high school, yeah.
Story_ID: 589365
Speaker 1: Now, I, I, I read a story about something that happened a little earlier in your childhood.  In addition to the music, you, you also got in trouble sometimes.  I read about you and your friends dropping mortar from the roofs of the building and that there was a--and that you--I read about you having spiritual turning point at that point.  Can you tell me about that story?
Speaker 2: Well you know this was when I was a little younger than that.
Speaker 1: Right.  About how old were you?
Speaker 2: Well I would say I must have been twelve, thirteen--twelve or thirteen.  This was when we moved on the hill--Sugar Hill and we moved up in 1939 so that was nine then, so I must have been ten or eleven, because it's--I hate to think I was old enough to do something that stupid.  But anyway there was, there was a shortcut, we lived on Edgecombe Avenue.  Edgecombe Avenue was here (indicates), it was right on the hill, so--
Speaker 1: And that's the highest point in New York [New York], isn't it?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Or Manhattan [New York]?
Speaker 2: It's going up to the highest point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's highest than lower Harlem [New York, New York] where I was born at.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: See, then you're going up on the hill when you're at Edgecombe Avenue.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And that goes all the way up and gets higher and higher.  And it's, it's called Washington Heights [New York, New York] at that point, so, you know.  But anyway so yeah that was a--I'm glad you brought that up, because I used to talk about that but you know I haven't talked about it recently.  Anyway, I was around eleven years old, and there was a shortcut between Edgecombe Avenue and St. Nicholas Place which was the next street.  It was a shortcut because St. Nicholas Place led to St. Nicholas Avenue and the subway and all that.  Edgecombe was sort of isolated; to get to Edgecombe you would have had to come all the way around 150th Street or up to 155th Street.  Edgecombe Avenue was one long block between 150th--okay so this was a shortcut, you could come take the subway, get off at 153rd Street and come under this shortcut, you know, between buildings, and get from St. Nicholas to Edgecombe Avenue, you understand what I mean, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I understand.  Yes I see it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 589366
Speaker 1: So okay there was--I didn't know if it's somebody involved, but I thought it was a brilliant idea--a joke you know, I like to joke.  They call me, they used to call me the jester, 'cause I was always making jokes, you now.  I was always the funny guy.  So anyway there was some mortar up on the top of one of the buildings that was on the--either side of this shortcut which was between buildings.  You'd have to go down in back of the buildings.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So in one of these building there was a mortar loose, you know the mortar from the roof which was loose.  So I got this idea maybe with somebody else aside me; I'd like to think that way.  There was somebody that said, "Oh man wouldn't it be funny that drop this down, somebody's walking through and bam and this thing falls next to him," you know, ha ha ha.  So I did--I was up there one time and I said, "Oh yeah here's a big heavy mortar now," and I see this guy coming through the shortcut so I dropped it down there, you know.  And then when I dropped it I realized oh shit this can kill this man, right. I realized it after I dropped it.  And I was--I did some heavy praying that time, I did some really deep praying and that praying--to get to pray at that level was something has carried me all through my life, really, 'cause I still pray.  And whenever I pray, I've reached--I know that time, I had reached a level of communication which was pretty deep, see?  And I was praying don't let this thing hit this guy 'cause if that hit him, he would have been dead.  It's some heavy mortar.  So I was praying and I was praying and I was praying and I was praying and I was praying, did some heavy praying.  And fortunately the guy passed, bang, it hit next to him.  So I--my prayers were answered, and I reached a point of communication with what we are praying to whatever it is, that whatever it is, I reached a--I communicated.  I communicated.
Speaker 2: And what happened after that for you?
Speaker 1: Well, no, nothing after--I mean, the guy must have said damn, you know, and went on, but--
Speaker 2: And you never did anything like that again?
Speaker 1: No, I'm not crazy and I didn't want to kill nobody. I wanted to make a joke, see?  So no that was--I mean who knows what end up in different ways but I didn't intend to kill anybody.  So that was something that was a big factor in my life as a human being.  I developed an insight into life at that point.
Story_ID: 589367
Speaker 1: How did that affect your work as a developing artist, musician?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, I was into music that didn't have anything to do with music as far as I know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was just playing in the street like a little ruffian.  So I don't know but I'm sure it's part of me, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, I guess what I'm thinking about is when you talk about the spiritual insight that you got and the depth that you went to in that moment, as a musician you, you are known for going into those spaces of depth.  But this is early. This is in the beginning of your career; I mean, you're still a child.  So I'm just wondering what's happening in your music as you are learning how to play and you're performing.  As you're learning--you create a band in high school [Benjamin Franklin High School; Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, New York, New York], you know, you're performing.  What's happening internally as you're developing yourself as an artist?
Speaker 2: Well, that's hard to say, because it wasn't long after that that we got involved in drugs and a lot of the pitfalls, so, you know.  But I feel definitely that this incident with the dropping this thing [mortar] was part of me.  I was--that, that was me.  I was born, and that was supposed to happen; that was my life.  That's who I was when I was born.  I always had a, have a sense of a spirit and, and a voice within me.  I always felt that when I was--so that was just me, and that I'm sure came out of my music how I don't know. I can't--
Speaker 1: That's all right.
Speaker 2: I have no way of trying to--people ask me, "Oh Sonny [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins--," I used to study yoga and I went to India one time.  People would say, "Well, gee Sonny, how did yoga help your music?"  Well, I don't know that, I was doing that to try to develop myself, you know.  So I don't know it helps my music or the affect, I don't know.  I have no way of knowing that but I'm sure it has.
Story_ID: 589368
Speaker 1: So let's talk for a minute about that period as a young man when, you know, a lot of people are getting into drugs at that time and you've been--you've talked about it publicly that became an issue for you.  On the music scene, there's a tremendous amount of drugs.  What--when did that occur and what happened in your life as a result of it?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, what happened was a lot of guys in our community, the jazz community, as I got older there was a lot of guys using drugs, because drugs was sort of our barrier against society, see?  And, and, and the music we were playing was sort of not accepted at that point anyway.  So it was our way of having our thing.  You know, and some of the great, great artist like Billie Holiday they just played a song by Billie Holiday this morning--wow what a, what a privilege it was for me to have known her, you know, and to have heard her but then I also had the extra blessing that I got to know her.  But she used drugs, Charlie Parker, every--Sonny Stitt, name them using drugs, everybody.  As I said it was our way of having something apart from a hostile society.  It wasn't us being hostile; it was a society being hostile to us, and this was our way of having our thing.  So anyway--
Speaker 1: And what were the popular drugs at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, the most popular drugs were, were heroin and cocaine.  Those were the drugs.  Those were the drugs of choice if I can say that, and that's what I got, I got involved with.  Heroin mainly was the one that gives you a habit, see.  And it's so funny now when I'm listening to the radio and hear about this drug epidemic all around with these young people using drugs, and oh it's an epidemic and how are we going to deal with a whole lot of kids using drugs.  And we have to find places and I listen to that, and I say wow back in my day, they'd have me in jail.  It wasn't any talking about oh gee how can we help these young people using drugs, see.  So I listen to that today and it's kind of amusing in a, in a sense because I say wow.  When I was using drugs, they'd throw you in the Tombs [Manhattan Detention Complex, New York, New York] and then in jail.
Speaker 1: That, that happen to you didn't it?
Speaker 2: That happened to me of course.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Of course, of course.  That happened to me.
Story_ID: 589369
Speaker 1: You, in 1950 when you were twenty you were arrested for armed robbery.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was that all part of the--
Speaker 2: That's all part of the drug thing, yeah.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and you spent time on Rikers Island [New York, New York].  You're a young man.
Speaker 2: I spent time--I spent time on Rikers Island and I was there for--I got a year, a year in jail.  Okay.  You do--I did a part of it ten months and then you get out on parole, you know.  And then, being out, I reverted to using drugs again and I had to go back for parole violation.  Back another three months in Rikers Island for drugs, and--
Speaker 1: How were you treated when you were on Rikers Island?
Speaker 2: Well, I was treated--you know what happened which was fortunate?  There were musicians that were in Rikers Island, so those were the guys--we had our little clique.  You know we used to play music for the Protestant Chapel [Protestant Mission House and Chapel, New York, New York] and all that. So we had our thing.
Speaker 1: So you were protected.
Speaker 2: I was protected, I was protected by my (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's very fortunate.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was great. And it, you know, I was--
Speaker 1: And were there drugs in jail?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  It may have been, but I didn't know.  They used to use nutmeg.  Nutmeg in a certain way would produce a hallucinatory thing and people would get nutmeg in jail and all that.  But any kind of other drugs like that was way beyond--you know, I'm sure it would have been a lot of money and everything.
Speaker 1: So given that you had been using and had a habit and go to jail for almost a year and not have drugs, how--I mean, did you go through withdrawals, did they--what happened?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, definitely a year I went through withdrawal, of course.
Speaker 1: Right.  Did they have medical people to support you?
Speaker 2: No, no, not in Rikers Island.  Rikers Island is a penitentiary, so that's--you don't get that there.
Story_ID: 589370
Speaker 1: What happened, though, was after my second time in Rikers Island [New York, New York], I realized--well, I've said--I've told this story so much I don't know whether it's--I mean, really you need to hear that again.
Speaker 2: This, this is your record so you should share it.
Speaker 1: Well yeah but I've said this a lot.  I was making a record with Charlie Parker and Charlie Parker thought that I was okay, 'cause I had been in the penitentiary.  And so he said, "Oh man, I heard you're straight."  And he was so happy 'cause that was his--that was his bane of his existence.  That all of his young followers were following him into using drugs.  That's what killed him, and he was just didn't know quite what to do about it.  So we had this record date, and I had just come back from this second trip to Rikers Island and something, I said, "Oh yeah I'm straight."  I told Bird, "Yeah man I'm--," and boy he was--you should have seen the look on his face and how happy he was, how happy he was, man, that I got away from drugs.  So unfortunately I was lying, because the night before I was using drugs with some of the guys on the record date, and while we were doing something they ratted on me.  Told, "Oh, oh, Sonny [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins], man Sonny was out getting high with us last night, man, he lying, man."  And after Bird found that out man you should have seen the look on his face.  The look on his--he was like destroyed, and when I saw that, I said, "Oh shit, I've got to get away from drugs."  And at that time the only people I had was my mother [Valborg Solomon Rollins] who would always be there for me.  And, you know, my family, they didn't--my mother stayed because I was doing--I was a pariah.  People would see me walking down the street and they'd say--they'd cross the street, get out--they didn't want to deal with me.  I don't want to go through all of the insane stuff that you do for drugs, but that's what I was doing.  So anyway, I realized at that point that wow I've got to, I've got to get away from drugs.  I was sort of beginning to realize that anyway but not really.  The lure of the lure of drugs was too strong.  So anyway I saw that, and I said to myself I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this for my mother let my mother see.  My father [Walter Rollins], he was--he had gotten out of the [U.S.] Navy but he sort of knew that I was running amok so he didn't know what to do with me.  But my mother, I wanted to, to, to get straight for my mother, you know.  I had alien- alienated everybody else as I told you I didn't have no friends, I didn't have nothing.  People would see me coming and they'd, let's get (unclear), see Sonny--here comes Sonny Rollins, man, you know.  Max [Max Roach] told me to stay--, "If you come to New York [New York] stay away from Fats Navarro, Charlie Parker and Sonny Rollins."  They'd tell these young musicians coming to New York.  "Stay away from those guys, man."  So that's how I was into it, I was lost.  So anyway after this incident happened at the record recording which was a great privilege to play with the great Charlie Parker, so I said, "Okay I've got to get away from this."  So there was a place called Lexington [United States Narcotic Farm, Lexington, Kentucky].  Lexington was a federal narcotics facility.  It was something like what the Betty Ford clinic was some years later.  You know there were celebrities, everybody that used drugs they went there to wean themselves off of drugs.
Story_ID: 589371
Speaker 1: So you were telling me about the, the hospital where you went.
Speaker 2: Lexington, Kentucky [United States Narcotic Farm, Lexington, Kentucky].  So this was a very--a lot of actors, movie stars, everybody, you know, went there.
Speaker 1: And at this point in your career, you're known already as an--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You're coming; you're performing so people know you as a jazz artist.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah. I was known.  I was known.  I was known.
Speaker 1: So you're one of those people there, the actors, musicians you're among them.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  But as a black jazz musician so they were not allowed to be an artist, a musician.  See they had to go to the penitentiary that was the system ran at that time.  So Lexington was a unique place.  It took in artists like jazz musicians and so forth.  And there were a lot of people, I remember--remember the actor Peter Lorre?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: He was there, Peter Lorre was, was, was at Lexington and there's probably others that--but he came up, 'cause I saw an ar- I didn't even know he had spent time there, but I saw an article where they said [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins and Peter Lorre, I said wow I didn't know he was there.  But, of course, they had to bust me, but that's okay.  Anyway--
Speaker 1: So this is in 1955?
Speaker 2: This was in 1955 yeah.
Speaker 1: You're twenty-five years old.  And I read that this was when they first started experimenting with methadone?
Speaker 2: Well they had something at that time, Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole], that they called dolophine and dolophine might have been the precursor to methadone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you went in there in Lexington and you took the cure and I think the cure was four and a half months.  You had to be in Lexington for four and a half months, and dolophine was the drug that they broke you off of the habit with, you know.
Speaker 1: And you stayed the whole time?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. No, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: At this point after you had seen Charlie Parker's face, and something happened in you and you decided it's time, you were committed.
Speaker 2: Right. I could see that.  I mean I would have to be somebody that was--I would, I would have to be like a heathen to not recognize what he felt, you know.  You'd have, I mean, you know, of course it was obvious.
Speaker 1: But at the same time, he wasn't able to kick it.
Speaker 2: He couldn't kick it, no.  That's why he was so distressed because he couldn't get off of it and he thought, here's Sonny, amen that.  I said, "Yeah brother," and he was so happy.  Oh man, he mad. But very few people were getting away from heroin at that time, very few people.  Most guys ended up destroying their life, dying from an overdose or something like that, or just destroying their life, you know.
Speaker 1: And your life had gotten to a low point at, at--before you walked in.
Story_ID: 589372
Speaker 1: What happened while you were there?  What was the change that made you able to stay clean?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Well, after--so I stayed in Lexington [United States Narcotic Farm, Lexington, Kentucky] for the full time, four and a half months during which time Charlie Parker left us.  And boy I was waiting to see--boy, wait 'til I see Bird and let him know that I got his message, and I was so happy, but it wasn't to be.  But I'm sure in another world he'll know that people got his message.  But anyway, so after I got out of there okay, so I was in Chicago [Illinois].  I had went from Lexington [Kentucky] to Chicago.  I was working on a job playing in Chicago.  Chicago is like my second home, by the way.  I had some good friends out there, some good musician friends.  Family, I stayed with a family out there and I love Chicago.  Chicago was really, you know, just, I just loved Chicago.  Anyway so I came back out from Lexington, I went to Chicago, you know, to kind of get myself together.  So then I said oh wow this is it now.  I have to be out here and I have to be--I have to break this habit now.  Nobody around, I'm not in jail, I'm not in Lexington and no place and it's up to me.  So I said okay but I'm going to do it.  So I proceeded to get a lot of menial jobs, you know, and (laughter) (unclear).  I got one job which was--I was a janitor in this place.  It was a place where they fixed typewriters.  It was about ten guys in there fixing typewriters, and I was like the janitor, you know.  So I was there, I think they called me Wally see 'cause my name is Walter [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins] so that--Wally, so that's me, Wally.  But I used to put up signs on the wall saying please be--please don't throw your paper towels on the floor, please, do--you know, stuff like that.  So I'm sure that Mr. Davis [ph.] said, "Gee who is this guy?"  But anyway I got--they liked me okay so that was that place.  So then I went to another place, I was working on a delivery truck.  We used to deliver restaurant supplies and I worked there for a while, you know, and, and--
Speaker 1: Why did you not go back to music right away?
Speaker 2: Well because I was afraid that I wasn't strong enough to be around drugs and the guys were still using (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you knew they were going to be there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It took me a while before I felt strong enough to go by the nightclub where I used to work at (unclear).  See, it took me a while after I was working on these, as I said, but naturally I wanted to go there that was, you know, that is my life. That's the--
Story_ID: 589373
Speaker 1: So I worked at these various jobs until I felt, okay gee Sonny [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins] now you're ready to go by the club.  It was a club called the Beehive [Beehive Lounge, Chicago, Illinois].  So I said okay let me go by there.  So I went by there one night, "Hey Sonny, how you doing man? Hey, man, I ain't seen blah, blah blah.  Hey man I've got some good chuff.  I've got some good stuff, man, come on."  And that's what I was afraid of, that was going to happen.  So that's when I, that's when I got into the rubber hits the road or whatever they say.  That's when it was--that's when I had to fight see 'cause then I was beginning to get that urge.  And these guys were here offering me stuff, you know, and I was back in my element, see.  And my work has a different element.  Now I'm back in my element with all my buddies.  "Hey Sonny come on man, I've got some good stuff man. Come--," you know.  Okay, so I was fighting; I had to fight and, you know, my hands got sweaty, you know, whatever.  So a while I went through this and finally I said, "Okay let me get out of here."  So I said, "Okay man, see you cats later, man."  And I got out, went back, got back into my life of being an honest person doing a day job.  Okay, that was the first time.  So, (makes sound), wow I made it.  Okay, so then I had to do it again, had to go back to the club so I went back to the club.  It was still hard.  Those guys there saying, "Hey Sonny come on man let's go, come on man."  And so I fought it off.  It was a little better.  I was a little better than the first time, a little stronger, little stronger.  So I got out and said, "Okay man see you cats."  A little stronger. Okay.  Okay I went back to my life; I said okay let me try it again.
Speaker 2: So were you performing or were you just there?
Speaker 1: No, no, no I was working on a day job.
Speaker 2: I know--
Speaker 1: I was just going there like one night to get back and see the cats, and, you know, and--
Speaker 2: You were stopping by.
Speaker 1: Just stopping by because that's where I'm going to end up being, that's my life.
Speaker 2: Right. So you're kind of testing it out.
Speaker 1: Testing it out, exactly.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That was a test.  The first test and this was a second test.
Speaker 2: And you survived.
Speaker 1: I got--it was a little better the second time.
Story_ID: 589374
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Mr. Rollins [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins], where is your horn all this time?  Are you playing, are you listening?
Speaker 2: Where was my horn?  I had a horn.  I don't know, it probably was--I had a horn.  I was staying at several places and I had friends in Chicago [Illinois], very close friends.  If I needed a horn, I could get a horn to play.  So I don't know if I had a horn myself, but if I needed a horn, I could get a horn.  So I can't say I had a horn.  I don't remember having, but I had access to a horn.
Speaker 1: Some people say that when they get clean, whatever it is that they do they can't do it first.  Did you have that experience?
Speaker 2: What, what, what do you mean?
Speaker 1: Not--I mean you're a horn player were you able to play right after you got clean?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, oh, okay.  Okay so let's see how this happened now.  As I began--now that was the second time, I was a little better.  The third time I went to the club [Beehive Lounge, Chicago, Illinois], I really felt it, said yeah, I got it, I got it.  I got it whipped, see.  And I was so--still careful, because it's a strong attraction but then I began to play.  But okay I was staying at a whole lot of different places.  I stayed with my friend house, a beautiful family there, gospel singers, the Gay Sisters [Geraldine Gay, Evelyn Gay, and Mildred Gay].  They were a gospel group from Alabama and their son [sic. brother] was a trumpet player.  They called him Little Diz [Robert Gay], but so he, he and I were tight.  In fact we went to Lexington [United States Narcotic Farm, Lexington, Kentucky] together and all this stuff.  Anyway and I stayed there so I was staying at different places, working these menial jobs.  By the way did that answer your question about the horn?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):   Yeah, just, because I didn't know when you were separated from it and if you were able to--when you stopped playing and when you started up again.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--I always had access to have a horn 'cause I was Sonny Rollins.  All these guys would--they wouldn't let me take their home with them no 'cause they probably wouldn't ever see it again but--
Speaker 1: But your horn you didn't have anymore?
Speaker 2: My horn.  God, my horn--there was no one horn that I had all the way through these experiences.  There was no one horn that I had through these experiences.
Speaker 1: When did you pick the horn back up and start playing it?
Speaker 2: Okay, now--okay so I was getting--feeling I was a stronger, I could go back to these clubs and haunts, my old--
Story_ID: 589375
Speaker 1: Okay, so I think I was staying at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], and it was very, a very famous YMCA that I think was 43rd Street [sic.].  There--it was, it was a YMCA which was involved with a lot of the civil rights activities in Chicago [Illinois]; it was famous for being involved.  Anyway so I stayed there and they had a--had in the basement a piano and stuff so I used to practice down there.  Now I don't know the horn that I got, but I had a horn so I was able while I was staying at the Y, I practiced downstairs in the room they had there.  This fellow, the young trumpet player, Booker Little, who passed on very early on, he used to come over there with me.  We used to practice down there together.  I had some other musicians who used to play down there.  So that was a nice situation while I was there.  So, but I moved (unclear), but I had several places I lived that in Chicago.  But that was good because they would practice--
Speaker 2: At the Y.
Speaker 1: --at the Y downstairs.  And you know what I used to eat?  I used to--my, my, my meal--I used buy a loaf of whole wheat bread, I used to get Oscar Mayer--
Speaker 2: Hot dog?
Speaker 1: No, no, no not the hot dogs.  The stuff--
Speaker 2: Like bologna?
Speaker 1: Yeah, like bologna, but what's the--liverwurst.
Speaker 2: Ah, yes
Speaker 1: Liverwurst.  So okay I'd get my thing, get my liverwurst and I'd get these--tomato juice.  They had these (unclear) tomato juices, these little cans.  So I got as much of those as I could--the cans 'cause then I could keep them in my room and for dinner I'd get my liverwurst, Oscar Mayer liverwurst, I'd get a loaf of whole wheat bread, you know.  So that was my--that was it and that was cool for me.  I don't eat a lot of food (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was this when you were living with Booker Little?
Speaker 1: Well I wasn't living with Booker.  Booker Little used to come to--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --practice with me at the Y.  Right.  But that's when I was at the Y.  I was, I was living at the Y.
Story_ID: 589376
Speaker 1: When did you begin to--when did you join the bla- the band with Max Roach and Clifford Brown [Clifford Brown and Max Roach Quintet]?
Speaker 2: Okay now that ties right into this as a--so far I'm going pretty good chronologically.  Maybe you're helping me do that.  So, okay, so I'm going back to the club.  The club is the Beehive club [Beehive Lounge, Chicago, Illinois] and--more and more because I'm stronger now I can go by.  So I went by, I was there one night and I've known Max Roach from New York [New York] and Richie Powell, Bud's [Bud Powell] younger brother, and they were playing, they were playing there.  So their saxophone player, very fine saxophone player, Harold Land, his wife was pregnant and they're from California.  So he had to go back to California with his wife, and they were out on the road, the band.  In those days it was not that nice being out on the road 'cause when I joined the band, I mean, we had to stay in some funky hotels.
Speaker 1: This was the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: This is in '50s [1950s] now, right.  Well that's when I got out of Lexington [United States Narcotic Farm, Lexington, Kentucky] in '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So I'm saying its segregation, Jim Crow, this is at that period (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah it was rampant.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You couldn't stay in the decent hotels although I did it one time in Cleveland [Ohio].  There was a hotel called the Olmsted Hotel [Hotel Olmsted, Cleveland, Ohio] and the band was always traveling by car.  You know, you've got the bass--the big bass in there, Max, me, Richie, the bass player everybody in a car.  So anyway we got to Cleveland one time and there was one hotel that I'd stayed in with those cats in Cleveland man that was the funkiest hotel I've ever stayed in my life, and I've stayed in some funky hotels.  But this one was so bad that I wrote a song 'Funky Hotel Blues' about that hotel.  But so anyway we're in Cleveland, and I said, so I said, "Man let's try to stay somewhere downtown."  I said, "Let me go in this hotel, Olmsted Hotel looked like someplace where I might be able to--."  Anyway the guys said no so I said, "Let me go, I'll go. You cats wait in the car, let me go in there and see if I can, you know, they'll accept us staying here."  Anyway, sure enough they said, "Yeah okay, there's a--." It's a band of musicians and they said, "Okay fine," and we stayed at the Olmsted Hotel, man, and it was really great.  I mean, guys had a chance and stay in a decent room, and get some room service and all this stuff.  I remember my steak.  You know, that's when I was eating meat.  I got a nice big fat, what was it, tenderloin steak?  I forgot what it was but, you know, and it was nice, bathroom, I mean, you know, just a decent room which everybody else would take for granted.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Story_ID: 589377
Speaker 1: Now, at--in your terms of your performances 'cause you're, you're playing with Max Roach and--
Speaker 2: Clifford Brown (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's his--it's their band [Clifford Brown and Max Roach Quintet], right?
Speaker 2: Clifford Brown.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  But I think he missed the part 'cause he was just talking about the sax player [Harold Land] whose wife was pregnant and they had to go, but we didn't catch up with how (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oh okay.  Sorry.
Speaker 1: We did.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he went back, he had to go back--
Speaker 1: We did.
Speaker 2: --and therefore I--they asked me to join the band.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that's how I joined Max Roach and Clifford Brown.
Speaker 1: I'd like you to talk about playing with them, performing with them.  What, what, what is--what are you performing?   Where are you performing? What's the music like?
Speaker 2: Well, the music was great.  The music was great.  It's Max Roach and Clifford Brown, I mean, it was one of the best bands around at that time.
Speaker 1: Are you, are you performing particular pieces? Is this improv at this point?  Is it a combination?
Speaker 2: Well, they had their repertoire which I had to learn that, you know.  They had their, their hits--they had some hits so I had to learn all the music.  I had some original music which I introduced with them.  They were--took it on.  So it was a nice fit, you know.
Speaker 1: And where are you performing, what are some of the venues?
Speaker 2: Well in Chicago [Illinois] was the Beehive [Beehive Lounge] where they were at, and wow, where was--well, there was a circuit of jazz clubs, you know, where the guys played at.  In Cleveland [Ohio], in Detroit [Michigan], Cincinnati [Ohio], all of the cities had a jazz club where the jazz musicians would play at, the well known bands.  So I don't recall them by name, but we played with them (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you, you played with them until the accident?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  Yeah, no, we were (unclear).  Oh, man, it was a beautiful time in my life and we came to New York [New York].  We played in New York and Brownie, Clifford Brown, who was a great musician, really a legendary figure, he and I were getting tight, you know, really musically, we were getting to phrase together.  Everything was--took a while, we we're really getting together, and we became close friends because I admired him; he never used drugs.  He was one of these guys--unusual jazz musician who didn't use drugs.  He was able to live a life without drugs.  So boy I admired that 'cause that's where I wanted to be like that.
Speaker 1: And so how much rehearsing are you doing in between your sets?
Speaker 2: Well we rehearsed a lot because I had to learn a lot of their music.  So we'd be, we'd be rehearsing as much as possible.
Speaker 1: As you're travelling where are these rehearsals occurring?
Speaker 2: Well, they'd, they'd, they'd be in the club.  We'd get there early enough to do a long sound check or something like that or we'd go by there in the daytime to rehearse, and sometimes we'd rehearse right in the hotel.  You know, we'd go over stuff right in the hotel, the hotel we were staying at.
Speaker 1: And about how long were you on the road with them?
Speaker 2: I, I joined them in '55 [1955], and then I was on the road with them until the accident, you know, which was in '56 [1956] I believe.  I'm not sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It is.
Story_ID: 589378
Speaker 1: What happened to them?
Speaker 2: Well, there's a beautiful documentary out about Clifford Brown ['Brownie Speaks, A Video Documentary: The Life, Music, and Legacy of Clifford Brown'].  I saw it a few months ago; I don't know why it's not getting more exposure and more praise, you know.  Anyway, he was accident prone, because Clifford had a--was in an accident--car accident and he was unable to walk (unclear) for a long time.  He was just lying down on a couch playing, and playing his trumpet.  Okay now that's sort of something which was hanging over him that thing, you know, the dark cloud. And Clifford, according to this documentary which is really fantastic--so Clifford knew--what happened was Max [Max Roach], myself and George Morrow, a bass player, we were in New York [New York].  Clifford is from Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], right around--he's from Wilmington [Delaware], right, and Richie is from Philly.  So they were down there, we were going to leave at different times to get to California where the next job was.  No wrong, sorry, the next job was Chicago [Illinois], Chicago again.  That was our next job, Chicago.  So they were going to drive, I think Brownie had just got this new car, new Buick a nice car and all this.  So him, Richie Powell and Richie Powell's wife, who was a Caucasian girl by the way.
Speaker 1: Nancy [Nancy Powell].
Speaker 2: Is that her name?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  They were going to drive from Philly and we were going to meet in Chicago, 'cause Max and I and George driving from New York.  So I mentioned she was Caucasian, because the particulars about the accident had never been, you know, nobody really knows what happened.  See, it could have been something that maybe had a racial component to it, I don't know.  You know, but that was in the '50s [1950s] and it was a white woman and, you know, these two black guys, who knows.  Anyway, before Brownie left Philly--Brownie, that's Clifford Brown--he had told his father that, "Gee man I don't feel too good, I really don't feel like going to Chicago, drive to Chicago," you know.  But they knew that he had a work ethic which was paramount, I mean, I've got to do it, I don't feel like doing it man, I don't feel like making this drive, and sure enough it was raining and that's all we know.  There was some accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  So Max, I and George Morrow, we're in New York, New York--in Chicago. We got to Chicago, and we're waiting for Brownie and them to get there and boy, what a, what a--when we found that out that was like--that was quite a blow to everybody.
Speaker 1: All three of them passed.
Speaker 2: All three of them.
Story_ID: 589379
Speaker 1: Such a young star, I mean it was like a young angel.  Everybody, everybody loved Brownie.  I mean he was just a shining star, young guy.  I think he's twenty-five years old maybe.
Speaker 2: And what happened to the group after that?
Speaker 1: Oh, what happened to the group after that?  Well are we back on?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well after that, we got over--that was, oh man we were crying like babies, I remember at this friend's, a prophet--painter, the Prophet [Richard Jennings], from Detroit [Michigan].  We're at prophet's house and man and we were crying like babies, Max [Max Roach] and George [George Morrow], just crying like a baby, all of us for the longest time.  Anyway, so that happened okay.  So what happened after that?  So we had to accept that and go on.  So Max then got a au- auditions for somebody who could take Clifford Brown's place.  It's hard to do 'cause Clifford was nonpareil, but anyway we went through a lot of trumpet players, Donald Byrd.  Let's see, who else was there?  Anyway we ended up with Kenny Dorham, all fine trumpet players.  So that became the band and we had to get another piano player, and I forgot who we got.  I forgot because we got several--what's the word--it's a written one--with several--
Speaker 2: Auditions?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's several groups--with several groups.
Story_ID: 589380
Speaker 1: Now, while you're doing that, you also made an album, that you--the 'Saxophone Colossus'?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Wasn't that during that same period?
Speaker 2: The 'Saxophone Colossus' was in 1957 [sic. 1956] so that was--
Speaker 1: Okay it's a little bit later.
Speaker 2: That's later.
Speaker 1: Was that the first album that you made the 'Saxophone Colossus' or had you made albums before that?
Speaker 2: You mean--
Speaker 1: You.
Speaker 2: No I made plenty of albums before that, sure.
Speaker 1: Before that.  So all along you're making albums as you are performing with Max Roach and others?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but you see when I went to Lexington [United States Narcotic Farm, Lexington, Kentucky] as you mentioned before, I was already known in the jazz circles.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I made my first jazz album in 1949.
Speaker 1: What was that called?
Speaker 2: That was with Babs Gonzales on Capitol Records.  It was Babs Gonzalez was like a hip hop singer back then, and that was my first record.  Also in 1949 I made a record with the great Bud Powell and the great Fats Navarro.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: Roy Haynes on drums.  Nineteen fifty [1950], I think around then--now my timing may be a little bit off, but I made--I had my first record in my own name.  See, those records I was with--
Speaker 1: Other--right.
Speaker 2: --those other people.  So around 1950, 1950 I made 'Sonny Rollins'; I was making my own records at that time as leader.  So, yeah, so all through that time up to '55 [1955], I was already--I had made a record with Miles Davis using a lot of my compositions in 1953 for his record with Miles ['Miles Davis with Sonny Rollins'], a recording with Miles.
Story_ID: 589381
Speaker 1: Playing with Miles [Miles Davis]--describe your experience of working him.
Speaker 2: Well Miles was like--I always liked Miles' playing.  He was my favorite out of the trumpet players, all of the great guys that were playing.  Maybe Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie] was in a class different, but of all the other guys, I always liked Miles' playing.  But it was great, Miles, and, you know, we got to be friends.  He used to come by my house up on Edgecombe Avenue [New York, New York]; we used to hang out and all that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, he was considered at least from the outside as being very temperamental.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What was the experiences playing with him and connecting with him as an artist?
Speaker 2: As an artist Miles is just trying to learn like everybody else was.  Miles didn't have it--it wasn't like he was some kind of--see this is the misconception people had about Miles.  But he wanted to, he wanted to have that image and so that's--guys would say wow Miles Davis thinks he's this and that.  Miles would turn his back on the people to play.  And people would say look at this arrogant guy and wow, boy, Miles--.  Miles would do that 'cause he was being shy; that's why he was doing that.  You know, he was being--he was trying to work something out on the trumpet, people would think oh boy what an arrogant guy. So that's some--that's something which is not really--
Speaker 1: That's why I was asking you as an artist working with him, what was the experience (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, no, no, no--he was, you know, a great musician and it's all about music.  If he could play that's, that's, that's it, you know.
Story_ID: 589382
Speaker 1: Now, during this period you married a woman named Dawn Finney.  She was a actress and model, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: She was--I see her on the cover of Jet and Sepia.  She was a popular model at the time?
Speaker 2: Well she was--she modeled and she did a movie--at least one movie, and she was a dancer.  She danced with the Lester Horton company [Lester Horton Dancers], which was a very popular dance company at the time.  And she was good friends with Miles' [Miles Davis] wife.  I think they might have both been in the Lester Horton company.
Speaker 1: Cicely [Cicely Tyson]?
Speaker 2: No, not Cicely, Frances [Frances Taylor Davis].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know Frances? Frances might have been portrayed in this movie they had about Miles ['Miles Ahead'], I don't know.  Anyway so--
Speaker 1: How long were you married?
Speaker 2: Well we weren't married too long, unfortunately, you know.  I'm not proud of that period in my life.  We were both young, and she was a wonderful, wonderful woman and so--not--we weren't married long.  She came--I brought her to New York [New York], we were living in New York together, and then we broke up.  She went back to California.
Story_ID: 589383
Speaker 1: During this period you're making a lot of music.  You know there's many albums that you're--well, records that you're producing at this time.  But also you become known for turning some songs into improve like 'There's No Business Like Show Business' the way you do it, and you become very popular for kind of making your own twists and turns for these popular songs.  What attracted you to that music that wasn't really jazz music but you made it jazz?
Speaker 2: Right, well you see, Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole], what happened is that as a boy growing up, remember I told you we went to the movies a lot, listened to the radio a lot, and that's where I heard all these songs.  You know I heard--I came from--I had--it was so lucky, my gro- I heard everything.  We even used to listen to the 'Grand Ole Opry' every week when they ca- .  So I heard everything, I heard a lot of these songs which I later made like 'I'm an Old Cowhand' and all that stuff.  And all of those songs were songs that I heard growing up, you know.  So they were just material that I felt like I could turn into expressions of myself, but that's where they came from.  I'd heard them all my life.  So it's nothing for me to play 'There's No Business Like Show Business' and all that.  I had heard that all my life.
Speaker 1: And yet it's a departure from the music that you had been developing over time or was it?
Speaker 2: Well, I couldn't think--I don't think it was a departure, I think it was just like calypso.  I mean, I didn't play calypso when I first came on the jazz scene 'cause I had to be a jazz player.  I can't play calypso.  When I went to play with Monk [Thelonious Monk] or whoever it was and I can't say, "Oh I'm playing calypso."  They would say, "Well, go back and play calypso man; you're not a jazz player."  So I had to play jazz 'cause that's what the name of jazz played, but I had all these background influences.  So it was not--it's easy for me to play 'There's No Business Like Show Business' or calypso tunes, I mean it was nothing for me, it was all part of my DNA, musical DNA.
Story_ID: 589384
Speaker 1: And as you are accessing these other parts of your musical DNA, you create 'Freedom Suite.'
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's, that's part--this is in 1958 now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about 'Freedom Suite,' please.
Speaker 2: Well 'Freedom Suite' was the one that probably has--distinguishes me in many ways.  I'm so glad I did that, because it was a jazz protest--it was protest music.  And I was able to do protest music, because my [maternal] grandmother [Miriam Hanson] was what you would call today an activist, okay. She was into Marcus Garvey; she was into Paul Robeson; she was into W.E.B. Du Bois, activism.
Speaker 1: And you used to spend a lot of time with her when you were growing up.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  I used to be out marching down Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard, New York, New York] in these protest marches for injustices happening down south.  You know, I never forget--
Speaker 1: As a boy.
Speaker 2: Yeah as a boy, as a little, little boy, my grand--I had to hold my grandmother's hand walking down the street in a parade. You know, "Free Tom Mooney and the Scottsboro Boys."  The Scottsboro Boys were some black guys they wanted to lynch for some white trashy woman that claimed they did something to her.  And, and there was this guy Tom Mooney who was a guy from New York [New York], a lawyer who had enough conscience and enough, enough, enough humanity, enough gullions to go down there and face these racist guys down south and defend the Scottsboro Boys, Tom Mooney [sic.].  So I remember that 'cause that was the song we used to sing as we're marching up and down Lenox Avenue.  (Chants) Free Tom Mooney and the Scottsboro Boys, free Tom Mooney--.  There was--you dig, so that's how I came up, that was my upbringing.  I was brought up in an activist family.  And that's nothing new for me and Nigeria we talked about that earlier.  One of the songs I made with Miles [Miles Davis] back in the early '50s [1950s] was Nigeria spelled backwards, "Airegin."
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I saw some pictures of Africa, of Nigeria, and I felt it was time for black people to not feel embarrassed or, you know, ashamed of Africa, you know.  So I said okay I'm going to do that but that was okay, I wanted to be slick about it.  Maybe I felt I had to be slick about it.  Anyway, I named it backwards Nigeria, "Airegin," and all my early work was in that vein.  I mean, a lot on my earliest--'74 [1974], I did the 'Freedom Suite' in 1957, 1958, this was early 1950s.
Story_ID: 589385
Speaker 1: So when I did the 'Freedom Suite' it was, it was a groundbreaker see, because the 'Suite'--the three part suite, it was--and I wrote something on the back, see.  I wrote it--I composed it, it took me a long time and I'm, I'm juggling with the syntax and how to get all this.  I got that.  I wrote it about the treatment of blacks--
Speaker 2: So it was direct.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, no, that's why I wrote it.  How--about what a shame there was all this culture that the society is absorbing and using as their own.  I mean, and coming from black people and what a--how ironic that we're getting treated this way.  No, it was, it was, you know, that was it.  I wrote that, it was written there, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was on the back of the album cover.
Speaker 1: It was on the back of the album cover.
Speaker 2: And how did people react to that?
Speaker 1: Well (laughter) how did people react to that?  Well, I got pushback. The guy that did it--the producer, a guy named Orrin Keepnews--he, he got so much pushback from his colleagues in the industry that he had to claim that he wrote this thing.  You know, later on he had to say no I wrote--it was a shame that they--I got push back 'cause well it wasn't that much work anyway.  That didn't boycott--I got boycotted later.  I don't think it had to do with that, it might have, but when I was playing in the South one time, I was playing down in Virginia, we had a seminar.  I was on tour with a big multiracial group.  So we're in the college there and these guys, so confronted me, "Well why did you write the 'Freedom Suite,' and what do you mean by that and blah, blah, blah?"  So that's one thing that happened. The other thing that people didn't like that.  That was a groundbreaker; I had people that didn't like that in the business, you know. So I experienced some, some pushback.
Speaker 2: Because you were making it in a direct commentary about race relations?
Speaker 1: In the 1950s. That was 1957; it was--it came out in February 1958 but I wrote it in '57 [1957] so I mean it was right in the middle of the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Sure.  And who else is on that album with you?
Speaker 1: Max Roach and Oscar Pettiford.
Speaker 2: Are they getting pushback as well?
Speaker 1: I don't know if they are or not.  In those days, I don't think there was pushback because it was [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins, I was the leader.  They didn't--I didn't--in those days it wasn't about who the sidemen were so I don't think, you know, they had any problem of that.
Speaker 2: So your consciousness is--you had it in you as a boy but now you're articulating it a lot more directly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 589386
Speaker 1: Another thing that you do shortly thereafter is in your appearance.  And you, you decide to wear a Mohawk--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the next year I think after that album comes out which is a dramatic statement.
Speaker 2: It was a statement.
Speaker 1: And what statement were you trying to make?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a statement that--I was trying to make a statement about the Native American people.  They are treated the same way and just about injustice in general, injustice in general.  So that--it fell into that.  I was thinking about Native Americans when I started to wear the Mohawk, but it--it's the same deal of trying to make a protest statement, protest music, see?  And there was a story I just recently--boy I got so mad at these people, I wrote the editor and had to--there was something in a recent jazz magazine [Down Beat] that they had this thing out on protest music.  They had two guys, one guy had a Mohawk very similar, and this guy in this story he didn't even mention me.  He mentioned the first protest record was Louis Armstrong and "What Did I Be So Black and Blue" [sic. "(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue"] which was an Andy Razaf song, Louis did that.  So that could be seen, although marginally, marginally.  It was--makes you think it was a social statement but it wasn't a real protest.  Okay, so this guy says oh that's when--then came Billie Holiday "Strange Fruit."  Well, that's a protest record.  So okay then he went up to another thing and left me out completely.  The next protest--jazz protest album was [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins' 'Freedom Suite' in 1958, February 1958 in which I wrote something on the back.  So it was no, it was no--
Speaker 1: No gray area.
Speaker 2: There was no gray, and it was no mistaking what that 'Freedom Suite' was about 'cause I wrote that as well as the, as the music.  I wrote something about what that was about, a criticism of American society.

Speaker 1: As you're becoming increasingly more political in your music, how--what's happening, what, what's happening with your career?  Because some--that can--you said there was some blackballing when, when did that occur?
Speaker 2: That--well I was getting blackballing, because I was a guy that (laughter), I would, you know, I'd want more money than I was originally scheduled to get and I realized I should have asked for more.  So I mean, I was doing a lot of things like that which, you know, so I wasn't, you know, I wasn't a complacent person, you know.  So I was activist in many ways and some of that was not--I remember this thing about--I remember I demanded more money and something, and so then okay we'll blackball you and you won't work, and I missed a lot of gigs--
Speaker 1: Is that when you decided to take a sabbatical?
Speaker 2: No my sabbatical had nothing to do with that not directly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, the first sabbatical that I took was when I was in trouble in the penitentiary [Rikers Island, New York, New York] that was in '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Forty-nine [1949], '50 [1950], '51 [1951] and then '53 [1953].  So some people look back at that and say, "Oh he was on the scene and then he was off."  So they said that's a sabbatical.  Well, in a sense it was, but anyway my next real sabbatical was 1959, and it didn't have anything to do with the--you know, I wasn't trying to make any statement.  I was just making my own personal sabbatical.
Speaker 1: Which is--for some people that would be a scary thing to do because you're doing very well in your career--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and then you're stepping off.
Speaker 2: I know people told me that.  They told me, "Oh man, Sonny [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins], don't do that.  Man they'll forget about you man, you know.  Don't leave the scene," you know.  But so anyway I never had--I always had confidence in myself that I could whatever I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: What made you decide to take a sabbatical, what happened?
Speaker 2: I wasn't playing enough music.  I wasn't playing enough music.  I told you before that I was a person that was always practicing, always playing, always practicing.  Okay, so around this '59 [1959] they are building me up, oh Sonny Rollins, Sonny, Sonny.  So I said to myself well wait a minute I'm not able to do what I want to do with my horn, so I'm going to take a sabbatical, practice some stuff, get a little more command of what I want to do and then I'll come back.  So that's all it was about.  And I hadn't--there was no--I didn't think about wow they won't want me back or nothing.  That had nothing to do with that.
Speaker 1: It was about your, your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm only thinking about music Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole]; that was my life.  As I told you when I went to the room and started playing, well that's all it was about.  Then and now, I'm trying to get to some place which is not the usual place there.  That's why I could go in the room when I didn't have--when I was seven years old and I'd still be there, who knows.
Story_ID: 589388
Speaker 1: Well--and during this sabbatical, as you're practicing, you began practicing on the Williamsburg Bridge [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Why there?
Speaker 2: Why there?  Okay.  That's a very simple answer; all, all musicians that live in New York City [New York, New York] have a problem finding someplace to practice.  I don't care if you play piano, I don't care if you play trumpet, if you live in an apartment which is where we live in New York City, you're going to be a distraction to your neighbor.  "Hey man, this guy is blowing the horn, you know and I'm trying to do this and trying," you know and that was it, always, that was a problem.  And when I signed a recording deal with RCA [RCA Records] in the 1950s, I mean, 1960s rather, after I came from the bridge, I put in that contract, I said I want to have access to the RCA Victor studios.  RCA had a--studios on 24th Street, and I said I want to have access so that anytime I wanted to, if the studios was available, they had plenty of studios in there--that's got to be part of my contract.
Speaker 1: You have rehearsal space.
Speaker 2: Anytime I wanted to and I'd go in there at night, you know, I got to know the guard that was there and he'd say, "Oh Sonny [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins] looking for a studio that's open?"  Go in there and play as long as I wanted to.  So that's the reason why I played on the bridge.  Now, I was walking on Delancey Street, I was living on Grand Street, Lower East Side [New York, New York] at the time, I was just walking down Delancey Street and I saw these steps going up the bridge; I didn't really think about it.  Said okay, let me walk up.  So I walked up on this bridge and I said wow it's nobody up there, there's not a living ass up there and, there's--and I walked across the bridge and walked over, nobody, there was maybe one person coming on the other side.  I said, wow I can come up here and blow my horn; I'm not going to bother nobody--my neighbor next door or nothing.  I can come up here and it was like a blessing, was like a blessing, and that's what I did and I was up there, you know, and I'd be--and sometimes I'd be up there at night, not too much mainly up there in the daytime.  But I could be up there at night, because in those days there wasn't this crime thing, wasn't really happening.  People, you know--I'm up there playing in the middle of the bridge.  Nobody was really thinking about me.  I'd see people walking back and forth, you know, and not many people just every now and then people would be coming.  Nobody even ever paid me no mine.  Probably said, "Well who's this crazy guy up there playing the horn?"  You know, so I could be up there night, I could be up there and had no--was no--there was no issue with security.
Story_ID: 589389
Speaker 1: So during this first--well, this is your second sabbatical that you were describing.
Speaker 2: The one on the bridge [Williamsburg Bridge, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: The one on the bridge.
Speaker 2: I think you could say that, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah and that's how you just described it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: During that time you begin practicing yoga.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: How did that come?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was interested these spiritual--in a way, I always was intrigued by a asceticism, you know, and I was--that fascinated me to be able to--in other words it was just being able to be closer to another reality besides everyday life, you know, I mean body and soul.  So I wanted to be closer to the soul than to the body, and I started to read a lot in the mid-1950s.  You know, things--a lot of these pursuits, Buddhism, yoga.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they were coming to the--at this point there are practitioners of Eastern religion who were coming to the states.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Yeah, they--there was a lot of--they'd been coming early.  There was a fellow named Swami Vivekananda who was here at the turn of the century.  He was here in the 1890s, and he was a very well spoken, brilliant scholar.  And he was one of the people that laid the foundation for English speaking people coming to the Western world [sic.], Swami Vivekananda he's, he's a brilliant guy.  And so--
Speaker 1: Who introduced you to the work of Vivekananda and others?
Speaker 2: Well, Vivekananda I got years later, but I can't--I remember there used to be a group called the Rosicrucians and they used to advertise on the back of comic books and stuff, you know, this Rosicrucia group.  Anyway, so that intrigued me, so I joined that group.  I went to some of their meetings and all that stuff, and I realized that this was something that I'm into that I really enjoy that.  So from that, then I really began getting more into--now the Rosicrucians by the way claimed their ancestry to Egypt.  But anyway, I needed--I wanted to go beyond that, so I ended up reading yoga books and that sort of coincided with the fact that I wanted to--I was smoking a lot.  I used to smoke cigarettes a lot and stuff like that, drinking a little bit, using amphetamines a little bit.  See I could do that because I had whipped the big boys, heroin and all that. So that was--you know, I was smoking cigarettes, a lot of cigarettes.  So I began feeling there was a way that I should have a perfect body, that my health, my physical body should be, you know, attended to.  As a matter of fact, when I went up on the bridge that's when I stopped smoking cigarettes.  I used to write down on a calendar one cigarette a day, two, next day three, next day one half, the next day finally none, no days.  And being up on the bridge was good, because I was also walking across that bridge.  That was a good--
Speaker 1: Exercise.
Speaker 2: --health exercise and they had a little abutment from the bridge; and I used to chin on there.  I mean that bridge was like paradise for me.  So then my yoga thing began becoming into focus for me more and that's when I began reading more about yoga.
Story_ID: 589390
Speaker 1: And when did you first go to India?
Speaker 2: I went to India in 1967, I believe.  That was during my other sabbatical, so--
Speaker 1: And where did you go?
Speaker 2: Well I had read a book, a very popular book about yoga--an 'Autobiography of a Yogi'--
Speaker 1: By (unclear) Yogananda.
Speaker 2: Paramhansa Yogananda, yeah that's such a great book.  So unfortunately he passed away before I could go out to--get involved with, in his teaching and all that.  So he had, he had, he had gone on to the next place.  So I--anyway I still wanted to--I was reading a lot of yoga books.
Speaker 1: Excuse me this is in '67 [1967] you said, right?
Speaker 2: Yes this is--
Speaker 1: So this is after you married Lucille [Lucille Rollins].  You all got married in '65 [1965],
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Did she go with you to India?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: This is your solo journey.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you go to--
Speaker 2: We were--my wife and I had some periods of separation a couple of months at some period, not long but we were, so maybe that was during that period--one of those periods, I'm not sure.  But no she didn't go with me, no, no.  The only thing that went with me was my horn and a suitcase.  I had a suitcase, and I had my horn.
Speaker 1: And what happened for you?  You know going to India is a very different country from America, from Europe wherever you'd been before and you're gone for a spiritual pursuit.  So you go to an ashram [Sandeepany Sadhanalaya, Mumbai, India]?
Speaker 2: Yeah I ended, I ended up in an ashram right.
Speaker 1: And you say you're interested in asceticism.  This is quite an ascetic life, right, very spare?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you do there?
Speaker 2: Well you know I was lucky; I met a guy on the plane going over on Air India, Indian fellow so he said, "Oh yeah.  Well gee, you're going to India," and he mentioned several places that he knew.  And he said, "You might be able to get accepted in these places."  So this ashram was one of them.  And so I was there in India for a while, not long.  I went to Bombay, called Mumbai [India] now, but--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I was in Mumbai then I ended up going to this ashram.  I can't remember exactly how it all worked out, but anyway.  And this was an ashram that had peop- different people.  It had Indian people, it had European people, it had different aspirants that came there trying to get the message.
Speaker 1: So they spoke English?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There were, there were several English speaking people there.
Story_ID: 589391
Speaker 1: And is--was it as a result of going to the ashram [Sandeepany Sadhanalaya, Mumbai, India] that you stopped eating meat?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I think I just--I was also when I was going on the bridge [Williamsburg Bridge, New York, New York], and I stopped smoking cigarettes, right, and I was getting my health and all this stuff.  So I was--then I was reading a lot of books about nutrition and everything, you know.  So I began getting an education of what to eat, what not to eat, you know.  So I think way back then I might have begun--been.
Speaker 1: And did you become vegetarian, do you now not eat meat?
Speaker 2: No, I never became a strict vegetarian; I always ate fish and/or chicken, you know.  I never was a strict vegan as they say.
Speaker 1: You just became a healthier eater?
Speaker 2: Healthier eater, exactly.
Speaker 1: You've had these periodic sabbaticals for, for yourself as you described them.  How, how have they rejuvenated you as you've had several of them over your life?
Speaker 2: Well they've all been very positive to me.  The one that I went to in India, there was a swami there--Swami Chinmayananda [Chinmayananda Saraswati] was the guy that had that particular ashram.  So we were talking one day, so I was telling him, I said, "Well you know, swami, it's hard for me to sit down in a lotus pose and meditate and settle my mind and meditate and all this stuff.  Because I'm from New York [New York] there's always been a lot of background noise, a lot of noise, and I'm sort of used to it and it's hard."  So he said, "Well, Sonny [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins], when you play your horn that's meditation."  Bingo--that was it.  I realized well yeah.  See, I didn't have to go in someplace with a lot of people sitting down in a lotus pose, I was meditating because I wasn't thinking anything negative when I was playing my horn, wasn't hurting anybody, wasn't doing nothing to nobody, everything was positive.  I was trying to get into a higher level of consciousness--that's meditation.  And so one--that was one--I said wow okay.  So then I came back to the states that was about--I stayed there about four, four and a half months or something like that.  So when I got that information then I came back to the states, and I was ready to go.
Speaker 1: You came back in--
Speaker 2: By the way Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole]--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes?
Speaker 2: --when I came back to the states have you ever heard about levitation?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: I was walking--I was above the ground, I wasn't walking on the ground okay.
Speaker 1: You're in a--
Speaker 2: That went on for a while, it lasted for maybe a couple of weeks or so before I began eventually getting down then I began feeling myself back on earth.
Story_ID: 589392
Speaker 1: During that period were you making music?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: I mean during that--this levitation period, when you're really in an altered state.
Speaker 2: Well, I had my horn.  When I went to India, I had my horn so I didn't go there just to get away, no, no.  I had my horn and I played in India as a matter of fact.  I did a little mini concert with a guy that had a nageswaram which is a big oboe, Indian oboe.  He and I played, you know, for all the people in the ashram [Sandeepany Sadhanalaya, Mumbai, India].  And I'm trying to think how much I practiced.  I must have practiced but not--I wasn't like practicing every day.  It was something--but I was playing as I said, I did a thing in there.
Speaker 1: And when you did that, now you obviously were accustomed to improv, and working with different artists.  Now this is an artist playing an instrument that's very different from the types of instruments that you've been working with to date.  How do, how do you move into that space with him?
Speaker 2: Well, he was doing his thing and I was doing my thing and since it was about music it fit.  What parts that could fit, fit.  Other than that he was playing his thing and I was playing my thing and it was perfect.  I love playing solo; I've been playing solo from the time I went into my--
Speaker 1: Your room.
Speaker 2: --seven age, see.  So it's always been something I like to do.  So it was great.  You know, and it--I loved his instrument this is a long Indian oboe, big long, big Indian oboe.  As long as that (points) alphorn almost.
Speaker 1: And you come back from, from that sabbatical when '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I had stayed there only four months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was back in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was '69 [1969] when you went there?
Speaker 2: No I went there in '67 [1967] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Either six--now this I'm not sure about '67 [1967] or '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you--
Speaker 2: And I was there about four months.
Speaker 1: About four months.
Speaker 2: A little longer than four months.
Story_ID: 589393
Speaker 1: And when you come back to New York [New York], among the things that you do, you're playing at the Village Vanguard [New York, New York] which is one of the premier places where jazz is performed regularly.  But you also moved.  This is when you moved to Germantown [New York], right around that time.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I, I, I moved to Germantown in 1972.  Yeah, I moved to Germantown in 1972.
Speaker 1: So you lived in the city for quite some time, the Lower East Side [New York, New York] you said, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Had you moved, had you moved from there?
Speaker 2: Okay, from there I moved to Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let's see now.  I moved to Brooklyn and this is where my--somebody knows 'cause I had--I'm sure but I'm not sure exactly when I moved to Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: My friend Bob Cranshaw, my bass player for many years, he was living in Brooklyn right across from Pratt Institute, and so he said, "Oh man there's a--I've got a nice apartment in this development."  So I moved over there and then I was back with my wife then, steady, and we moved over there.  And then we stayed there.  Then we moved--then that, that neighborhood began getting a little problematic, and so my wife was working at that time at NYU [New York University, New York, New York].  She was working at (unclear), but also NYU.  She had to come home late at night and all this stuff when it was dark so I said, "No this is not going to work."  I'd meet her at the subway, you know, but we realized this is nice, but we've got to move out of New York or this neighborhood anyway.  So we moved from Brooklyn to Independence Plaza [New York, New York], which was a new set of apartments that they were building down on the Lower West Side right off the Hudson River.  And there were three big apartment buildings--complex of buildings and other stuff.  So we moved in there, and we lived there until we moved up to--we moved to Germantown but we still had that apartment.  And so we had pied-a-terre, they call it, and then a home up in Germantown.  So that was cool; that situation was good.  I'd come down to--I'd be in the city more.  Lucille [Lucille Rollins] was getting really acclimated to the country and all that so, so I was in the city more than she was 'cause I was rehearsing in the city and all this stuff.
Story_ID: 589394
Speaker 1: Who were you, who were you playing with during this time?  This is now the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: The members of my band, you mean (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh god, there's a lot of different people.  Bob Cranshaw, the guy that I just mentioned, he was sort of with me more or less all during that time.  I started working with him in 1959, and he's been working with me up until my last job in 2012.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: He was--he works for a lot of people, but times (unclear), I could always get him, you know.
Speaker 1: And what does he play?
Speaker 2: Bass he just passed by the way about three weeks ago.
Speaker 1: Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You also received a Guggenheim fellowship in the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't remember exactly when, but yes I did.
Speaker 1: And you're being acknowledged during this period for shifts in your music once again.  How is your music evolving during, you know, as we moved into the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Well, Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole], that's a hard thing to say.  I--you know, my music is always evolving I guess, because I was criticized getting electric--some electric guys in the band and all that stuff, you know.  But to me it's just a seamless progression but you know how people are.  They want to put, put things in boxes so I guess I was--had to take a lot of criticism for that.
Speaker 1: Well, it seems like you were responsive to what was going on culturally, including the music.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: And, and incorporating some that, some R and B, different elements.
Speaker 2: Of course. Right. Of course look at my man Louis Jordan back in the '30s [1930s] he would be like a rhythm and blues band; that was my man.  So what's the difference?
Speaker 1: Now, you were criticized but you were also acknowledged, I mean Guggenheim fellowship is a great honor--is it--and so I guess you're getting from both sides the positive and the criticism.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Guggenheim was an ackno- you know, they gave the Guggenheim to artistic people, artists, writers, musicians.  People that were working and on things that needed financial help, you know, for projects they wanted to do.  I got a Guggenheim and with that Guggenheim I was able to build my studio in Germantown [New York], you know, which was great.  I built my own studio up there and--
Speaker 1: Is that where you would record?
Speaker 2: No, not to record; I never recorded up there.  This, this is just for living there and practicing every day, you know.  I always recorded in the city here.
Speaker 1: So you had a place to practice?
Speaker 2: A place to practice.
Speaker 1: Was it a soundproof studio?
Speaker 2: Yeah, soundproof.
Speaker 1: What did it cost to build that?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, but what I got from the Guggenheim was not a lot of money.  It wasn't a lot of--I think now the grants are more, I believe.  Anyway, it wasn't a huge studio, and--but it suit my--it suited my needs, and I don't remember exactly the, the amount of the grant (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  That's all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 589395
Speaker 1: Here's another interesting thing, you added to your--in 1974, you added to your band a jazz bagpiper.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Rufus Harley.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: A jazz bagpiper.  What is that sound adding to your band?
Speaker 2: Right. Well, I always liked the bagpipes and I got a pair of bagpipes actually, but Rufus Harley was a bagpipe player.  He al- he started out a saxophonist, but he made his reputation with the bagpipes, and he was great.  He was the best musician, you know, and it was great.  Rufus played with me, we recorded together, travelled the world together, and, you know, it was great. You know, I liked the music (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, this is adding a different dimension to your music, the bagpipe, bagpipe.
Speaker 2: In a sense it was yeah, yeah.  But Rufus was trying to do that on his own, but he didn't--he wasn't [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins.  I was able to give him a lot of exposure, you know, but he was playing jazz bagpipes, you know, on his own with his own bands.
Story_ID: 589396
Speaker 1: You mentioned that you have always enjoyed doing solos--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and by the time we're heading toward the end of the '70s [1970s] you're touring with the Milestone Jazzstars, but you're also looking into unaccompanied saxophone solos.  What, what are you doing?  Where is this happening?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, in 1959 I did a performance at the Berkeley, Berkeley--I'm trying to remember--it was a Berkeley Jazz Festival, and was held in the--I'm blank on the name of it.  It's sort of like a big Roman theater [Hearst Greek Theatre] in Berkeley, California (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, California.
Speaker 2: So that was the first time that I really did a unaccompanied jazz performance that got, you know, got people to begin to--I got some critical acclaim for it.  And at that time I--now that was before I went away on--went to the bridge; that was before that.  So anyway, that was very good.  I got a lot of acclaim for that, and it was sort of groundbreaking in a way, because my, my man Coleman Hawkins had done a record, saxophone solo, but this was a concert saxophone solo, you know, no accompaniment just saxophone.  So I just--I took it a little step further where I was doing a whole not eight minute performance on record.  I did a whole show performance.  And that was very, you know, I appreciated that, and that was a little groundbreaking.  So in my resume I can always say that I sort of encouraged that.  A lot of people did it a little bit more after that but it was sort of a groundbreaking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that was from '59 [1959].
Speaker 2: That was in '59 [1959].
Story_ID: 589397
Speaker 1: You were saying there's a book being written on 19--what happened musically in 1959.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't who who's writing it, but a guy interviewed me for it and there seemed to have been a lot of things happening in 1959.  I don't know any more about it.  Yeah, I didn't--I don't know the name of it or the author.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this was what--this was a key thing that happened for you during that year.
Speaker 2: In 1959, I went on the bridge [Williamsburg Bridge, New York, New York] so that was really key and also I did this concert this concert earlier, but going on the bridge was a big thing for me in 1959.
Speaker 1: So when we fast forward, we were looking at ending the '70s [1970s] and kind of moving into the '80s [1980s].  Well, one of the things that you did in terms of solo--a different kind of solo performance is with Johnny Carson on 'The Tonight Show' ['The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'], right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was in '79 [1979].  Now--
Speaker 2: Was that '79 [1979]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And of course Carson had a lot of musicians on his show over the years.  Being on his show, what did that do for you in your career?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  I guess it did okay.  I guess it did okay.  You know, there is no way for me to measure, but it--people took note of the fact that I was playing solo saxophone, you know, which was sort of another groundbreaking act.
Speaker 1: Right, 'cause you weren't there with a band.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: It was you.
Speaker 2: Just me.  See, I was still in my mother's [Valborg Solomon Rollins] house seven years old playing, same thing.  I was, I was just there then, yeah.
Story_ID: 589398
Speaker 1: And then as we move into the '80s [1980s], you start per- doing a lot of performances in larger venues, in concert halls and arenas.  Where are you performing?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a theory that jazz was being dishonored by only being heard in nightclubs, and that I wanted to perform in concert halls.  So, I think that there's other people might have done that, I'm not, you know, I'm not--I don't think we were the first jazz concert--jazz group to play a concert hall.  No, but anyway I want, I wanted that to be normal for me, I didn't have to play in these clubs.  Now, these clubs are great, but it's awful hard to play three sets in a club.  And people smoking in clubs, you know, selling alcohol, everything like that.  Now, that's okay; that's--that has it's good aspect to it, but at that point in my life I wanted to make a--what I considered a, a improvement in the--where jazz--just in jazz so that we could play Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] and all this stuff.  Why do we always have to play in the Vanguard [Village Vanguard, New York, New York], you know?
Speaker 1: Well you did play in Carnegie Hall, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah I played in Carnegie Hall sure.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But I don't remember the year. But you're saying what?
Speaker 1: Well you--in the '80s [1980s] I think is when you started playing more in larger venues.
Speaker 2: Okay, well that, that was my intention to lift the, what I considered, the image of jazz--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Sort of elevate it to the point where you don't have to go to a jazz club.
Speaker 1: As I had mentioned to you when I came to see you at MoMA, which is a different kind of venue, Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York], the--people were wrapped around the block to get in so very different venue, a museum.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You played--
Speaker 2: That was a solo saxophone thing again.  See I was beginning to develop that.  You know, that, that was still sort of not done so I was beginning to develop that.  That engagement was as well as solo--it was solo saxophone and the venue was Museum of Modern Art, right, but one of the attractions was that it was solo.
Speaker 1: And this is how you started, the exact way that you started on the horn.  Now so many years later you're playing it out on, on the stage.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 589399
Speaker 1: You also performed on a Rolling Stones album ['Tattoo You'].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did that come to be?
Speaker 2: Well, they came to me because of my wife, Lucille [Lucille Rollins].  Now Lucille was a European woman.  She was familiar with the Rolling Stones and these--that whole milieu.  I mean, I heard the name Rolling Stones but Rolling Stones didn't mean anything to me.  So they wanted me to play on this album, and this guy had come to see me one night and said, "Yeah, well you should get [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins."  There's a guy who played in the Rolling Stones, (unclear) jazz.  Anyway, so I didn't want to do it so Lucille said, "No Sonny, please do this."  So I said, "Okay, well, I'll do it."  And the rationale that I'll have for doing it is that I'll see how my playing as a jazz musician can somehow meld with these guys, you know, British rockers or whatever they were called.  So that's how I rationalized it to myself.  I didn't want to be credited on the record or anything.
Speaker 1: I read that so you were not credited on the record, but people still knew it was you.
Speaker 2: It got out, yeah.
Speaker 1: Why didn't you want to be credited?
Speaker 2: Because to me that was sort of a lower step down.  That would--that's sort of a--
Speaker 1: Rock and roll.
Speaker 2: Right and I was already Sonny Rollins.  I was one of the top names in jazz, I represented jazz is higher than rock and roll, okay?  Simple as that.  I didn't want to be, "Oh man, Sonny Rollins is playing on a rock and roll record?"  You know, that's a disgrace but I did it.  My wife was, "Oh yes, Sonny please do this."   "Okay," said, "I'll do it."  And they wanted me to tour with them after the record came out.  They said, "We've got all these tours," you know, that's a big group playing amphitheaters, all the places, all the people and money and this and I said, "No way, no way."  I'd be playing with the Rolling Stones, are you crazy?
Speaker 1: Their huge popularity didn't faze you at all.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't really recognize their huge pop- popularity.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it wasn't the genre that you paid attention to.
Speaker 2: Right, I didn't pay any attention to that genre.
Speaker 1: Did you regret not going with them?
Speaker 2: No, I'm glad I didn't--regret not going?  Just the opposite.  I mean, if I had to--I couldn't have lived with myself if I'd played with the Rolling Stones, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: It was not for you.
Speaker 2: No, no.  Now especially I would have been playing with the group.  See, the Rolling Stones had concerts where they had Stevie Wonder not playing with them.  He--they had him opening for them something like that, that's fine, that's different.  They didn't approach me that way; I was supposed to re-create that record that we made together.  So I had to be part of that group and that would--no it's no way that I would do that. No.  And people today they don't understand well the Rolling Stones--well the Rolling Stones was some British rock and roll group who--they were all about the same to me.  Maybe The Beatles made--got a better impression but even them it took a while before people heard about, you know, appreciated them a little more.  But no that was not an issue with me.

Speaker 1: The University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] created a jazz archives in your name in 1993, and it houses all kinds of work from jazz artists over all these years.  Can you describe how that project came to you?
Speaker 2: Well it came about by Nathan Davis who was, I think he was a director of the--of that department at the time.  I knew Nathan from Europe when I was over there in Paris [France], and he was playing in Paris.  I think he was in the [U.S.] Army and he got out of the Army and he was playing in Paris.  I knew Nathan from that time, and then he came to the United States and got involved with Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh.  And then he would have different groups coming down there and he had something like tribute concerts and so on and so forth.  So I think that's what you're referring to.
Speaker 1: Well, he--the archive is in your name, the Sonny Rollins International Jazz Archives.
Speaker 2: Well, I never knew that.
Speaker 1: Wow, yes that's what it's called at the University of Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: (Pats himself on the back).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 589401
Speaker 1: I want to talk about your activism again, because in 1998 you released an album called 'Global Warming.'
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you have been passionate about environmentalism and paying attention to the world in which we live.  Here's an album that speaks to that.  What, what, what are the forces that came together to make this album?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, just being a citizen of the world.  In other words, I don't want to live in this world and take more than I give.  See, that, that comes from the Buddhist, yoga thing, it's all, it's all of, it's all a piece.  You don't want to destroy something, you want to try to build something, I mean, be--have a positive force.  I got interested in the environment which is the same thing.  You know, just using anything, taking garbage throwing it on the street, using up a lot of resources, it's all the same thing.  If you're a yoga, yogi, you want to live a principled life.  You want to live a life that is saying something.  See, you want to be somebody that's wow.  Well, I don't care what people look at you, as a person you have your own ideals; that's what you strive for.  So you want to be a generous person, you want to be an honest person, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  So the global warming thing began to get a lot of attention that time, and what it--what the indication was to me was people using up something and not paying any attention to it.  You know, let's do this; that's okay.  Oh, I'm happy so I don't care what it does to somebody else.  That's what that environmental--my consciousness began getting into that.  So 'Global Warming' was an attempt to--
Speaker 1: Raise awareness (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) jazz waking up, you know, people.
Story_ID: 589402
Speaker 1: On 9/11 [September 11, 2001], you were very close to the buildings as they came down.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you, can you tell me about that experience and what you did as a result of it in the music you made?
Speaker 2: I was living in an apartment building forty stories and I lived on the top floor [of Independence Plaza].  It was six block away from the World Trade Center [New York, New York], okay.  I was in my house one morning; my wife [Lucille Rollins] was coming down to the city the next day.  We were going to go up to play a job in Boston [Massachusetts] together.  I was down in the city earlier 'cause I had to do some stuff, whatever it was. So anyway I was in my house and all of a sudden I heard pow.  I said, "Gee, what is that?"  I wonder if it's a--sounds like something happened with a plane or something down by the river 'cause we lived right on the Hudson River.  So I said, "Wow it sounds like a little--," I don't know what it was but anyway I had no idea.  As was my wont, I had on my sports station there, you know it's--I'm an anti TV guy so even back then, I was not looking at TV.  And then this guy said, "Wow there's been a plane crashing into the World Trade Center."  Then the news began talking about it.  So I went downstairs; it was voting day as a matter of fact.  It was voting--they voted down in the lobby of my building, the apartment building we had.  So we came out, I looked up, there were flames coming out of the World Trade Center, you know, and everybody was wow standing there, women were screaming and everything.  Women in the building, I know they were--everybody was--so while we were there watching this thing the other plane came into the other building.  Now, we couldn't see that 'cause the only building close to us was one building.  The other building was not within sight but they said hey they hit the other building.  Once they hit that all these people down in the street from the, from the house and the area, we said, "Wow we better start running."  Because if that building had fell down that would have taken everything with it.  So we started running.  People started--let's get away because if that building falls over, it's curtains.  Okay.  So we ran a little bit up, not far. It was a lot of just, people, and then we saw these flakes of toxic stuff just fall like snow falling out of the sky.  So then they said--we heard okay that building didn't fall over.  It seemed to be imploding in itself.  So okay, we don't have to run--but they said--I don't know if this is triage or some term that they used where it's complete chaos, fire trucks, police, ambulances everything right down in my--in front of my house.  Anyway they said, "No go back upstairs, go back upstairs, go back upstairs."  Okay, so went back up, and I brought out the television, an old television we had there, turned it on and I saw the, the other building where it had hit--
Speaker 1: When you're up higher, right.
Speaker 2: --and that was it.  So we stayed there all the, of course--it was a toxic--that whole place was really toxic.  There will be a scandal one day--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --and they will tell you why they couldn't close that area 'cause that's Wall Street.  But that was--there was a toxic camp down there.
Story_ID: 589403
Speaker 1: And you made, you made--well you did the concert, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah I did, I did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You went to, you went to Boston [Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the concert was recorded, called 'Without a Song, a 9-ll Con-'--
Speaker 2: Right, right 'A 9/11 Concert' ['Without a Song: The 9/11 Concert'].
Speaker 1: It changed into that after 9/11 [September 11, 2001] happened.
Speaker 2: You mean the title?
Speaker 1: Right, because it wasn't--
Speaker 2: I don't know what the title--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It could have yeah, maybe so, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Did you make music specifically after that--
Speaker 2: Well, you know--
Speaker 1: --in response to that?
Speaker 2: It was a thing where if you were in New York [New York], everybody was shell shocked; we were shocked.  So, anyway, I had to go back up--I'll lead to that--I had to go back up to my apartment the next night and staying in my apartment, all the lights, everything then were out, elevator everything came--was off, so--let's see.  It was the radio, I think the radio 'cause I had a battery radio.  So we had to stay there until the next, next night, we got evacuated, the National Guard was evacuating--
Speaker 1: Because so much debris in the air and all of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah there was a lot of debris going on all the time.
Speaker 1: I remember, for weeks.
Speaker 2: And I was--oh yeah weeks, you're right months.
Speaker 1: Where you were probably months, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah and we got evacuated and I went up to the school up there, and fortunately I had my driver, I called him and I said, "Look man can you pick me up and take me home up in Germantown [New York]."  So I did, I didn't have to stay in this place.
Speaker 1: So how were you able to perform?  I mean, I remember that time, but I was on 14th [Street] and 5th [Avenue] not so far away.
Speaker 2: No kidding.  Well, you were close.
Speaker 1: Close.  And I remember not being to work.  I mean, lots of people just were frozen just couldn't do anything.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: And you performed five days later.  Given--I mean I remember hundreds of people being frozen and just not being able to do anything.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: What did you do--what, what process did you go through to be able to perform?
Speaker 2: Well, okay.  That's another case where my wife, Lucille [Lucille Rollins], played a big part in my life.  I--we had to walk down when I was evacuated from Independence Plaza [New York, New York].  You had to walk down forty flights of steps, you know.  I had my horn and a little shopping bag, and wow my legs were like rubber.  But I got up there, we left and I got up to Germantown.  And so I said, "Wow, baby, I can't, I'm too wiped out, I can't do a concert," you know.  I'm just, I'm too--I can't even quite think, you know.  So she said, "No Sonny [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins], you have to do this concert, you have do this concert."  She kept saying, "No you must do it."  So I said, "Okay I'll do it." Okay, so the band was bused up from the city up to Boston.  These guys were so shell shocked they couldn't--nobody knew anything. Guys were just sort of, you know, it was another world.  Everybody was really out of it.  So how did I do it? I don't know but, I mean you know, music is something that comes easy to me, comes easy to the guys so we just played it.  But the people were very--the part of it that kind of was encouraging was that the people were so--it was like they really needed to hear some music, you know, and some normalcy.  So that really struck me, but while we were doing it, we were just doing it, you know.
Speaker 1: So the musicianship kind of clicked in and you were able to perform (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We did it sort of as a--rote, you know.
Story_ID: 589404
Speaker 1: So a, a few years later two very important things happen the same, same year.  You received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in 2004 and also your wife [Lucille Rollins] passes away.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: High and low same year.  How long were you married?
Speaker 2: Well altogether, we were married about forty years or something like that.  We had our little--but I would say a good forty years.
Speaker 1: Was she alive when you received the award?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, because she was sick, and I was consumed with that, you know, so I don't, I don't remember when we got the award really.
Story_ID: 589405
Speaker 1: In 2006 you found your own label, Doxy.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How did you come up with that name?
Speaker 2: Well, I had written a song called "Doxy" that I recorded with Miles Davis.
Speaker 1: Many years earlier.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the '50s [1950s], early '50s [1950s], and that song was played--oh no there's three songs, "Oleo," "Doxy," anyway one of those songs--
Speaker 1: And the Nigeria one, backwards.
Speaker 2: Right, "Airegin" right,
Speaker 1: Right, "Airegin."
Speaker 2: Nigeria.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that was played a lot.  It was like a little standard--the other one "Oleo" was really--more guys were playing that.  But so, you know, just to commemorate that, you know, I just named it Doxy Records.
Speaker 1: And then the first album that you make on that label is 'Sonny, Please.'
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: What's the origin of that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well when my wife and I would be in an argument about something, "Blah, blah, blah," and then she'd say, "Sonny [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins], please."  I said, "Now okay I'm going to use that for a song Lucille [Lucille Rollins], Sonny please."
Speaker 1: It was nominated for a Grammy [Grammy Award], you did a good job.
Speaker 2: Yes, right, so.
Speaker 1: So what does mean now to have your own label?  This is 2006.  So it's, it's, it's before the Internet is as big as it now in 2016.  You know, there are issues of how music is being used and repurposed that are going on, and there have always been issues as it relates to a record label working with an artist and how much money the artist gets versus the label.  I mean, these are conflicts that have existed forever.  When you make your own label, what, what power are you assuming in having your own label?
Speaker 2: Well, basically what I do, I select the musicians; I select the material; and I finance the record.  I have to pay everybody.  So that's about it.
Speaker 1: And then you--
Speaker 2: You know, if I did it with Blue Note [Blue Note Records] for instance, I would get paid and they would pay the musicians and whatever else was paid.  Now, with my own company, I have to get paid and then I've got to pay everybody else, so.
Speaker 1: But, but if the record is successful, you also reap the financial benefit.
Speaker 2: Yes, that would be how it would be--supposed to go down, but as you know the music business is quite unscrupulous, if I can use that word.
Speaker 1: So what happens in reality?
Speaker 2: Well, in reality you never know how much records you sell.  You never know, and these are for people like Nat Cole [Nat King Cole].  These big people selling all these--you never know how many records you sell 'cause you're not selling them, they are selling them.  You know, myself, I sold 50 million records.  Well, wonderful but actually you could have sold 150 million.  So that's the type of business the music business is.  It's really--but for me as a jazz artist and many jazz artists, it was just a matter that we didn't have anybody telling us what to do.  You know, "Oh well Sonny I want you to play this, or--."  We did what we wanted to do and we had that control.  So it was, it was, you know, it was some control, you know.
Story_ID: 589406
Speaker 1: In the 2000s, how is jazz being regarded in, you know, on our cultural landscape today in this day and age?  Because you've been involved in jazz for so many years.  You know, when you were a kid it was on fire, you know, and so many great musicians were making their mark, and you become a part of that at a very young age. There have been many different musical art forms that have emerged and evolved from that time.  Where does jazz stand today?
Speaker 2: Well, jazz, gold--the golden age seemed to be in the mid-1950s, around that time, 1930 maybe to up to 1960 something like that.  That would be the high apogee.  So now we have a lot of other musics; we have all different sorts of music, world music, this music, hip hop music, that--.  And so to be a jazz musician, you have to have, you have to have love, and you have to have courage and you have to have strength and you have to have that today 'cause you love the music.  Whether you're going to make a lot of money or not, well that was true back in the golden age.  A lot of musicians didn't make a lot of money in the golden age of jazz and it may be true today.  Or even--it may.  That's a commercial question Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole]; I don't deal with commercial questions like that, I don't know.  People like it or people don't like it; it has no, it has no bearing to me.
Speaker 1: You know, many talk about jazz as the American, the original American music. You know, obviously born out of the African American soul but when you go around the world, jazz is understood as American.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Po- possibly well maybe now hip hop too but--
Speaker 2: Well hip hop is really jazz, but that's another story, so let's get it--
Speaker 1: Well, no, but tell (unclear)--explain that.
Speaker 2: Well it's just like I say, hip hop is really jazz; it's a form of jazz.  It's a form of jazz.
Speaker 1: And when you define jazz how does [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins define jazz?
Speaker 2: Well jazz is got to do with the rhythm, it's got to do with the feeling, it's got to do with expressiveness, it's got to do with music in the moment.  See all that's jazz, that's hip hop, it's all the same in a way.  It's hard to understand that now, because people are saying, "Oh well gee hip hop, hip hop and--this jazz."  Well that's not--maybe some years from now if the world is still around they'll say, "Oh well it's all--that's just a form of jazz."  Am I getting across at all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 589407
Speaker 1: What do you feel the messages are that jazz delivers?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the message is just of high cultural--jazz is music so that's high cultural expression, high cultural expression.  I think it's the highest as far as our--because you've got to create.  You know, it takes a lot of--boy it takes a lot of musical knowledge to really be a jazz player and, and I mean, it's--jazz has everything in there.  Jazz has hip hop in it, jazz has everything in it.  Blues cats say oh well the blues--well of course blues, gospel jazz in that but I'll tell you a story.  I know a lot of blues musicians who love jazz, and a lot of jazz musicians who love the blues.  I don't know any blues musicians that can play jazz but I know jazz musicians that can play the blues.  It's another level in the same--see, I don't want to create an argument with people, "Oh well I like that it's all the same."  But you're saying jazz, jazz, jazz so I'm trying to answer you in that.
Speaker 1: When you said it's all the same what are you talking about?
Speaker 2: Well, because it's all--it's music in the moment, it's music which has great feeling, great depth, and that improvisatory thing that, you know, that's something you can't describe.  You know, just like comedy, people have a lot of comedy, they say oh yeah I like--but what makes comedy, timing, timing, you see, and that's--
Speaker 1: That's what makes improv too.
Speaker 2: Exactly that's what makes all of this. That's what makes hip hop if you want to use hip hop as an example of something that's so different from jazz.  It's the same thing, basically it's the same thing.  Now okay, I can't go into a club and oh I want to hear hip hop.  Well that's on a small level.  I don't like to think in that level.  I don't like to think in that level, I appreciate it all.
Story_ID: 589408
Speaker 1: Well, we started this interview, and you talked about the unity that as you look back on your career and on music, you see unity more than anything else.  While this could seem like an esoteric question, but I want you to explain, what do you mean by that unity as it relates to music and your career?
Speaker 2: Well, I think unity is the ideal.  That's the ideal in everything we do, you want to have a unified body whatever it is; you want to be unified.  You wouldn't have disparate things, nobody knows, this guy is doing that and this has nothing to do with that, nobody wants that.  That's not, that's not what humanity is trying--humanity, if there was ever such a day when people would all--unity, that's what it's all about.  Unity.  It's not about a whole lot of countries killing each other and fighting each other, which is what goes on now and has since the beginning of time.  No, people are looking for unity; that's the thing, unity.  A unifying element, you know, God people oh God yeah well that's what God is; that's unity.  People are trying to find something that unifies everything.
Speaker 1: What do you believe your contribution to unity has been?
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), I don't know what.  I mean, don't ask me because I'm not a big fan of everything that I have accomplished in my life.  I still want to do more and more and more and more.  So I'm not going to sit back and say well gee I did this and I did that and did--no.  Hence, I've contributed because I think in a unified way and my contemporaries have validated me, so I'm not a phony, but other than that, you know, I'll let other people say whatever contributions I've made.
Story_ID: 589409
Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: No I don't.  The reason why I don't have regrets is because I feel that we live for a reason; things that happen to us happen for a reason.  So I could look back like we were talking about and say wow why I was using drugs, and I did that and I did that but that happened for a reason.  That happened for a reason.  And since I believe in Eastern culture, things are going on and on and on.  There's reincarnation, this little world isn't the end of it; this little life isn't the end of it.  So I have no regrets, sure I might have messed up in this life.  I know I have but so what.  I'll straighten it out in the next time, you know.  They say pay me now or pay me later.  I'll get it straight this time--or if I don't get it straight this time, I'll get it straight later.  But that's what we believe in when we believe in unity.
Story_ID: 589410
Speaker 1: What advice would you give to young people who are interested in pursuing jazz?
Speaker 2: Well, if you love it, especially now when theirs is a lot of competing music that's all about information, social media all of this stuff.  I mean, it's, it's, it's information up the kazoo, too much information.  So if you love jazz, then you're a special person.  If you can dig jazz, you're a special person and if you are a special person and you love jazz then that's your life.  That's your life; do it.  Do it.  Don't expect anything out of it.  See when I was playing, I didn't expect nothing out of it but the pleasure of doing a good solo, playing with some great musicians. That was it that was all it was about.  That's the highest you can go, you can't go any higher than that.  So the young guys say, "Oh I love jazz."  Well then you--that's the right--you, you're--you've got the--you're into a huge world if you love jazz and you're getting into something and the rest of it is up to you.

Speaker 1: Now Mr. Rollins [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins], is there anything that you would like to share that I have not asked you?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't remember because we've been talking for a long while.  I think we've covered probably everything that I can think about and music and life.  As I told you, my favorite saying is it's all good.  Meaning what?  Meaning that it, whatever it is, is good.  See, there's nothing bad going on that--to the point that, oh man that negative, defeatist.  No that's, that's--it's going to turn out good because it is good.  The universe, whatever way you want to describe it, is good; it's all good.  If you're going through negativity, okay then I've got to learn what to do, I've got to learn how to live my life better.  I've got to learn how to give up something or not give up something else, you know.  But it is good.  Ultimately it is good, it's good.  It's all good.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole].

Speaker 1: Well this was taken at the state department [U.S. Department of State] when I was down in Washington [D.C.] for the Kennedy Center awards [Kennedy Center Honors] and Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was there along with Hillary [Hillary Rodham Clinton] and I always thought that when Bill Clinton first came on the scene and they said, "Oh he's a saxophone player, he likes jazz," I always--when I heard that I said, "Wow, he better be careful."
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Ok tell us this one.
Speaker 1: This is a pretty early picture of [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins when I looked like I had the world on a string.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Let's see now--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  This says Rollins Beacon Quartet, John Abbott.  Does that help at all?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, that must have been the Beacon Theatre [New York, New York] and that could be my friend Ornette Coleman over there and it was my eightieth birthday celebration.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay. All right. That's good.  So that we don't need.  Can you see this one?  This is probably self-explanatory, it's: Friday evening, November 29 at Carnegie Hall, Morningside Community Center, Thanksgiving Jazz. Billie Holiday, Dizzy Gillespie, Ray Charles, Chet Baker with Zoot Sims, Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins.  Anything to add about the Thanksgiving Jazz morning--at the morning--Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Carnegie Hall.  Yeah that was quite a night and my friend--I played, I played before Ray Charles so I played something, people liked it so after--later in my life, I always remember that I kept Ray Charles from coming on.  So that was my way that I made myself feel good, but yeah that was a great night and some great people.  Coltrane also was there, I believe with Monk.  They it mentioned him.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Well actually it says yeah Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.  Okay
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You're absolutely right.
Speaker 1: Well, that looks like the kid there.  I don't know exactly when and where but--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: --could be with Max Roach's band maybe.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: That looks like a picture of my [maternal] grandmother [Miriam Hanson].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  That's what it says, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah my grandmother who was the activist in my house and who--you know, they always say you have your mother [Valborg Solomon Rollins], you have your father [Walter Rollins] and if you're lucky you have your grandmother.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  So that was the one with whom you marched on Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's the one that I marched on Lenox Avenue.  She used to take me to all these gospel churches and all that, Mother Horn [Mother Rosa Horn]--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: --and so that was my grandmother.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  That's where you got your activist streak from?
Speaker 1: That's where I got it from.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm playing there and I can't see who else that is playing with me.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  It says Sonny Rollins, Clifton Anderson.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  That's my nephew, Clifton, playing trombone with me.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  This looks like an album cover, 'Golden,' Sonny Rollins.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. I think, I think that was supposed to show my Mohawk--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Right.
Speaker 1: --but I don't know if it really--does it show it there?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  It does you can see it up here, here.  It's a low angle shot obviously looking up and you can see your goatee and your eyes and then right up here is the front part of the Mohawk.
Speaker 1: The front part of the Mohawk right, right, right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: That was Sonny Rollins practicing on the bridge [Williamsburg Bridge, New York, New York], but I'll tell you about that picture.  After I left the bridge, and it was--it became such a big thing in jazz, that picture was taken.  Because, you know, I went up on the bridge to do a commercial for Pioneer Electronics [Pioneer Corporation] and that was when that picture was taken.  So that was actually when my sojourn on the bridge was over.
Speaker 2: Right, that's how you're styled.
Speaker 1: Right, because I wouldn't be dressed like that.
Speaker 2: That's a photo shoot right there.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  They're recreating your--
Speaker 2: Right, that, that, dressed like with a cap on and not.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay. Good point.  There's somebody we know.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah that was a wonderful opportunity I had to receive the National Medal of the Arts [sic. National Medal of Arts] from Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], and it was a great honor to receive that National, National Arts, I forget the exact name--the National Arts, National Medal of the Arts.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Excellent, I think that might be the last one.  Oh I skipped one.  This one for some reason they sent us a very small version but that looks like you on a beach.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, as you know, as I've explained, I always liked playing with nature.  I used to practice by the beach or in nature surroundings in a park and the Williamsburg Bridge sufficed to make it a nature surroundings.  This was in Japan, in Miyazaki, Japan and I think I was there at the sound check just warming up and doing what I do best and what I, I, what I guess, at this stage in my life, I was fortunate enough to be put here to do, and that's blowing my horn.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a pretty young guy there (laughter).  Boy look at, look at that guy.  So I guess that--I would say I was about fourteen maybe.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And I was sharp, had on, you know.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah.
Speaker 2: You sure were.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
