Mr. White is a journalist and an advocate, a civil advocate, and we'll find out more about that.  The videographer this morning is Scott Stearns, and I'm doing the interview, [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock.  I'm going to start by asking you where are we?

Speaker 1: Wonderful.  And today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is the 27th of March.  Or is it the 28th (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I'm going to let you decide (laughter).
Speaker 2: It is the 28th, I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: Right, right.

Speaker 1: Okay.  And your favorite saying or phrase?
Speaker 2: If, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
Story_ID: 339805
Speaker 1: I'm going to try to take you back to your earliest knowledge of your parents' parents, and so forth and so on.  Let's start on your mother's side.  What was your mother's full name?  Oh, let me go back and ask you, could you spell your full name for me, please?
Speaker 2: Sure.  It's George Gregory White [HistoryMaker George White].  That's G-E-O-R-G-E, Gregory, G-R-E-G-O-R-Y, and then White, W-H-I-T-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And let's--I'll come back and just ask you if could you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Edna, E-D-N-A, White [Edna Finney White].
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Finney, F-I, double N, E-Y.
Speaker 1: All right.  And your father's full name, and spell it?
Speaker 2: George Bernard, B-E-R-N-A-R-D, White.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although he was born simply George White.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: He actually added the middle name Bernard himself when he was an adult.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because George Bernard Shaw was one of his heroes.
Speaker 1: Favorites?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good to know.  Now, for your memory, or from what you've been told, how far back can you go on your mother's family's side?
Speaker 2: Not very far back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They both, my maternal grandparents died when I was quite young, so I never even met them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember their names?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know much more about my father's side, as far as my grandparents are concerned in the, the older generations.
Speaker 1: Oka- okay.
Story_ID: 339806
Speaker 1: Then let's go over to your father's side, George White.  And how far back can you go in his family?
Speaker 2: To my grandparents, Will White, W-I-L-L, White, and my grandmother, Daisy White.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have any memories, not memories, but certainly any stories that you know of about who they were, in terms of origin and so forth?
Speaker 2: When I was young, I think I was around eight or nine years old--I grew up in Detroit [Michigan], but we drove down to North Carolina to visit my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They lived in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yes, in Rutherford County [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my paternal grandfather was very well-off, for a black man of his generation.  He had about ninety acres of land, of farmland.  I remember seeing horses and pigs and cows--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and you know, seeing crops growing in the fields for the first time in my life when you're a kid growing up in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Right, you didn't see many on the streets of Detroit.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And I suspect he did--well, I don't suspect, I know from what my father told me, that one of the reasons my grandfather did so well was he had a lot of kids.  He had nine kids, and they all worked the farm, and they all worked very hard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father was the youngest of nine, and he would often tell me these stories about how hard he had to work.  And he'd get to the dinner table and he couldn't quite elbow his older siblings out of the way and get enough food (laughter).
Speaker 1: Nine sib- eight siblings.
Speaker 2: Yeah, eight siblings, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Eight siblings is kind of rough.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he would often end these stories--and he'd talk about the family dog and the hunting, and all sorts of things.  And he was obviously--even though he left--and all my uncles as well as my father attended college.  My father didn't finish, but that is also kind of rare for that generation.  And but they all went to Detroit, because in terms of earning a living and wages, you couldn't do better than the auto factories.  They paid very well then and still pays very well now.  But he was obviously proud of the farm, because he'd tell me these stories and then he'd end the story--and I was quite young--he'd said, "One of these days," he would say, "Greg [HistoryMaker George White]," which is my middle name.  They called me Greg to avoid confusion with my father. "You're going to have a chance to own some of this.  What are you going to do with it?"  And I would always reply, "I'm going to keep it, Dad."  And--
Speaker 1: He liked that idea?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and later on I had to keep that oath, because there were some efforts to sell the land, and I ended up buying out a couple of my aunts.  And then eventually some of my other uncles and aunts said they weren't going to get any value out of this, and they really wanted to sell.  And it had to be sold as a unit if it was going to be sold at all under the will, unless there was some agreement among those in the will.  I arranged a sale for them, but we retained, me and my brothers [Anthony Dexter White and Derrick White] and sisters [Debra White and Charlotte White], about thir- forty acres of the land.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, I kept my promise to Dad.
Story_ID: 339807
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little ways, or see how far back I can take you.  On your [paternal] grandfather, Will White, how far back can we go from what you've heard or what you know someone has told you?  How far can we go to find out about him?  Can we--
Speaker 2: Um, you could--
Speaker 1: Could we go back to his childhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably.  I'm not sure what records might be available about my grandfather's parents.  But having purchased, you know, made some real estate arrangements regarding the property--and actually this was just a few, four or five years ago I made this trip to do this--I hadn't been there since I was a little boy.  But I did happen to do a little research.  So, there are some records about my grandfather and his acquisitions, and how he expanded the farm, and lots of property records relating to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there anything that could tell you about Will White was like as a child growing up, how far he went in school and so forth?
Speaker 2: I don't know that much about that there.  But I suspect that my surviving uncles could probably help me with that.  And it's probably the sort of history and information I should be seeking, and sort of get it recorded.  I do know from what my father [George White] told me, and my father's deceased, that he was, he was a taskmaster, but a very bright man and obviously a man who managed his money well, and knew the value of real estate.  And obviously, he was a good farmer as well.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Right.  Was that something, though, that he learned education-wise, formal education-wise?  Or was that just something that came naturally to him?  Or was that--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure how far he went in school.  But it's clear to me that he valued education because all of his sons went to college.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And again, we're talking about going to college, black men going to college in the, you know, '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] and.  So that's quite an accomplishment, you know.  So it's clear to me that he valued education, and he understood that that could make a big difference in a person's life.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.  I'm going to ask you if you could name the eight children that Will and Daisy White had, your father being the last, the ninth, of course, George White.  But can you, will you name those?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  Artis [Artis White]--
Speaker 1: Spell that.
Speaker 2: That's A-R-T-I-S.  James [James White (ph.)], Willie [Willard White], Inez [Inez White], that's I-N-E-Z; Mary [Mary White], and one aunt who I only know as Tiny [ph.], I don't know her full name (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's fine.
Speaker 2: Let's see.  How many do we have here?
Speaker 1: We have six.
Speaker 2: Six, okay.  Um--
Speaker 1: Two more.
Speaker 2: Valona [Valona White].
Speaker 1: Spell that.
Speaker 2: V-A-L-O-N-A.  And--
Speaker 1: One more.
Speaker 2: One more.  I guess it must have been eight.  There was one who was adopted.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I've not met her.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, good enough.  And the eighth one was?
Speaker 2: Vermail [Vermail White], V-E-R-M-A-I-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough.  And of course the ninth one was your dad, George?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They all worked hard because your grandfather was a taskmaster?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How much can you tell us about your grandmother on your father's side, Daisy White?
Speaker 2: She kept a good house.  I think since my grandfather was such a taskmaster, we sort of needed a little softer touch from the other parent, and she provided that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Loving, caring, and she was obviously part of the farm.  She helped work the farm, and she kept the home together as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know much about her life before she married your grand--?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 339808
Speaker 1: I'm going to go back now to your mother [Edna Finney White], and ask you for her date of birth?
Speaker 2: Boy, I'd have to get that to you later, Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock].
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's fine.  How about the place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was actually born in Georgia, and her family moved to North Carolina when she was quite young.  I think she was four or five years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What part of Georgia?
Speaker 2: I'd have to get back to you on that as well.
Speaker 1: That's fine, okay.  And then her family moved to North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And is that where your mother and father [George White] met, in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, they all lived in the same area.
Speaker 1: The same area.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's go over to your dad.  What's his date of birth?
Speaker 2: I'd have to get back to you on that as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Good enough.  How about the place of birth?
Speaker 2: That would be Rutherfordton [North Carolina], in Rutherfordton County [sic. Rutherford County, North Carolina].  So, it's Rutherfordton, T-O-N at the end.
Speaker 1: Rutherfordton?
Speaker 2: Yeah, R-U-T-H-E-R- Ruther- R-U-T-H-E-R-F-O-R-D- and then T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, Rutherfordton.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what I thought it was going to be.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's about fifteen miles [sic.] outside of Charlotte [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay okay.  Now, let's go to your--first of all, do you know how your mother and your father met?
Speaker 2: I don't know the exact circumstances under which they met for the first time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they did date, and then married in North Carolina, and then moved to Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember the year they got married?
Speaker 2: I don't, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know the year they moved to Detroit?
Speaker 2: I can give you circa, the approximate.  And that would have been about '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, good enough.  Now, I want to get to your date of birth.
Speaker 2: December 3, 1953.
Speaker 1: And you were born in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you, how many siblings do you have, and can you name them for me?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have two brothers and two sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In order of age--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --Anthony Dexter White, Charlotte White--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Debra White.
Speaker 1: Um--?
Speaker 2: D-E-B-R-A, short for Debra.  And Derrick [Derrick White], D-E, double R, I-C-K.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough.  And this is order, so you are the--
Speaker 2: Oldest.
Speaker 1: You're the oldest?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any reason you didn't become a junior?  Are there any stories behind that?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm actually glad I didn't.  (Laughter) As I mentioned, my father was actually born simply George White, with no middle name.  And he adopted the middle name Bernard, I guess as a young adult, because that was his favorite writer [George Bernard Shaw] and one of his idols.  I didn't learn this until I was a young adult myself.  He--I turned out obviously to be a writer, and he--I think I must have been twenty-two or twenty-three when he told me that that his aspiration as a young man, and that that's where the Bernard came from.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But they named me George Gregory White [HistoryMaker George White], which technically makes me not a junior.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they call me Gregory to avoid confusion in the household.  Now, I was known in the neighborhood as Gregory as well, but always known in school as George.
Story_ID: 339809
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your grandfather, I'm sorry, your father [George White], and take a look at--do you know anything about what he was like as a student growing up before college?
Speaker 2: Before college?
Speaker 1: Yes, any discussion?
Speaker 2: He was a, he was a good student.  He was a reader, and ambitious--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, intellectually.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He went to school in Rutherfordton [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he went to college at North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --as did his brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough, okay.  What year was he at North Carolina--what years was he at North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd be guessing here, because I'm just not certain.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm guessing it was the early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And all of his siblings went to college?
Speaker 2: All of his brothers.
Speaker 1: All of his brothers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't think my aunts went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's sort of an interesting--
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: --pairing of my parents, with my father's side being, you know, wealthy with lots of land and well-to-do, by standards of both black and white, actually, in North Carolina--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and my mother [Edna Finney White] being the daughter of sharecroppers.  So--
Speaker 1: Right.  And I was going to bring that out a little bit more.  It wasn't uncommon to think well to do well, that men had to go to college, and women don't.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And to have that thinking on the black and white sides.  Okay, your uncles then went to college.  James [James White (ph.)], what did he study?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure what any of them studied--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't know much about A and T.  It's, I think it's likely that they had some liberal arts education and maybe some technical--well, obviously, there must have been some technical training, because it is A and T.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And one of the things at these agricultural schools, or schools that start off with that agricultural base, much like my own alma mater, Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], is that there's some teaching in horticulture--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and agriculture and general farming, and technology.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I'm sure they had a mix of studies that included some liberal arts and some, you know, technical and agricultural training.
Story_ID: 339810
Speaker 1: James [James White (ph.)], your Uncle James, what did, what kind of work did he do?
Speaker 2: They all worked at the, in the auto factories.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultanoeus) Yeah, they all migrated to Detroit [Michigan], the pay was great.  That meant they were part of that great black migration--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to the North, specifically a migration that was motivated by jobs.  Or actually, what generated the interest was jobs in the auto industry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course that included not just black folks, but also whites from the South as well.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, absolutely.  Since all of them eventually moved--including the women, right?  Since all of them eventually moved to Detroit, who took care of the farm down there?  Your grandfather [Will White]?
Speaker 2: Two aunts stayed behind, and my grandfather who lived a long life, as did my grandmother [Daisy White].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe they had some hired help as well.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: I'm certain.
Speaker 1: Which ones stayed behind?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Vermail [Vermail White] and Tiny [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  And everybody, everybody else including your mother [Edna Finney White] and your father [George White] moved to Detroit?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Was your mother working in the auto factory also?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She, she did work at times when we--I guess as I was growing up, she did not work.  I think she started working when I was about eleven or twelve.  And she worked at the local hospital for about five or six years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think she did, yeah, she also did some work for a defense contractor for a bit as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 339811
Speaker 1: And I'm trying to establish I guess some of the mores of that era.  Because your mother [Edna Finney White] moved to Detroit [Michigan] in 1949 with your dad [George White].  And of course, you and your siblings came along, and that's enough to keep her busy (laughter) without being in the auto factory.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I wanted to see if we could find out what kind of jobs the women who did go to Detroit were working in?  Were they working in jobs comparable to the men?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was manual.  I mean in the case at the hospital, my mother worked in the laundry room.  And she, when she worked for a defense contractor, it was sort of a, they would, they'd make parachutes.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And basically--
Speaker 1: Because now, we're in the middle, we're still in the middle of the war [World War II, WWII].  No, the war was over when your mother and your father went.  But I'm imagining that your uncles and aunts went up there, what, during the war or prior?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  My father's older brothers undoubtedly went there during, when the auto factories were being converted to make tanks and other military equipment.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And one of my uncles, Willie [Willard White], Willie B., actually served in the, he served under Patton [George S. Patton].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So he, there was a period when he was not in the auto factory, he was in the [U.S. military] service.  He was in Europe.  I think he was, yeah, he was in North Africa as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yes.  But I think by the time my father got there, the war was, if my chronology is right, the war was over.
Speaker 1: Over, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In 1949.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '49 [1949].  And but the, with the post, you know, the postwar economy, the U.S. just really exploded.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It really it just grew, as the U.S. became really the world economic power.
Speaker 1: And all the auto factories were converting--
Speaker 2: Right, back to--
Speaker 1: --back to autos--
Speaker 2: Back to autos, right.  And there was a boom.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they were, the auto industry was churning out, you know, millions of cars.  It was an economy that worked because everyone was paid high wages, and they could afford the cars they were making.  And in Detroit, even today--and this all started during the war and the postwar period--a housing boom as well.  So to this day, you have, the greatest housing stock per capita in the country is in Detroit.
Story_ID: 339812
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories?  You were born in 1953 in Detroit [Michigan].  What are your earliest memories from the time you were born?
Speaker 2: I was born in the projects on the east side of Detroit.
Speaker 1: Was there a name to them?
Speaker 2: It was Jeffries, it was the Jeffries Projects [Jeffries Housing Projects, Detroit, Michigan], I believe.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: My earliest memories as a child was growing up in the--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Let's go back.
Speaker 1: My earliest memories as a child was growing up in the projects of Detroit, the Jeffries Projects.  And at a very early age, I think was six, my family moved to northwest Detroit, which is where I grew up.  At that time, and actually for many years, it was a predominantly Jewish neighborhood.  I went to Schulze Elementary School [Schulze Academy for Technology and Arts, Detroit, Michigan].  My other brother and sister were too young to be in school, and there was only one other black kid in the elementary school besides myself.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And one thing that I really value from that period--
Story_ID: 340042
Speaker 1: All right.  You're entering Schulze [Schulze Elementary School; Schulze Academy for Technology and Arts, Detroit, Michigan], one of two black kids entering Schultz.  And what was it like being the only--
Speaker 2: Well one of only two?
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: Well, it was different, you got a lot of attention; none of it was negative.  This was a largely Jewish neighborhood and a largely Jewish school.  I think these kids were taught about discrimination, that it was a bad thing.  I had very close Jewish friends.  My best friend was a Jewish kid, I remember.  His name was James Stahl [ph.], and he used to--whenever the teacher had his or head turned, he'd punch me in the shoulder.  That was his way of showing affection, sort of a playful punch.  And Jews value education, and they really make it a priority.  And they make sure that their schools are doing a good job, and they want their kids to be in the books and to excel.  And I benefitted from that, from that environment, no question about it.  I began to read at a very early age, and I saw that my schoolmates were all into books, and I was right with them.
Speaker 1: The, your family moving to that neighborhood--I don't know Detroit [Michigan] that well.  But just moving to that neighborhood, was that an effort by them to get you into better schools you feel, or do you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.  But it was an effort to improve our life generally.  They wanted to be homeowners, and as I mentioned, we were in the projects [Jeffries Housing Projects, Detroit, Michigan] before.  And this was a very, very good neighborhood.  It still is, relatively speaking, in Detroit.  And it made all the difference in the world, probably in terms of my life and how things have turned out for me.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, getting back to your parents' [Edna Finney White and George White] motivation for wanting to move out of the projects into this area where there were better schools and a better neighborhood I would imagine--did they ever talk about why they wanted to make that move?  And did they purchase a home when they made that move?
Speaker 2: Yes, they bought the home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a two-story brick house with a basement and a backyard, with a pear tree, cherry tree, a nice lawn in the front, squirrels running around.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And in those days, the elm trees were up and down the street; every street was lined with elm trees.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dutch elm disease later took out a lot of that stock.  But it was very pleasant, a very bucolic neighborhood, and a very dramatic change for me, although I was so young I really didn't have and don't retain much of a memory of my years in the projects.
Speaker 1: Right.  The, how long--did you finish school, elementary school at Schulze?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was, by the time you had gone through Schulze and about to go on to junior high or middle school, what was the racial makeup of the school by then?  Had the neighborhood changed, or was it beginning to change in the school?
Speaker 2: Yes, it had.  By the time I started, when I--in my elementary years, say, by the time I graduated from sixth grade, it had gone from 99 percent white to probably something like 70/30--70 percent white and 30 percent black.  And then by the time I graduated from junior high school [Beaubien Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan] three years later, it was 60, probably like 65 percent black and 35 percent white.  It changed very rapidly in those junior high school years.  And then by the time I graduated from high school, Mumford Senior High School [Samuel C. Mumford High School, Detroit, Michigan], it was 90 percent black then.
Story_ID: 340043
Speaker 1: That change was coming on--now we're talking about 1960s and a new president had come in, John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy].  Were you aware of the national change, from John F. Kennedy to where it had been, you know, to [President] Lyndon Baines Johnson and so forth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I guess I was twelve, eleven or twelve when Kennedy was elected.  I recall my, my mother [Edna Finney White] was a big fan of the Kennedy family.  They talked politics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this was a time of ferment in this country, you know, and my mother admired him.  I recall her saying quite often that he talked, Kennedy talked in his campaign about discrimination--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and about the status of black folks.  Later, because I became historian by training as--was a journalist, I know Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] was talking about those same issues, although he framed it slightly different.  He talked about, you know, how the U.S. looked in terms of how the rest of the world viewed the U.S., considering we had these racial problems.  I also recall their admiration for Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And I--
Speaker 1: Because he was beginning to force dramatic change in the country.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And your family and you were aware of those things (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, our parents wanted us to know what was going on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they wanted us to know some of the history behind this as well.  My father [George White] talked--that probably got him more excited and into talking about what was going on--I'm speaking about the Civil Rights Movement here--more than American politics did, whereas my mother was interested in both.
Story_ID: 340044
Speaker 1: And your father [George White] during this period was working at which, which auto (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC, Auburn Hills, Michigan].
Speaker 1: --at the Chrysler auto factory?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Let's--you are very much aware of what's going on around you.  The world is changing.  John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] is the president, and we're moving on to where [President] Lyndon Baines Johnson is taking over for a young American president who's been slain.  Do you remember that period when John F. Kennedy was slain?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Yes, I do.  And I remember coming back from school, and my mother [Edna Finney White] was crying because Kennedy had been assassinated.  I had no idea, I don't think they told us in school.  And I had never seen her cry before, and so it had an effect on me, and I knew that something terrible must have happened.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Did you ask her why she was crying (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she told me, she told me.  And the, I think I really began to take a keen interest in what was happening in the country, and in the news generally.  Not--the assassination didn't start it; it was probably the Civil Rights Movement--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I began to see the, the news footage of protests in the South where law enforcement was using dogs and fire hoses on nonviolent protesters.  And--
Speaker 1: How, how about your younger brothers [Anthony Dexter White and Derrick White] and sisters [Debra White and Charlotte White]?  Were they aware of what was going on?
Speaker 2: Not as--well, they were, but perhaps not as aware.  You know, they were younger, and perhaps were not as interested.  I don't recall talking very much about the news or world affairs with them as a child, although I had a great interest in it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I think they had, they weren't as interested.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what your father's reaction was to John F. Kennedy assas- being assassinated?
Speaker 2: He wasn't as moved as or disturbed as my mother, at least not visibly so.  And I think my father had some antipathy.  I think he had some real problems with the Democratic Party, being from the South and knowing that the traditions of the Democratic Party in the South was basically, you know, segregationists.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so he had some actual sympathy for Republicans, and actually had--when he talked politics from time to time, he would often talk favorably about Republicans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you could understand the historical context of that.  I think later, you know, he became a little bit more critical of Republicans, particularly the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] administration.  I'm moving sort of ahead here, but I remember initially when he was very supportive of Nixon.  And it was later when, with the war [Vietnam War] and the corruption and Watergate, you know, that he became-
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --disillusioned.
Story_ID: 340045
Speaker 1: You were in a school--were you in Mumford [Samuel C. Mumford High School, Detroit, Michigan] then or still in middle school?
Speaker 2: When Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: You may have been still in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let's see, I was, I was still in junior high school.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  And the racial makeup in these schools are changing?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What was it like?  I mean was there resentment, open resentment, quiet resentment?
Speaker 2: We tended to get along, although there wasn't as much mixing in terms of people, you know, black and white eating lunch together.  We certainly played together, we played games together.  It wasn't the, it was probably more--not exactly tension, but less collegiality compared to my days in elementary school [Schulze Elementary School; Schulze Academy for Technology and Arts, Detroit, Michigan].  But then again, the number of black kids there were dramatically lower.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was able to walk to my elementary school, it was just four blocks away.  We had to be driven to our junior high school, which was--
Speaker 1: You were bussed?
Speaker 2: Driven, my father [George White] would drive.
Speaker 1: Oh, your father drove.
Speaker 2: I suppose some kids took public transportation. But it was Beaubien Junior High School [Detroit, Michigan], it was a fairly large junior high school.  I can't recall the exact numbers, but the building was certainly big, and it was, you know, very different from my elementary school days when school was fairly small--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and in walking distance.
Story_ID: 340046
Speaker 1: When did you start to form ideas about what you wanted to do as a professional growing up?  And what kind of profession--did you start formulating or thinking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, what happened here was very interesting; it was a real fork in the road for me.  I did well enough in junior high school to be accepted at Cass Tech Senior High School [sic. Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], which is a very special school, a school for talented youth, with great academic credentials.  You had to be accepted there.  It was, it, you could call it an early day magnet school.  But Cass Tech had been in Detroit [Michigan] a long time.  It had always been there for so-called elite students.  And I was accepted to Cass Tech, which was downtown or pretty near downtown.  So, it was quite a long trip from northwest Detroit where I lived.  And this was a little pivotal.  The first day--like a college, you had to declare what they call a curriculum, not a major, but a curriculum.  And I chose commercial art because as a young kid I'd always been interested in art, and I used to draw.  I was a big comic book reader, and I think that got me into reading books, reading comics initially.  And I even created my own comics in elementary school and junior high school.  But it was something there that was a tip-off for me.  It was not just the drawing that I was interested in, but the storytelling.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was the whole idea, the notion of creating a comic book that involved stories as well as images.  But still, I thought I was really more interested in, and better at art, and that's what I really wanted to do.  So the first day of class at Cass Tech, the teacher said, "I'd like all of you to bring in some samples of your art tomorrow."  And so the next day I come in with my art.  And I look at my art, and then I look around the room at the art of my classmates.  And then I look at my art again, and I tell myself, "I'm not good enough."  (Laughter) And on that very day, I decided I was going to transfer back to my neighborhood high school--I mean not back, but to it, because I had never attended; this is my first day at Cass Tech.  And actually, Mumford High School [Samuel C. Mumford High School, Detroit, Michigan] was one block.  It was actually at the end of my block, the school itself.
Story_ID: 340047
Speaker 1: So it was like back to elementary school [Schulze Elementary School; Schulze Academy for Technology and Arts, Detroit, Michigan], where I'm going to a school [Samuel C. Mumford High School, Detroit, Michigan] very close to home.  It was the best decision that I could have ever made because I'm a much better writer than I ever would have been an artist.  And these days, the demand for hand-drawn--any kind of art, you know, other than the high arts--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --there's no need for it.  So this whole notion of commercial art today, we have computer generated art.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: No, it was a good, it was a really good decision on my part. I--my goal then--I realized I wasn't good enough to be an artist.  That was very limited, but I didn't know that until that first day at Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan].  I could draw people, but I had some difficulty with landscapes and animals, so I was very limited.  And I decided that what I really wanted to do was write, was write books, write fiction.  I guess I graduated--in terms of reading outside the class, from comic books to science fiction--and I loved science fiction--and so I decided I was going to be writer.  And early on, had an English teacher who I confided my goals, let him know about my goals.  He was actually very curious about me, and he actually asked me, "You know, what do you want to do, you know, when you're done here, down the road?"  And I told him, I said--and he said, "Well, until you write that bestseller, maybe you might want to take up a profession where you could use those skills in your interests."  And he said, "Why don't you join the high school newspaper?"  And he was actually the advisor for the high school newspaper.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he got me involved with the high school newspaper.  And I think that was my sophomore year, early in my sophomore year in high school, and I've been involved in journalism ever since.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, he saw something that you didn't know about yourself?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  We, I did all sorts of writing.  I actually helped edit the literary publication called The Muse [ph.], which won some national awards.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: So, we had some other people who were talented writers at the school as well.  And I was able to help bring them together and we put together and we put the--it had poetry, short stories, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. And even though you had opted (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) essays.
Story_ID: 340048
Speaker 1: And even though you had opted out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) essays.
Speaker 1: --of a very good high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], as I remember, Mumford [Samuel C. Mumford High School, Detroit, Michigan] is a pretty well thought of high school.
Speaker 2: Yes, Mumford was one of the top high schools in the country.  And again, if I recall correctly--you'll recall seeing the movie 'Beverly Hills Cop'?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Eddie Murphy is in it, this is the first movie.  He's running around in most of the movie in a T-shirt that says, Mumford Senior High School.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And the reason why he's wearing that T-shirt is that the two guys that wrote the movie went to Mumford High School.  (Laughter) And we still have some of the leading Hollywood writers and producers here today who went to Mumford High School in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Oh, is that right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jerry Bruckheimer.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: He went to Mumford High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  For some reason I thought Mumford quickly became a black high school, but apparently it didn't.
Speaker 2: Well, it did become quickly--because when I was, when I entered, I think again it was about--the neighborhood or actually the school itself was about 65 percent black, 35 percent white.  And by the time I graduated, it was pretty much 85 or 90 percent black, the high school.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So, this was a period of rapid change.
Speaker 1: And can you think of what year you made that switch to Mumford High?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  That would have been '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 2: Let's see, yeah.  Because I graduated, I started in Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] in '71 [1971].  So, yeah, that would have been like '68 [1968] or '69 [1969].  Yeah, '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, good enough.  Some of the other names--Jerry Bruckheimer was a favorite screenwriter of mine.  But Jerry Bruckheimer--anyone else that you can think of?
Speaker 2: Well, Jerry is older than me, but he (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: He came, he was there before I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think the two guys who wrote 'Beverly Hills Cop' also preceded me. The--it was still a very good school when I graduated, when it was 90 percent black.  I mean, its academic traditions had been maintained.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And it was a very challenging environment.  And we were never good in sports, maybe because we had so many kids interested in the books (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I'll never forget my first year in high school. We actually won the city basketball championship, which is amazing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Mumford never won anything (laughter).
Speaker 1: Mumford was cerebral students (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 340049
Speaker 1: So, any other fond memories or unpleasant memories at Mumford [Samuel C. Mumford High School, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Nothing but pleasant memories.  I have to say that my life as a person who wanted to make a difference really began in high school.  My next door neighbor and I both developed a keen interest in politics and in the world in general, and in particularly the history of black folks in this country and the plight of black folks in this country.  We were, I think in our sophomore year we were disturbed that in English classes we weren't given an opportunity to read black authors or black poets.  And in our history classes we weren't taught--this was a history without blacks.  And, we had a very stern principal.  And we decided to do something about all three of those issues.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And he and I sat down and we planned a student rebellion.  And we had plans for everything, in terms of recruitment, and the timing of when we were going to do this, and when we were going to do that.  And we shut down the school to get--we had a list.  We had all of our demands ready before we did a thing.  We wanted a black literature course.  We wanted, we wanted some black history.  It didn't have to be a complete course, but we needed our history to include some history of black people.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we wanted the principal gone.
Speaker 1: Okay, the principal had to go (laughter).
Speaker 2: And my memory is a little vague now, but I think the school shut down for three or four days.  Now, what's interesting about this--
Speaker 1: Who was the principal?
Speaker 2: I can't recall his name--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --unfortunately.  But the person who replaced him was black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I do recall--and this often happens during rebellions or revolutions or what have you; you don't know what you're going to unleash.  And although we planned and started it quickly, some other characters came in and they were suddenly the high profile, you know, activists, or those who got--you know, we got news coverage. TV--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The local TV news came out to find out what's going on Mumford?  And why are students protesting and--
Speaker 1: Now, why did the--
Speaker 2: In my case, I wasn't looking for the spotlight.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I just wanted some black history, some black literature, and I wanted this very repressive principal gone.
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Edna Finney White and George White] know that you were one of the leaders?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, they did.  I mean, I didn't tout it or talk much about it.  And--
Speaker 1: Were they concerned (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't think, I don't think they knew the extent to which I was involved in actually planning it and organizing it, though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this again was really sort of a pivotal, a really pivotal period.  Because when we got these, when we got the black literature course, that was important.  And then we had a teacher--and this was after our protest.  I don't know whether he got extra training or whether he knew this history; it may have been a combination of the two.  And I recall his name was Mr. Branson [ph.], he was black.  And it was an Afro American history course, forgive me.  But instead of--what he did, the first three weeks of the class, instead of teaching us African American history, he taught us about the ancient kingdoms of ancient Ghana, ancient Mali, and ancient Songhai.  These are proud kingdoms, rich and world-renown at their time, at the time, with universities before there were universities in Europe.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I was stunned.  And after the shock wore off--and we spent the first three weeks on this.  I was then angry.  Why hadn't I been taught this before was my reaction.  And it seemed to me that it would make such a difference in terms of people's self-esteem if they knew that their history did not begin in slavery.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that indeed their history was a great one, and that we black folks were creators of the earliest civilizations.  And that point I decided I wanted, I wanted to not be a teacher of African history, but a writer of African history, and that I in some form or fashion wanted to give people information about ancient Africa.  And that had a great bearing on where I attended university.
Story_ID: 340050
Speaker 1: The other great experience I had in high school [Samuel C. Mumford High School, Detroit, Michigan] was I had developed a late interest in music, and I began to take piano lessons.  I wanted to write music; I didn't want to be a performer, I wanted to be, to write music.  I was a very creative kid, and I had also sorts of creative interest.
Speaker 2: And all of this came during high school?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, uh-huh (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 1: And there was a high school teacher, Mr. Williams [ph.], who took an interest in me and tutored me on the piano.  And of course he knew about my involvement in the student protests, and he knew about my poetry in The Muse [ph.], the literary publication that won these national honors.  And I wrote poetry that really resonated with the other kids in school, and in this Muse publication and other publications.  And you know, it's funny.  I think now about those high school days of writing; this really started in junior high school [Beaubien Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan].  And we had a newsletter there, and I wrote a spoof called 'The Boy from Beaubien' [ph.] which was based on 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,' but it was a total comic spoof, and people really loved it.  And I guess I got that early affirmation from writing.  And so, it continued in high school.  So Mr. Williams, my music teacher, knowing about my interest in poetry, encouraged me.  He wanted to do a special graduation program with my class, and he encouraged me to try to come up with some poetry with a presentation that would wrap around 'Lift Every Voice and Sing,' the national black anthem.  And I developed something, and we presented it at the graduation, and people loved it.
Speaker 2: Wonderful.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We had a choir, you know, and between acts we got up and read portions of my wrap-around.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it all played off the lyrics of 'Lift Every Voice and Sing.'  I'd take that pause, and then add some things.  And that was pretty, a pretty uplifting experience.  And because of my association with him, he put me in touch with some folks who had, black kids who had previously graduated from Mumford, who were at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  And we'll talk about that next.
Story_ID: 340051
Speaker 1: You're getting ready to graduate from high school now, Mumford High [Samuel C. Mumford High School, Detroit, Michigan], and getting ready to go to college.  Before we leave Mumford, any other memories that we should be aware of?  You said all of them were pleasant?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the girls, but I'm not going talk about that (laughter).
Speaker 1: And they don't want you to.  (Laughter) Okay, how did you happen to select Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] as the school that you'd attend?
Speaker 2: Well, part of the influence was the music teacher, Mr. Williams [ph.], who collaborated with me on this special spa- graduation ceremony performance.  And he wanted me to meet some Mumford alums who were at Michigan State.  And again, this is another pivotal part of my life.  But that wasn't the main reason I went there.  I mean, that was one of a number of reasons.  Another reason was that they had, had and have, one of the best African studies programs in the country; that was another factor.  Another factor was that when I was a young kid--let's see, how old was I?  I was twelve--let's see, yeah, twelve, thirteen or so when Michigan State had those great football teams in 1965 and '66 [1966], they were number one in the country.  And remember that famous game against Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana], the famous 10-10 tie?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: What happened was my mother [Edna Finney White] sent me to the cleaners, which is just two blocks away.  And there was a black woman in the cleaners, (cough) and she was listening to a college football game.  I said what, I didn't know people listened to college football games. (Laughter) And she was listening to Michigan State.  And I was an avid baseball fan, and used to read the sports pages. (Cough) But I asked her about--what game was that, and who was playing?  And she told me, and then I began to look at the sports pages for stories on football at Michigan State.  And at that early age, before I was in high school--I was about, was getting close to getting into high school. While I was still in junior high [Beaubien Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan], I said when I grow up or get older, I'm going to go to Michigan State, and I'm going to be a quarterback for Michigan State.  (Laughter) Now, I had a big interest in pro football as well at a young age.  But suddenly I became a big college football fan, so those are three reasons I went.  I had contacts there from, you know, the Mumford alum, the great African studies programs.  And Mich- and even though I had decided early on--yeah, actually by the end of junior high school that I did not want to be an athlete in college.  And I actually decided--even though I was a very good athlete in various sports, especially baseball as a pitcher, I did not want to be a professional athlete.  I wanted to be a writer--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and stick with those goals--
Speaker 1: You were still--
Speaker 2: I was still sticking with the goals that I had set, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in high school, early in high school.  But that allure of Michigan State for that pro football program--and then they accepted me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because additionally, the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] did not.  But then I think two weeks after I got a letter saying they had not accepted me, then I got another letter saying--basically, they changed their mind.
Speaker 1: I mentioned how--what a great student I was in junior high school, in terms of grades, and I was good enough to get into Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan].  And contrast, my grades in high school were not as good.  What happened, I had got off to a fairly slow start.  I was an average student. It may have been partly because of all my interests.  And then of course the student activism--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was a distraction.  But my last year and a half, particularly in the ninth grade, you know, I was acing it, I was getting all A's.  I was totally focused, and realized that this was going to have a bearing on what kind of school I was going to get into.
Story_ID: 340052
Speaker 1: As a consequence, I was actually admitted through something they called the developmental program at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  And this was largely used to bring in people of color.  And it's ironic, because I ended up graduating--I know I'm leaping forward here a little bit, but I don't want to forget this.  End up graduating with honors from Honors College [Michigan State University Honors College, East Lansing, Michigan], which is a special college at Michigan State, you know, for students that excel.  So--
Speaker 2: Now, did Dr. Robert Green [HistoryMaker Robert Green] have anything to do with that?
Speaker 1: Well, he had a lot to do with a lot of my life during my undergraduate years at Michigan State.  Let me tell you how I met Bob Green.  And this relates to these Mumford [Samuel C. Mumford High School, Detroit, Michigan] alums who I was introduced to by my music teacher.  These guys were all heavily involved in student politics, particularly black student politics.  And as a freshman, they arranged for me to be named director of the Office of Black Affairs [OBA], which was an organization that received university funding.  They provided, put the--the OBA put together special programs for black students.  We had a budget and offices in the Student Services Building.  And being precocious, I didn't run from that opportunity.  I said, "Sure, I'll be director."  And we were on the third floor of the Student Services Building at Michigan State, the same floor that the State News is located, which is the daily student newspaper.  And I guess it might have been my first term, or it might have been my second.  But one of the students came into the Office of Black Affairs and said, "Come quick, Dr. Green--" they were speaking of Dr. Robert Green, "--is raising hell at the State News office."  So, I walked down the hall to find out what was going on.  Now the State News was, and still is today, one of the best student newspapers in the country, it's got this great tradition.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At that time they had won, I think at least four Pacemaker Awards, which is the award for the best college newspaper in the country.  They had never had a freshman on the staff.  You don't work for the State News if you're a freshman.  If you're lucky, you can get a job--if you're lucky you can get a job there if you're a junior or senior, you know.  I walked down the hall, and Dr. Green is standing in the middle of the room, and he's talking to the top editors of the paper.  And he's saying "Where are the black staff members?"  There were none.  And the editor--I came in and the editor was responding about it, and he was saying, "Well, we haven't had any blacks apply."  And I'll never forget Walter [ph.], one of these Mumford alums, who got me involved in this.  And Gerald Ethan [ph.] was the other guy.  But immediately Walter said, "Well, here's George [HistoryMaker George White], he's applied."  I hadn't applied for anything, but I had enough sense to keep my mouth shut.  (Laughter) I was shocked, number one, at what was going on.  And then suddenly I was like, you know, Walter's saying, "Here's George, he applied."  And the editor responded, "Well, come back tomorrow, and we'll get your paperwork filled out, and we'll get you on the staff," (laughter).
Speaker 2: Just like that?
Speaker 1: Just like that.  Just like that, I became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, what was Walter's full name?
Speaker 1: It was, what was Walter's name?  I'm going to have to really think and get that to you, because I think he's probably doing something important somewhere today.  They were all, this whole clique of Mumford guys were pre-law students.  I mean, they all wanted to go to--Michigan State didn't have a law school, they were just--but they were getting prepared to go to law school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I'll think of, hopefully think of Walter's name later.
Story_ID: 340053
Speaker 1: They had never had a freshman work as a--so, not only--I don't know whether they ever had a black person on the staff [of the State News] before me, or--I know for sure they never had a freshman (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And suddenly I was there as both a freshman and a black person, not to cover the black stu-
Speaker 2: You were double-token?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Not to cover black students or anything like that, or what was happening with black students [at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], but just as a regular staff member. And, but keep in mind, I was experienced when it came to publishing, going back to my junior high school [Beaubien Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan] with the newsletter, and 'The Boy from Beaubien,' [ph.] and then in high school [Samuel C. Mumford High School, Detroit, Michigan] with the student newspaper and then with The Muse [ph.], a literary publication.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, I wasn't daunted.  I was, I didn't--but then I knew the tradition at the State News, that's why I didn't even dream of working on the paper that early.  You know, I never even thought about it.  But suddenly I was there, and I was going to take advantage of it.  So, not only did I do regular reporting--you could if you wanted to, but you weren't going to get paid extra.  But you could also write an opinion column, and I did that on a regular basis, as well as my regular reporting duties.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I just wrote a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is all in your freshman year?
Speaker 1: My freshman year.  I remember one of the first columns I did was a column on lead paint poisoning, and the creation of the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] by Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], the Environmental Protection Agency.  I remember doing stories, writing opinion columns on money and politics.  I wrote a satirical column, a la Art Buchwald about, you know, the renting of the White House [Washington, D.C.], you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And my very first news story, I think it was my first, it might have been my second, was a story where I profiled this couple of Indian descent who had been forced out of Uganda by Idi Amin when he forced the Asians out of Uganda.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And this tied into my interest, obviously, to Africa.  And so that--
Speaker 2: And this is 1973, right?
Speaker 1: No, this is 1971.
Speaker 2: Seventy-one [1971]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And again, I was a freshman.  I continued to do this all my freshman year and all my sophomore year.  It was seminal, and it was important because I got the kind of early experience that, you know, no one got.
Story_ID: 340054
Speaker 1: Consequently, after my sophomore year [at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], I got an internship at the Detroit Free Press.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's very early for getting an internship in a major newspaper.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it was because I had that experience [at the State News].  And again, this was something seminal.  I remember Neal Shine, he was the managing editor for many, many years, asking me during the interview--oh, let me just say this.  That same--I turned down The New York Times because I had already accepted the Free Press offer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: For a summer internship.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I remember--
Speaker 2: And The New York Times wanted you to come to New York [New York]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And spend the summer?
Speaker 1: And I told them I'd like to, but I've already committed to the Free Press.  And so, during the interview with Neal Shine, he asked me what was I majoring in?  And I had great clips, you know, again, freshman through sophomore.  And I said, "Journalism."  And he said, "Why are you majoring in journalism?"  He said, "You don't need to major in journalism when you've got all of this kind of experience.  If you really want to make yourself extra special and sort of unique, you need to major in something else and continue to work the student newspaper and get internship, et cetera."  He said, "There's not much more you're going to learn in journalism classes when you're actually working as a journalist, albeit part-time."  And I thought about it, and he was serious.  And I said, "Wow, well, this will give me a chance to focus more on African history, which is my passion."  And my roommate in college, W. Kim Heron, who is a cousin (cough) of Gil Scott-Heron--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was a genius, a great guy.  He was a National Merit Scholar, and he was in Honors College [Michigan State University Honors College, East Lansing, Michigan].  So I was aware that there was this Honors College.  And what was, what was so great about Honors College, if you were in Honors College, you could waive all sorts of pre-requisites that the other students had to take.  And you had, you could have a real active role in fashioning a very unique academic program that fit what you were interested in.  It gave you a lot of flexibility.  So, my grades were good enough so that I could transfer out of the school of arts and letters, which included the School of Journalism, and transfer into the Honors College.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that allowed me to get a double major.  Because I had already taken, you know, not a whole lot, but I had taken a lot of journalism courses in my freshman and sophomore years.  So I said I don't want to just waste those classes.  You could get a double major through Honors College, and that's what--after the Free Press editor told me, you know, "Get a major someplace else," that's what I decided to do, get a double major.  And I ended up becoming, taking a lot of classes in African studies.  And one of those contacts--it was more than a contact.  We became, he became sort of a mentor to me.  He was the director of the African Studies Center at the time.  His name was Alfred Opubor, a Nigerian, who actually got his B.A. at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  He ended up getting his master's [degree] and Ph.D. at Michigan State.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in communications.  And I'm leaping forward again here again, time machine-wise.  But I was just in Egypt recently as a consultant for the creation of a pan-African global TV and radio network.  And he was the one who got me involved in this as a consultant, or as they call it, a medium expert.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He, after leaving Michigan State was the director of the Pan-African News Agency for many years, which is the African version of the AP [Associated Press].  So, again, all of this--really important and seminal things that happened to me during my years at Michigan State.
Story_ID: 340055
Speaker 1: But after two years at, after, after I got that internship at the Free Press [Detroit Free Press], I was still the only black reporter on the staff with the State News.  And there was a black student newspaper, and the guy in charge of it was a graduate student [at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  At first they approached me about writing for it, and I said, fine, I guess I could.  And then they said, "No, you really need to help us edit this."  And for a while, I actually did both.  I was actually editor of what was called the Grapevine News [sic.]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I was also a staff writer and columnist for the State News.  I think I did this for six months or so, and it was just overwhelming, particularly now that I was in Honors College [Michigan State University Honors College, East Lansing, Michigan] and taking all these classes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so I decided to quit the State News to work full time as the editor, the executive editor of the Grapevine Journal--that was what they called it, not the Grapevine News.  Because it was the only way I could help other black students get experience working for a newspaper, and experience working with an editor who had some expertise.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The person who was in charge of it, the graduate student, really wasn't a journalist, and really wasn't into writing.  He was good at getting advertising and that sort of thing.  And--
Speaker 2: Who were some of the students?
Speaker 1: Oh, you'd be amazed.  Jackie Bates [Jacqueline Bates], who I think she's still with The Washington Post.  These are all people who worked under me for the Grapevine Journal.  Cassandra Spratling did some work for us; she's now the editor of the Detroit Free Press.  Kim Heron [W. Kim Heron], my roommate worked for many years with the Free Press.  Larry Gabriel, my other roommate, actually ran the alternative--I think he's now in charge of the alternative, the leading alternative newspaper in Detroit [Michigan]; I can't recall what it's called.  A lot of these alternative newspapers are really big, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: These are weeklies, the alternative weeklies.  I'm trying to think of the others.  There were others, I'm not sure I can think of them all now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But there was a large cadre of people who worked on the Grapevine Journal, and they all went into mainstream journalism.  And I guess I made a difference in their lives (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Because I was there, you know, to run the paper and recruit people, and to make it a really good publication.  And it was excellent.  I mean we would come out with our orientation issue in the fall, and I think within one year we got up to like sixty-two pages.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so these, these, these are really important, really important period for me (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How many-
Story_ID: 340056
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many blacks were on campus [of Michigan State University, Detroit, Michigan] then?
Speaker 2: We had the largest, and it's probably still the case today, I don't know for sure.  But at the time when I was a student, from '71 [1971] to '75 [1975], we had the largest black student population at a predominantly white institution in the country.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: We had, there was something like forty, something like--
Speaker 1: East Lansing [Michigan] is not a bastion for liberalism.
Speaker 2: No, but we, you know, obviously, you know, you got Detroit [Michigan], you know, with its huge black population there.  And Lansing [Michigan] has a, you know, fairly sizeable--I think even then I think Lansing was maybe 20 percent black or something like that, the capital of the state.  There was an auto factory there as well, Oldsmobile.
Speaker 1: Right.  But they had a terrible record of accommodating African Americans.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Michigan State actually was fairly progressive.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Not like the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]; they had a slightly better record.  They came late to Michigan State, but compared to other predominantly white institutions, they were, I think they were sort of on a cutting edge.  If I recall correctly, something like maybe 8 percent, 8 or 9 percent of the 45,000 students at Michigan State were African Americans.  And then we had an African American president, Clifton Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I have to say during these years there was, it was the height of the protest period against the Vietnam War.  And there was a draft then, and that had a lot to do with it.  But you know, in my case, I learned about the history of the Vietnam War, and realized that it was an unjust war, that these folks were fighting to free themselves from colonialism, from the French, and then somehow we got involved.  And but at the same time I was sort of--because of my involvement with student journalism, I was somewhat of a high profile figure.  And you could say that I sort of got co-opted by the university establishment because I suddenly I was on Clifton Wharton's, the president's student advisory board.  And we had on one occasion, well, actually, it went on for I think about a week, some massive protests on campus.  And the first day, the state police came on campus, and there were clashes with students.  And as a result, the number of protestors the following day grew exponentially, and we had sort of an emergency meeting with the president.  And there were others who joined me to keep the state police off the campus, because it was only making the situation worse.  And we said let it, you know, just let the students let the steam off and hear what they had to say.  And let them get their voices heard, and then maybe things will go back to, you know, to normal.  But you know, this wasn't--people had a right to assemble and to protest, and he took our advice.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's smart.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a smart guy, he was a brilliant guy.  And he, like Bob Green [HistoryMaker Robert Green], was someone I looked up to, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he was sort of a ment- not so much a mentor, because I didn't have to spend a lot of time with him.  But I did--you know, we would have these lunches once a month or so.  And often he would have, other people would have faculty leaders at these same meetings, and that sort of thing.  And his assistant at the time, it's interesting, was James Spaniolo, who I got to know pretty well.  And then he, James later became head of the College of Communication of Arts [sic. College of Communication and Arts and Sciences] at Michigan State, which includes journalism, public relations, TV and radio, so many departments.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And again, that's one of the best colleges of its kind in the country, ranking right up there with Annenberg [Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism], here at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California].  And we actually connected just recently, just a few years ago.  He's now president of the University of Texas [University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, Texas] at, is it Arlington?  Yeah, I think its Arlington.  He's now a university president in the UT System [University of Texas System].
Speaker 1: Okay, in Arlington, Texas?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, we've kept in touch, since he found out I was here.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, it's funny how--you know, these contacts, these are things you want to maintain through the years.
Speaker 1: Oh absolutely, lifelong.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 340057
Speaker 1: Now, you're a junior [at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] at this time, when all of this is happening to you?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Am I correct (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What was your senior year like?  I mean, it seems like you've done everything.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my senior year was fairly uneventful, compared to, you know, the turmoil of the protests, and my involvement with the Office of Black Affairs [OBA], and the founding of the Grapevine [Grapevine Journal].  I quit the State News, I think as I mentioned, after about six months of trying to do both.  So, my last two years I focused on just the Grapevine Journal.  And as I promised The New York Times that following summer at the end of my junior year, I was an intern at The New York Times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in my senior year, it was probably relatively uneventful compared to the other years, not that nothing happened.  (Laughter) I was just completing my studies, and looking to see where I was going to land my first job.
Speaker 1: What was The New York Times like at that time?  You went and you were there in New York City [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I lived in Manhattan [New York], and the--I think I lived in Midtown.  I lived in walking distance from The Times.  I'm trying to remember the building that I lived in.  It was sort of a boarding house of sorts, in the sense that, you know, you pay the monthly fee, and you could also get meals with that, you know.  So, they didn't pay interns as much then, and I guess they still don't now.  (Laughter) So, and as you know, Manhattan is very expensive.
Speaker 1: Very expensive.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I didn't have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were some of the people there at The New York Times?  This was what, '74 [1974]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, you had Scotty Reston, James Reston, of course, columnist.  And I saw R.W. Apple once, but he was based in D.C [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was a correspondent.  I remember once talking with Hedrick Smith.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I hadn't thought about any of this in a long time.  Oh, boy, all the giants, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of the day.  And they were just, I had always wanted to--I hadn't ever even been to New York until I was an intern that summer, and it was just such a thrill, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was an eye-opener, because it's like no other city I'd ever been in.  And it was just a great experience.  And then when I graduated, The Times, as you know, does not hire any writers right out of college (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, but The Washington Post did have a program where they hired interns out of, you know, people who had just graduated.  And if they liked you enough, you could be hired after an intern period.  So I took a job with The Washington Post.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think there were like fifteen of us, yeah.  And they only hired two, and I was not one of the two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I took my first job at a paper that I had studied in journalism school.  I was so--really impressed with their layout, and they always- they had a great tradition of journalism as well.  The Minneapolis Tribune [Star Tribune].
Speaker 1: Okay, Carl Rowan's old paper.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 340058
Speaker 1: All right, let's, let's go back and see how many of the, what--the makeup, African American makeup was for The New York Times when you were there as that intern.
Speaker 2: Well, the percentage was very small.  It's probably not very big now, but it was very small then.  This was true for most of the major so-called elite newspapers.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But there were a few, and they were all the best, and you had to be the best to be there.  So, I was impressed to meet people like [HistoryMaker] Paul Delaney, Earl Caldwell, Gerald Fraser [C. Gerald Fraser].  That's about all I can recall from The New York Times.  And then the following summer--was after my senior year at the internship at The Washington Post, one that could have led to job.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But they hired, they hired--and it's still probably true today--very few of those interns to really just say it was a good opportunity for folks.  But people like Leon Dash [HistoryMaker Leon DeCosta Dash] who was well-established there--[HistoryMaker] Milton Coleman was fairly new there at the time.  He had formerly worked in Minneapolis [Minnesota], where I was to end up working my first full-time job.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And curiously enough, my first, my internship with The Post [The Washington Post], I was posted in Prince George's County [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had the wildest, worked in the wildest bureau, with three real characters--Courtland Milloy--
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 2: --Hal Logan, and Elizabeth Becker.  And Hal and Courtland were just, they were a trip.  (Laughter) I mean, these guys were outrageously funny, you know, but also very talented guys.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I guess Courtland is still there.  Is he still writing a column (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He's still there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, that was an experience.  And I enjoyed actually being in the bureau, because it gave you more independence than if you were working in the main newsroom.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And actually, my goal was--and this really is to bring back some of my ambitions of writing things relating to African--writing African history.  My goal was to work as a foreign correspondent, and to be based in Africa.  And so, any kind of bureau work would add to my resume as someone who could do bureau work, who had the independence, who was able to be a self-starter.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, I was very pleased to be there.
Story_ID: 340059
Speaker 1: And so they [The Washington Post] had fifteen interns, but they only hired two, and you were not one of those two (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so where di- where did you go?
Speaker 2: I ended up going to Minneapolis [Minnesota] to The Tribune [Minneapolis Tribune; Star Tribune].
Speaker 1: You've graduated now [from Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you went to Carl Rowan's old newspaper?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  And they had a great tradition.  And Minnesota had generally, not just at the Tribune, but a tradition of producing great journalists, people who were going through there and becoming great journalists, or being a native Minnesotans and becoming great journalists.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I had never been there.  And I thought I was, when it came to cold weather, I thought I was pretty tough, but just didn't know how cold cold could be.  (Laughter) Of course, Chicago [Illinois] has the reputation, but the Twin Cities [Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota], they have the wind.  I mean, its plains country.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it's prairie country, and you get that wind whipping with the cold, and the wind-chill factor of twenty, thirty below.  So, but many other things made it a great experience for me.
Speaker 1: What was it like as a cub reporter?
Speaker 2: It's interesting, because the Tribune had an internship program.  And this was a minority internship program, and it had been a revolving door.  I think they had at least two or three, maybe even four of my--previous interns who had been hired for the intern period.  You know, you had sort of a probation period I think, for like nine months or a year, or something like that, had not been retained, and there was actually one other minority intern on the staff when I was hired.  And it was made clear to me--I mean some people were telling me, she wasn't doing so hot.  She wasn't going to make it either.  I think I had been on the job two weeks or three weeks.  And I remember one editor exclaiming after reading some of my copy, "We got a good one," or something to that effect.  (Laughter) I mean it sounds patronizing, and now it is patronizing.  But at the time I remember saying, "Well, I guess that's a compliment," (laughter).
Speaker 1: What year are we in now, '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: We're in, yeah, '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was a new intern.  And I think after--this will bring back a couple of other memories, Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock].  After I'd been there I think four months, some white members of the staff--I think it was at least two or three people--came up to me and said, "Hey, you know, you're really good.  You don't need to be under this minority intern status."  And they encouraged me to go and see the editor and ask to be, you know, a regular full-fledged member of the staff.  And I did so, and the editor agreed that my work was merited me being placed on the staff.
Story_ID: 340060
Speaker 1: And I was assigned to general assignment and I loved it, because I got to do a little bit of everything [at the Minneapolis Tribune; Star Tribune].  And I had, and I have, very broad interests. The--I got a--very early on, I had a great deal of interest in the Native American population.  There was a very large Native American population in Minnesota, as you know.  And they weren't being covered.
Speaker 2: At all?
Speaker 1: At all.  I mean, I guess I could relate to them; they were people of color.  At this time, there were almost no black folks in Minnesota.  (Laughter) It was like, I mean if I saw a black person on the street, it was an event, you know.  There was a very small neighborhood in Minneapolis [Minnesota] there at that time where blacks lived.  And I didn't live in that neighborhood and didn't get to it very often.  So, but I, even before I arrived in Minnesota, I have to admit I had sort of an interest in the Native peoples, and felt that their culture and history had been ignored or covered up.  And so every chance I got, I agitated to do stories on them, and every now and then I got to do them.  I was assigned, my first beat was really sort of a mini-beat.  It was like I would do some GA [general assignments], but anytime there was any news related to Dutch elm disease, I was assigned to do that.  And it became, it sort of evolved into sort of an urban environment beat.
Speaker 2: Now, you knew about Dutch elm disease (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --from your neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Growing up in Detroit [Michigan], that's right, seeing all our trees get diseased and a lot of them cut down.  And I was really somewhat, well, obviously interested and concerned, for that reason.  I knew what this could do, you know, to an urban population.  And it evolved into sort of an urban environment, and I enjoyed doing that.  I really covered very closely.  Every winter though, I would ask myself, why am I here?  (Laughter) But when spring would roll around, and summer, it's really beautiful there.  You have lakes everywhere, and a lot of cultural institutions in the city.  And the people are very friendly.  And--
Speaker 2: How long did you stay?
Speaker 1: I stayed there four years.  And it's--what happened is I was getting sort of excited that I wanted to--if I was ever going to be able at any time in my life to write some African history, I needed more than a B.A. degree.  So, I decided I was going to go back and get my master's [degree] in African history, not to teach, but you know, sort of improve my expertise.  So, I gave the paper some notice.  I had done--by the way, I had almost skipped over this.  A good bit of investigative work, including some major stories that were copyrighted front page--a whole series of stories on the scamming of minority contrac- minority contracting, where the federal government--these are--we have many federal government contracts.  I think there were some state contracts, too, where you had blacks operating as fronts for white companies--accepting money and, you know, taking--they'd be giving them a small portion, and most of it would go to a white firm, including some exposes of some high profile black folks that were involved in this.  So, that was sort of a milestone in investigative coverage for me.
Story_ID: 340061
Speaker 1: And I gave my notice.  I told them--I'd gotten this fellowship from the Lilly Endowment [Lilly Endowment, Inc.], and I was now going to have all my, all my expenses paid, plus I was going to get a monthly stipend.  I was going to go back to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  And so I gave my two weeks' notice, and then in four to two weeks, something happened.  There was a report of a rebellion on an Indian [Native American] reservation called Red Lake [Red Lake Indian Reservation, Minnesota].  And the report was that there was some sort of flare-up of violence.  And this is one of those sovereign areas where they have their own police, their own courts, their own constitution, tribal council, elected officials.  And so, the report was that the rebels had rounded up a couple of cops and put them in a jail cell, and the jail was on fire, they set it alight.  And because I had done coverage--one of the frustrating things I had happen to me at the Tribune [Minneapolis Tribune; Star Tribune] was that I was able to get some stories done on Native Americans.  But for the most part, they didn't want, they didn't want, they didn't want the stuff.  And I had been doing, working on a series on how the educational system, the public schools, had been failing Native Americans.  And it had never appeared, you know; they sat on it, you know.  So then this violence happened at the Red Lake Indian Reservation, and they asked me to go up, and paired with a photographer.  And we flew up, I think it was up in Bemidji [Minnesota]; I think that's the nearest city.  And then we rented a vehicle, and as we were driving towards the reservation we heard a radio report that two reporters, that a reporter and cameraman from, I think it was WCCO [WCCO Radio, Minneapolis, Minnesota], the CBS affiliate, had beat us there, and that they were greeted by armed men who told them, who first told the cameraman to smash his camera on the ground.  They had weapons aimed at them.  And the cameraman smashed his camera, and then they told them to lie down on the ground. And then they put guns to their heads and told them they were going to kill them.  But they didn't kill them, they torched their car.  And these two guys had to walk back to Bemidji; that was the city.  I think it was Bemidji--I think it's the clear city, near Red Lake.  So, we were hearing this on the radio (laughter), so we ran in the other direction.  And--
Speaker 2: You were heading in the wrong direction.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) We got there and, yeah, there were a couple of people--as soon as we got there they were aiming weapons at us.  There was an old woman, and a kid who must have been thirteen or fourteen.  And the woman--I'm trying to get this right.  I think she had the pistol, and I think the kid had the rifle.  And they asked us who were we, and what did we want?  And we identified ourselves, and they lowered their weapons.  And then I approached them and asked them what was going on.  They said, "Well, this is a rebellion," and that the government was corrupt; that they were stealing elections, stealing money, jailing dissidents--just complete corruption, was what she was telling me.  She said that the people had had enough, that there was an uprising.  And I said, "Okay, what--I understand some police have been put in a jail cell," and that, you know, the place was set on fire.  And she said, "Oh, no, the leader of the rebellion had found out about that, and they got in and got these cops out before they burned."  These were Indian cops.  And so I said, "Take us there."  So, we got there, and we could see the jail facility smoldering.  Then suddenly, bullets starting flying around our feet.  And the old woman and the kid had left at this point.  He was, the photographer was taking shots of the jail cell and I was just, you know, sort of tightening up my notes for my first long interview about what went wrong here.  And one of the things the old lady had told us was that when the rebels rounded up these cops and put them in jail, they got all the guns that the police had stocked, you know, they took all the police weapons.  And there was also lots of liquor in there, liquor that the cops would confiscate from drivers who were driving and dr- drinking and driving.  So, you had a bunch, apparently, of men out there with guns and whiskey and liquor (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, my.
Speaker 1: And maybe some of these people were shooting at us.  Because they were missing, but it was a little too close for comfort.  I mean, one bullet missed my leg and foot by about less than, maybe less than twelve inches.  So we- there was a fire, and there was a fire department facility across from the jail.  And we just started running, and then we got inside the fire station.  They were shooting at us the whole way.  And then we got inside, slammed the door, and then bullets starting coming in through the windows.

Speaker 1: When the shootings died down, me and him got, you know, we left and went back to the hotel.
Speaker 2: You went back to the hotel?
Speaker 1: Yeah, back in the city.
Speaker 2: You didn't head back on the road back to Minneapolis [Minnesota]?
Speaker 1: No, not Minneapolis, to the nearest city.  I think it was Bemidji [Minnesota], I can't recall exactly.  But we were there to follow the whole story, so we knew--and we stayed in touch with our editors.  Lots of people were trying to help with logistics from Minneapolis.  People were checking with the feds, with the governor's office, to let us know, you know, what was going on, and where we should go next.  And so, we learned by making some calls that--we didn't have cell phones back then.  (Laughter) So--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We had to get through, first of all we had to get out of danger, so we went back to the nearest town in the hotel and made some calls.  And we found out that the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] was going to be there the next day, in big numbers.  The local police could not come to the--it was a sovereign country.  There had to be something like this corruption or destruction of federal property for the feds to come in.   The state couldn't do a thing, and neither could any of the other local--
Speaker 2: Because it was sovereign.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so we were back there early the next morning on the reservation [Red Lake Indian Reservation, Minnesota], at the site where the FBI was actually meeting with the lead- the leader of the rebellion.  And we just, and there were reporters from all over the country there from all the major news organizations--TV and radio, as well as newspapers.  We were all huddled outside waiting for the meeting to end.  And the meeting ends, and the leader of the rebels walks out of the meeting.  And the FBI had let him go, pending further investigation.  You know, his story had credibility, you know, because there were other people telling them the same thing about what was going on there.  And the leader of the rebellion walks past this huge throng of reporters, straight to me.  And I introduced myself, and he said, "Do you want a story?"  And I said, "Yeah," and he said, "Well, come with me."  He took no questions from anyone, and people were mobbing around him.
Speaker 2: Were you, were you were the only African American?
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: So, you understand maybe what he was thinking.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Here's somebody he wanted to talk to, another person of color.  And we stayed for two days, and he told me his story.  We never stayed any one place more than three or four hours, because he was concerned about the reprisals from the tribal council chief, the guy who was in charge of things.  The chief, I think his car was torched, and I think his house was damaged somewhat.  And there were I think three or four or five people killed in that first day of violence.  So, he was concerned that we not stay in one place, because, you know, they could catch up with us.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so even at night we would only sleep three or four hours in one place, and they would, you know, arrange for another place for us to go from there.  So, it was pretty harrowing.  But he gave me the whole story, and nobody else had it, with all the details about what had been going on.  And I was thinking, you know, I give my notice to you guys, and my paper [Minneapolis Tribune; Star Tribune] tried to get me killed (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) They had given you--
Speaker 1: So, you know, I could have stayed a little bit longer.  I think we were up there about five days, and just had front page after front page of long, you know, very detailed coverage.  And then I said, "I got to get back, because I've got to get packed."  And then when I get back, they're trying to get me to stay.  And they said, "Well, stay at least and finish this series you've been trying to--you know, this series on, on Native-- how the education system is failing Native Americans."  And much of it had already been written and finished.  I said, "Well, okay, let's get with it," you know, and I agreed to stay long enough to--
Speaker 2: Finish that?
Speaker 1: To finish that, which could have been in the paper, you know, a long time ago--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but somebody called for a five-part series. With lights- lots of sidebars rea- with each main bar. And then I was out.  I was out, and it was back to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Okay, where you worked on your master's [degree]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 340063
Speaker 1: What was it like being back at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]?  Things have changed a little bit.  And now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had--it was a very different experience.  The journalism school [Michigan State University School of Journalism, East Lansing, Michigan] asked me to teach, so I taught some journalism to make a little extra income, even though I had the stipend.  But I had to stop teaching because it was so, it was time int- so time consuming, you know.  And the grading of papers was just, takes up a huge amount of time.  And I had no idea how--you know, the way I looked at graduate school was like, you know, I can take a couple classes, you know, per term.  I had no idea how much work was involved-- how much reading, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Especially the reading, it was just incredible amounts of--it was very, very challenging.  But I did well, and again, this was, I was on non-teaching track.  I'd decided on this, again, because I wasn't planning to teach, which gave me a lot of flexibility, much like when I was in Honors College [Michigan State University Honors College, East Lansing, Michigan], to tailor my own academic study program.  So I would, I would not be able use that master's degree to get a Ph.D., because it was a non-teaching track, it was specialized study.  I could take a few more courses and probably qualify to use that to get a Ph.D. in African history, but that's the way I wanted it set up, because I wasn't interested in being called doctor.
Story_ID: 340064
Speaker 1: And so, my next goal, obviously was to find a news organization that had foreign bureaus that could get me abroad.  And I joined U.S. News and World Report magazine, and never thought I would end up back in Detroit [Michigan].  Because once I left Detroit, I thought I would not be back in a working capacity, certainly.  I was in the mode then, you know, to see the rest of the world.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I'd done the Detroit sort of thing--
Speaker 2: Right.  What year are we in?
Speaker 1: We're in, let's see.  I graduated with a master's degree [from Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] in '81 [1981].  So, this was like '82 [1982] that I joined the U.S. News--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in their Detroit bureau.  And, but I was eager to take the job, because, again, this is bureau work, something that appealed to me.  From Detroit, we covered obviously the State of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, and Western Pennsylvania.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this is a national publication, which was, you know, another--it was really a great thing for me.  The--but I was a little bit disappointed.  I guess I didn't fully understand how a magazine, how different it is from newspaper work.  If you're in a bureau, you very rarely get to write a standalone story.  I mean it's not extremely rare.  I mean, you might get an opportunity maybe once every three months or so to write a standalone story.  For the most part, you're developing material that goes into a national story.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And some of the old hands there who had been working in the bureaus for years, would basically file notes.  But I had been so used to, and so dedicated to writing a story, that every one of my files was a story.  I made sure the most important stuff was at the top, and that's what the national writers group--in this case they're based in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], as opposed to Time and Newsweek or Time where they're based in New York [New York].  But I just had to keep those skills, you know, going, so I would always file an actual story.  And I got to write standalones from time to time.  But I guess after, what, two or three years--like I said, it was three years or so I was looking, sort of looking to get back to the daily newspaper.  Besides, the U.S. News and World Report really didn't have a, they didn't have that many bureaus abroad.  They had, I think at one time, they had one in Cairo [Egypt] and South Africa.  But they weren't going to send me to South Africa; that was during the apartheid times.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, my opportunities were somewhat limited there, in terms of my specific interests working, in working abroad.
Speaker 2: And up to this point, you had not been assigned to a foreign bureau?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: All right, okay.
Story_ID: 340065
Speaker 1: So, when I was approached by the Detroit Free Press, and ironically the U.S. News and World Report bureau was actually based in the Detroit Free Press Building [Detroit, Michigan].  They rented out quite a few--it was a huge building.  They rented out quite a few offices for news organizations like AP [Associated Press] and Reuters.  I didn't have to think about it very much, because actually a daily journal gave you a chance to do, you know, write your own standalone pieces.  And so I guess it was '80--was it '84 [1984] or '85 [1985]?  This will be in the chronology that I think you already have.  But I joined the Free Press and as a business reporter, which was something different; I mean, it was specialized reporting.  I'll never forget when I interviewed with the Free Press, a business editor, he asked me to look at a couple of financial reports to see if I even understood what they were about.  And I did, you know, and he was somewhat surprised.  And one of the other things he asked me, he looked at an annual report, and he asked me where I'd find information about earnings and, you know, where to find something about depreciation, and all sorts of things.  And so I joined the staff, and I'm trying to recall, I guess initially there, too, I started as a general--oh, no, I know what happened, now that I think about it.  He wanted me to join the staff and cover the auto industry.  That's a very prestigious position in Detroit [Michigan].  And in those days, both papers had a cadre of reporters covering the industry.  But I think at the time, both the Free Press and the Detroit News, each had three reporters.  The Free Press had three reporters covering the industry, and so did the news.  At the time, if I recall correctly, the Free Press only had one, and they were trying to get two more reporters.  And I guess he must have been very surprised when I told him, "I don't want to cover the auto industry."  This was my thinking, and maybe it's because I grew up in Detroit.  But I never had an interest in the auto industry.  I know my father [George White], it was very difficult for him to work in the auto factory, considering he wanted to be a writer.  It was very dehumanizing work, doing assembly line work.  And unlike, you know, maybe a lot of males, I had never--never had all that much in interest in cars, in terms of the styling and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I was just never a car guy, it was just never one of my passions.  And I had to be honest with them and say, "I'm not, you know, I'm not interested in the auto industry."  And he said, "Well, please do it.  If you will join the staff and just do it until we find someone to replace you, then we'll put you on another beat."  And I agreed to join under those circumstances.
Story_ID: 340066
Speaker 1: So, now you've made a compromise with the Detroit Free Press (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: You're going to be an auto writer, automobile writer, until they find someone else?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, they, I think it only took them maybe five or six months to find someone else.  And I think I had kind of, something to do with my next assignment, which was to cover utility industries in the agencies that regulate them.  This included the telecommunications, the telephone industry.  This included the energy utilities, you know, people who provided the heat and lighting to our homes, and agencies like the public utilities commission [Michigan Public Service Commission] up in Lansing [Michigan].  And these are industries that really didn't get very much coverage.  But I was interested because it included Detroit Edison [DTE Electric Company, Detroit, Michigan], and it included a utility that had nuclear plants in the Detroit [Michigan] area.  I- if I recall correctly, we're talking about the Fermi 1 plant [Enrico Fermi Atomic Power Plant, Michigan], I think it was called.  It was the subject of the book, 'We Almost Lost Detroit' [John G. Fuller].  And that must have been at least seven or eight years before I arrived on the scene to cover utilities.  And they were building Fermi 2, and then you had--oh, I also covered energy companies.  We had some major energy companies in Detroit that were involved in coal and oil, and coal gasification.  American Natural Resources [American Natural Resources Company, Detroit, Michigan] was that company.  They were eventually gobbled up by a Houston [Texas] based company, and I covered that merger.  So, there was a pretty broad beat.  There was, you know, energy, there was utilities, telecommunications, and it appealed to me.  I mean, it involved things that I didn't know all that much about, but had an interest in.  And as it turned out the--oh, and then you had the other major utility in the state, I can't remember its name right now.  When I took on the beat, it was in financial trouble.  It almost went into bankruptcy when I, as I covered it.  Its stock got down to something like, I think it was like two or three dollars a share.  And it had been up in the thirty and forty dollar range, or something like that.  So, lots of turmoil.  And that was one of the big stories, and they finally began to dig themselves out.  And then the other utility had these nuclear facilities.  And I think it was the Fermi 2 plant that had the worst record with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, over like a three or four year period before I got there, and it just continued to get worse and worse as I worked that beat.  And I ended up reporting a lot of disturbing things about nuclear energy and about these plants.  And I'm going to move ahead a little bit here in my time machine.  But when I left the paper, the business staff had a huge lunch for me and presented me with, among other things, a drawing of myself, glowing from the radiation of going to these plants, you know (laughter).  Because I went into them numerous times, because they were always telling me, "We're getting this stuff fixed," you know.  And this was highly technical stuff, so we were really challenging the cover.  And in dealing with the regulators, that was interesting, because now I've got the chance to deal with both business and government.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we had some scandals here.  When we were finishing up, let's see.  Looking at '88 [1988], closing in on around my fourth year or so at the Free Press, I covered some scandals relating to, you know, some major companies that were like household names in Michigan, like Sanders Candy [Sanders and Morley Candy Makers, Inc., Clinton, Michigan], and office mismanagement stories.
Story_ID: 340067
Speaker 1: So, really went out with a blaze with both these stories about problems in nuclear energy and corruption.  But I was ready to make a move.  And what happened was I began to talk with The New York Times, and then talking with the Chicago Tribune.  The Tribune had actually made an offer, and I was not happy with it.  And then--
Speaker 2: You were getting ready to say you were not happy with the offer made by The New York Times.
Speaker 1: No, by the Chicago Tribune.  I was still waiting for the offer from The New York Times.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And at the same time, Michigan State's [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] football team, this school that I had become enamored with when I was like twelve or thirteen because they had these great football teams, they hadn't been to the Rose Bowl in twenty-two years.  (Laughter) And they finally made it, and I was not going to miss that.  And a good friend of mine knew I was going out, coming out here for the Rose Bowl, and he wanted me to meet a friend of his who was a journalist.  He was a journalist, and--
Speaker 2: What was his name?
Speaker 1: His name was Steve Franklin [Stephen Franklin].  He had formerly worked with the Free Press [Detroit Free Press] in the business news department, a Jewish guy who spoke Arabic, as did I.  I had studied Arabic during my master's [degree] studies for African history.  And that was one thing that--we became friends when we learned that we both spoke Arabic and we both played tennis.  I have to say, though, you know, sometimes you play down to the level of your opponent.  I could never get my good game going with Steve, because his game was so lousy.  (Laughter) And these were all close games, because he would hit the ball so softly, you know, and a lot of dinks.   And anyway, we were good tennis buddies.  But he was working with the Chicago Tribune at the time, based in Detroit [Michigan], covering the auto industry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --and he wanted me to meet a friend of his, Idibari Ingeri [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who's a staff writer here at the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times].  He gave me her number, and I called her about three days before I was to come here to the Rose Bowl, you know, for a weeklong Rose Bowl vacation.  And she was suddenly trying to talk me into applying for a job at the Times.  And--
Speaker 2: This is 1988 now?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this would have been, yeah, 1988.  And so I told her--my immediate reaction was, "Well, I'm looking to make a move.  And even if I wasn't, I'm always willing to talk.  But I don't know that I would like it out there."  I told her, I said, "Well, I spent time in Africa and in the Caribbean and Europe, but I've never been to California and don't know whether I would like it or not."  And I got out here and loved it right away--you know, it's the diversity, in topography and the climate, as well as its diversity in population.  And that all appealed to me, and it was very different than any other place I'd been to.  And I did the interviews while I was out here, and the Times, L.A. Times, like any other of the major news organizations, was slow to hire folks of color.  They didn't have many on the staff.  And I'll never forget--what I did before I left, I sent my clips off.  I sent these clips off, and a portfolio.  And when I finally got the person in charge of hiring on the phone, she hadn't seen my clips.  And we talked about an hour before I realized she was screening me, trying to decide whether I should even come in for the interview.  (Laughter) I think the next day she got the clips, and she called me back and had me in.  And because I was a business reporter with the Free Press, she had me meet with the business editor.  And so I interviewed with not just the business editor, but some of the assistant editors, and then the managing editor who was in charge of business news.  They had three managing editors set up at the time.  And things went really well.  And by the time I got back to Detroit, I think it was the very first day I was back--I got a call and they had an offer, and I accepted it.  And before--I'll never forget.  Before I even went on this trip, my mother [Edna Finney White] was like really giving me, sort of kidding me, and giving me a hard time about spending all that money to go to California to follow a football team.  (Laughter) So when I got back, I told her, you know, I said, "Mom, the football team got me a job," you know.  But then I still tell other people--and I tell them to this day--you know, the Times offered me the job, but the most important thing is we won the game (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 340068
Speaker 1: One of the things I wanted to ask you about, your dad [George White]--you're staying in touch with your mom [Edna Finney White].  And your dad, how's he doing?
Speaker 2: No, they're both deceased now.  My mother just died last year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father actually died of a heart attack like eleven years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your dad--yeah, okay, good enough.  But at this time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But my father was alive when I took the job with the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough.  I had wanted to make sure we included that in there.  But go ahead.  So, they're now offering you a job with the business section?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a general assignment.  But this--if I had not been a business reporter, or some reporter with some special expertise--here was the rule of thumb at the L.A. Times, like it was at The New York Times and The Washington Post.  You had to be a superstar, I mean really a real firm name with, you know, a credible track record, to be hired and brought to work downtown at the headquarters to write for the main edition.  Most of the people that they hired had to pay their dues, so to speak, because all three papers--I think The Washington Post less so than maybe The New York Times and the L.A. Times--you had, most people who were hired and worked in the bureau in various regional bureaus.  So, here in Southern California, at that time they had a lot more bureaus than they do now; they've cut back incredibly.  But you ended working in Orange County [California], in San Fernando Valley [California], the other valleys, San Diego [California], the huge bureau of San Diego, Long Beach [California].  And they had, these were zone sections.  I mean, each of these staffs created stories for sections that were zoned.  These were often substituted for what was then called, I think it was called the metro section--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --here.
Story_ID: 340069
Speaker 1: Let's go into just a little bit of a profile, so that people will understand.  The Los Angeles Times was noted as somewhat of a very racist organization.  Otis Chandler made no bones about it, of course.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Otis Chandler actually sort of changed the culture.  It was his father [Norman Chandler] and the previous owners of the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times], going back to Harrison Gray Otis, the founder.  It was extremely--not so much co- overtly racist in terms of being more racist than other newspapers, but extremely conservative.  The L.A. Times built Southern California, you could say.  They were the voice of the elite.  But more than that, they were, they led the charge for all sorts of developments, I mean everything from infrastructure to cultural institutions, leading the charge to build it, often putting your own money in it.  It was a powerful force, not just in Southern California, but statewide, but extremely conservative.  And this all began to change when Otis Chandler took over, I guess, who just recently died.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Otis took over, oh, I guess it was '67 [1967], '66 [1966], no, it wasn't that far back.  Yeah, it was about '68 [1968], '67 [1967], in that period, and he immediately began to transform the paper.  It might even be in the mid-'60s [1960s].  He began to really bring in top-notch journalists, and insist on top-notch quality journalism.  Previously, the L.A. Times was an enormously profitable newspaper that was poorly written, and the coverage was very much slanted, basically what many people refer to as a rag.  It was a very, very, lucrative rag for the Chandler family, for members of the Chandler family.  Otis began to change that.  When I arrived there--I'm going to say two things, and I'm going to come back to my point about the bureaus.  Because this whole time, something very significant happened later.  I talked about how most people who were hired had to work at those bureaus and pay their dues before they got a chance to go downtown and write for the main edition.  And because the L.A. Times, like most other news- major newspapers, were late to hire people of color, and they had the system--the farm system, which you'd use in baseball analogy--where the few people of color they had were out in the bureaus, okay.  And I would find myself being one of the few people downtown, and that's only because of my specialty.  So, again, if you were a superstar or you had a specialty, you know, as a reporter--and this all goes back to what Neal Shine was trying to tell me in the Detroit Free Press.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, he said get some special expertise, and you can bring that to the plate.  But I actually got it as a consequence, in my case, of working with the business news at the Free Press later on.
Speaker 1: Now, in spite of all of that--and you're right.  But in spite of all of that, you had two black women on the editorial page.
Speaker 2: Janet Clayton and Gayle Pollard.
Speaker 1: Right.  And one was the editorial director.
Speaker 2: Janet became a director later.  At that time, she was not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, later.
Speaker 2: They were both just writers at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there weren't a lot of them.  I'm trying to think of who else was working downtown at the time.  Because I'm wracking my brain here to get a sense of--
Speaker 1: Who's the person who--
Speaker 2: There weren't that many.
Speaker 1: --works at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ron--
Speaker 1: Ron--
Speaker 2: Ron Harris.
Speaker 1: Ron Harris.
Speaker 2: And Jube Shrieber [ph.].
Speaker 1: And Jube.
Speaker 2: And Jube worked in business news, so I actually had another black person in there with me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was there before I arrived.  And Ron was in the metro section.  I think there may have been--
Speaker 1: I don't think there were any more.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  There might have been one other person.  And if so, I can't think of it.  And you consider this was a huge staff, and oh, I think they had something like eight or nine hundred people in what we called editorial.  And that included everything from copiers, to photographers, editors, reporters, and various support positions for those editorial positions, you know, administrative assistants, to the, you know, top editors, et cetera.  That's a huge, that's a lot of people.
Story_ID: 340070
Speaker 1: I was initially assigned to, to general assignment [at the Los Angeles Times], which again, I liked.  The--it gave me a chance, you know, to do different things, and sort of get the sense of what I wanted to do.  And I realized what I really wanted to do was cover international trade.  But before I got that opportunity (background noise). Can we take a break here?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: I initially started as a general assignment reporter, which gave me a chance to do a little bit of everything.  And then aerospace was still pretty big in Southern California at that time, in terms of there being a number of companies that were involved in aerospace, aeronautics, defense contracting, commercial work, and aeroplane design.  We've had a lot of consolidation since then, and part of this big consolidation push, I got involved in the coverage of.  And that was the effort to buy, the effort to acquire Lockheed [Lockheed Corporation; Lockheed Martin] by a takeover artist based in Texas, a fellow named Simmons [Harold Simmons].  And the aerospace reporter was so busy with, you know, other potential mergers and just covering day to day things happening in the industry, they decided he needed some help.  So, they asked me to cover the Lockheed takeover battle.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I did that, and that was really high stakes business reporting.  And you want to be--because it was high stakes in the sense that The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, all the financial business magazines, this was a huge, huge story.  And so, it was sort of my first taste of, you know, large scale competition as far as business reporting, and getting on a national level.  There was even international interest in the story.
Story_ID: 340071
Speaker 1: And then I finally got a chance to do what I had wanted to do, because I thought I could bring my training into this.  And I, you know, I hate to go backwards now, but I'll, I'll, maybe I can tie the two things together here.  I thought as long as I'm here in the states with my interests in, particular interest in Africa, but interest in international affair in general, that I should try to do as much reporting on trade issues as I could.  And when I was at the Free Press [Detroit Free Press], that's when you had this huge movement to--first it started with the protests at the South African embassy, where people would just lay down and would have to be, you know, carted out.  This is all part of the anti-apartheid movement.  And then the activists got really smart, led by people like Randall Robinson, and realized that to really end apartheid, you had to end its financial support; you had to take that away.  And they began to campaign for dis-investment, to get U.S. corporations to divest from South Africa.  And in Detroit [Michigan], you had three of the top five U.S. investors.  I think three of the top five foreign investors in general, excuse me, foreign in general, were based in Detroit.  They were General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company], number one; Ford [Ford Motor Company], number two, and Burroughs [Burroughs Corporation; Unisys Corporation], which later became Unisys.  I believe was either number four or number five, with Burroughs being a huge computer company and business, business company.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the protests came to Detroit, where they began to do the same sit-in, lay down protests within the GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] and Ford buildings, where they would have to be dragged out by police.  It got the press coverage, and it got the people talking about U.S. corporate involvement in South Africa, and how that was supporting and sustaining the apartheid regime.  I did more stories on this whole issue of U.S. involve- corporate involvement in South Africa than anyone in the country.  And this went on for over a year and a half.  And I didn't just do it when there were protests.  I studied what was going on--the issues, the- lots of enterprise stories on divestment, you know, for social justice in terms of what had been done before on other issues.  And I really became an expert on foreign investment.  And also, I have to say I got a chance to write about, as a result of that, about international trade in general, including things like the GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  And also I have to say--I skipped over this.  When I was with the Free Press, I also wrote a weekly column on small business.  But from time to time, I would quite often write about small business opportunities abroad, and that sort of thing.  So, had some experience writing about trade.  And so I asked for it at the Times [Los Angeles Times] when I finished with the Lockheed [Lockheed Corporation; Lockheed Martin] story, because it had always been a beat where you were, you could travel abroad and even be based abroad for a while.  A lot of these stories were done out of Tokyo [Japan], you know, out of Japan, China.  But by the time I got the beat, there was a recession, and the paper was like feeling the pinch, and they were cutting out travel.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that was one of the beats that was cut out.  And so suddenly I got this beat, and I couldn't travel.  (Laughter) So I did a lot of this, a lot of it by phone, but ended up doing a lot of stories.  The big story at the time, one of the really big business stories was the big trade imbalance we had with Japan.  There was a lot of political heat about it.  And then soon with China, we began to get huge trade deficits with China.  I wrote about trade with Mexico, and then I started doing stories also--because apartheid has finally ended, and I got to do stories about U.S. business opportunities in South Africa, opposed to getting them out of there.
Speaker 2: Right.  Let me ask--
Speaker 1: I actually met with trade ministers from South Africa who came to California, you know, and did interviews with them.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, you said you couldn't travel?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Was that because of the limited budget of the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Times started cutting the travel budget, to cut overall expenses because of the drop in revenue and because of the recession.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You mean they wanted to save their profit, not, not lose money. Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I--we created a special once-a-week section for this special international trade, and I filled up these sections.  I mean I would make these packages that would appear on Mondays--
Story_ID: 340072
Speaker 1: And I'm guessing--I'm trying to replace when all this occurred.  I guess this was like, by the time I was doing international trade.  I think this was like around '94 [1994] or '95 [1995] when I had just come off a special assignment covering the riots.  And that takes us to a whole major story in my journalistic life, and not just in terms of the reporting, but some of my own involvement.  When the riots occurred, I guess it was '91 [1991], the Times [Los Angeles Times] was in a bind.  We had a lot of black folks out in the streets.  And just some background to all of this, for those who don't know it.  It was that a black motorist, Rodney King, was--I guess the riots were actually '92 [1992], but the King beating was in '91 [1991].  What happened, he was fleeing the police, a black motorist, and they chased him some distance.  There were several squad cars involved.  And when they caught him, they beat him mercilessly.  They beat him with nightsticks, they kicked him; there was a whole gang of cops around him.  They stomped him, and all this was caught on videotape, as you know, Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock].  And it was shown around the world, you know, and shown repeatedly here in Southern California.  These cops were indicted, and tried in a place called Simi Valley [California].  The defense attorneys got a change of venue, got it out of Los Angeles [California].  And somehow, these police officers were acquitted, despite the evidence on the videotape, which just created incredible furor.  And when the verdicts were announced, people began to go out into the streets, African Americans, but also Latinos.  And at first there were protests, and then the protests turned into violence and looting, and violence against--and violence, people against people violence.  And this involved everyone--Asians in Koreatown [Los Angeles, California], a large swath of the city, a commercial district for the most part.  Korean merchants went up on their roofs with weapons to protect their property.  And numerous deaths.  And the paper was in a quandary.  Because as I mentioned earlier, most of their journalists of color were in these bureaus, because they hadn't paid their dues yet.  So, they were not downtown where they could work for the main edition.  But that's where the violence was, it was in Los Angeles.  It wasn't in Long Beach [California] or San Diego [California] or--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, or the Valley [San Fernando Valley, California].  And what they did was ask these folks to come in and help us cover this situation.  I volunteered to go out.  And on the first day of coverage of all this violence, after the first day of coverage, the paper appeared that next morning.  And all of the by-lines, I believe except for one or two, were written by white males.  The other one or two were written by white females.  And all the journalists of color were in tag lines at the bottom of each story.  You know, sometimes it would be two, sometimes it would be three, sometimes it would be four.  But basically it would say, "So and so contributed to this report" in sort of tiny print at the bottom.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And these are people out in the streets taking the risks.  So, there was outrage, and justifiably so.  There was something called the UNITY caucus [UNITY: Journalists for Diversity] which was formed.  And it included Asian, black, and Latino reporters.  And they gathered and began to, basically, they were gripe sessions.  Initially, they didn't have any plan for dealing with the situation.  I have done stories on the diversity movement in corporate America, and thought I could bring something to the table.
Story_ID: 339844
Speaker 1: Let's go back to Minneapolis Tribune [Star Tribune] for a moment, and your involvement with another HistoryMaker, Vernon Jarrett.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and this is how I met Vernon Jordan [sic.], who is a, you know, great supporter of The HistoryMakers.
Speaker 1: Vernon Jarrett.
Speaker 2: Vernon Jarrett, yes.  But it also ties in with what I'm talking about, about to talk about with the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times], and what happened with the staff and this and that, and the particular journalists of color at the paper as a result of the riots.  And this relates to my concern about how people of color are treated, and what opportunities are given in this business.  I mentioned that when I was hired with the Minneapolis Tribune, I was hired in this so-called minority intern program.  And they hadn't hired anyone in about three or four years, and they would just go through this nine month or one year period and then they'd say, "Well, you're not good enough.  Sorry, you know, we'd like to keep you, but."  And I thought I was too over-qualified to be even hired under that.  And I also thought they weren't giving these people who were brought in enough attention and support and basic teaching, you know.  There are some things that you're supposed to work with an intern on, and get them to--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --get their work up to snuff.  So, it disturbed me.  I was on the staff at the time that I was hired at the Tribune, and they said "Okay, we'll cut your minority internship program short.  You're good enough to be on the staff."  But I thought about all of this, and then when the editor later asked me, I think it was the following year, to go to an NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] convention--and I had been going to the NAJB convention since the--I think it was the second one.  Was that Houston [Texas], or--
Speaker 1: The first one was Houston [sic. Washington, D.C.], and the second one--
Speaker 2: Was the second one D.C. [sic. Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 1: Was it D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: We'll figure it out later.
Speaker 1: Right, we'll figure it out later (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I'd been there from the second one on.  And I think this must have been, let's see, 1977 I was asked--or '78 [1978] at the very latest--I think it was '77 [1977]--to go and recruit for the paper, to go the NABJ conference and recruit.  And I said, "Well, I don't think I can recruit."  I told the editors, "I don't think I can recruit for you for this minority internship program.  It's not being run right.  You're not giving, you know, these people are not being given enough support and assistance.  And it shouldn't be just a minority intern.  It should be a general internship program that you should bring people of color under.  I just don't, this is not working here.  This program is not working, and I can't recruit folks for it."  And so the editor at that time said, "Well, we'll recruit--." And I'm not sure if it was, I don't think it was the top editor.  It was maybe one of the managing editors or something.  But he said, "Well, we'll recruit without you then."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what I said, I said "Okay."  So, I went to the convention, and Vernon Jarrett was the president of the National Association of Black Journalists at that time.  And I sat down, I got, collared Vernon, and I sat down and told him what was going on at the paper, and that there needed to be some change, and that they wanted me to recruit and that I wouldn't, and that they said that they would try to recruit, and Vernon cut me off, and he said, "They will get no assistance in recruiting from us, from NABJ."  He understood what I was talking about.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And Vernon and I kept in touch all those years, you know, from that point, you know.  And I always admired him, because he was a historian; he understood the value of history.  And he was the one who actually made me aware of The HistoryMakers program.
Story_ID: 339845
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultnaeous) fast-forward to L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times].  We had just had the riots [Los Angeles riots], and we had all these people of color take--put their lives in their hands by going out in the streets, only to be given just tag lines at the end of stories instead of a byline, and then forming a UNITY caucus [UNITY: Journalists for Diversity] and it's just a gripe session.  And I had covered stories reporting on the diversity movement in Corporate America, where they tried to get everybody involved and empower people and get their ideas to improve the product and to improve the service, as well as improve opportunities for folks.  I said, maybe that's what we need here.  And I just sat down one night and devised a very detailed program; I created a diversity committee for the L.A. Times.  And I pitched it the UNITY caucus, and I pitched it to Shelby Coffey [Shelby Coffey III], the executive editor.  Everybody liked it.  Now, I expected to be named to the diversity committee, but I did not expect to be named co-chair.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the managing editor was named the other co-chair by the executive editor.  Just to be brief on how this worked, I decided we needed three committees, and these committees would change from time to time, in terms of what they focused on.  We had a body of nine people on the committee, and then each of them, three each, would serve on a subcommittee.  And one subcommittee looked at hiring development; that was their focus, their charge.  One looked at news coverage.  And the third one looked at newsroom communications.  Each of those three persons in turn had to recruit three people to sit on the same subcommittee.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, eventually you would have nine people on each subcommittee.  So, it was like a way of getting into the staff, getting the staff involved in solving the problems at the paper.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we met, I think it was--
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: Well, this was, this was '90- '92 [1992] when--
Speaker 2: Ninety-two [1992]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I served as co-chair through '95 [1995].  We, what happened, we would meet, initially we met twice a month, and then we made it monthly meetings.  But the subcommittees were meeting more often, and the managing editor basically deferred to me; I ran the meetings.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And after our first year, we sent a set of recommendations to the executive editor, and just about all of them were accepted.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It included a lot of major changes in the way they went about the hiring and development, and the way they did hiring and the way they did internships.  There was a serious or dramatic change in coverage.  Suddenly you began to see some positive feature stories about communities of color, and began to see the type of sourcing of people who were never sourced before, who, you know, were suddenly showing up as sources in the paper.  So, there were some major, major changes.  Concurrently, and by the way, that diversity committee continued for years later.  I'm not sure, I think it's probably--I don't think it's in existence now, but I think it lasted at least seven, seven years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I didn't get paid for this, it was volunteer--on my basis.  I still had my normal reporting duties.
Story_ID: 339846
Speaker 1: Concurrently, the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] was also looking at the riots [Los Angeles riots], and looking at how the media seemed to be caught totally off guard, knowing that the coverage of communities of color in this very diverse area and region was very poor, wanted to do something about it, and they were willing to spend some money.  And the program, one of the program directors at the time put her head together with our friend, Gayle Pollard, Gayle Pollard-Terry, and they did some brainstorming along with a few other folks, and developed something called the UNITY Media Access Project.  I mean, that wasn't what it was called.  Initially, the idea was to create a media education or a media outreach program that would get journalists out into the community and get the community more informed about how the news media works.  This was all the three major journalism organizations of color--the local chapter of the NABJ, that's the National Association of Black Journalists, the local of the Asian American Journalists Association [AAJA], and the California Chicano News Media Association [CCNMA], which is actually the largest journalism association of color, one year older than NABJ.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But confined here to California, obviously.  They got together and decided it would be a coalition effort.  And three people from each of those journalism associations sat on the board, and decided to call it the Unity Media Access Project, and they would be the board of directors.  And the story of my life it seems, they said, "Let's let George [HistoryMaker George White] chair this" (laughter).  And I was drafted.  And even though I was not involved, you know, early on in, you know, in the advising and development--I was too busy with the diversity committee, you know, and my reporting.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, but there were some conflicts among some members of the group, and they thought I was the only one that could resolve it and keep everybody walking together and moving forward.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I agreed to do it.  And again, it was voluntary, we didn't get paid for it.  We did have a paid staff; we had a budget of a hundred thousand dollars a year.  And in over three years we did thirty--ten a year--thirty media education projects and programs.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We did these in the summer.  These were five-hour programs.  Typically, we'd start off with a person from the field of public relations, talking about how to a press release, how to do a news conference, and how the news process works in TV versus newspapers versus radio, et cetera.  Then we'd have a person who'd been in the news, not a newsmaker, not someone who's always in the news, but someone who had just recently happened to get in the news--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and talk about his or her experience dealing with the news media; someone who doesn't have professionals working for them in other words to deal with the news media.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then we would have a free lunch.  And that would bring out some of the journalists who weren't part of the program, just for the free lunch.  Not just for that, but the hope was to get other journalists to come out, not those on the program.  Because the whole idea was to, one of the ideas was to help them expand their source base, to develop sources.  But we did each program in different parts of Southern California, reaching out, you know, making sure we touched every ethnic community.  At the free lunch we would have, you know, TV anchorpersons or executive editors, or publishers, high profile folks to give a speech.  Then we'd close the program with a journalist roundtable, where we had typically three or four journalists talk about the dos and don'ts of dealing with the news media.
Story_ID: 339847
Speaker 1: This is where I first gained my experience in what we call media engagement, media community engagement; I became an expert in it.  And at the same time that I was doing that, I was becoming--well, I was in effect an unpaid consultant to the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times], trying to fix their problems.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because we looked at everything, not just news coverage and hiring and development, you know, but sometimes we looked at business issues.  You know, we looked at basically, you know, how we'd bring in support and staff to make the editors better, not just the reporters better, and also some training and development.  And those two volunteer responsibilities later led me to think about other potential possibilities for my future as far as, you know, where I could go.  About the time that I was wrapping up all of this work on the diversity committee and the UNITY Media Access Project, you know, I had done the reporting on international trade and aerospace.  And actually this was somewhat concurrent with my work on the diversity committee and the Media Access Project.  I was assigned to the retail beat--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --which is a really dramatic opportunity.  I didn't know it at the time, but initially it involved coverage of incredible consolidation and retailing, where you had all these major chains gobbling each other up.  And we're talking--
Speaker 2: What year are we talking about?
Speaker 1: We're talking about change such as--
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: Oh, what year?  We're talking about 19--
Speaker 2: Ninety-three [1993]?
Speaker 1: Ninety-four [1994], starting in late '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And '95 [1995], '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, changes like in Macy's, and buying out--you know, Federated [Federated Department Stores, Inc.; Macy's, Inc.] buying out chains that had been local mainstays here, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Like Bullock's [Los Angeles, California], and The Broadway [Los Angeles, California] department store chain.  Robinson-May [Robinsons-May, Los Angeles, California] actually gobbled itself up (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: There used to be a Robinson's [J. W. Robinson Co., Los Angeles, California] chain, and then it was a separate May [May Company California, Los Angeles, California] chain.  And then they merged the two.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All of this was tremendously important to the newspaper.  Keep in mind how much of the advertising base of a newspaper is retail advertising.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, this was really sensitive coverage.  At the same time, it was extremely--most people don't read the business page, okay.  But they will read a business page story about a retail chain, places that, you know, they go into all the time--a supermarket chain, or a clothing store.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, these are things that they can relate to.  They're involved, you know, in that.  They're not involved necessarily in Wall Street or buyouts.  So, these stories are also very closely read.  I mean people really, you know, this was really big news.  So, I just happened to get the beat at a time when there was enormous change.  And one of the things that made this beat such an opportunity, it was incredibly broad.  It included department stores of all kinds, the supermarket industry, the restaurant industry, and the makers of all consumer products, except automobiles; that was my beat.  (Laughter) That means I could be, I could cover anything.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, practically anything, you know (background noise).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was a tremendously broad beat, as I was saying, you know, retail and stores of all kinds, the restaurant industry, and the makers of all consumer products except automobiles.  So, I could cover almost anything, because it was that broad.  It was, it could mean one or two things for me, though.  Because it was so broad, an editor could give me an assignment just like that, you know, because there were things happening in all these different industries.  On the other hand, there was also so much going on, that if I was enterprising I could keep myself busy and wouldn't have to take any assignments.  I mean, I could do the things that I thought were most important in that, in that beat.
Story_ID: 339848
Speaker 1: And after the long series of spates of, you know, retail takeovers, and the dust settled from that, one of the things that was clear to me that we were not covering was the apparel industry.  And the apparel industry in Southern California is the largest in the nation.  It eclipses New York [New York] at this time.  I was starting to cover the retail industry I guess in about '96 [1996] or so; I was starting to give some attention to it [at the Los Angeles Times].  And I think it had surpassed, the decade before had surpassed New York in terms of revenue.  And we almost never, you know, very rarely did any stories on the industry.  And I thought it was an interesting industry, so I began to do features initially, and I know those are fairly well-read.  I got a call I think as a result--I know as a result--of my feature writing as far as the apparel industry is concerned.  I got a call one day, there was a woman on the phone and she said she was calling from Carole Little, which was then, and still is, a very large--I think it was like in the top five or top seven of manufacturers of women's clothing, primarily business wear and attire for, you know, middle aged, somewhat middle-aged--I think their market probably stretched down to women in their late twenties.  And she said, she recounted the murder of three executives, actually two executives and one contractor, affiliated with Carole Little over like a two and a half year period.  And this is the story she tells me.  A contractor, one of the major contractors, is killed on his way from his shop (cough) to his car.  And his brother is wounded, his brother also worked with him in the business.  This is in Glendale [California], outside of Los Angeles [California].  He was a person in charge of contracting, one of the vice presidents, you know, who gives out contracts to people.  You have to realize that most major apparel companies don't make their own clothing, they contract it out.  They just provide the designs.  Carole Little, as it turns out, did produce some of their own stuff, but a good bit of it was contracted out.  They're based in Los Angeles.  And this vice president for contracting, killed in his car on his way home from work, shot.  A control- the comptroller was shot in his car on his way home from work.  Another executive sort of just below the vice president level, I think she might have been the assistant vice president, also involved in contracting, her house was firebombed twice and she was shot at in her car on the freeway.  She survived all three attempts.  I didn't believe it.  I said, "How could we not have known about any of this happening over the last two years or so?"  She said, "Well, all I can tell you is that there was a cop in the cafeteria at Carole Little today.  They had all the employees in and they told us, they gave us all the details and the information I just gave you.  And they said that they didn't think all these killings were connected to the last killing, which was the killing of the comptroller, who was a Filipino guy.  And then they began to say, we need to look and see if this is connected.  And they told us we could call the cop anonymously if we knew something, and they gave us his phone number."  And so, she gave me the cop's name and the phone number.  I call up the cop, and he confirmed it, all of it.  And we had an incredibly bizarre front page story.  And that same day, the day my story was already out, he held a press conference for everybody else.  And it was big news.  And here's what I began--and so suddenly the retail reporter--because it includes consumer products, like apparel--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Suddenly, I'm Mr. Detective, and I'm going to find out what's happening here, what's going on.  So I began a really long journey, and sometimes I guess it might have been dangerous, to find out who was behind these murders and why.  I spent a lot of time with the police, and it was not just one police department, because the murders happened all over the place.  I spent time with the Glendale police, because of the first murder of the contractor.  The two--the comptroller and the vice president for contracting were killed in Los Angeles, so I dealt with LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] there.  The assistant vice president was also involved in contracting.  Her home was in Long Beach [California], and her home was firebombed twice, so I dealt with the Long Beach police.  And because various police departments were looking at this, they thought there may be some conspiracy here that might go beyond even these jurisdictions, and that they might even be involved in organized crime.  And I'll get to that in a moment.  I had to deal with the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] because they were involved.  The Glendale police were the most cooperative.  I really got a--developed a great relationship with those guys; the others, less so.
Story_ID: 339849
Speaker 1: But here's what the police theory was, and it makes, it made sense to me.  And it also related to what I had been doing as a reporter.  We had from time to time, whenever an apparel contractor was found and fined either by the state labor department or the federal labor department to be violating labor laws, you know, such as failure to pay overtime or unsafe working conditions, those sorts of things--if that contractor was affiliated with a big label, a big well-known label, we would sometimes do a story on it.  I was often the person that would do that story; I was usually the person that did it.  The other person that would sometimes do it was the labor reporter.  We had a labor reporter back then; they don't now.  And I don't want to date the piece, because the Times [Los Angeles Times] might at some time resume the labor beat.  But his name was Stu Silverstein [Stuart Silverstein], and then often we worked on these stories together.  And the head of Carole Little, Leonard Rabinowitz, read these stories as a lot of people did.  And said he didn't want to be embarrassed like that, you know, to find out some contractors, you know, were operating some sweatshop and they're doing his clothing.  And it's just so embarrassing, you know, it hurts his name, hurts the company's name, and it's bad for business.  So he said--he thought, he sat down and thought it's probably the smaller contractors that are more likely to be breaking the law, because they're just barely surviving.  So I'm going to take up all my business from the smaller contractors and give it to my big contractors.  The term Russia Mafia is a misnomer.  There is no commission like the East Coast Mafia or the Cosa Nostra, where they divide up territory, where they say, "You're going to do gambling and you're going to do prostitution, you're going to do drugs," or they actually divide up geographic turfs, and you work this area and you work that area, and when people have disputes they bring it to the commissioner to resolve it.  There's nothing like that with the Russia Mafia.  And in addition, there's no specialty when it comes to Russian Mafia crime.  They will do different types of crime, you know, because there's no one telling them, "Yeah, you can't do that, you're out of your area."  We talked about, we're talking about organized crime of Russian immigrants, is what we're talking about.  And we're talking organized crime, organized crime with Russian immigrants.  We're talking about people who were involved in organized crime in the Soviet Union before they came here.  So, we're talking about people who were involved in organized crime in what was to some degree a police state, you know, very authoritarian.  So, you can imagine how free they felt here, and so they rapidly began to spread.  And they began to operate in certain areas, and I don't want to impugn any of these areas.  I'm just saying that they, you know, they tended to get into these sorts of types of businesses--the jewelry business, gas stations, auto body and repair, and the apparel industry among them.  And as it turns out, there were several.  I think there were at least three, and I know there were two Russian, yeah, at least two, and there might have been three separate Russian contractors working for Carole Little.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And so, the police began to suspect one of these contractors may be the Russian Mafia type involved in organized crime.  And here's why they thought so, and it makes sense to me, too.  And I broke all of this out in follow-up stories as to what may be behind all of this.  Everybody that was killed, and everybody they tried to kill had something to do with contracting.  Actually, the first person that was killed was one of the big contractors that benefitted from a company deciding to move all their business from the small contractors to the big one.  He was killed, and his brother, who became a really great source for me, was shot in the head.  But you know, it didn't hit his brain; it was through the cheek, if I recall.  The vice president for contracting, it's obvious.  He's giving out the contracts, he gets killed.  Another high level contractor, a woman, they tried to kill her three times; she's involved in contracting.  Then the comptroller, he's involved with the money.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He gets killed.  Okay, only one person is arrested and convicted, and that's the person who did the first murder.  And this is a young teen from Russia, doesn't even speak the language very well.  Doesn't know the victim, obviously a hit man.  Doesn't know the victim.  His name was Demirdzhyan [Karapet Demirdzhyan].
Story_ID: 339850
Speaker 1: I really, really worked these stories hard.  I actually got his [Karapet Demirdzhyan] sister to talk to me, her English was actually fairly good.  He was behind bars at the time.  He never talked, and he still hasn't talked.  So, I ended up doing a lot of stories, and we ended up writing this--I did a lot of reporting on this for a period of months.  And eventually I did a huge breakout, what we call a column-one story that took up I think like three or four pages.  It really, really broke out what was happening here.  And I believe I--well, the cops know, I believe, who was behind the murders.  I think I know too, but they couldn't prove it.  Now, what was important about this story is that it led to even a more a bizarre story, but the one that I'm probably most proud of. And I have two Pulitzers [Pulitzer Prize], one from the riot coverage [Los Angeles riots] and then one from the earthquake [1994 Northridge earthquake] coverage.  And these are things that we can talk about in more detail later, as far as the Pulitzers and all of that.  But as a result of doing the Carole Little story, I developed a relationship with the deputy director [Jose Millan] of the state labor department because that's one of the three industries that they regulate, and agriculture being another one.  And I think as a result of that relationship, he wanted to trust me when he learned something very bizarre.  And he called me up and said, "George [HistoryMaker George White], we think we have something really, really strange here."  And I said, "Well, what is it?"  And he said, "Slavery."  And I said, "What?  What are you talking about?"  And he said, "It's slavery in the apparel industry."
Story_ID: 360507
Speaker 1: This is a continuation of an interview with [HistoryMaker] George White.  And the videographer is Scott Stearns.  Interviewing is [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock.
Story_ID: 360508
Speaker 1: Let's go briefly back to a point that we may have skipped over a little too fast for our audience.  And that is, there was a period when you were at the Detroit Free Press, where you did meet someone and fall in love.  Could you just give us, relate to us what happened?
Speaker 2: Sure.  This was actually sort of a continuation of a relationship that began in college.  She was my college sweetheart, and--
Speaker 1: At Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: At Michigan State, where we were undergraduates.  And we had been dating for about six months, and then I graduated.  And she was a couple, about a year and half behind me.  And so, I went off to The Washington Post.  And by the way, I should also mention that at The Post, a friend of mine and yours, who later founded a bunch of newspapers in Northern California and had founded an institute--Bob Maynard [Robert C. Maynard].
Speaker 1: Bob Maynard.
Speaker 2: I forgot to mention him in our previous discussions when I referenced The Washington Post years.  But I went to The Washington Post and then the Minneapolis Tribune [Star Tribune] and worked there four years.  And we talked about some of the coverage I did as it related to Native Americans.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then went back to Michigan State and got my master's [degree], and joined the U.S. News and World Report.  And my former wife, Lynn [ph.], when I left for The Post and later for the Minneapolis Tribune, went to law school and ended up practicing law in Cleveland [Ohio].  And it was with a poverty law firm, you know, she was helping poor people.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And so, when I moved from the U.S. News and World Report, about the same time I made that move, I learned that Lynn was back in the state, back in Michigan back at our alma mater, Michigan State.  And so we developed a long-term, long-distance relationship.
Speaker 1: I was getting ready to say long distance.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And she was up in East Lansing [Michigan], which is about ninety miles from Detroit [Michigan], and so I'd drive up on weekends and we'd see each other.  And after about, nearly a year of courting we married in '83 [1983].  And the marriage didn't last, but it was an important point in my life, and I think some good things came of it.
Speaker 1: How long did the marriage last?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we remained friends.  She actually, being a lawyer, she assisted, she handled the divorce papers.  And she took her time.  (Laughter) She was in no rush, and neither was I.  But, you know, it's just one of those things.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Sometimes you think you know someone, but--
Speaker 1: You don't. Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You're not--you don't, and you're not quite compatible.
Story_ID: 360509
Speaker 1: Now we can move ahead--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to, you're at the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm at the L.A. Times.  And we left off with this really bizarre series of murders involving executives at the Carole Little company.  And this, I broke the stories in May of 1995.  There were quite a few stories as you recall involving the Russian Mafia.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I mentioned that I developed a relationship with Jose Millan.  I didn't mention him by name, but he was the deputy labor commissioner for the State of California.  And the labor department, the state labor department, regulates a number of industries--the apparel industry and agriculture among them.  So, when the word got out about murder in the apparel industry, he was obviously interested, and that's how I encountered him and we sort of stayed in touch.  Then he called me I think about July or so, early July, maybe mid-July.  And he said, "George [HistoryMaker George White], we think we have something really bizarre."  Now when he said, really bizarre, he was referring to something even more bizarre than the murders in the apparel industry (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: And I said, "What is it?"  And he said, "We think it's slavery."  And I said, "What?"  And he said, "I can't tell you much more than that, other than it involves the apparel industry."  And I said, "Well, Jose, look you're going to need somebody to be there to cover the liberation of these people.  I don't know what their circumstances are, but you need somebody there to document what happened to them, and their liberation."  And I said, "I'd like to be that person."  And he said, "Well, we think we can make that happen.  All I can tell you now," he said, "is that probably at some point--and I can't give you any advance notice, and you can't share this information with anyone, not even your editors, because we don't want this to get out.  You'll get a call in the wee hours of some morning, and you'll be told where to go."  And I said, "That's fine."  About a month or so passed, and it's actually August 1, 1995.  I remember these dates really well, because it's such an amazing event, or discovery, I should say.  On August 1, Jose and his boss, Vicky Bradshaw [Victoria Bradshaw], who was the labor commissioner, called me that morning and said they wanted to have lunch; they said it was pretty urgent.  And I said, okay, I'll join you.  And we had lunch, and they told me, to my surprise, they said, "The raid is scheduled for tomorrow morning."  Now, they had told me previously they would not give me advance notice.  And then they told me why they were giving me advance notice.  They said, "George, we want you to know something, because it may have an impact on whether you decide to go with us or not.  The justice department [U.S. Department of Justice], along with the INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service] was supposed to be in on this raid with us.  At the last minute they told us that now they're not going to join us."  And I said, "Why not?"  And they said, "Well, they say they need a federal warrant."  Well, the state had already gotten a state warrant, and that seemed to me and everyone at the time good enough for the feds to come in with the state authorities.  But suddenly they were saying, no, we need a federal warrant.  And it didn't seem to make sense, particularly to drop out and back away at the very last minute.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it, I thought about this, and I said, "What's going on here?"  And then it dawned on me that Janet Reno was before the [U.S.] Congress.  The Congress was holding hearings on the Waco [Texas] incident.  And she had actually, she was actually being grilled during that same week, you know, the same day that the state authorities were telling me that the feds had backed out.  And as you recall, this was a justice department involvement in an effort to deal with a cult in Waco, Texas.  There were firearms and lots of children there, and they were concerned about the children and the weapons.  And it ended in disaster.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There was, some guns went off and then there was an assault.  And apparently these cultists had rigged the place to burn, and it burned and lots of people died.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, it seemed to me--here the justice department now--Janet Reno was appearing before Congress discussing what happened.  And then she probably learns that the justice department has been asked to take part in a raid involving slavery, where the word is there're people with guns inside some complex where people were being held against their will.  It seemed to me that they suddenly got cold feet, this whole notion of people with guns in a compound.
Speaker 1: And the things that could go wrong.
Speaker 2: The things that could go wrong.  And they decided to pass.  I thanked Jose and Vicky for letting me know, but I told them I wanted, I still wanted to be a part of this.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They never said anything with regard to the way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now you were making decisions without your editors knowing what decisions you were making (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  But at this point I got advanced notice, and so I had to let them know.
Story_ID: 360510
Speaker 1: And I did, and they [editors at the Los Angeles Times] were very skeptical.  They thought--you know, anyone, I think, might find this very hard to believe, that he- somewhere in Southern California there was some sort of large-scale slave ring.  But nevertheless, I pressed them.  And I had also been informed by Jose [Jose Millan] and Vicky [Victoria Bradshaw] that--the labor department folks--that there were three sites that they were going to raid--the site where people were actually being held--the slave site itself--the home of the people they thought were involved and responsible for this slavery, and a shop downtown--an apparel shop in downtown Los Angeles [California].  We dis- I discussed this with my editor and we decided we would cover one or the other.  So, I would go to the slave site where the actually liberation would happen, assuming it happened and that there was such a place.  They were all very skeptical.  And my good friend, who I mentioned when we talked previously, Stu Silverstein [Stuart Silverstein], who was a labor reporter, he was the one who we sort of paired up with and booked him on a lot of stories regarding violations of labor law in the apparel industry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and it was these violations that prompted the head of Carole Little to say, "I'm going to move all my business from the small contractors to the big contractors, because I don't want to get embarrassed by having my contractors exposed, or possibly exposed as labor law violators."  So, Stu was assigned to sort of sit outside the house of the people that were supposedly involved in this slavery.  And you know I was told, and information was relayed to Stu, that we would be notified again.  We were not told exactly what was going to happen, but that we'd get a call in the wee hours of the morning.  At about three a.m. on August 2, 1995, I got a call and I was told to drive--I was given the address and I was told to drive to a Yum Yum Donut Shop in the City of El Monte [California] which is just outside of Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I arrived at the donut shop and the place is swarming with cops--El Monte police, California State Police [California Highway Patrol], lots of police.  No one was eating donuts.  And just think of police officers in a donut shop.  (Laughter) No, they were getting their guns ready and they were preparing their vehicles.  And after a brief preparation period, I was, I joined the labor department folks in a car.  And it was a caravan of vehicles, of mainly police vehicles.  And we drove to an apartment complex in El Monte, it was a gated area.  And I had been told previously about the situation, that a gunman had been sited, sort of a guard, at the gate, so there might be some shooting.  So initially I was to sort of stay back, as all non-police personnel were advised to stay back.  When we arrived, it was clear that there was no one at the gate.  And so, I didn't waste much time in running up to the gate, because I wanted to witness everything.  And the gate was chained.  It was a apartment complex, six units, basically townhouse-like units.  The police quickly pulled out the chain cutters and they cut the chains and the locks.  And they had their weapons pulled, because again, they had been told that there was an armed guard.  There was barbed wire around the fencing of the complex.  We went to the first door, the nearest door once we were inside, and the police officers knocked on the door, and no one answered.  And they knocked some more, and no one answered.  Then the axes came out, and they took an axe to the door and just basically broke it in.  And when they entered they found several people, and they were of Asian descent and they claimed to be workers.  But the police were skeptical, because there were all these garments on hangers ready, and lots of boxes.  And all of these, all of this product was ready to be shipped out--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to retail stores.  And the police suspected that because these people did not answer when they knocked on the door, if they were really workers and were sort of enslaved, why didn't they cry out?  Now, they suspected that these people were part of the slave ring (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: And they were right.  We went to the second unit, and the police knocked.  And immediately you could hear people yelling and crying out.  They were speaking in a language the police didn't understand; actually they were speaking Thai.  And the labor department and all the investigators involved in this knew that these people were from Thailand.  And so they actually had a translator there, someone who spoke Thai.  And these people could not open the door from inside, and the door could not be opened from outside without a key.  So, again the axes came out and they had to break in the doors.  And out of a two-bedroom unit came about twenty-five, thirty people.  And they were obviously relieved and shocked, because they had no idea someone was coming for them.  They went to the next unit, and again another twenty to twenty-five people came out.  They went to third unit, et cetera, et cetera.  And they had to break down the door in each case with axes.  When it was done, there was like more than seventy people who had been held captive, several men and the rest of them were women.  They had been held there for various amounts of time, there was one woman that had been held there seven years.
Story_ID: 360511
Speaker 1: And this was the story.  The--their captors were ethnic Chinese from Thailand.  Their victims were ethnic Thais.  They had been recruited in Thailand and told that they would, that there was an opportunity for them to have a great job in the U.S., good housing, a whole new life, and that everything would be arranged for them if they were willing to go.  And they were recruited in most cases individually.  When they arrived here in Southern California, they were told that they had amassed a great debt because of the airfare.  And one person we interviewed said that she was told that the airfare was something like seven thousand dollars, which was obviously not the case, not that expensive, to fly from Thailand to the U.S.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And in addition to having to pay off the airfare, they had to pay off combinations of food, et cetera.  Now one of the things we found on the site was a garage that was converted into a store where these enslaved people would have to purchase, you know, food and sundry items.  And that was added to their debt.  And of course, all of that was inflated.  These people were never shown a ledger that showed how much of their debt was being reduced by, you know, their work.  And so they had no idea of how and when they would be released, or when they would pay off their debt.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In fact, they were indentured servants, but they were being held by force.  We learned from the interview process--we learned a lot that night--that initially when the first group of people that had been brought over, they were allowed, not freedom, but they were actually--they would take them in a van or a car or a shuttle to the grocery store, and they would, you know, buy their groceries and they'd take them back to the complex.  And there was no barbed wire at that time.  But over the years, several people escaped.  And this is how the authorities learned of this in the first place; one woman escaped and actually someone who helped her informed the authorities.  Also found at the site was another apartment where they found hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.  The under story that came out later--well, let me just finish the story and talk about the immediate impact.  We found, as I mentioned, lots and lots of clothing.  Almost of the clothing was branded and labeled with major labels that you would all recognize.
Speaker 2: Gee whiz.
Speaker 1: They all were destined for major retail chains that we all shop at.  All of this was in the story, a huge front-page story, and it created a firestorm in the apparel and retail industries.  It just, it was a shockwave.  In the immediate aftermath, the follow-up stories that I did involved complicity, possible complicity by the INS, the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  Because there had been an investigator who had learned of, had heard about the reports of slavery at this apartment complex.  And he actually camped out and sort of watched the place for a period of days, and then suddenly he was pulled off the case and told not to continue to investigate this, a fellow by the name of Bonner [ph.] was his last name.  And so there was suspicion that the slave ring somehow got to somebody in the INS and paid someone off, or maybe more than one person off, so that they could continue with this.
Story_ID: 360512
Speaker 1: This became a major story.  Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] decided to create a White House task force on sweatshops [White House Apparel Industry Partnership].  Congress, some members of [U.S.] Congress, particularly some members of the California delegation--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --began to put forward and discuss legislation that would address this issue.  And the--both the apparel and retail industries realized that if they didn't reform themselves quickly, that they may be facing much more draconian regulations and sanctions.  And so they formed their own task force to clean up this problem.  Among other things that came out of this, the--both the apparel and the retail industries adopted codes of conduct which their members were required to keep track of, to know who all of their contractors were, who their subcontractors were, and to inspect these facilities.  The reaction of both industries in the wake of the disclosures of the El Monte [California] slavery ring was to say, "We didn't know anything about it.  We just contracted out, and then this work was sub-contracted out to the slave ring.  We had no idea that they were part of our supply chain."  Under these reforms that they adopted themselves, they said, "From now on, you have to know who all your suppliers are, and you have to inspect their work."  In addition, they adopted basically standards that required their members to also inspect, you know, payment of minimum wage, you know, and safety to make sure these sites were safe, et cetera.  Now, if I can back up here, there were--I'll probably err on the exact number of arrested, but I think it was at least seven people that were arrested as part of the slave ring.  These were people who were found at the site and arrested.  My colleague, Stu Silverstein [Stuart Silverstein], camped out at the house, but no one ever showed up that night.  And the police authorities who were there arrested no one.  The Times [Los Angeles Times], we did not have anyone at this other shop that was downtown, but authorities were there, and they did find someone suspicious, so they suspected them as being part of the slave ring.  This was a legitimate clothing operation where they had a lot of Latinos working, and it was sort of a front for the slave ring.  So, they were producing this clothing in an apartment complex and then sending them to the shop downtown.  And they found someone suspicious.  He was also Thai, an ethnic Chinese, I believe.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He told them, before they were about to arrest him he told them that he just wanted to go into the bathroom for a bathroom break.  Old trick.  He closed the door, and there was a window in the bathroom that led out to the alley, and he was gone.
Speaker 2: He was gone.
Speaker 1: He was gone, and they never found him.  The authorities suspect that he was able to escape back to Thailand, because no one knew his identity.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But these slavers went on trial and got stiff penalties.  And those enslaved, because of the ordeal they went through, there was so much sympathy for them, and everyone thought that they should be allowed to stay in the country and to get jobs.  And that was the process that was started.  I continued to work on the story in terms of reforming these two industries, the apparel and retail industries.  And the coverage went from--as I said, the incident occurred on August 2, 1995, and I was still writing about efforts to clean up these industries, both within the industries and in Congress and the White House task force through 1997.  And as it turned out, basically the industries adopted most of the major regulations that were being proposed by the White House task force, and kept by Congress.  So there were some, basically they were all on the same track.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This story continued to resonate though, and the Smithsonian Institute [sic. Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] decided that they wanted to create a major exhibition on American sweatshops, and that the El Monte slave ring would be a centerpiece of this exhibition.  There was a famous case in New York [New York] where many women dove to their death.  And this was in the early 1900s, the Shirtwaist fire [Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire] that was also part of the exhibit.  And they re-created sweatshops from the turn of the century visually, and they re-created the El Monte sweatshop scene, fixing the barbed wire.  I was consulted as a--did the research to prepare for this.  And when the apparel and the retail industries learned of these plans by the Smithsonian, they immediately opposed them.  And eventually the National Retail Federation relented, and decided to support the exhibit.  But the apparel industry, for the most part, opposed it or just stood on the sidelines and took no position.
Story_ID: 360513
Speaker 1: I have to say looking back on this story, and actually these series of stories over a period of several years relating to this incident, and sweatshops in general, that this was the most important work in my career.  I had obtained Pulitzers [Pulitzer Prize]. Two: one for my role in team coverage of the 1992 Los Angeles riots [Los Angeles, California].  The L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times] received a Pulitzer for spot coverage that year.  The paper decided who among the staff really made the difference in terms of earning that Pulitzer, and I was among those cited by the paper as being responsible for generating that Pulitzer.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I was given a commemorative for that, the same thing on the earthquake coverage, the Los Angeles earthquake of 1994.  But the paper did not submit my reporting on the slavery in the sweatshops for Pulitzer competition, I'm not sure why.  But nevertheless, that to me was the most important work of my career, and certainly something I'm still proud of today.  I went into journalism to make a difference.  I understood the tradition of journalism as a tool, or an agent for change.  I understood the history of that, going back to the abolitionist press.  Frederick Douglass, who not only was an abolitionist, but a journalist.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Ida Tarbell.  And my heroes were the muckrakers of the turn of the century, people like Lincoln Steffens and Upton Sinclair, who exposed child labor and corruption, and really dirty and dangerous circumstances in the meatpacking factories.  This was a tradition that I looked to as a journalist, and I got an opportunity to make a difference with these stories about apparel and sweatshops.  And it indeed created great changes in those industries, and raised people's consciousness about labor practices in this country.
Speaker 2: Right, and especially in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Especially in Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 360514
Speaker 1: So, I, I wrote the story about the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] exhibit in 1998, and they were even--and then later there were plans to take it on the road, plans that never materialized.  I suspected that there was some underground quiet opposition to this exhibit going on the road, I suspect, by some of the same business entities that didn't want to see it in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] at the Smithsonian [National Museum of American History].  But again, that's something that I'm proud of as well.  So, that was 1998 when the exhibit opened.  We get into 1999, and I'm beginning to look beyond the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times].  I had been there eleven years.  I had served as an unpaid consultant, creating and running the diversity committee--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for three years, and affected a lot of change in the paper.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that committee continued after my three year tenure.  So I had experience as a media consultant, I had--with the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], and had chaired and managed the UNITY Media Access Project where we were involved in media community engagement.  So, I had this expertise in community engagement.  I said maybe I can get paid doing these things, and that's when I began to look at the possibility of becoming self-employed.
Story_ID: 360515
Speaker 1: So, after eleven years at the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times], you feel it may be time for a change?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I, and I wanted--I thought maybe there's an opportunity for me to use this experience as a media consultant, and as an expert in media-community engagement.  And what prompted me to think about leaving, number one, was the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], who I had served--well, they had funded the project that I managed on a volunteer basis, the UNITY Media Access Project.  They were looking for someone to do some book, a booklet on economic development, as, particularly as it relates to people of color and poor people.  And they were looking for sort of success stories, corporate involvement in economic development.  And being a business reporter and I had written about economic development, they thought I was a good candidate for that.  In addition, an organization called the Foundation for American Communications, or FACS for short, based in Pasadena [California], were--they were looking for a new director.  FACS is a program, what they do is they organize seminars on issues in the news for journalists, to help them better understand those issues so they can do a better job of reporting those issues.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And in addition, they have an annual economics institute, which is a week-long retreat where journalists get to learn more about economics and some basic business--understanding of business as well.  Journalists tend to do a poor job on economic reporting and business reporting.  Most of them don't have a background in economics or business.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that's why they find it very difficult often to get their hands around these issues.  And they also have a science institute.  So, I had an opportunity, and I had always wanted to be self-employed, to give it a try.  And I had already accepted, I decided to leave the Times.  I accepted the contract project for the Ford Foundation to do the book on economic development.  And the Foundation for American Communications, FACS, offered me a job basically running their program.  And I told them, "Well, I'm already, you know, working--doing some work for the Ford Foundation."  And they said I could do both, so I was in a situation where I co- was--actually had two jobs.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Which is a nice thing to have if you're self-employed (laughter).
Speaker 1: Much better than one.
Speaker 2: Yes, because--
Speaker 1: It's certainly better than--
Speaker 2: --one of the real challenges of being self-employed is this.  You're always working on hopefully at least one project, and then you're at the same time looking for the next project, looking for your next work.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And then you're trying to collect money from the last project that you had, so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so, you've got three balls in the air at all times.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But this was really good for me.  It was a real chance to do some things I was very interested in.
Story_ID: 360516
Speaker 1: Later, after I moved on from my work for Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] and for FACS [Foundation for American Communications], I helped cr- helped create the, I was a consultant and the first fellow at the Institute for Justice and Journalism at the USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], the Annenberg School [Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I actually helped them create and lay the groundwork for this institute, which is a fellowship program for journalists of print, broadcast, and what have you, who want to take time out to do research or special reporting on social justice issues.  And I began to do some work with them, I think this was 19--
Speaker 2: Was that the project that [HistoryMaker] Jay Harris is now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, Jay Harris was a separate Annenberg project.
Speaker 2: Okay, it was something else?
Speaker 1: It was sort of journalism democracy project.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So about 2001, I began to do work as a consultant.  Among other things, I did a baseline data research for the institute, and that translated into this.  I did research on the coverage of people of color in California, going back to the earliest days of the press in California.  This baseline research would be there for any journalist who wanted to know about the history of coverage of people of color.  And so, we're talking about Native Americans; we're talking about the Japanese and Chinese immigrants who came here to help build the railroads.  We're obviously talking about the Latino people who were still here, and in many cases coming in in great numbers.  And of course, African Americans, who, who became--who migrated here.  And actually, African Americans, as many of the viewers may know, were among the first to settle in Los Angeles [California].  It was a group of Mestizos and blacks--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and Mexicans and Indians and some Spaniards who created the Pueblo, that became known as Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, this state and this city has always had this diversity that we see today.  I also organized a public forum, or couple of forums for the institute.  I had a big role, well, the central role, in creating a forum around the tenth anniversary of the Rodney King beating.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this was in 2001.  The riots were in 2002, and that was the year later when the police officers involved in the beating were acquitted.  And what we did, and what I organized was a forum that looked at--that had three segments and three different areas of focus.  One was the whole issue of police reform.  There had been corruption in LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] and lots of other problems besides the Rodney King incident, and the federal government took a--stepped in and began to mandate certain reforms.  And so we examined, during this forum, what had been going with police reform.  And we had Merrick Bobb, who was sort of a central figure involved in overseeing these reforms on our panel.  And we had the then police chief at the time, [HistoryMaker] Bernard Parks and others.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The second segment looked at economic development.  Because right after the riots, there were cries and calls for economic development.  Not only was there a need before the riots, but certainly after the riots.  There had been so much damage and fear that businesses would not re-invest in certain parts of Southern California.  So we looked at that issue, and we had among others Los Angeles Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas who was sort of leading the push for economic development, and Jack Kyser [John A. "Jack" Kyser] who's a renowned economist, a Los Angeles based economist, was among those involved in that session.  And then in the third session we had a journalism panel of reporters, including high profile journalists such as anchorpeople and the leading reporters.  We discussed the coverage of police reform and economic development, so they were sort of self-analyzing themselves.  And this was a very interactive event where people in the audience had a chance to ask questions.  It went very well.
Story_ID: 360517
Speaker 1: I had, really was very happy doing with--what I was doing.  And again, I now was like into like my third year of self-employed.  And I found out about a center at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], called the Center for Communications and Community.  And I learned that they were doing a lot of things that I was engaged in.  They were involved in--and I didn't mention this as part of my work as being a self-employed person--I would sometimes help non-profits or community groups understand how the media works.  This goes back to my UMAP [UNITY Media Access Project] days.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I would also, I was also a consultant to media, not just institutions like USC's [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] journalism institution, USC Annenberg [Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism].  But I would help documentary makers and independent radio programmers with both their content and content planning, and also with their budgets and their business planning.  Because of my background as a business reporter, I knew quite a bit about business.
Speaker 2: Right.  The big question is what did you do with all the free time?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, I learned about the Center for Communications and Community at UCLA, and discovered that one of the things they did was help non-profit community groups understand how the media works, so they can do a better job of getting their stories told.  They were also involved in trying to get journalists better connected to communities, particularly communities of color.  That they were involved in effect as consultants, not paid consultants, but offered their assistance as journalists--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and news organizations nationwide in that regard.  And they were also beginning to develop a third leg, and that is as a journalism operation in themselves.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They had a website where they had resources for journalists and for community development--activists, but also a few news stories and things that they pick up off the web, in addition to having some journalists write some pieces for them on coverage issues.  And then they had produced one issue of a journal that they call Context [Context: Journal on Media, Community Intersection].  And so, I'm very intrigued, and decided I should arrange to meet with the founder and head of the center, Frank Gilliam [Franklin D. Gilliam, Jr.].  And we arranged, we arranged for lunch and we sat down.  And I was basically going to talk to him about the possibility of organizing a public forum for the center, much like I had done for USC.  And the first thing he told me was he had just been promoted, recently promoted to associate vice chancellor at UCLA; he was a professor of political science.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And he got into, he created the center and got into the media initially as a critic of the media, analyzing and doing research on the impact of news, impact of coverage of people of color on people of color, and also the broader society in terms of how the broader society would view people of color.  And he got into that very heavily, and he was also very involved in research on a cognitive--fledgling cognitive science called strategic frame analysis research that relates to identifying ways to link language to values, to help people understand your message and to relate to your message.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 360518
Speaker 1: And this was something that the Annie E. Casey Foundation--which is very much involved in supporting media and media related projects--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --took an interest in.  Casey, as you know, has been a long-time supporter of National Public Radio [NPR].  They sponsored many PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] programs.  But their real mission--they were founded by the founder of UPS [United Parcel Service]--was to help children.  And then they later--and they've been around for so many decades--they later realized you couldn't really help children unless you help their families.  And then they realized you really couldn't help their families unless you helped and supported the communities in which these families lived.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then they realized that you can't affect change and get support for communities unless you tell your story.  And you can't tell your story unless you reach the media.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So they gave Frank Gilliam [Franklin D. Gilliam, Jr.], to provide the sort of capacity-building and communication that was needed to affect change and to create community development.  All that background--to lay out the situation when Frank and I had lunch--he's telling me he's just been promoted to associate vice chancellor, and now he's looking for someone to manage the center [University of California Los Angeles Center for Communications and Community, Los Angeles, California] because he's got a real serious big time full-time job.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And actually what they wanted him to do was create a center that would do outreach, that would bring the university [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and the communities together by funding projects related to economic development, the arts, and health, where parties in the community could find partners on campus with expertise--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and put together grant proposals, and they would be funded by the center.  And conversely, faculty members could find partners in the community for any of those three areas--economic development, arts, or health, and then submit applications for funding.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When Frank told me he was looking for someone to run the center, I didn't have to think very hard.  I said, "I'm the man."  (Laughter) I mean, this was a perfect fit.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I immediately told him, I said, "I think I might be interested in that."  And then after we had talked a bit, he said, "Well, I think you might very well be a good fit."  We talked some more, and when we finished he said, "Let's go meet the staff."  Well, it wasn't that simple.  Universities have regulations, and they have hiring committees, and they have protocols and procedures, and I had to go through that process.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But at the end of it, I did get the job.
Speaker 2: Wonderful.
Speaker 1: And this was something that was just perfect for me (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And chrono- chronology-wise, what was the date?
Speaker 1: This was 2002, September of 2002--
Story_ID: 360519
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I started as assistant director and editor at the UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] based Center for Communications and Community.  And to put in in (background noise) it's really involved in all three of these areas.  The Center for Communications and Community, which we call C-3 for short, is a journalism research and training institute that operates at the intersection of community development and communications and the media.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And one of the things that I wanted to do, which I was sort of amazed with--right away we had work there.  We operate nationwide, and part of the communications that Casey [Annie E. Casey Foundation] had done, the Casey Foundation, is provide financial support for non-profits and community groups through coalitions in each of these cities.  And they were trying to address a myriad of problems, you know, problems with the schools, problems with economic development, problems with job training, health care, and in some cases people moving from prisons trying to integrate back into society.  And so, there was a ready-made network for the center to serve.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And what we did, and what we do essentially is work with these groups and build up their communications capacities.  And much of that work is done through workshops, where we teach them the basics of dealing with the news media, but also give them training.  And this is how we're really unique, in strategic frame analysis, where we help folks learn how to identify broad values--values such as justice, opportunity, accountability, fairness, responsibility--values that no one is against, and values that people generally understand when you use these words.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We help them identify the value that relates to their particular mission, and to invoke those values and invoke them well, so that people can understand what exactly their mission is and relate to it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then we would test the folks participating in the workshops by giving them media related assignments, such as writing a press release or sitting for an interview.  And I would actually do the interview, or we'd have them write an op-ed, where they had to take this training and basic media relations skills and apply that, but also take the framing training that we gave them and also invoke those values and use those frames--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to get the point across as well.  In addition, at many of these workshops we would bring in journalists from mainstream media to attend these workshops, and have a separate session for them with the group where they would talk about their jobs and challenges of covering these particular communities--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which tended to be poor.  And then we'd take a lot of questions and hear criticisms as well.  And for the journalists, it was a real opportunity to develop new sources.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And one of the problems in journalism, and it's still a problem today and seems to be becoming a bigger problem, is its sourcing, particularly as it relates to covering communities of color.  Mainstream media tends to have, their sourcing is very thin, and they tend to return to the same people over and over again.  A journalist will look in the clips, look at what's been covered in the past to identify someone--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to speak on a certain issue.  And it's the same people being called over and over again.  As I say often in these workshops, sources make stories.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, it was very important that we help journalists expand their source base and also develop relationships with the community so they continue to expand their source base.
Story_ID: 360520
Speaker 1: After doing this for almost a year or--I think about nine months or so--it was very gratifying work, but I felt somehow uncomfortable, because we were doing this work all over the country.  I mean, my first two workshops--we did one in Indianapolis [Indiana] and then we were on to Hartford, Connecticut, and et cetera  But couldn't do anything in Los Angeles [California], because Casey [Annie E. Casey Foundation] did not have a Making Connections program in Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: They had them primarily in medium-sized cities, not the major cities like the top five cities in terms of population, but in some very sizeable cities such as San Antonio [Texas] which I think now is the seventh largest city in the country, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --San Diego [California], which is ranked sixth or seventh depending on what period you're looking at, or eighth.  And I just felt we needed to do something here, particularly in light of the fact that we had been hit with a spate of gang violence that was really, really something that was terrorizing black and brown communities.  Now, gang violence has been a problem here in Southern California for decades.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But every now and then it just spikes up and becomes a serious, serious matter.  And we were in one of those spiked periods in early 19- in early 2002.  And I felt that this was a public issue, something that we could create a forum around, where we could seek solutions to this problem.  And I began to do research and talk to folks about this issue, and certainly I realized that the coverage of this issue was simply framing it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as a criminal justice issue, or as a police enforcement issue.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the more and more I researched and talked to people who were involved in trying to deal with the gang violence beyond the police--people involved in intervention and counseling and healthcare--I came to the conclusion that this was also a major public health issue, but it was not being addressed that way in the media.
Speaker 2: That way, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And so, I decided to organize a forum working as vice president of the local chapter of the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ].  Decided, and we decided to partner with The California Wellness Foundation [Woodland Hills, California], which is a major foundation in Southern California.
Story_ID: 360521
Speaker 1: They were willing to provide ten thousand dollars for journalism programs that address health issues, and they approached the local chapter of the black journalists chapter [National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ)] about doing so.  And I was of course vice president, and I was very interested in this, because I had already done all of this research and looking at this issue.  And I was asked to take the lead in organizing this.  And then I suggested that we organize the entire program through the Center for Communications and Community [University of California Los Angeles Center for Communications and Community, Los Angeles, California] because we had the accounts and the resources and the staffing to make this happen.  And so we organized a forum, and we decided that we would invite three constituent groups.  One would be people involved in healthcare.  And one of the things I did was bring in and involve very early on--and agreed and also obtained her commitment to join us as keynote speaker--[HistoryMaker] Deborah Prothrow-Stith at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], who was a leading expert on violence as a health issue, as a public health issue.  She had done quite a bit of work on the issue of gangs.  And then I decided we also needed other people who were health experts locally who had some expertise on the gang issue.  I realized that what gang terrorism does to a community.  First of all, you had the carnage from the killings and the woundings, putting a burden on emergency rooms--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and hospitals.  And then you have the pathology of distress, the syndromes that relate to fear, that hurt individuals psychologically, from children to seniors.  And then you have the pathology of those who are recruited into gang life, and whose mind and mental attitudes and self-esteem--everything is affected.  And in many cases, these people, you could say that they're brainwashed to some degree.  So, that's a mental health issue.  So, we had brought in--I just identified folks, you know, counselors, psychiatrists--people that had been dealing with gangs--and hospital administrators.  Then we had another constituent who were the counselors, these were not medical folks.  These were community-based folks who were trying to intervene or prevent kids from going into gang life, or helping with counseling to help bring them out of gang life.  And then the third segment of course were journalists, we had to have journalists there.  And in all three areas, we had really high-profile folks and we had an incredible turnout, a huge turnout in September of 2003 for this forum.  And we did indeed focus on solutions.  We weren't there for people to complain about this or that.  We weren't there for the health professionals to complain about the coverage, because everyone knew that the coverage was bad, that it was focused purely on the police enforcement frame.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I urged them to--and I interviewed them all before we held the forum, so we could get some of these ideas down in written form.  "How can the press improve?  How can they improve the coverage?  How can they frame this as a public health issue?  Who are the sources that they can turn to?"  So those involved in intervention and counseling, we had them think about this beforehand about, you know, how could the media improve?  And the impact on the journalists who attended--and we had journalists on the panel and many, many journalists in the audience, and we had members of each of those three constituents throughout the audience.  They learned a great deal.  And right on camera, a number of them said, "I had no idea.  Now I know some people I can turn to-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so we can improve coverage of this issue."  It was a huge success.
Story_ID: 360522
Speaker 1: And I wrote about this forum in one of the first issues of Context [Context: Journal on Media, Community Intersection], a journal published by the Center for Communications and Community [University of California Los Angeles Center for Communications and Community, Los Angeles, California], the first one that I edited.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Each issue has a theme.  And the theme of that issue was race.  But that's the feature section.  In the C-3 [Center for Communications and Community] report section which is basically my column--a column from Frank Gilliam [Franklin D. Gilliam, Jr.] the founder and director--on occasion we'd have a separate feature.  In this case, it was a separate feature of my interview with [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jarrett.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The late Vernon Jarrett, the renowned journalist and activist and scholar.  But in my column, I wrote about this forum, this gang forum.  And we began then to move on, and begin to I think make a serious impact in various cities around the country.  In Hartford [Connecticut] for example, we had a situation where the--a predominantly black community called Upper Albany [Hartford, Connecticut] and a predominantly Latino community [Frog Hollow, Hartford, Connecticut] were being pretty much ignored by the mainstream media.  And these two communities had also very little to do with each other, although they had many problems in common.  And one of the things we did, and we do this quite often, this is to examine the nature of news coverage and its impact on communities of color or--and/or poor communities.  We did an audit content analysis of TV news coverage in Hartford.  And we discovered, among many other amazing things, that in a city that's 85 percent black and brown--we looked at TV news coverage, local TV news coverage over a three month period of all of the major affiliates in a city that's predominantly black and brown, something like less than 5 percent of those on the screen as sources over that period were people of color.  And this is in a city that has a Latino mayor.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That was just one of the many findings.  When we presented these findings to the Making Connections coalition in Hartford, they were shocked and they were angry.  And one person said, "Well, what can we do?"  And I thought about it, and I said, "Well, you can do your own audits.  You don't have to wait for us to do them."  I said, "When you criticize the media, they're like the professionals in any other business.  They don't take criticism very well."  And often their first reaction is: "You don't know what you're talking about."  And I stressed to them, "If you do an audit, if you break out what they've covered, and how and who the sources were, et cetera, you do know what you're talking about."  And as a matter of fact I stressed, "You'll know more than the journalists know, because news organizations do not do audits of their own coverage," (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: And I said, "That's a start."  And then I thought some more, and quickly followed up by saying, "You might consider creating a media, sort of a media watchdog group, a media advocacy group that will do these audits, but also do other things."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they agreed that that would be a good idea.  But then something very dramatic happened.  And I'll tell you about that in just a moment.
Story_ID: 339867
Speaker 1: So, I'm, I'm thinking at this workshop--after I've just discussed these audit figures with the Making Connections coalition, they're upset about the fact that they're so lightly sourced.  It's really outrageous how little TV news will go to communities of color to get comment, or even deal with, let's say the city officials of people of color.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they wanted to know what should be done.  And I said, "Conduct your own audits.  You don't have to wait for us to do it.  Better yet, create a media advocacy group that will do that and other things."  And they decided to create a media advocacy group.  I expected them, you know, to work on as a committee or a task force, ways to get better coverage from the mainstream media.  To my surprise, and actually pleasant surprise, they decided that their first priority would be to create their own media to tell their own story.  And so, they created a radio show at WHUS [WHUS Radio, Storrs, Connecticut], which is the University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut], a weekly show.  Actually, a member of their coalition was the general manager of the station.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: So he helped organize this.  They created a website, and then they created a TV show for public access.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then later they created a newsletter, and this was very significant--a bilingual newsletter staffed by residents from these two neighboring communities, a predominantly black community in Upper Albany [Hartford, Connecticut], and the predominantly Latino community, Frog Hollow [Hartford, Connecticut] community.  And what this did was actually start the process of bringing these two communities together.  They were doing stories on their common interests and their common problems.  These stories were being written by people from both communities; they were working together on the newsletter, just a tremendous example--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of how the media can be a force for change and a force for self-empowerment.
Story_ID: 339868
Speaker 1: We began to see that, particularly with the Internet, that community-based media now was a real option more and more for people everywhere.  And so we began following the example of the Hartford [Connecticut] example, to encourage folks to create community-based media, and we offered our services in terms of helping that happen.  And this is a big, a big part of what we do now.  We think this movement is global; it's clear to anyone who follows the Internet.  We're now starting to see not just blogs and community-based newsletters and websites where people tell their own stories, but we're beginning now to see video news being produced by community-based journalists.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We're seeing audio on the Internet.  You no longer have to have a tower or a major building or a printing press, you know, requiring thousands of dollars, and in some cases millions of dollars to create print, audio, and video media.  This is a new world that we live in now.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And it's one in which we can--to use a term that a good friend of mine uses--it's now a world in which we are the media.  It's now we the media.  And journalism used to be a lecture, and now it's a conversation because we now have the interface between professional journalists and community-based media.  And I won't go into detail because many of the viewers know these stories about bloggers and independent journalists; they'll cover things that the mainstream media missed.
Speaker 2: Right, or did not, for some reason did not want to put out.
Speaker 1: Right, or just didn't want to cover it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: One, of course, prominent example and there are many, many others, is the one of Trent Lott praising the segregationists.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the late Strom Thurmond who ran for president as a Dixiecrat, you know, segregation forever was sort of his campaign platform.  And the senator did not realize that there was a mic nearby.  And Trent Lott, he says what a great man he was, and--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --he would have been a great president, et cetera, and there were mainstream media reporters there who did not report this.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: And this was picked up later by bloggers who put it out there.  And it resulted in a firestorm that forced Trent Lott to step down as the majority leader of the [U.S.] Senate.  So, this is one of many examples.  So I'm very hopeful, and I feel that this transition I've made is very timely.  I feel that I'm making a difference, and we continue with context in that mode.  Our next theme was the rise of the community voice, in which we had people in various parts of the country all re-tell their own stories of community empowerment through community-based media, or through activism addressing the shortcomings of the mainstream media, but addressing those shortcomings and telling the broader community about these shortcomings through their own community media.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, I think, I'm very hopeful when I look at the future.  And this is a global movement now.  And we're, our advice is being sought now worldwide, and our assistance and expertise is now being sought worldwide.
Story_ID: 339869
Speaker 1: Would it be fair to say that you are now the leading exponent of this, or in teaching communities (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think so.
Speaker 1: --or assisting communities?
Speaker 2: We're probably-yes actively, in terms of actively helping community-based groups do this, we're probably the leader.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we've received some distinction for it.  And thank you for asking that question, Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock], I sort of overlooked some of the accolades.  There've been some non-profit associations that have put together sort of reports on the best practices, and we've been cited by many of them as a leader in both media advocacy and media education.  And then just recently the journal, the Nonprofit Quarterly it's called, did a major feature on the center [University of California Los Angeles Center for Communications and Community, Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in which they cited us as a leader in this effort to empower communities through media education and media development.
Story_ID: 339870
Speaker 1: I have to say, you know, looking back on my career--and I have a lot to look forward to as well--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --I feel that I'm sort of walking in the footsteps of one of my heroes, [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jarrett, the late Vernon Jarrett, who was a pioneer, a Chicago [Illinois] based journalist, among the first in many, many things--the first black on television in Chicago, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --one of the pioneers in terms of blacks at the Chicago Tribune.  His career goes way back to the Chicago Defender, back into, I believe it was the '40s [1940s].  But in every phase of his life, in every phase of his journalism career, he was also an activist in that tradition that I talked about of being an agent for social change.  And this is part of the tradition of journalists that many journalists today don't realize; they don't know this history.  And Vernon talked about this history a lot.  And I'd like to think that I'm making a difference, and that I'm going to make a difference, much like my hero Vernon Jarrett.
Speaker 2: And I think you will; I really think you will.  We might, well, we might ask the question, how would you like to be remembered?  But you've got so far to go, and I don't mean that in what you've achieved, because you have a great achievement.  But I mean just your fertile mind tells us that you're going to be doing a lot more things, and we'll be re-visiting you in the future.  Is there anything else that you would like to get in, just for this part of course?  I know we're going to be re-visiting you.
Speaker 1: I think that pretty much covers it.  Again, I'm hopeful for the future.  I think we live in an age that is revolutionary.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The Internet I think will have more profound effects ultimately than the printing press in terms of educating folks, empowering people, and it can be an amazing tool for change.  And I look forward to being part of that.
