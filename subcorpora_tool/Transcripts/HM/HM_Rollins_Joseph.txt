Speaker 1: My name is Adrienne Jones and I am the interviewer, Neculai Burghelea is the videographer, there are no observers.  Sir, can I get you to state your name and to spell it, please?
Speaker 2: Okay, my name is Joseph Metz, M-E-T-Z, Rollins, R-O-L-L-I-N-S, Jr. [HistoryMaker Reverend Joseph Metz Rollins], because I was named after my father [Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Can you tell me your date of birth and the location of your birth?
Speaker 2: I was born September 8th, 1926 in Newport News, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Today is September 14th, 2007, can you tell us where we are and the location, and the address of this interview?  You don't necessarily have to say your address, but can you tell where we are located today?
Speaker 2: We are located in White Plains, New York, 42 McKinley Avenue, White Plains, New York, 10606 (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?

Story_ID: 571701
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm going to ask you five, what we call, People magazine questions.  So, I'll ask the question and you just answer with whatever comes to mind.  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Probably hamburgers.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Christmas.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Green.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was able and my wife, wife was living, we were in Nashville, Tennessee where I spent five years and we used to head to Canada because at that time Canada was still the place where things were fairly free and everything so we ended going to places like Nova Scotia [Canada], Prince Edward Island [Canada].  One year we had been out to a Presbyterian camp in Nebraska and so my wife, and the kids [Cecelia Rose Rollins and Joseph Metz Rollins III] were young, and they said, "Where we going?" and I said, "We're heading north," and we ended up going into Canada and then heading east and we didn't stop until we got to, as I said, Prince Edward Island.
Speaker 1: And what's your favorite phrase?  Do you have a favorite saying?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I have to be careful because I had a reputation, being known as a cussing preacher.  Well, you know, I'm, I'm, I've gotten sort of calmed down now but in those days, probably I ended up cussing a little more than I should have.
Story_ID: 571702
Speaker 1: Okay, let's start by talking about your family.  Can you tell me about your mother?  Can you tell me what her name was and where she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name, her maiden name was Alice Cleo Clements [Alice Clements Rollins], and she was born in Lynchburg, Virginia.  Her father was a barber in the white trade and his mother was a former slave and one of my favorite people because when we went to Lynchburg in the summer to visit her, she was always, would reach down in her long gown and pull out silver money.  When I say silver money, I'm talking about like, at that time, quarters and fifty cent pieces were really silver and she was a dear, dear, she was one of my favorite people.  She was not educated or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Are you speaking about your great-grandmother now?
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Clements.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Her last name was Clements 'cause her son, my grandfather, was a barber in the white trade in Lynchburg, Virginia.
Speaker 1: So let's talk, talk about them, one at a time.  What's your, tell me about your grandmother.  Do you, you said she pulled out the silver money.  What else do you remember about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Well, as I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your great-grandmother, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother, as I said, when we would go up to Lynchburg in the summertime to visit, 'cause that was my mother's home, and interestingly enough, my mother's mother, Lula Fletcher Clements who taught in the public school system, the third grade in Lynchburg for over forty years, was really ashamed of her mother-in-law because she was very, very dark, she had no education, but she was a dear, dear lady.  When people would come to see her, they were mostly white people because they, she had worked for them and the like, but she was the kind of lady that would sit on the front porch of my grandmother's home and then her mind would drift back and she wouldn't get up out of her rocker and say, "I see my brother, dar.  I see my brother, dar" 'cause her mind went back and forth.  Nobody knew how old she was but, as I said, when she died, most of the people who came to her funeral were white.
Speaker 1: And did you say that she had been a slave in that Lynchburg, Virginia area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had been a, she had been a slave.  We, we didn't know her exact age but she must have been about ten or twelve when the war, Civil War ended and, as I said, her son, William Fletcher Clements [William Clements], was a barber in the white trade at that time.
Speaker 1: And what's the white trade?
Speaker 2: That was, these are black barbers.  Grandpa Clements was a barber who cut only white people's hair and that was, of course, see, we're talking about a different time.  Black, in my home, in Newport News [Virginia], there were barbers in my father's church [Carver Memorial Presbyterian Church, Newport News, Virginia] who cut only white people's hair and then suddenly the white people, barbers, discovered that they were competition.  And so you don't find any black men doing nothing but white people's, white men's hair.  That's how times have changed, but in those days, that was quite a thing.  They did very well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so did that bring you social standing and a good salary?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say that because, as I said, in my, my father was a pastor too and there were several men in the church there who cut only white people's hair (laughter) and they did very well.
Story_ID: 571703
Speaker 1: So did you know your grandmother also?
Speaker 2: My, yeah, now you see, I had two sets of grandparents.
Speaker 1: Your mother's mother.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to spend time with her?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, Lula (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Her name was Lula.
Speaker 2: Lula Fletcher Clements.
Speaker 1: Do you know where she was from?
Speaker 2: Somewhere in Southwest Virginia.  I can't remember the town but she was living in Lynchburg, Virginia 'cause she taught third grade for over forty some odd years and she was very, very, very, very fair and when she would come to visit us in Newport News, Virginia, where I grew up, we would always go over, she would come down on the train, Norfolk and Western [Norfolk and Western Railway], to Norfolk [Virginia] and then they had a ferry to come over to Newport News and the, one of the things that we learned very early because, as I said, she was, when she would go to the so-called front, or colored car, the porter and the conductor would say, "Come on back here, this is where you belong."  She wasn't trying to pass, but they wouldn't let her ride because, as I said, she was, she was fair enough to, she was blue-eyed and the like and very proper.
Speaker 1: Now you said that the colored car was in the front of the train?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Behind the engine so that when the car was, if you ever rode it, all you got was the soot and everything, that's the way it was.  I remember that 'cause I had that experience myself.
Story_ID: 571704
Speaker 1: Your mother [Alice Clements Rollins], how would you describe her?
Speaker 2: My mother was also a teacher, that's where my daddy [Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.] met my mother 'cause my father was a, had come from Linc-, Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].  That's where he finished seminary and he came to Lynchburg and, I guess, they struck it off and they got married in 1925 and I was born in 1926 because my father was a pastor in Lynchburg, Virginia, at a little church and then he came to Newport News [Virginia] where I was born in, in Newport News, Virginia in 1926 and they had two children.  I was the first, the oldest, and my brother was born in 1931, William Andrew Rollins [William Rollins].
Speaker 1: And what grade did your mother teach?
Speaker 2: Well, she only taught, she didn't teach after she got to Lynchburg, I mean, after she got to Newport News but she was teaching probably first grade or second grade.  In those days, the school that they came to, to get credit and stuff like that, was Hampton Institute.  It's now Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia] (laughter).
Speaker 1: So your mother attempted, attended Hampton Institute--
Speaker 2: In the summertime--
Speaker 1: --Institute.
Speaker 2: --to get credit for that and also Grandma Clements.
Speaker 1: Lula Fletcher?
Speaker 2: Lula Fletcher Clements--
Speaker 1: Also went to Hampton?
Speaker 2: Just in the summertime--
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) because in those days, all you had to do was show up and take credits.  She'd come down in the summertime that would add to, of course at that time in Virginia, they still didn't get equal salary for equal, you know, for what they were doing because, as I said, Virginia was firmly segregated and black teachers, or Afro American teachers, got less than their counterparts 'cause, as I said, I, when I grew up and I, when I first came to New York [New York], I met people who were, come from Lynchburg and they would say to me, "Oh, I went to your, your grandma and she taught me, and Lula Fletcher Clements," and as I said, it was very interesting because she was very, very fair, blue eyes, her hair was snow white and when she'd travel, they wouldn't let her go to the quote, colored car because they thought, the conductors used to tell her, we know where you belong.
Speaker 1: And put her there.
Story_ID: 571705
Speaker 1: Now your father, where was he born and what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was born in Greenville, South Carolina.  My grandfather, see we're, Grandpa Rollins was a Presbyterian minister, my daddy was a Presbyterian minister and I ended up being a third generation Presbyterian minister but Grandpa Rollins was from Charleston, South Carolina and he had taught, and because at that time, black clergy in the Presbyterian church had more education than anybody else, four years college, three years seminary.
Speaker 1: Where did your Grandpa Rollins attend seminary?
Speaker 2: He, he, he went to what was then known as Biddle, B-I-D-D-L-E, University [Biddle University; Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina].  That was when Mrs. Johnson C. Smith [Jane Berry Smith] came down and she was from the Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] area, she gave money and Biddle University, which was in Charlotte, North Carolina, they changed the name from Biddle to Johnson C. Smith University in honor of her husband.
Speaker 1: And how did your, do you know how your grandfather, Rollins, decided to be a Presbyterian?  Was that, was he raised as a Presbyterian?
Speaker 2: Well, it's hard to say.  Now my middle, Grandpa Rollins was, as I said, from Charleston, South Carolina, he had gone to, what was then Biddle University in Charlotte and the way we got the name, Metz in our name, 'cause Grandpa Rollins' name was Joseph Andrew Rollins but he had been a classmate with Reverend William Metz, that's how we got the middle name, M-E-T-Z, because my father was his first child and he named him in honor of his friendship with Reverend William Metz.  That's how the, he was named Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr. and then my father, in those days, he went to high school at Biddle University and then Grandpa Rollins some--had some kind of falling out with the school and he, when my father finished Biddle in 1921, he sent my father, 'cause daddy was going to be a preacher, to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].  So he did not finish, my father did not finish Biddle Seminary down there because Grandpa Rollins was upset.  I never found out the reason why but he sent my father to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania which was in Chester [Chester County, Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 571706
Speaker 1: Do you know if your grandfather, your father's [Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.] father, was raised as a Presbyterian?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he was.  As I said, you would have to understand my grandfather because he was a very interesting man.  He was a principal in addition to being a preacher in Gastonia, North Carolina and it was a fascinating thing that I remember going down, because his baby daughter, my daddy's sister, Aunt May [Lavinia May Rollins] got married and I was to partici- I was the ring bearer in her wedding but Grandpa Rollins [Joseph Andrew Rollins], in those days, there were certain things that preachers did not do.  My grandfather loved to smoke and if you happened, they had indoor plumbing and indoor toilet and if you happened to have to go into the bathroom after he had been in, sitting on a toilet, reading his paper, smoking his cigar, it's because, in those days, in the early '30s [1930s], preachers did not smoke in front of people.  You know, I, I, when I, I started smoking when I was seventeen, my mother [Alice Clements Rollins] made me promise that I would wait until I was at least a freshman in college but, as I said, in those days, Grandpa Rollins did those things behind closed doors because preachers did not do that.
Story_ID: 571707
Speaker 1: Did your father [Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.] tell you any stories about when he was growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as I said, daddy was, my father was born in Greenville, South Carolina and, you know, everything in those days was segregated and he, I remember him talking about when they were in, when Grandpa Rollins [Joseph Andrew Rollins] moved to Gastonia, North Carolina, he used to talk about how they would pull the shades down when the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] would march through the black community and, you know, just wait and you had to be careful and, of course, everything, I remember my, my daddy's brother, Andrew Middleton Rollins [Andrew Rollins], was a principal at a colored school (laughter), that's just my quotation, I'm being funny, and he used to come over and take me to the movies in Gastonia when I was down there 'cause I stayed with my grandparents and started school in Gastonia and he would take me to the movies and we had to go and buy a ticket at the front and then go around and climb up the, up the steps and sit up in the balcony 'cause that was where, at that time, black folks, if they went to the movies, that's where they sat.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the movies that you went to with your uncle?
Speaker 2: John Wayne and Tom Mix, they were all western, the old fashioned, all of them are gone now but I remember that.  As I said, my uncle was a principal and he used to, he never called me by my name, he always called me, June because I was J. Metz Rollins, Jr. [HistoryMaker Reverend Joseph Metz Rollins] and I always admired my uncle because he was always sharp clothes, things like that, but he accepted things as they were and, as I said, he would come over and we would go to the movies in Gastonia and you'd buy the ticket at the front gate and then you had to climb up to the buzzard's roost, as we used to call it, that was where you sat.
Story_ID: 571708
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father [Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: My father had spent, as I said, he, he, because of something that happened when he was at Biddle [Biddle University; Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina], he finished, he went to Lincoln in Chester, Pennsylvania [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].  So grand- my father had, had some exposure to life quote, in the North, and the thing that I remember about my father was that, you know, he, he was a minister and, at Carver Memorial Presbyterian Church in Newport News [Virginia] but the other thing was my father enjoyed life.  He had learned how to cook.  Now my mother [Alice Clements Rollins] could cook the regular things but my father was a, cooked things like lemon pies and things like that and he was, he was not, as I said, the typical preacher because I remember there was a Baptist minister who had some grandsons that lived around the corner and they would come around and my father would let them have twenty-five cents so that they could go to the movies because Reverend Galvin [ph.] didn't believe in, in, in movies.  He seemed, I'm talking about like the, the '30s [1930s] and they were, my father would let them have twenty-five cents and they would slip to the movies because there was a, there was a one black theatre in Newport News called the, Dixie Theatre, and it was run, managed by one of the members of my father's church and the thing that I remember, again, about that was that we used to sit up in the balcony.  You could sit anywhere in this movie and we would throw peanuts and stuff like that down on (laughter) people in the lower row.
Story_ID: 571709
Speaker 1: Do you remember what Newport News [Virginia] was like when you were a child?  Can you just give us a description?
Speaker 2: Newport News, at that time, when I grew up, was a one-horse town.  There was a shipyard there and there was some members in my father's church [Carver Memorial Presbyterian Church, Newport News, Virginia] who had certain jobs like Mr. Howard [ph.], they had well-paying jobs but they were still being paid less than their white counterparts and they made up a good business, a part of Newport News because Newport News was segregated 'cause I remember when we, they used to have a parade and I, when I was old enough and had joined the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], we were always at the tail end of the parade and by that time everybody else had gone home.  Well, that's what I mean when you march and you brought up the rear and there was nobody there to watch you.
Speaker 1: And so your Boy Scouts--
Speaker 2: Troop, was segregated, Troop 36, I can remember that much.
Speaker 1: And how far did you go in the Boy Scouts, like what--
Speaker 2: First Class.  I quit after a while.  I was a First Class Scout.
Speaker 1: So, what else do you remember about Newport News?  Where did you live in the town of Newport News, you and your family?
Speaker 2: Well, we lived on Marshall Avenue. Now that takes a bit of explaining because Mar- there were two sections of Newport News.  There was uptown, where we lived and then there was East End where other folks lived, including my father-in-law, P.B. Boone, and the young lady, his baby daughter that I married in 1950, but they lived as this, and so, when the schools were changed, I was uptown and when we went to Huntington High School [Collis P. Huntington High School, Newport News, Virginia], which was a quote, colored school, we used to pass through a section of the white community and one of the earliest memories I have was a little white child, no more than four or five or six years old, come out and say, "Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger," you know, and call you that as you pass through and, of course, we called them soda crackers and things like that but that was part of my growing up because you had to go through, the town was divided that way.  It's hard to describe it verbally.
Speaker 1: Well what's the name, you said that there were two black communities, I thought.  There was uptown and there was East End?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And what's the name of the white community that you had to pass through?  Did it have a moniker (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was just, it was just part of Newport News.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at that time, they, they still lived and, and, you would go like for instance, 25th Street, which was a main drag and you had to cross 25th Street and then you'd hit a white community and went down, as I said, when, when they developed, when they put the high school out in the East End section.  Before that, Huntington High School had been known as Dunbar [Dunbar High School, Newport News, Virginia], which was a black poet [Paul Laurence Dunbar], and that was the elementary, that had been changed to an elementary school and then when I finished Dunbar, which was uptown, you went out to Huntington and you had to go through certain sections, of course, that's all changed now.
Story_ID: 571710
Speaker 1: Now when you went to elementary school, you went to Dunbar [sic.] and it's a--
Speaker 2: It's a little more complicated than that.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  Why don't we talk about that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, my father's church, Carver Memorial Presbyterian Church [Newport News, Virginia] was at 24th Street and there was also a school, elementary school, about a block away called John Marshall Elementary School [Newport News, Virginia], which was named for some white judge up in Richmond, Virginia and you only went to school five hours a day and there were, it was two shifts.  You were lucky if you ended up going to school from 7:30 in the morning until 12:30 because that meant you had the whole afternoon to do whatever you wanted to do.  And then if you were unlucky, you ended up going to school from 12:30 until about 4:30 or 5:00.  I forget the number of hours because, as I said, they, there was no separate, but equal, it was separate, separate but certainly it wasn't equal.
Story_ID: 571711
Speaker 1: So you were describing the, the school day at John Marshall Elementary [John Marshall Elementary School, Newport News, Virginia] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us a little bit about that experience?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, the school system in Newport News [Virginia] was segregated and it was separate.  We didn't spend as much time in school as the white counterparts did but John Marshall was an elementary school a few blocks from my father's church, Carver Memorial Presbyterian Church [Newport News, Virginia].
Speaker 1: And how many hours did the white students in Newport News go to school?  A regular school day?
Speaker 2: They had regular school days and it was all, as I said, it was segregated.
Speaker 1: And at John Marshall were, how were the grades organized?  How many years were you there and was everyone together or were you separate, in different classes?
Speaker 2: Well, John Marshall was an elementary school for, for blacks and I have certain memories about that.  There was a woman by the name of Mrs. Ruth Smith [ph.], she taught elementary school and the thing that I remember about her, this is sort of unorganized, but my brother, who is younger than me, was in her class and my parents [Alice Clements Rollins and Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.] tell the story that they waited and Bill [William Rollins] didn't come home.  So, my father went around to John Marshall School and there he found my brother in school, Mrs. Smith had gone home and forgotten about him and Bill, my brother, and his buddy, who she had left there in the school, were having a good time running because they had tables not much higher than this, running up and jumping up and just raising sand and he didn't come home until my father came around and got him.
Speaker 1: And what was your teacher's name at John Marshall?
Speaker 2: I--Mrs. Ruth Smith taught me also.
Story_ID: 571712
Speaker 1: What kind of a student were you while you're there [John Marshall Elementary School, Newport News, Virginia]?  Were you well behaved?  What, what were you thinking about while you were in elementary school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, I did everything and I wasn't too much, I wasn't too heavily impressed by the fact that my father was a minister.  Of course, in that day and age, you behaved, you know.  My parents [Alice Clements Rollins and Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.] expected me to do and I didn't change too much until I got to high school [Collis P. Huntington High School, Newport News, Virginia], after I got out of elementary school, but I remember teachers saying to me, you and you're, "You're Reverend Rollins' son and you got to do this and you got to do that," but, you know, by and large, I was a pretty good student but I, I probably could have pressed a little harder but, you see, in, in those days, you didn't have television, you listened to the radio and you listened to things like 'Amos 'n' Andy.'  I don't know what you know about that and in those days, also, you went to bed early and I can remember that on Sunday, we went to church at eleven o'clock on Sunday school and then on the evening, there was a Woodard's drugstore [Newport News, Virginia] which was a black business and when we, our idea of recreation was to go around to Woodard's drugstore, who was a member of my father's church [Carver Memorial Presbyterian Church, Newport News, Virginia], get some ice cream, come home and by nine o'clock, lights were out.  You were supposed to go home and go to bed and because you had to get up early in the morning and, as I said, I can remember listening to 'Fibber McGee and Molly' and 'Amos and Andy,' all the crap that was on the radio at that time and you listened to it and you laughed, I guess, and then, of course, things did finally change but that was much later when the television started to coming on.
Story_ID: 571713
Speaker 1: What were your favorite subjects as a small student?
Speaker 2: Well I was pretty good in spelling and English.  I was not a mathematician and I learned that my father [Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.] hadn't been much one, one either but in those days, as I said, my mother [Alice Clements Rollins] had been a teacher and, as I said, my father read all the time because he bought books and in those days, he had to go down to Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] to use their library because the public library was segregated and it didn't have anything worth reading, or at least my father thought so, because, as I said, he, he was a well-read and a widely-read man.  He used to bring me books from Hampton Institute's library because that was what he had access to at that time.  The libraries in, the public libraries in Newport News [Virginia] were not open to us.
Story_ID: 571714
Speaker 1: And once you finished at John Marshall Elementary [John Marshall Elementary School, Newport News, Virginia], did you go over to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Where'd you go next?
Speaker 2: After I finished John Marshall, again, you're talking in terms of segregation, Paul Laurence Dunbar [Dunbar High School, Newport News, Virginia], which had been the old Huntington High School [Collis P. Huntington High School, Newport News, Virginia] segregated, was still uptown on Marshall Avenue where we lived and that's where I went and spent time until I finished the, the grades, and at that time, you only had seven grades and from there I went to Huntington which, by this time, was now relocated in the East End section and when, as I said, it was still segregated and I lived uptown and I'm repeating myself but when we used to come around having little white children no taller than this come out and holler at you and say, "Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger" and, you know, I remember that even as, as, to imagine an eight or seven or six year old child coming out on the street and calling you that as you pass through that neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Were there more white people in Newport News [Virginia] than black people?  What was the population like?
Speaker 2: I would say that in the '40s [1940s], Newport News, this is before World War II [WWII], the population at Newport News is about thirty-five thousand folks and we had, our, I can't remember how many black folks, but it changed when the war came and they came to work in the shipyard and then when the war was over, the joke was that at the James River Bridge [Newport News, Virginia], which was the, going out of Newport News to go back to North Carolina, that there was a sign that said, "All you colored folks, leave your shoes here, you didn't have none when you came (laughter)," 'cause that was just something that had been told as a fib but Newport News, as I said, was access and, as I said, when I grew up and we would leave Newport News to visit my mother's [Alice Clements Rollins] people in Lynchburg [Virginia], I remember my father [Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.] had an A Model Ford [Ford Model A] and we would gas up in Newport News at a black station, 'cause there was a member of my father's church [Carver Memorial Presbyterian Church, Newport News, Virginia] who owned the station, and then we would make it as far as we could to Amelia, Virginia [Amelia County, Virginia], which was a big county, and here again, it was just outside of Richmond [Virginia] and you got up there and found a station that would allow you to use the restrooms and then we would stop and, I have a good friend whose family owned a large farm, his name was Swan [ph.], and they lived in Amelia County and we would stop there because Mrs. Swan always had lemonade or something like that and we would stop for a few minutes and then we would keep on until we got to Lynchburg, which was my mother's home and that was the way you rode and that's how you did to avoid the embarrassment of, you know, of segregated facilities or having them tell you that you can't use our restrooms because if they had restrooms, they had one white women and white men and then they had one that said, colored, and you were to use that whether you were male or female and, of course, as I said, my parents were not radicals but we, we learned the inherent value of dignity and that's where, that's where, when I was in Florida, somebody asked me, why did I behave that way?  I said, because I was, was taught that way.
Story_ID: 571715
Speaker 1: Can you tell us any memories about your time at Dunbar school [sic. Collis P. Huntington High School, Newport News, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, you ran into things, and this was unique and special, I remember there was a boy, he's dead now, but he used to play the bass horn and later on when he came north, he was playing for Daddy Grace [Marcelino Manuel da Graca] and you've heard of Daddy Grace?  And that, and when, in Newport News [Virginia], Daddy Grace was our next door neighbor.  I lived at 2128 Marshall Avenue and when Bishop Grace would come to town, there was all kinds of excitement and everything like that 'cause he had a house of prayer in Newport News and our house was about, wasn't more than, than this between, because Daddy Grace had bought this house and it belonged to Ed Allen [Edward Allen], who was a bootlegger, black, Afro American, Negro, whatever, and when Bishop Grace would come to town, there was all kinds of excitement because he never went to church until 10:30 or 11:00 at night and he would sit on the front porch and he had local people, he was from up here in Massachusetts but Bishop Grace was an interesting character.  He had local pastors and I remember there was a local pastor who had done something, according to Bishop Grace's life, and he, I saw this man crawl up the steps on his knees and Bishop Grace was sitting in a long swing on the front porch and he crawled across the floor to beg Bishop Grace's forgiveness and when I got involved in the bus boycott, I had, in Tallahassee [Florida], where I was a pastor, I had come back to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] where I finished and a friend of mine who was teaching there, who had been over in, into a section of Charlotte, North Carolina and when we came out, we had gone to eat, segregated again, and when we came out, I saw all this activity and I told my friend, I said, "Let's go over here and see Bishop Grace."  And so, we went and he said, "How you doing young man?" and I said, "I'm fighting white folks," and he said to me, "Daddy don't bother with nothing like that."  I said, well, "You look awful worldly to me," because when he used to come and go, he had his hands out and by the time he got out of his car to go in his house, he had a wad of money.  I said, "Well that looks awful worldly to me."  He said, "Daddy, don't bother with the world" which it was, he didn't raise no, raise any question but he exploited black folks 'cause there was a thing that I remember, it sounds crazy, they used to sing (singing), "Daddy got the keys to the kingdom, Grace unlocked the door" and then, you know, all that kind of foolishness but, as I said, when I, when I saw him, he let me and my friend come in the house and the people who supported him was standing outside and said, it must, "Oh, you know Daddy Grace?"  I said, "Yeah, he was my next door neighbor in Newport News," but I left because they were paying his support and he wouldn't let them in.

Speaker 1: How much time did you spend at your father's church [Carver Memorial Presbyterian Church, Newport News, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well I grew up there.  I finished high school [Collis P. Huntington High School, Newport News, Virginia] in 1943.  In those days, you had seven, you had only four grades in high school.  I spent my first year in college at Hampton Institute which is now Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia] and I, that's where I went, spent my freshman year and I was influenced by several things there because my parents [Alice Clements Rollins and Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.] were determined, and believe it or not, I got a scholarship, this is 1943, a tuition scholarship at Hampton Institute.  You know how much it was?
Speaker 1: How much?
Speaker 2: One hundred dollars.
Speaker 1: And did that last you for the tuition for the whole year?
Speaker 2: That was tuition scholarship.  I had, I was, I rated a tuition scholarship of one hundred dollars and that was part of my scholarship and I spent a year on the campus at, at Hampton Institute.
Story_ID: 571717
Speaker 1: So, let's talk a little bit before you went to Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  Did you know when you were in high school [Collis P. Huntington High School, Newport News, Virginia] that you were going to go to Hampton or had you, had you thought about college before you graduated (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, well I was, assumed that I was going to go to college.  I only spent one year at Hampton because my father [Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.] and his father [Joseph Andrew Rollins] had all been to what was known then as Biddle University [Charlotte, North Carolina] and then when Mrs. Johnson C. Smith [Jane Berry Smith] came down to give money to Biddle, they renamed it, Johnson C. Smith University [Charlotte, North Carolina] and I went down there in 1944 as a sophomore.  I worked in the kitchen, helped serve students and, you know, I didn't have any special privileges and I've, I, do have, I had, the faculty was just about all, the faculty was all white--black at that time.
Speaker 1: The faculty was all black--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at Hampton Institute?
Speaker 2: No, at Johnson C. Smith.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, now you're at, at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And at--I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: --at the old Biddle, now Johnson C. Smith.  I apologize, you're a sophomore now.  What is your focus while you're at Johnson C. Smith University?  Do you have a major?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I majored in religious education and I minored in history.
Speaker 1: And did you think you were going to be a minister at that point when you were studying there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had pretty much decided that I was gonna be.
Story_ID: 571718
Speaker 1: And what made you decide that you wanted to be a minister?
Speaker 2: Well because at that time, as I said, I guess more of my father's [Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.] influence and my family influenced his daddy [Joseph Andrew Rollins] but it was also that at that time in the '40s [1940s], that was the greatest freedom that you had and, you know, you either teach or preach and I didn't want to teach.  I did teach later on because when I finished seminary in 1950, I was ordained, my father invited the presbytery for my ordination and I remember that on January the 10th, 1950, that was when I was ordained to the ministry.
Speaker 1: And were you ordained at Carver Memorial [Carver Memorial Presbyterian Church, Newport News, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Right, he invited, again, everything was segregated and it was a presbytery, a southern Virginia which covered from Newport News [Virginia] all the way west to Roanoke, Virginia and they used to come for one day meetings and that's where, as I said, they ordained me and he invited other local clergy to come and very interesting because I had prepared myself to answer all the heavy theological questions and there was a man named Reverend Nance [ph.] who was from Norfolk, Virginia, he was black and he asked me certain questions and there was another man from Richmond, Virginia, a West Indian, Reverend A.A. Hector and they got to arguing on the floor, presbytery there in the church because when he asked me certain questions, Hector said, "Let the young man answer the question," and, of course, the other part of it was that they started to arguing and here were guests, Baptist preachers, Methodist and others and my father had to get up and tell them, "Behave yourself," because they were, you know, they were just acting up and, as I said, it finally took place.  I was ordained, I always remember, January the 10th, 1950.  And so when I went back to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina], I was an ordained Presbyterian minister and it was my last year in seminary and being ordained I could go to churches and do communion and the like and some of the guys who didn't have that, hadn't been ordained, called upon me to do and it was very interesting when I was in Charlotte [North Carolina], there was an Episcopal church, a black Episcopal church, and they invited me to come and preach but because of the high church stuff, they said, I could only, I couldn't, I could preach but I couldn't deliver communion according to their understanding but that was the way it was.  And then there were some that tried to convert me to become an Episcopalian but I wasn't ready for that.
Story_ID: 571719
Speaker 1: Once you became ordained and you graduated from Johnson C. Smith University [Charlotte, North Carolina], what did you do then?
Speaker 2: Well, keep in mind that this again is January, 1950 when I was ordained.  When you were ordained, you were supposed to have a call to a church and at that time, I'm grateful for God's providence.  I was supposed to go to Elizabeth City, North Carolina, which is now a place where it's a state school, Elizabeth State University [Elizabeth City State Teachers College; Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina].  They call it university now, but, and I ended up going down there to Elizabeth City, North Carolina and all of a sudden because they didn't have enough money to pay me the wonderful sum of $2400 a year, I ended up letting that go and going back down to Johnson C. Smith where I ended up taking some other courses and ended up teaching at Smith for three years, from 1950 to '53 [1953] and there was a man by the name of Dr. A.O. Steele, who had been my, I guess, friend and I had corrected papers for him and I was there for three years and by that time, of course, I had gotten married and my first child, Cecelia Rose Rollins was born in Charlotte, North Carolina but I didn't have enough money to go and do graduate work.  And so in 1953, at this time, there was the Northern Presbyterian church [Presbyterian Church in the United States of America] and a Southern Presbyterian church [Presbyterian Church in the United States], 'cause they had split over the issue of slavery back in 1861, and I ended up accepting their call to come down to Tallahassee [Florida] to organize, quote, a Negro church, unquote; and, of course, I had some interesting experiences down there.
Story_ID: 571720
Speaker 1: When I brought my, I went down first and my wife came down with the baby [Rollins' daughter, Cecelia Rose Rollins] on the train and she broke down in tears after she got to Tallahassee [Florida] and said, "How did you ever bring me to a place like this (laughter)?"
Speaker 2: What did Tallahassee look like in 1953?  Was it--
Speaker 1: It was the state capital with a, two institutions, Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida], which you have probably seen on television and Florida A and M College [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College, Tallahassee, Florida], which that, next year, the legislature voted, they didn't have anything else, they voted to change it from FAMC to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] by that kind of thing 'cause they had a little segregated law school, a segregated, I forget the, I forget, it'll come to me in a minute, but at that time, Florida A and M was known as Florida A and M athletic and music university because at that time, Jake Gaither, who, believe it or not, was a Presbyterian who had come to Florida A and M from Knoxville College in Knoxville, Tennessee, they used to have, he would suit up eighty or more kids on the football team and because Florida State was not winning anything, you would have Jake Gaither, Florida A and M University and all the white legislatures sitting on the sidelines and the, and the like.  And, of course, when I went, as I said, when I went to Tallahassee, there was the two girls, within, by 1954, they had gone downtown on the quote, bus, and they refused to move and give up their seats.  And so, they were arrested in downtown and the police called the college to come pick them up.  And I'll never forget that Sunday morning when I picked up the Tallahassee Democrat 'cause they only had one newspaper, there was a little item on the front page that said, "Front seat riding Negroes arrested here," and I thought about it and I said, well, maybe, couldn't be because at that time, you had the Montgomery Bus Boycott going on and I had not met King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] yet, but I knew about him.  And so, Monday morning, somebody called my house and said, "Come on up to Lee Hall [Lee Hall Auditorium]," which is the big auditorium, said, "There'll be something you might be interested in, Rev. Rollins [HistoryMaker Reverend Joseph Metz Rollins]," and when I got up there to Lee Hall, it was filled with nothing but the black students 'cause at that time, it was totally segregated.  And so they didn't waste any time and they said, our girls, two girls had been arrested and the like and so they took a quick vote and poured out of Lee Auditorium and came out on the street where the Florida A and M, where the bus to Frenchtown [Tallahassee, Florida], which was quote, the other side of town, past the white university which is known as Frenchtown, that was where the other section of the black community lived--
Story_ID: 571721
Speaker 1: Will you continue telling us about coming out of Lee Hall [Lee Hall Auditorium], right where the--
Speaker 2: Oh, the kids, as I said, had called me that Monday morning because, as I said, the local paper, which was only the Tallahassee Democrat, had a little item on the front page saying, "Front seat riding negro women were arrested," and, of course, they, they were arrested 'cause they wouldn't give up the long seat, just like Rosa Parks did in Montgomery [Alabama].  And so, when I saw that, that Sunday morning, I just said to myself, "Maybe, could be, we might have some action in Tallahassee [Florida]" and that early Monday morning, I got a phone call from one of the students 'cause I was supposed to be quote, minister, to Presbyterian students at Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida],  and they said, "Come up to Lee Hall, you might find something interesting going on."  And when I got up to Lee Hall, it was filled with nothing but students and it didn't take them long, they got up and I can't remember the young man who was president of the student council but he said, you know, how, student, these were two girls, have been arrested and insulted.  "What do you do?"  And what happened was that the bus from Frenchtown [Tallahassee, Florida] came right through the heart of the campus and the kids came out of Lee Hall and blocked the bus right in front of the auditorium and they wouldn't let it go past and, as I said, it doesn't take them long.  And so, later on, I was told to come to Bethel Baptist Church [Bethel Missionary Baptist Church, Tallahassee, Florida], which was on the other side of town and which was pastored by a fellow named C.K. Steele [Charles Kenzie Steele] and black preachers are all over there debating whether they would support the students and, of course, I was much younger and I had very little patience for this kind of foolishness and I got up and said, "We got to support 'em.  It's not a question of whether you will or you won't, you've got to support 'em because they've already started a thing."  And so, I, I, we, we rattled around and talked at Bethel Baptist Church and then we had a mass meeting that night and that was when we organized the Inter Civic Council which became the instrument for sponsoring the Tallahassee bus boycott.
Speaker 1: Were you an officer in the Inter Civic Council?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).  I ended up being elected treasurer (laughter).
Story_ID: 571722
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you, we skipped a little talking, discussing your church in Tallahassee [Florida].  Can you tell us the name of your church and a little bit about it, Trinity [Trinity United Presbyterian Church, Tallahassee, Florida] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, when I started the church, I was living on 1710--no, I'm sorry, that's, that's another place, I'm sorry, but anyhow, I started, I, I had found a home to rent and we started holding services in my home.  This was in 1953 and it got to the point where it was too crowded and an inconvenience 'cause this is where I was living.  I used to have to clean up, set up chairs in the living room and the dining room and then, one of the interesting things was, we had one of the few televisions that we had brought, black and white, and so when service was over, we'd turn it on and some of them would stay around to watch television because some of them didn't have, hadn't seen, it was all black and white, but finally we ended up with, 'cause it was inconvenient and when we got some growth and everything, it got to the point where we, we, it was just inconvenient to have to try to clean up on Saturday night, set up folding chairs and we had people standing on the outside.  And so, with some help from our white friends from downtown, they got us a rental agreement with a black school and we started worshiping in the auditorium in, and this was still part of, of the area in Tallahassee, near Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University].  And one of the things was after we moved there to the school, we had services and I had found an organist, or a pianist played for us and he taught on the faculty at Florida A and M University, FAMU by this time, by, except the legislature hadn't voted that way.  And so we, we, we met at, the name of, see again, I can't remember the name of the school but I think it was Barnes School [ph.].  I'll say that, I think I'm correct, and we started holding services there and it was interesting because some of the white people from downtown came to worship with us and they were quite complimentary.  Oh, you all worship just like we do, 'cause they had come expecting us to be jumping and shouting and all that kind of foolishness and I'm a Presbyterian, I'm a third generation Presbyterian minister.  I probably was too careful to have, was too dignified 'cause it wasn't 'til I sort of learned from C.K. Steele [Charles Kenzie Steele] and there was a, an A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion] minister whose name was K.D.S. DuPont.  Wouldn't you like to guess what the K.D.S. stood for?  His father had named him King David Solomon DuPont [King Solomon DuPont] at Fountain Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church [sic. Fountain Chapel A.M.E. Church; Greater Fountain Chapel A.M.E. Church, Tallahassee, Florida].  DuPont was as tall as I was and a very well-known man in the, in the black community and he had a knack for finding out everything in terms of, 'cause we didn't have to worry what white folks were saying about us, the maids and things who went, would come to the meeting.  White people thought they were deaf and then they would talk about 'em in front of them and then they'd come back and tell us what they were up to.
Story_ID: 571723
Speaker 1: The upside of it was that later on, my first chance to meet King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was when we invited him from Montgomery [Alabama] and he flew down and I was, it was my mistake to be emcee in the meeting and King was late and some folks thought he wasn't, never coming and I was cussing to myself, but he had flown down on a private plane and they brought him and that was my first time to meet King.  Actually, I had been to Montgomery later on because there was a couple that had met and they were from Montgomery and I had to, I went up to do their wedding but that was, King came to Tallahassee [Florida] and, of course, we had only one, as I said, one newspaper, the Tallahassee Democrat and editor of that paper was as biased as could be and he referred to us as outsiders.  Steele [Charles Kenzie Steele], who was the head of the Inter Civic Council, had been born in West Virginia preaching in the coal mines since he was ten years old.  DuPont [King Solomon DuPont], who was from outside of town, about thirty miles of Tallahassee, who had a brother who was a butcher and ran a meat shop on the street down there, who said, then there was a local grocer, Dan Speed [Daniel B. Speed], who was our treasurer, no, I was the treasurer, I said he was one of the supporters and we had, you know, we had a, we had a thing pretty much rock solid in the black community and, of course, the upshot of it was that the white people from the First Presbyterian Church [Tallahassee, Florida] who were supporting my efforts to organize a church, said to me, "You'll have to get out of this," and my response to them, "Are you going to come and be a part of my church?"  And they said, "No, not hardly."  I said, well I can't and so they cut off my salary which was at that time, $2400 a year [at Trinity United Presbyterian Church, Tallahassee, Florida].  I had a wife and a baby, my oldest child, Cecelia Rose [Cecelia Rose Rollins], and then in 1957 my son [Joseph Metz Rollins III] was born in Tallahassee and, but the black community supported me.  DuPont would get up and say, "Well if the white folks won't do right by you, we'll build you a church," and they used to bring things to the meetings, groceries and stuff like that, to say that, "We support you, Reverend Rollins [HistoryMaker Reverend Joseph Metz Rollins]," because, as I said, when the white folks from the church say, "You have to pull out of this," my response was, "Are you going to come and support me?"  They weren't ready for that.
Story_ID: 571724
Speaker 1: What did you do when your salary was cut off by the church [Trinity United Presbyterian Church, Tallahassee, Florida]?  Were you able to get a new church or did you have to take a job?  What did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, two things.  I managed to survive on what came from the local congregation which wasn't a whole lot because, as I said, my basic salary, at that time, this is 1954, was $2400 a year.  Then, the other thing was, again, everything was segregated.  There was a Florida A and M University Hospital [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University Hospital, Tallahassee, Florida].  I worked as a quote, male attendant.  I used to go to work at eleven o'clock at night and work until seven o'clock in the morning--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Yeah, what he's talking about is a young lady Joyce Hanson [ph.], she's down in South Carolina but she's written extensively.
Speaker 1: You were telling us about working at FAMU's memorial hospital.
Speaker 2: Right.  I got this job--
Speaker 1: Overnight.
Speaker 2: --to supplement my income because by this time, I was trying to take care of a wife and one child [Rollins' daughter, Cecelia Rose Rollins] and another one [Rollins' son, Joseph Metz Rollins III] on the way and, as I said, I worked, quote, I was classified as a male attendant, which was to, and I can remember that some nights, I'd be sitting up on the second floor watching the memor- the, the entrance when somebody was shot or hurt or something like that and I'll never forget an incident that occurred where a guy had, this is a black man, and, of course, everything was segregated.  He had gotten in an argument with this woman and they came up and I could hear them 'cause it was only two stories up and--, "Man, I love her, I love her," and he was woofing and talking and the cops were, you know, but he had shot the woman 'cause he had gotten mad with her (laughter) but there was that, that was just one of the things and I'll never forget another night.  There was a guy there and I had either brought the bedpan or something like that and so he looked up at me and he said, "Ain't you the preacher?"  I said, "Yeah."  "What you doing at this kind of work like this?"  I said, "Well, preachers will do anything to survive" because I was giving him the bedpan, cleaning his butt and that type of thing.  And so, I had a reputation, I guess, that I was willing, no, not willing to do anything but I had established myself in terms of the black community and one of my supporters was a man named Dr. Russell Anderson who had taught at Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] and I heard about him before I knew him and he had taught at Johnson C. Smith and his nickname was Sporau, S-P-O-R-A-U, I guess, and when I first met him down in Florida, I had to ask him the question.  I said, "Is it true that you flunked your wife," 'cause she, he was teaching at Smith and the word was, I had no way of knowing and when I asked him, that he just sort of shrugged and grinned, but he was my rock, 'cause he had taught his way through Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  He had a Ph.D. in biology and a very brilliant man and had gone back to Howard at the age of forty-something, with a wife and four children and taught his way and then he ended up being a pastor, being a doctor, medical doctor, at Tallahassee, Florida, and Doc didn't take no stuff.
Story_ID: 571725
Speaker 1: Tell us some more about the Inter Civic Council and the development of the Tallahassee bus boycott.  How did that work itself out or did it work itself out?
Speaker 2: Well it did because the Inter Civic Council was called, was created when we decided to support the students and C.K. Steele [Charles Kenzie Steele] was, was a pastor of Bethel Baptist Church [Bethel Missionary Baptist Church, Tallahassee, Florida] and, as I said, had been preaching since he was ten years old in the, in the mountains of West Virginia and in the coal mines.  DuPont [King Solomon DuPont], and then we even had, most important of all, the chaplain at Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] was a man by the name of Dr. James Hudson.  He was the only real faculty member who ended up supporting us and his, you know, his welfare was threatened.  They didn't fire him but when the investigation started and then they arrested us, I'll never forget, I was supposed to be down at court at nine o'clock in the morning and when I got downtown I found that I only had fifty cents in my pocket 'cause I had rushed out to be on time so that they wouldn't create any more problems.  And so, there was a lady there, a black woman, bless her heart, she's about eighty or ninety years old and so she over--she was there attending the court session and she had heard me say something and she reached in her pocket and gave me fifty cents.  I told her, I said, I'm going to the bank, I don't need this, but she said, "That's all right, you stick to your guns and do what you's got to do, Reverend," and you know so that was the way it was and, of course, the, I won't say, he wasn't a judge but he was a low, low-life lawyer and so he spent time trying to create the illusion that we had all kind of money and we have been receiving some support from the National, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the like, but when he was passing this case, he would talk about the fact that this wasn't the poor Inter Civic Council, that we were getting money from everywhere and we were getting some money from some places but it wasn't that much but they end up, to make a long story short, they found us all guilty, C.K. Steele, myself, K.D.S. DuPont, everybody that was on the, the board of directors on the Inter Civic Council, was found guilty.
Story_ID: 571726
Speaker 1: And of course, we had a lawyer from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] from Tampa [Florida] who put in an appeal and then of course it went on, and then by that time, this was 1958, I left Florida because the United Presbyterian church had finally decided that the racial problem was at least regional and they had hired a white minister and put two of us in Nashville [Tennessee]--
Speaker 2: And what happened with the bus, the buses?
Speaker 1: Well, oh, yeah, okay, I got ahead of myself.  We drove the buses off the street and then, 'cause nobody was riding 'em and then in, I'll never forget, in Florida, something happened just before Christmas of 1957 and I spent Christmas Eve, oh, this was when the [U.S.] Supreme Court had ruled that bus segregation was illegal and so, as I said, December the 24th, Christmas Eve, I spent my time quote, riding the buses, for the benefit, and this was what the white folks said, for the benefit of the TV cameras and everything and, as I said, that was 1954 and, as I said, we brought King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] down to support us and when things got tough and when the United Presbyterian church offered me a salary to come to Talla- to, to Nashville as a black member of a biracial team, the salary was six thousand dollars and I thought I was in glory.
Speaker 2: Six thousand dollars a year?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This was 1958.
Speaker 2: And you weren't the minister of the church in, in Nashville, were you?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: You were on the staff there?
Speaker 1: I was staff.
Speaker 2: Okay, so just one more Tallahassee [Florida] issue.  I just want to find out, did the buses eventually become integrated due to your efforts?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, they did, because we drove the buses off the street and for a while there were no buses and poor black folks walked and we had, with the money that we had, we had a, like they had in Montgomery [Alabama]--
Speaker 2: Like a carpool?
Speaker 1: Carpool, there you go, and people would call and, as I said, the fascinating thing was, the white folks have very interesting attitude where we're concerned and these were ladies who worked as domestics and we picked them up, or they would come to the place where we had, and then they would come and work and then come back and say, "Oh, Matt, oh Annie, you ain't, you ain't, you're not a part of all of this, are you?"  "Oh, no, no, no" and they were listening (laughter).  It's unbelievable but that was the way it was.
Story_ID: 571727
Speaker 1: So, eventually you get a new position in Nashville [Tennessee] and what do you do there?  Do you spend any time on the Freedom Rides in Mississippi before you go to Nashville or on your way there?
Speaker 2: No, no, that didn't start until, I left Nash- I left Tallahassee [Florida] in 1958.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you went to Nashville?
Speaker 2: And I went to Nashville because the United Presbyterian church had decided that the racial problem was just regional and they hired a white Presbyterian minister and we were part of a team and we had offices in Nashville and we, you know, we're supposed to explore what was going on and I'd travel from, oh, I went to places at Texarkana, Texas.  I was in Texas where I had to sit up and listen to a white official say, "What is it you Negras want?" 'cause they never used the word, black, and they never used the word, Negro, but they always said, "Negras," and I'll never forget we were in a meeting and my wife was there and so she got tired of hearing this guy keep saying, "Negras," and she said to him, "Have you ever heard of the word knee, like K-N-E-E, grow, G-R-O," he got red and all of a sudden he didn't say anything and finally he got into the conversation again and he said, "Well, I've had a Negro secretary," and then he looked at my wife and said, "Well how did I do, Mrs. Rollins?" And, you know, but that was how they referred because the word was always slurred and then I'll never forget we were in one meeting, in those days we were still going north for education and one of the, oh, this was, I'm sorry, I got confused, this was in Florida, and we came up again with this word and so one of the white guys who had been north for a degree, I think at Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], 'cause he was a banker, he said, he said, "We learned how to say Negro up north," and that was, that was, you know, it's hard for people to realize that a simple thing like how you pronounce a word because we had not come to the point of Afro Americans or anything like that but they, as I said, those who had gone north had come back with a little more sensitivity.
Speaker 1: A little more politically correct--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for the time.
Speaker 2: That's right--
Story_ID: 571728
Speaker 1: So tell us about the Nashville Christian Leadership Council and your participation in that.
Speaker 2: Well that was a local thing because, at that time, Nashville [Tennessee], this was a whole different thing.  Tallahassee [Florida] had been about this transportation, Montgomery Improvement Association had been about transportation and when the court decided that interstate and intrastate were both in the same, we won that battle.  In Nashville, I got involved because we started to trying to desegregate local facilities.  The thing was that, you know, nothing was open.  I'm talking about places like to eat and the downtown facilities.  So we went after that and Kelly Miller Smith, who was pastor of First Baptist Church [First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill, Nashville, Tennessee] downtown, this was one of the few black churches that was still in the heart of quote, the downtown, community, was the leader of the Nashville Christian Leadership Conference and I served on that and we had kids from Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], some who had the courage enough, white students from Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee] and I forget what other school there, oh yeah, there was a black seminary, a Baptist seminary, and we got support from them and we, and there's a friend of mine who was a service, who was a pastor here in, in the Bronx [New York], he died several years ago, but at one time, we led anywhere from four hundred to a thousand black youngsters, and I'm not talking about college students, I'm talking about we had raided the black community and taken kids and my, phone, "I was with you when you're talking about sitting in but you ain't got no business exposing them little children."  I said, "They came voluntarily" (laughter).

Speaker 1: What kind of action did you take in Nashville [Tennessee] with the Christian Leadership Council [Nashville Christian Leadership Council]?
Speaker 2: Well that was a very interesting thing because, as I said, Kelly Miller Smith, who was the president of the Nashville Christian Leadership Conference and we considered ourselves a part of the Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] movement, his church [First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill] was in downtown Nashville, just a few blocks from the state capitol.  It had been left there, you know, 'cause most of the black churches had moved from downtown out to other sections, Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], which was the quote, black school, and the like.  We had an office in, near Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee] and the relationship with Vanderbilt was very interesting because I remember that when I had been down to Mississippi to participate in something going on, when I called to say I was coming home, I got our babysitter and my wife had gone to the hospital 'cause my daughter had had her appendectomy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Appendix removed.
Speaker 2: And when I got into town, there was a Jewish pediatrician that we had had, very nice dealings with and my wife had called, he had left an affair where he was dressed in a tuxedo, came out to 1710 Villa Place, picked my daughter up and took her to Vanderbilt hospital [Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee] where he removed her appendectomy.  I guess that's what you call it.
Speaker 1: I think that's the process, it's the appendix, and so when you have that removed, it's called an appendectomy.
Speaker 2: Right, but the point, he did this on his own and when I got into town and I called my house, the little girl that was a babysitter, said your mama, said, "Mrs. Rollins is at the hospital," and she was at, he took her to Vanderbilt hospital.  So she got the best treatment and one of the funny things, when I got there the next day, she was rooming with a little white girl, poor and mountain as anything, and so my daughter, Cecelia [Cecelia Rose Rollins] said, "This is my friend," and I forget her name, but it was very interesting because they were, had no problems with each other and, as I said, if, if he had not left where he was and come and taken her to the hospital, she might have died, you know, from an appendectomy but that was part of it.

Speaker 1: Nashville [Nashville Christian Leadership Council] was an effort to desegregate the town of Nashville [Tennessee] and that was a pretty rough experience because I have, I don't have the, I don't know where the pictures are now but every so often they sent me stuff that involves me and shows me downtown Nashville and a couple of times I, you can see I've lost a bit of my widow's peak but right up here is where I got hit when we were leaving downtown Nashville and we were getting to First Baptist Church [First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill, Nashville, Tennessee] and I got hit by some of these young hoodlums.
Speaker 2: What did they hit you with?
Speaker 1: A rock, I think, but the point was, that I got the black youngsters off the street, into the church and then I came back out and so somebody said, "You're bleeding, Rollins [HistoryMaker Reverend Joseph Metz Rollins]," I said, "Yeah," and so the thing that I remember most was this ride to Meharry [George W. Hubbard Hospital - Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] because Meharry was the black institution you've heard of in Nashville and I ended up being taken there and they put two stitches, three stitches in my head.  And so by this time, my mother's mother [Lula Fletcher Clements] in Lynchburg [Virginia] had seen me on, on the television, had called my parents [Alice Clements Rollins and Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.] in Newport News [Virginia] and I'll never forget the phone rang, "Metz, this is your daddy, are you all right?"  He was asking the question, so I told him, I said, "I'm okay," I said, "I had the greatest experience of my life, I rode to Meharry hospital and they put three stitches in my head and I'm sitting here relaxing."  About a half an hour later, the phone rang, it was about 5:30 or 6:00 and it was from the mayor's office, they were having an emergency meeting in downtown Nashville.  So he said, "Mr. Rollins, can you come to this meeting" and I said, "I'm wounded," and he said, "Well, if we send a car for you, will you come?"  I said, "Yeah, if you will send a car for me," and about twenty minutes later, this police car pulls up in front of my house, he comes and knocks on the door, my wife is feeling sort of not too open and everything and so she said, "What do you want?"  "Well, I come to get Mr. Rollins to take him to a meeting of the mayor in downtown Nashville."  And so I went down and this city was on the brink of a riot.  At that time, they had black policemen, but if they arrested you, if you were white, they would hold you until the white policemen came and took you away (laughter), that's how crazy it was in Nashville.  And we ended up, the guy came and picked me up to go to Mayor West's and I remember his name, I don't know why, but the mayor of Nashville at that time was Ben West and he was quote, supposed to be a fairly liberal for his time, and he was, when he sat us all down, he said, "You know, things are right-are real edge," and I said, "Yeah," and we all agreed and, and it had gotten, it was very, very tense.  And so he said, "Well, you all hold off for a while for your demonstrations and stuff, like," and I said, "Well, we'll think about it," but you never let the edge go if you think you've got an advantage.

Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your family.  You've mentioned your wife a couple of times and how, you know, Tallahassee [Florida] was not the nicest place, you, you're now living in Nashville [Tennessee] where it's not the most comfortable place, can you talk a little bit about how you spent time with your family and how your being an activist affected your wife and your, and your children [Cecelia Rose Rollins and Joseph Metz Rollins III]?
Speaker 2: Well, two things.  We always took vacations and I had got sometime invitations to go places to take my wife and my family and one of them I remember as a part of what was going in Nashville.  We drove from Nashville out to Nebraska and there was a camp there, my wife and my children, and when it was over, we were there a week, my wife said, "Are we going back to Nashville?"  I said, "No, we're headed north into Winnipeg, Canada to enjoy getting away from the problems down there in, in the South."  That was the thing I always felt I owed them and I don't have the camera but every year we would go to Canada.  One time, as I said, we were in, we went, start, that time, we went into Winnipeg and then we went east and we came back through Upstate New York, Vermont really, and we had stopped on a Canadian side with some French Canadians who treated us royally and then we came into the states, up south, is my recollection of how Upstate New York was because there was some strange white folks up there, and you sort of, when you went to these places, they look at you and say, and--as if to say, "Where did you come from?" But that was just the way it was 'cause by that time I was living here in, I moved to New York [New York] in 1963.
Story_ID: 571732
Speaker 1: I asked you about your family and you said there were two things, one, was that you took vacations.  What was the other thing?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, we always went, as long as my wife's people were still living, as long as my parents [Alice Clements Rollins and Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.] were living, we always managed to go back home to Newport News [Virginia] and, of course, what was interesting there was some of the things that we'd been fighting for were finally taking place in Newport News, you know, because when we were growing up, there were two beaches, Buckroe Beach [Hampton, Virginia], which was a white beach, on the Chesapeake Bay, and Bay Shore [Bay Shore Beach, Hampton, Virginia], which was quote, the colored beach, and just a fence separating 'em.  And so finally it had come to the point where they desegregated and so we started going to Buckroe Beach, which was, by that time, the only beach that was there--open because Bay Shore had been owned by a black man at Hampton University [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and he finally started building houses and stuff like that but, as I said, we would come to Newport News because things were opening up.  We went to, oh boy, there's a place there near Williamsburg [Virginia]  where they had things and my wife used to like to buy stuff in, and when I'm loading the car back with stuff like glasses and silverware and stuff like that, we're in the, in the, one of the chest, one of the places in the dining room is filled with glasses and stuff like that 'cause when I ended up coming to New York [New York] and I ended up spending time, I was, for twenty-five years a pastor in the Bronx [New York], and we used to have an open house and my wife could cook and people would come to eat and, 'cause they were always very generous and sometimes the living room, the den, her thing would be in, wall to wall folks and, as I said, my wife did that until she got ill because she had, oh boy, it'll come to me in a minute.
Speaker 1: Did she have kidney problems?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did she have--
Speaker 2: No, she, she suffered from, she was on, oh gee.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Dialysis.
Speaker 2: On dialysis (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was on dialysis, there you go.
Story_ID: 571733
Speaker 1: So let's talk about when you moved to New York [New York] and you become a founding member of the National Committee of Black Churchmen.  Can you tell me why that organization was founded and what was your relationship to it?
Speaker 2: Well, the National Committee of Black Churchmen was a group organized to carry on the struggle up north and they made me executive director and I had offices down on 125th Street, near the, oh Jesus, at 125th Street near, where the train comes down.
Speaker 1: So, on, near, that's not Lenox [Lenox Avenue; Malcolm X Boulevard], that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, it's--
Speaker 1: --it's not 5th Avenue, it's the next one.  It's--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Park Avenue.
Speaker 1: Park Avenue.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where I've--
Speaker 1: Now where the L.I.E. [Long Island Expressway] runs?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know about that.  I've been away (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or where the subway train runs?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  It's 97th [Street].
Speaker 2: But we had an office on the second floor of a building where I served as executive director for the National Committee of Black Churchmen and I'll never forget, in 1974, we had our last major meeting in New York before I ended up going to St. Augustine Presbyterian Church [Bronx, New York], but during the five years that I was executive director, we were trying to stir up, 'cause you have to understand that the black church above the Mason Dixon Line wasn't as active as in terms of those of us who had lived in the South and fought to desegregate facilities, restaurants, you know, and the like, in places like Dallas, Texas because when I was in Nashville [Tennessee], I went to all those places and I had to sit and listen to a new set of things as, of white pastors and ministers, "What is it you Negras want?" you know and, again, having to remind them of the same thing that we'd done in Florida, (laughter) how to pronounce the word Negro, that was just the irony of it and I went to places like Texarkana, Flor- Texarkana, Arkansas.  I've been some weird places.
Story_ID: 571734
Speaker 1: And of course, some of the struggle was still going on in places like Mississippi because, I can't remember when Meredith [James Meredith], when the Meredith freedom march [Meredith March Against Fear] started, you know the guy who--
Speaker 2: James Meredith?
Speaker 1: Integrated Mississippi (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At the University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi]?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's right but we left on a march that started in Memphis, Tennessee and that was an interesting thing because we stopped in places along the way and ran into, we were under the direction of the Mississippi highway patrol when we got into Mississippi and the guy who was the head of it was a big burly white man, in uniform and everything, he'd done pretty good until we got to a place in Mississippi, oh Philadelphia [Mississippi], we, we ended up in one of the marches that took us to Philadelphia in Mississippi where they had killed the three young black men [sic. Michael Schwerner, James Chaney, and Andrew Goodman] and he had done pretty good and then we went back to Philadelphia and King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy] was standing in front of city hall in Philadelphia and King had asked Abernathy to pray, to open up the meeting 'cause we were here all, here in Philadelphia.  I didn't close my eyes, I kept my eyes open because I didn't trust these guys and Abernathy prayed and the two sheriffs that he, deputy sheriffs that were eventually tied up to the killing, was standing right behind him and they had, you know, they were watching what was going on and they had smirks on their faces, Abernathy said, "Lord, we thank you for your protection," and the like, I can't remember everything but when we started to move out, all of a sudden this big beautiful car came barreling down and I dove into a ditch and this Mississippi highway patrolman, instead of pointing his rifle at the car, had it pointed down at me.  I said, you know, "I ain't your enemy," but that was the way it was--
Story_ID: 571735
Speaker 1: And we went on down to, we ended up going to Mississippi, and the thing that I remember that, one night, we were in a, I can't remember the town, and Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had made a statement and, of course, people like the fellow, it's the black fellow, he was very radical, ended up dying in Africa.  I know you know his name but anyhow, the upshot of it was that we were followed and we were chased out of town and I remember coming up with Martin beside, because by this time the state highway patrol had poured teargas at us and it was, it was quite a mess but we got out of that situation pretty good.  Nobody was wounded or anything like that, except that I can't remember that we were stationed in this town and this boy, I'm sorry, as well as he was known in the Civil Rights Movement, he had come back and was marching with us and yet he was not accepting quote, that we was supposed to be nonviolent and not respond, oh gee, anyhow, he had come down with guys from Chicago [Illinois], supposed to be bad, bad blacks, packing and stuff like that but every time when we, we went somewhere, they were always woofing and talking but, you know, if you paid any attention and followed behind them, you might end up getting killed because they talked a good game but when it came toward, they were as very much nonviolent as we were 'cause they didn't want to get shot, as I said, I'm sorry, I can't, he was well known, it probably will come to me in a minute.
Story_ID: 571736
Speaker 1: Can you talk about [HistoryMaker] James Forman and the Black Manifesto that he gave at Riverside Church [New York, New York], in particular.  I know that there was an agreement, I think, in Detroit [Michigan] but can you talk a little bit about that manifesto and perhaps about the day that Reverend Forman announced it at the Riverside Church in New York City [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I was here and the irony was that I'll never forget at 475 [Riverside Drive], which is the Interchurch Center [New York, New York], I had this interesting relationship, that when I went, they had barricaded and taken over the building, Forman and the others, and so when I got there, they said, "Which side are you on," some of the whites who were not been able to get into the building?  I said, "It ain't no question, I'm where I am," I'm going to join 'em and they let me in the building and Forman and them had taken over one of the Board of National Mission offices on the, I forget which floor, but, as I said, I had good relationships with Jim Forman and I went upstairs and they were trying to, what, the white Presbyterians thought that I was going to end up being like the intermediary between the two of them and I said, you know which side I'm on because in San Antonio [Texas], I can't remember the year, our church had its general assembly in San Antonio and we took over one of the nightly meetings.  Jim Forman was there, I was there in jeans and stuff like that and we, just wouldn't let white folks speak and we, that was when we first heard indications of the framework of the Black Manifesto because it was later on when we got back to New York [New York] that he read it and everything.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about, a little bit about, can you describe a little bit about what it is, what it meant, what it said?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.
Speaker 1: Not necessarily?
Speaker 2: I, I, you know, it was, it was, that was the thing when there was the demand for money.  As I was, as I said, I remember that much and Forman was asking for reparations, that's what the key word was.
Speaker 1: And did, did you feel at that time that white churches, that white clergies should provide reparations to black churches?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I never had any question of where I stood.  It got me in some trouble but that was okay and they, you know, none of that really materialized but that was part of the demands.
Speaker 1: And would you say that that was an extension of black theology in the James Cone [HistoryMaker James H. Cone] tradition?
Speaker 2: James Cone, yeah.  I knew Cone 'cause he was teaching at Union Seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] and he had written a book, and then there are other folks, a lot of folks that I can think of, a Presbyterian minister who was down in Washington, D.C., oh gee, as I said, I knew I should have had some notes--Gayraud Wilmore [HistoryMaker Reverend Gayraud Wilmore].
Story_ID: 571737
Speaker 1: We're talking about James Cone [HistoryMaker James H. Cone] and perhaps some of the differences between James Cone and [HistoryMaker] James Forman and you said that James Cone (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Forman considered himself as an activist, Cone had the status of being a theologian teaching at Union Theological Seminary in New York [New York].  He wrote books, he was a part of, when I became executive director of the National Committee of Black Churchmen, he was one of our chief spokesman because he had sat down and thought things through and the like but, as I said, and, and Forman had been, as I said, the activist, had been a part of the student movement and the like 'cause you remember he died a few years ago in Washington, D.C. and he wasn't that old.  I sort of lost contact with him but I'd always kept up a relationship with him in terms of his standing and the like.
Story_ID: 571738
Speaker 1: We were still talking a little bit about [HistoryMaker] James Forman.  You had said he died in Washington, D.C. (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) D.C., yeah, but Forman, as I said, I had known him since he was with the student movement when I was in Nashville [Tennessee] and he was in, he participated in everything in terms of the marches and the like and, as I said, I always admired Forman because when he dreamed up the, I guess you would call it the, you said the Black Manifesto--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --which he made certain demands and stuff like that.  I think a few places where the black influence in the predominantly white churches responded in some ways like the Episcopalians, they had every major black, every major church had some very vocal black activists.  I can't remember all but the Episcopal church had them, we had the black Presbyterians, Lutherans, I used to know all those guys, and they made demands individually and collectively on their denominations and some of them when, as I said, I became executive director of the National Committee of Black Churchmen, they funneled some of that money toward my salary 'cause I was on 125th Street [New York, New York] near the train station.  I should remember the date but, I mean the place but, I can't remember.
Speaker 1: I, too, think I know the name of the building that you might have been in and I just cannot think of the name of the building (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: It's just off the train tracks, maybe two buildings in?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's still, that build--it's a historic building and it's preserved.  I know someone who has some offices there now, and I'm pretty certain.
Story_ID: 571739
Speaker 1: So let me ask you about some other initiatives of the National Committee of Black Churchmen.  How did you feel about the Vietnam War?  Did you make, take a stance?
Speaker 2: Well, I was there when Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] made his speech at Riverside Church [New York, New York] and so far as we were concerned, the war [Vietnam War] was all wrong because we took our cue.  Martin made a speech at Riverside Church, as you remember, I forget the exact date, but I was there that night when he made that speech and, of course, it wasn't too long after he was assassinated because I'll never forget, I was in Chicago [Illinois] at the National Committee of Black Churchmen and we had been at a meeting and when we got in the cab, this guy said to us, "Have you heard the news?" and we said, "No." "Well maybe I shouldn't tell you." This is a white cab driver in Chicago.  And so he said to us, 'cause M.L. Wilson [Mannie L. Wilson], who was pastor of Convent Baptist Church [Convent Avenue Baptist Church, New York, New York], he and I were in the cab together and he said, "They shot Martin Luther King," and of course we went back to the church where we were having a meeting and that ended our meeting so far as in the form of discussion.  We watched the news and everything and I got out of town later that night 'cause I had a commitment to preach up here at Pleasantville Presbyterian Church [Pleasantville, New York] and when I stood up that morning, my opening words were, "I'd rather be anywhere than here with you all."  There were a couple of black folks who were friends of mine who knew I was going to preach and I did and that night I left New York [New York] and landed in Atlanta [Georgia] at two o'clock in the morning and, of course, the town was jumping and somebody who knew me said, "Do you want to go see King?" and I said, "No, I don't want to see him laying in a coffin," but nobody went to sleep that night.  As I said, I had landed in Atlanta around two a.m. in the morning and when the funeral, I remember seeing Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy], Nixon [Richard Milhous Nixon], I won't spit on his word but, because less than two weeks later, Bobby Kennedy had been assassinated out in California [sic.] and Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia] wasn't the biggest church and I remember seeing Wilt the Stilt [Wilt Chamberlain], you know, famous black athletes and the like who got in and I stood on the outside and marched with them because at that time, they were taking him to a grave where they buried him and then later on, you know, streets were filled with black folk 'cause this was in Atlanta and I remember, I was trying to remember a black musician, Dizzy Gillespie, I remember seeing him because he had a place down near King's church and that's where I had a chance to meet him, you know, just casually and the like but the place was filled with the who's number one, you know, us people, that's the best way to describe it.
Speaker 1: And did you stay in Atlanta through the funeral?
Speaker 2: I left, I can't remember what my commitments were but I didn't stay, I, after the funeral was over, I got out of town the next day 'cause I had other commitments.
Story_ID: 571740
Speaker 1: So, talk to us a little bit about the National Black Church--Committee of Black Churchmen [National Committee of Black Churchmen] and the Vietnam War.
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, that probably was my primary response because I, King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] made his speech at Riverside Church [New York, New York], which he specifically talked against the war [Vietnam War], I can't remember all the details, but it was the emphasis that most of us who were dying in Vietnam, were black and he questioned the validity of the war and that's where we went from there and, of course, I'm a pacifist, though sometimes I don't always act pacifist and I belong to the Fellowship of Reconciliation [Fellowship of Reconciliation USA] which is a pacifist group over in Nyack, New York that is, carries on those kind of demonstrations and what money I have, I send to support it but that's where I am theologically and the like though sometimes I don't always reflect, very mild, 'cause I get angry sometimes at some of the things that go on, especially Bush [President George Walker Bush] and the war that's going on in Iraq.
Speaker 1: Do you feel that that's a similar war, I mean, last night, the president had said that we're going to, that we would like to have an ongoing presence in Iraq.  Did you feel that similar activity was happening in Vietnam?  Does it feel similar?
Speaker 2: No, I think it was a little different and I, I question Bush's, well I question his mentality partly because I don't think very much of him, mentally or on the like and I think that he will continue the war as long as he can and he's not going to pay any attention to the first--to our people feel because he would have stopped some, and I don't know what all that he's talked about, that we're going to get out of that struggle any time soon and I just hope I live long enough to vote in November (laughter).
Story_ID: 571741
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about Black Solidarity Day?  I heard that the National Committee of Black Minis- Black Churchmen [National Committee of Black Churchmen] had, what was, essentially a day of absence that sounded like it was very similar to that [HistoryMaker] Douglas Turner Ward play called, 'Day of Absence' where all the black people disappear.  Do you remember anything like that?
Speaker 2: Well that was, oh yeah, it didn't end up being that successful but that was one of the things that we did advocate and, as I said, I was in New York [New York] that time and I don't think it was, I wouldn't even say it was hun- 30 percent successful in terms of actually staying away but that was one of the things that we did advocate.
Speaker 1: And what was, what was the purpose of, what were you attempting to show?
Speaker 2: Well, we were trying to show our dissatisfaction with the way things were going.  I can't even remember who was president at that time but it was, again, to reflect our, our failure so far as the Vietnam War was concerned because, you remember when it ended, it ended in sort of like confusion.
Speaker 1: The war?
Speaker 2: Right, you know, we got out and there were people left there and I can't remember all the, the details but it was, it was what, 1974--'2 [1972] because '72 [1972] was when I left the National Committee of Black Churchmen to become pastor of St. Augustine Presbyterian Church in the Bronx [New York].
Story_ID: 571742
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about that church and the work that you did there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had succeeded Edler G. Hawkins who was, when that church was organized, was its first black pastor.  I won't say the first black pastor but, I mean, he was the most prominent and he'd also been our first black moderator of the general assembly of the Presbyterian church 'cause that happened in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] when he, when we were having the general assembly and he was elected moderator of the church, the first black to hold that office.  He traveled, you know, for a year.  He went to see the pope [Paul VI] at that time, but he didn't go a lot of places where other moderators might have gone because even the idea of having a black moderator come to a predominantly white church, they weren't too happy about, and, of course, as I said, I'll never forget when I was still traveling, I was in Denver, Colorado at the Presbyterian church and they had two services and I was to preach at both.  And so, in the morning, in the early morning service, he had, the senior pastor had all of his other, like assistants and stuff and so I told him, between the morning service and the eleven o'clock service, I said, with the exception of a few changes, you're going to hear me say essentially the same thing because I didn't bring but one sermon but, as I said, at the eleven o'clock service, he had the guys, and I said, "You're going to have to hear the same thing again," because he felt that with more white folks, even though I'm a fair-skinned black, there was that, this would offset any strong feeling that his members may have had about it.  So I came into the pulpit at both services, surrounded, and I was the only black there.
Speaker 1: And did that change over time?  Was there eventually more black membership?
Speaker 2: Nah.  I didn't get back to that church but I kept up with a lot of things and the United Presbyterian church has not altered its, it's had to write positions but so far as integration and all like that, it's just like when I went, when I left the National Committee of Black Churchmen and became pastor of St. Augustine Presbyterian Church [Bronx, New York], it was a predominantly, in fact it was not just predominantly, it was all black, and I stayed there for twenty-five years and I was an activist in the Bronx [New York].
Story_ID: 571743
Speaker 1: Because I went through all kinds of crazy things.  I remember the borough president of the Bronx [New York] on Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] birthday had a stupid-ass thing, pardon the expression, where on the corner he climbed up and raised a--named the street, Martin Luther King Day, Martin Luther King, you know, street, for a day and then he took the sign down when it was over with.
Speaker 2: And were you able to get the street more permanently named, Martin Luther King Drive, perhaps (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, a lot of things changed after folks got on board.  Here in White Plains [New York] we have a Martin Luther King Boulevard [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard].  In the Bronx, I forget which street it was, but there was a Martin Luther King Boulevard because after all of, by this time, Martin was dead.
Speaker 2: Did you run for the school board in White Plains?
Speaker 1: Yeah I did and I got, I didn't, I didn't do, I ran against, my candidacy was classified on the fact that here in White Plains, black youngsters ended up being, my daughter [Cecelia Rose Rollins] was in school at this time, in high school, and, you know, they interviewed me and they said, you know, again, the inevitable question, "What is it you people want?" and I said, "I want the same damn thing that you all have," in the sense that she had gotten in to, 'cause she was my oldest and as outspoken and the article appeared in The New York Times about what was happening up here and she had made some comments and things like that were, which were in keeping with how I felt but when I, when I ran for school board, they asked me what I stood for and I said, we want total integration because even though, quote, there was integration, unquote, it was not equal here in White Plains and I'll never forget the last night, which was of the election and you generally stayed around and sort of watched the returns and I was invited to a prominent white home the night of it and I was amazed that some of them had heard some of the statements and raised questions with me and I said, "I stand by 'em," and I didn't win.  I got 1500 votes which was part white and part black but it didn't get a whole lot but that was the way, White Plains has not changed that much.  There's a public housing unit here in White Plains and if they could tear that down, that would quote, except for a few black folks who live other places, they would, they would close us out of downtown but they can't do anything 'cause it's a public housing project and when they did some repairs to it, black folks were scared to leave the units because they thought that if they moved, they wouldn't be able to get back in and I think we have one, what one, there's a guy running for office in the future of, will be one, and he's an interesting candidate.  I met him at the black barbershop and whether you win or not, I don't know, 'cause he's running for office again, but there's not a whole lot of black political power here in White Plains.

Speaker 1: Another thing I wanted to ask you about were the Attica prison riots.  Did you have any involvement with that and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about it?
Speaker 2: Well, Wyatt Tee Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker], who's, used to be pastor of Canaan Baptist Church [Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, New York, New York], when the thing broke, I forget where I was, but we felt the need to go up to it and I convinced Wyatt to come with us because he had sort of an inside track with the more political and higher white folks than I did and we went up to Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York] and reluctantly they let us in and they had been, you know, I mean, at that time, the prison was a pure mess, dirty, filthy and they were, most of the guards up there were white so there was not very much welcome but when we marched and were allowed to go through, you would hear the way that prisoners communicated and they would say, you know they would knock and say, "There's Dr. Walker, Reverend Rollins [HistoryMaker Reverend Joseph Metz Rollins] coming along," and by the time you got to the second tier, they were there and the guys asked you all kinds of questions and even if you brought some extra cigarettes, you gave them to 'em but it was interesting because, as I said, Rockefeller [Nelson Rockefeller] was still governor and we had a meeting down at his office in downtown, Midtown Manhattan [New York], and it was interesting, we got there before he did and we managed to spread out all over the chairs so that Rockefeller didn't sit at the head of the table, he sat at the middle of, of course, and then he had a quote, reputation, quote as a liberal but he wasn't any more liberal than the rest of 'em.
Speaker 1: Now were you able to make some progress in terms of the conditions that were happening at Attica?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I think that the riot, and that's what it was, and they reacted typically in terms of it, they let Wyatt and some of us go in and we were able to see the conditions and they told us about the things.  It was cold 'cause that's Upstate New York and where we came through it was, the place was cold 'cause it's near the Canadian border and it was just, if I had been there before, I wouldn't do any crime that would have sent me to Attica (laughter).
Story_ID: 571745
Speaker 1: Can you tell us anything about the, the Harlem Five trial that happened in Harlem [New York, New York]?  You don't know that one where some undercover cops shot some, some black youth?
Speaker 2: How long ago was that?  I guess, I'm sorry I just don't remember.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-one [1971].
Speaker 2: Oh gee.  Well I was still with the National Committee of Black Churchmen because I did not go to St. Augustine [St. Augustine Presbyterian Church, Bronx, New York] until 1972 and I imagine I must have been involved in it in some way but I can't remember.
Speaker 1: That's quite all right, that's quite all right.  Let me ask you a little bit about your opinions of Billy Graham and the Christian right in general.  If you could tell us historically a little bit about what you thought about Billy Graham (laughter) and then today, you know, do you feel that the, that the Christian right has an impact on the nation as a whole?
Speaker 2: Well, unfortunately, the Christian right does have an impact, a conservative impact.  I was never, I was in North Carolina and I never went to one of the Billy Graham rallies that were here because theologically, I thought he was over here to the right and then he was known as a pastor to presidents and I've never agreed with him theologically on anything.  It was just that way because I, and even his most recent thing where he was, well his wife [Ruth Bell Graham] had died and I felt sorry for him that way, but he was sort of resurrected to support the Bush [President George Walker Bush] thing and I just never, never, never agreed on anything that Billy Graham said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nope.
Speaker 2: --because when he had, I remember he had a rally here in New York [New York] and he managed to get out some black folks but it was primarily a white thing because I don't ever remember him really speaking out at the height of the Civil Rights Movement as supporting the right to vote, the right to have elections and stuff like that and the things that I was a part of in places like Rock Hill, South Carolina, Charlotte, North Carolina, other places that I had helped desegregate, I don't ever remember hearing anything about him supporting our right to have access to facilities or anything like that.
Story_ID: 571746
Speaker 1: Reverend [HistoryMaker Reverend Joseph Metz Rollins], do you think that you have a distinct theology and if so, how has that theology affected civil rights and modern times?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, growing up like I did in Virginia, segregated, down to Florida and all the things, I ended up always being quote, pro-black.  I remember one year when I came home and my father [Joseph Metz Rollins, Sr.] was still pastor of Carver Presbyterian Church [Carver Memorial Presbyterian Church, Newport News, Virginia] and I preached and after it was over, my Daddy said, "I don't understand where Metz is coming from," and I said, "It's not hard for me," because so far as I was concerned, I've viewed my thinking out of a very narrow perspective and, as I said, primarily it was pro-black.  In terms of the theology and people like James Cone [HistoryMaker James H. Cone] who had written the, quote, the first book about black theology, Gayraud Wilmore [HistoryMaker Reverend Gayraud Wilmore], whom I worked for with, with the part of the Presbyterian Commission on Religion and Race [United Presbyterian Commission on Religion and Race] and Gay is still living down near Washington [D.C.] and still writing because just this past weekend, no, just a couple of weeks ago, or a little more than that, in July, black Presbyterians in the Presbyterian church celebrated two hundred years of black Presbyterianism.  They had a big celebration in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at First African Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia where they had music, where they had black Presbyterians coming from all over the country, because one of the things that finally did happen was the realization that with all the progress we have made as black Presbyterians in a predominantly white Presbyterian church, that it is still a lot more to be done.  That's why you have the national committee, not the National Committee of Black Churchmen but that's why they were able to celebrate, an interesting thing at First African Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia and that church is not very large in terms of numerical strength but it was represented two hundred years of our involvement as black Presbyterians in a church that was still sort of anti, I won't say anti-black but not very welcoming.  The man that I succeeded at St. Augustine Presbyterian Church in the Bronx [New York], Edler Hawkins [Edler G. Hawkins], had been our first black moderator of the, of the church.  He was elected in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] and I was there and I remember telling folks, when I got to St. Augustine in 1972, that the Presbyterian church wasn't all that happy about electing this man as his first black moderator and many places that moderators had gone before, he didn't get an invitation.  Oh, yeah, he went to see the pope [Paul VI] but that was in Rome [Italy] and there was nothing so far as I was concerned, earthshaking about that but there were places like in certain parts of the country, up north, or as I'm happy to say, about up south, that he did not get invitations because they were not overly happy that he had become the first black moderator of the Presbyterian church.
Story_ID: 571747
Speaker 1: Can you just talk a little bit about what a moderator is or just define it?
Speaker 2: It's a purely--
Speaker 1: The position.
Speaker 2: It's not a, you know, it's, it's, you know, it's one year and it's, it's, it's, they've elected women, men, Thelma Adair [Thelma C. Davidson Adair], who was in Harlem [New York, New York] and still living whose husband was pastor of a church in Harlem.  She was the first woman moderator, first Afro American, (laughter) see I'm getting the right language, and she's still active and everything and yet it was interesting when her husband passed, I attended his funeral and it was held at the church [Mount Morris Ascension Presbyterian Church, New York, New York] where he had been pastoring all of, and she was very determined that it was going to be reflected as an Afro American funeral.  So, it was very interesting.  The music and the whole attitude and there were a few, you know, white folks that had come to his funeral 'cause they had all known Gene Adair [Arthur Eugene Adair], he'd been a pastor in Harlem for a long time.  He'd come from down south and along with Hawkins [Edler G. Hawkins], Adair, there's another fellow, Rendall Presbyterian Church, who had been a chaplain and I knew him 'cause I was a frat brother of his but again, even in the New York [New York] scene, it was pretty much limited, you know.  I remember, he used to come down south to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] and he was the only guy I knew who wore his frat pin, 'cause he was a Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] like me, on his clerics, but he had been a pastor in Harlem at Rendall Memorial Presbyterian Church [New York, New York] at about 137th Street, behind Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] and he was a Kappa to his heart but his experience was quite limited, you know.
Story_ID: 571748
Speaker 1: When I die, I guess they'll remember me for being a Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] since 1945, that's when I pick--crossed the burning sands.
Speaker 2: Did you pledge at John C. Smith University [Charlotte, North Carolina]?
Speaker 1: Johnson C. Smith University, Alpha Epsilon chapter.  I wasn't able to go down this past year.  They celebrated seventy-five years and a lot of my friends that are still living who are around were down for that experience but, you know, the black fraternities and of course we're integrated now, but there's the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], the Kappas, Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] and Phi Beta Sig- Sigmas [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity] and we used to do things, I won't even quote, where we would sing songs like (singing), "Let's go down and piss on the Kappa house--on the Alpha house (laughter)."  You don't include that (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Unruly behavior but also, of course, your fraternity did community service and other fantastic supportive (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --events.
Speaker 1: I remember, but I remember when I was being initiated, way back in 1945, they had a habit of taking us downtown on the last night of initiation and there were four of us who were going to become Kappas and a fellow named Cecil Ivory, who I knew from Cotton Plant, Arkansas, and he would come to be a pastor in Rock Hill, South Carolina, he took us down, made us walk from Johnson C. Smith campus to the town square and put four of us, one on each corner, and then he lifted us up off the sidewalk, I mean standing, with a paddle and I, when I came off and had become a Kappa, it was about six, eight weeks before I could walk too good 'cause in those ti- and I'll never forget, we were standing there waiting and I was one of the last one and there was a white cop, he said, "Damn, if this is what it takes to go to college, I'm so glad I didn't go (laughter)," 'cause he was seeing us get lifted up.
Story_ID: 571749
Speaker 1: And Cecil Ivory was a tall black fellow from Cotton Plant, Arkansas and he had been pastor at Rock Hill, South Carolina and at that time, students were still giving demonstrations and there were some youngsters in jail in Rock Hill, South Carolina where he was pastor, and I went down because that was part of my job and Cecil Ivory and I were, you know, frat brothers [in Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] and we went downtown.  I'll never forget, it was on a Saturday, and when we got downtown of Rock Hill, South Carolina, there was these crowds of white folks, I started to say, honkies, but that was what it was, and Cecil turned around and went back to his house and said, "Metz [HistoryMaker Reverend Joseph Metz Rollins]," 'cause he was sort of crippled, "Go upstairs and look in the nightstand and bring what you see," and when I went upstairs in his house and opened up the nightstand, there was a loaded pistol.  It was Cecil's pistol.  I brought it back downtown and he put it on the seat because we had given him an instrument even though he was crippled so that he could drive and he put it on the seat between us and I said, "Cecil, what the hell are you going to do?"  He said, "I'll tell you," 'cause I said, he had not been raised in any kind of nonviolent thing.  He said, "If them, mess with me, I'll take two or three of 'em before I'm finished," and we drove downtown with this pistol, loaded pistol, sitting on the seat between us and fortunately nothing happened and I spent the night at Cecil's house 'cause I preached the next morning but, as I said, I remember that he was born in Cotton Plant, Arkansas and his experience with white folks and the whole racial thing, just made him react very strong and, as I said, there's a picture in one of the old Jet magazines, long time ago, showing him being wheeled out of the jailhouse in, in Rock Hill, South Carolina by a sheriff 'cause we had helped him, and he had stood up against them in terms of the changes that were taking place because desegregating the South had not been an easy thing.
Story_ID: 571750
Speaker 1: Do you feel that desegregation of the South and up south, the Upper South, has been successful?
Speaker 2: Well I think two things.  Black folks have more power down south than up south and that has happened in Greensboro [North Carolina], in Charlotte [North Carolina], you got black mayors.  I can't even remember in Nashville [Tennessee] where I lived for five years, we helped desegregate and there were, there was an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] attorney named, Attorney Lubie [Alexander Lubie], he was from the islands and he was an elderly gentleman but he was part of the NAACP lawyer and the one who, when you said, Lubie, Mr. Lubie didn't take no crap and he was active in, you know, right on up until his, his death, when he was there in Nashville, Tennessee.  And so a lot of changes that took place were interesting because in Memphis, Tennessee where my friend James [ph.], oh boy, I have to stop and think, he's, he's in Nashville right now, he was a Methodist minister and he had been put out, he was planning to, he was planning on going to ministry and he was not allowed to attend Vanderbilt seminary [Vanderbilt University Divinity School, Nashville, Tennessee] at that time and he came up here to Boston [Massachusetts] and got his degree and he came back to help lead demonstrations 'cause he was a believer in nonviolence also and he just recently retired.  In fact, last year, retired as a Methodist preacher out in California and guess what?  Vanderbilt invited him back to spend a year as a visiting professor, consultant.  I haven't talked to him to find out how it's been going but it's a different, it's a different Nashville from what we knew when I was there.
Story_ID: 571751
Speaker 1: And what about up south?  Things have improved but only slightly and less, what you were saying earlier, was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think, I think one of the things that I discovered, well it wouldn't have been to my surprise, that the black clergy that you would have thought would have been most vocal up south were not and they accepted a lot of stuff to be quiet, to get some little extra benefit.  I, I won't call names and stuff like that.  What I know, a lot of guys and they would ask me crazy questions like, "Well what have you been doing recently, Metz Rollins [HistoryMaker Reverend Joseph Metz Rollins]?" and I said, I'm trying to free white folks and free black folks at the same time but they didn't, if they were in Atlantic City [New Jersey], if they were here in Harlem [New York, New York], you know, they were big time preachers but they didn't do much to change the situation and one of the things that I discovered after I came to the Bronx [New York] was that we were having a general assembly up in Hartford, Connecticut, this is the whole national church and this is where Hawkins [Edler G. Hawkins] had been the first black moderator but it was in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma].  And so I said, we'll take a bus up to Connecticut and they were surprised because when I got off the bus and started walking, they said, "You know everybody?"  I said, "You're damn right I knew everybody," because I knew the different guys who were now in positions of power and worked and they all spoke to me and during the first four or five years that I was pastor at St. Augustine [St. Augustine Presbyterian Church, Bronx, New York], I was always inviting prominent and, I'll never forget, Gay Wilmore [HistoryMaker Reverend Gayraud Wilmore] who was a good friend of mine and he and I worked on the Commission on Religion and Race [United Presbyterian Commission on Religion and Race] where he was the boss, I had invited Gay to preach at St. Augustine and, of course, Gay came in all of his glory with an African robe and everything like that and Gay is a great preacher and I used to say that the Presbyterian church could pay him just to sit around and think about what the issues were facing us but I had to make a long story short, when he finished preaching at St. Augustine, the whole congregation stood up and gave him applause and I took to the pulpit and I said, "Y'all never did that for me," but Gay was a great preacher and when they just celebrated two hundred years of black Presbyterians in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in July at First African Presbyterian Church, he was one of the speakers.  Now I'm eighty-four and Gay is about, I'm eighty-one and Gay is, I think he's a couple of years older than me but he's still active, still writing, still preaching and the like and his wife is sick and he lives down in a retirement home in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] but Gay is still active and still able to get around and everything.
Story_ID: 571752
Speaker 1: When it's all said and done with, what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Well, that I was an activist, that was primarily my role and I was an agitator because I'll never forget, when the general assembly was meeting down in San Antonio [Texas], I went down and we were on the floor, we were on the evening program and I showed up in jeans and a denim shirt with some cowboy boots and those days I was able to wear, before the diabetes starts striking me, but I used to favor boots and it was just interesting and some of my compadres used to say, "Well, you're nothing but an agitator."  I said, "Yeah," 'cause Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] used to have a thing about, about the dryer or whatever it was and he would refer to himself as an agitator who helped to spin, I can't remember exactly.  When Martin was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well the washing machine has that agitation piece in the middle--
Speaker 2: But that, but that's what Martin--
Speaker 1: --moves the clothes.
Speaker 2: --referred to himself as one in that situation that he was--and he was, you know, because it was amazing that when we were together in places like Mississippi, and we had been on the Meredith freedom march [Meredith March Against Fear] and we got down to some place in Mississippi and the patience of the protection that we had and we got teargassed and I'll never forget both of us ended up together and I had taken off my t-shirt to cover my nose to escape the teargas and I looked up and there was Martin about two, three feet away and, you know, it's amazing that he survived as long as he lived.  It was bad enough that he was killed in 1968 but there was a real genuine hate in certain parts of the South where Martin was concerned because they had just never had that kind of thing, of black preachers, especially in the South, speaking out and that's the way it was with me.
Story_ID: 571753
Speaker 1: When I was in Tallahassee [Florida], I didn't realize, 'cause I used to stay up 'til twelve, one o'clock and realized that some of the members of my church [Trinity United Presbyterian Church, Tallahassee, Florida] were out there protecting or watching over me and they said, "Damn, don't you ever go to bed (laughter)?" but, and I was lucky that I survived because when I left Tallahassee, this was, I was in Nashville [Tennessee], and I had gone out and I paid off all my debts and one of my checks bounced, fifty dollars, and I didn't, they bounced in Nash- you know, for something that I paid in Tallahassee, and I was slow in putting the money back and the next thing I knew, they came to get me.  Well, they were going to take me back to Tallahassee for this and fortunately I had a fellow named Will David Campbell [sic. Will Davis Campbell] who was a Baptist preacher who grew up in Mississippi, had been a chaplain at the University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi] but Will was a great guy and he bailed me out for about two hundred dollars and when I contacted a lawyer, 'cause they had a segregated law school at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University College of Law, Orlando, Florida], he told me, when I called him, he said, "Metz [HistoryMaker Reverend Joseph Metz Rollins], if you had come back down there, they were going to put you in jail, put your ass under the jail."  I mean, that was how they were determined to take care of some of us who had been, as I said, agitators, but I don't ever regret.
Story_ID: 571754
Speaker 1: I remember when they sent a cop out to arrest us and my wife was pregnant with my youngest child, my son [Joseph Metz Rollins III], who you saw, and when she came to the door, this cop, "I've come to arrest your, your husband."  And so she was feeling, you know, and so he, she said, "He's having dinner."  "Well, I'm sorry, he's going to have to wait."  And so, he, when I came to the door, I told him, I said, "Ain't no point in your getting upset."  I said, "I'm going on with you downtown."  And he said, "Well you can take your car."  I said, "No, you came for me, I'm going to ride with you," and I climbed in the front seat beside him and he took us on down and this gentleman who was my physician and my elder, Dr. Russell Anderson, came down later, posted my bail 'cause Doc had, had a Ph.D. and he taught his way through Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] and ended up in Tallahassee [Florida] and he and I had a very good relationship.  He said he would stand behind me and when we went downtown to meet with some of the white Presbyterians, he came up with a very interesting thing.  He said, "Let me tell you how I feel."  He said, "If you folks want to lay your head on a rock, I want to be right there laying beside you."  He was talking to a white fellow, he said, "But if you want to put your head on a feathered pillow, I want to be there too."  And there was one elder who couldn't stand, he had a white--a black man talk like this any longer and he got up and walked out the meeting.  He just couldn't take it but Doc was my rock and when they called me, I went down to his funeral.  His family paid for me to come down when I was up here in, and I went down and participated because Doc had been, as I said, my rock.  He was a tough guy and he had started out in Frenchtown [Tallahassee, Florida], that's where his office was, on the other side of town in Tallahassee and then he moved his office over near Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and at one time he had been the college physician and he didn't give anybody any break when it came to, 'cause Doc would say, you need to be in school but I never had the nerve to ask him that when he was teaching at Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina], they had the rumor that he, his wife had taken a course under him and he flunked her but I, I never asked him that.  I didn't have the nerve (laughter).
Speaker 2: We want to thank you for being an agitator and we want to thank you for spending time talking with us today.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm egotistic enough to think that maybe that's something I'll leave behind.
Speaker 2: Indeed.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It was a pleasure.  I, I just wish my memory could have been better 'cause I'm certain that there are a lot of things, I didn't keep a diary and a lot of things, 'cause I knew [HistoryMaker] John Lewis when he was a student at, he was going into the ministry and then he later ended up being a congressman.  He's, and he, I'm flattered that one of the few times when somebody wrote a book, I'm listed in there because he considered me his friend and Abersnatchy--I'm sorry, Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy] (laughter) was a--I'll stop.  I'm just being off the wall right now.  You're not recording any of this?
