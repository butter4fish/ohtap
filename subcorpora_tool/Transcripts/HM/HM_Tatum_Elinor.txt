Story_ID: 54909
Speaker 1: Okay, so Elinor I wanna start out by--I wanna start with your mother, and I'd like to have her name and what you can tell us about her growing up.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Susan Kohn Tatum.  She was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1934.  She, along with her family--well, most of her family--fled the Nazi occupation in 1939.  And being of Jewish decent, they would not allow any more Jews into the United States by 1939, so my mother and her family went to South America.  And they settled in Quito, Ecuador, where she lived with her many cousins and uncles and aunts for about another 10 years until they moved to Queens in New York [New York City, New York] in, in the late 1940s--early 1950s.
Speaker 1: Did she tell you much about her growing up in those various places?
Speaker 2: Well, she doesn't really remember Prague because she was four years old when she left.  And she doesn't remember much about the journey from Prague to Czechoslav--from Prague to South America to Ecuador, but she, she remembers a little bit about when she actually lived in Ecuador and the cousins that were around.  And we actually just had a family reunion in Ecuador this past year.  But she, she came to New York when she was about 14 years old, and she went to high school not too far from here, over on--near Union Square, actually on Irving Place.  It was an all girls' school, and when she graduated from there, she ended up going to FIT, Fashion Institute of Technology, and she became a chil--children's clothing designer.  And so for many years she worked for the giants, such as Healthtex, designing children's clothing.  And then she did a small foray into hat designing, but at--while she was a children's clothing designer, she got involved in downtown New York City politics.  She was a member of the Village Independent Democrats and did leaflet-ing and campaigning for various candidates in the early '60s [1960s].  And that's how she met my father [Wilbert Tatum], was on a political campaign in, in the mid 1960s.  And then after I was born, she--
Speaker 1: Do you know which organization it was part of--
Speaker 2: The Village--the Village Independent Democrats.  And the actual campaign was they campaigned to make Ed Koch [Mayor Edward I. Koch] the, the ca--the district leader for down here.
Story_ID: 54910
Speaker 1: What I found interesting was--what was your father [Wilbert Tatum]--can you talk about what wa--he was doing here.  I've often thought of Harlem [New York City, New York] politics and the clubs--you know, political clubs in Harlem.  So what brought him here?  And then I wanna go back to his family background.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I just--
Speaker 2: So my father came to New York and he became a community organizer.  And when he first got here he lived on the bowery, and then he lived at a place called the Church of All Nations, which was on 2nd Avenue between Houston and 1st Streets.  And it was kind of a Bohemian organization that had people from all over the world, all over the country, coming together to make a difference.  And he was part--he was a secretary of an organization called the Cooper Square Committee, which was located over on 4th Street, and that was all--the organization was about trying to preserve the Lower East Side [New York City, New York] and the East Village [New York City, New York] of, of Manhattan to have affordable housing and whatnot.  And that's where he was in the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s].  And so he also became involved in local politics down here, and so that's where the Village Independent Democrats came in, and they met on Ed Koch's [Edward I. Koch, former mayor of New York City] campaign.
Story_ID: 54911
Speaker 1: So talk about your father and his background.
Speaker 2: My father [Wilbert Tatum] was one of thirteen, born in North Carolina in 1933, the son of a sharecropper [Eugene Milton Tatum] who happened to have a newspaper that as my father says printed whenever they had enough advertising.  It was actually a few newspapers [Henderson, Clinton, and Goldsboro Tribune].  They were all farm newspapers, and my father was the managing editor at nine years old.  We only have one copy of that newspaper, and it happens to be a copy where there's a picture of my father and his twin brother, Gilbert [Gilbert Tatum], coming back from the tobacco fields where they worked.  So my grandfather always wanted a newspaper like the 'Amsterdam News,' so the 'Amsterdam News' was kind of his dream, and so it was something my father was very intent on some day fulfilling his father's dream.  He, my father, was a great orator, and, and when he was high school he won an oratory contest, which actually brought him up to New York City [New York City, New York], and he got to be the managing editor of the 'Columbia Spectator' [Columbia Daily Spectator] for a day.  Unfortunately, I don't know where the photograph is right now, but I've got this wonderful picture of him at an editorial meeting at the 'Columbia Spectator' when he was still in high school.  So, as I said, my dad was one of thirteen.  They never knew they were poor.  He used to talk about eating pieces of bread with black strap molasses and lard on them, and how--what a-- what a treat that actually was, and how they used to take baths--the boys used to take the baths after the girls 'cause they was using the same water (laughter).  And he had a--you know, a wonderful childhood of sorts.  It was hard; it was crowded; it was cramped, but there was a lot of love there, and you know, it made him the man that he is today or he was when he passed.
Story_ID: 54912
Speaker 1: But he [her father, Wilbert Tatum] went over to Lincoln University in Lincoln, Pennsylvania where he got a partial scholarship.  He then left to go into the Marine Corps and he served in Japan in, in the Korean War.  He got shot in the butt there.  And then he ended up almost finishing Lincoln [Lincoln University], but he didn't have enough money to pay the rest of his tuition, so he never actually got his degree at that point in time--or at least he had an outstanding balance.  And from there is when he came to New York [New York City, New York].  And--but after the Marine Corps, he one day got into a fight on a bus with somebody and decided that he did not wanna be a black man in America anymore.  And a man named Gunnar Myrdal, wrote the 'American Dilemma,' [An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy] who was a Swedish sociologist or anthropologist, he had said to my father one day when my father went to one of his talks, if you're ever in Sweden, come look me up.  So my father decided that if he didn't leave, he was gonna end up killing somebody--leaving New York.  So he got on a plane with very little money and went to Stockholm, Sweden, and went and looked up Gunnar Myrdal.  But Gunnar was in the United States touring at the time, and so my father had one other name of a woman named Sun Axelsson, who was a Swedish poet.  And so he went and he found Sun's apartment, and he knocked on the door and Sun wasn't there, but her friend was there and said well, Sun is Greece for the summer; I'm going to Greece tomorrow, but you're welcome to stay in our apartment; here are some coins for the heat, because everything was on a pay for the steam system in the apartments.  And we'll be back in touch, but you're welcome to stay here for as long as you want.  And then he got a few other names of people, one of them being Artur Lundkvist, who held the 17th chair on the Nobel Prize committee.  He was responsible for all the Latin American authors for getting the Nobel Prize because Artur personally translated them.  And so he, he got in with the Swedish literati, and he was responsible for protests against Dukes in the Swedish Harbor, got arrested in Sweden for that.  And then after Kennedy's assassination [1963], his friends in Sweden said it's time for you to go back to New York.  It's time for you to go back to the United States.  You've got work to do there, and that's when he came back to the U.S.  But while he was in Sweden, he wrote a column in Scandinavian newspapers called 'Being Black in White America.'  And so that's when he got involved in community activism right here in New York 'cause when he came back from, from Sweden.
Speaker 2: So did, did--he hadn't been in New York before he left.  He had been--
Speaker 1: He had been--
Speaker 2: he lived in--
Speaker 1: No, he had been in New York for a little while.
Speaker 2: For a little while.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 54913
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father [Wilbert Tatum]?
Speaker 2: In which way?
Speaker 1: Just personality wise.  How would you--
Speaker 2: Oh, larger than life, a gregarious, strong, a big flirt, and wonderfully warm, but very purposeful at the same time.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother [Susan Tatum]?
Speaker 2: Understated, strong, passionate, loving.
Speaker 1: And how would you say--what do you have of each of your parents?
Speaker 2: All the good and definitely all the bad of both of them (laughter).  I'm very much a blend of, of both of them.  I think I take after my dad a little bit more in some things, but it's been--and people say that, you know, when they see me they--I remind them of my father, not only in the way I look 'cause they see him in my--in my face as well, but in the way I carry myself, the way I speak, and the way I connect people.
Story_ID: 54914
Speaker 1: So, Elinor, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of growing up?  Well, I've got some memories that I'm actually sure if actually happened or if (laughter)--or if it's something that I made up.  My mother [Susan Tatum] tells me I made it up, but I remember it happening.  It was just around the corner from here walking across 3rd Street [New York City, New York], and has nothing to do with anything more than walking through huge puddles that were up to my waist because there was a drain that was clogged.  But it was walking through my neighborhood, and this is the neighborhood that I've lived in my entire life.  A lot of my first memories are of the block that I live on and the changes that it's gone through.  Because when I was little, you know, this was not a very nice place to live.  It was a place where there were alcoholics and drug dealers, and there was a men's shelter on the block.  And you know, I was--I was afraid to walk out of the house a lot of the times, but when I got inside I was in a safe haven.  But my parents were very instrumental in making this neighborhood change to what it is now.  And what's so amazing about this neighborhood is, while you've got, you know, five brownstones on this side of the block, you've got Section 8 housing across the street, a men's shelter down the block, and a four-star hotel on the corner.  And the people that I knew when I was growing up are still the same people that I see walking down the street today.
Story_ID: 54915
Speaker 1: So describe your block--I mean what it was like to grow up on the block.
Speaker 2: Well, when I was really small it was mostly the epitome of the bowery bum, old alcoholics who would--many of them had been Vietnam [Vietnam War] vets who were just down and out, harmless, but smelly, and you know, they--the--they loitered everywhere and, and littered the streets.  But then when the 1980s came and the crack epidemic came, the men that were in the shelter became younger, more aggressive, more dangerous.  The dealing that was on the block was incredible.  I mean, it was nonstop, day and night, 24 hours a day.  It was--it was terrifying at times.  At one point in time, my parents [Wilbert Tatum and Susan Tatum] actually wanted me to go stay with my best friend on the Upper East Side [New York City, New York], because they didn't want me coming home after I went away for summer camp because it had gotten that bad.  At that point in time, we worked with the city of New York, and we had mounted police on the block 24 hours a day until they got the drugs off of the street.
Story_ID: 54916
Speaker 1: So can you--can you--can we--you--we take you back and you tell me what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I'm not very good (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well you mentioned some of the sights, but let's try sights, smells, and sounds.
Speaker 2: Urine, booze, and, and police cars (laughter).  Those were the smells that were outside.  But inside--even though I'm a vegetarian, my father [Wilbert Tatum] loved to cook, and he loved to cook things like ham hocks, and beans, and chicken, and--so I remember those smells inside the house.  Those were good smells; outside not so much.
Story_ID: 54917
Speaker 1: So when you--so tell me about the family household, 'cause you're an only child?
Speaker 2: I am, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how are you--I'm just trying to understand what it was like to grow up in a household where both parents are active, right?  And it--
Speaker 2: But when I was very young, my mother [Susan Tatum] did not work.  She, she stopped working for a while, and it didn't get to what she started doing later.  She actually was the head of distribution for the 'Village Voice' for many years, when the 'Village Voice' was, was a paid newspaper.  And she had--she was distributing over I think a 150,000 copies of the 'Village Voice' every week.  But, you know, when I was very small, my father [Wilbert Tatum] was deputy borough president of Manhattan [New York City, New York], commissioner of the garment district, commissioner of urban renewal in Harlem.
Speaker 1: But see this--so how would--
Speaker 2: So we he was very busy.
Speaker 1: He was ver--so how do we get from their activism?  Can you fill in those pieces to him being deputy borough president? 'Cause that--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, but--
Speaker 1: --that's--I mean, that--
Speaker 2: But--let--when he start--there--there's, there's--as a community activist, he was very involved with what was going on all over the city, and in--I guess it was probably late 1960s, very early 1970s--well, there's a woman named Elinor Guggenheimer, who was the first woman that was on the board of estimate [New York City Planning Commission], and she--my father decided that they need to get some attention to what was going on in Cooper Square that is, and so he staged a sit-in on her office.  And she was so excited that someone was sitting in on her that she sat in right back on them and stayed with them, and she and my father became fast friends.  I'm actually named after her.  And she was one of the most amazing women in New York City history I believe.  She started the New York Women's Agenda [NYWA]; she started the Women's Forum [Women's Forum of New York]; she was a woman that was for women's rights, started all those women's organizations; for children's rights, and for, for elder rights as well.  And so she, I think helped a lot to get him going in, in that direction.  But then he became borough president--it was deputy borough president of Manhattan under Percy Sutton [in 1970].  And I'm not exactly sure how that happened.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But, but--did--before that he was involved in the Lindsay [Mayor John Lindsay] administration--in the John Lindsay administration.
Speaker 1: But I know that, that the period that you're talking about was hugely important to Harlem [New York City, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I--as I understand it, there's a--I can't remember the name of a club that, there was a Harlem's men's club [Gang of Four/Harlem Clubhouse] that--you know, political club 'cause you--you know, that helped elect, you know, Percy (unclear)--you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Basil [Basil Paterson]--whatever--all [Mayor David Dinkins and Congressman Charles Rangel] were part of.  But so do you--ha--are you born at this point?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, you're not born, so you--
Speaker 2: I wasn't born until 1971.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right so this is a--so what have you heard about that period?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, my father was deputy borough president under Percy--under Percy Sutton.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I just--I don't remember.  He never really talked about how--
Speaker 1: He never talked--
Speaker 2: --he got involved--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --in that.
Story_ID: 54918
Speaker 1: When you asked me a question before about when my first memory is.
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: My other first memory happens to be of a board room down at city hall, where I was at a table with my father [Wilbert Tatum] and a whole bunch of men.  And my father was at a meeting, and I started pulling on his coat sleeve, and he said: "What is it honey?"  And I said something to him.  I have no idea what it was, and he told the room to be quiet for a moment.  He said: "Excuse me gentlemen, my daughter has something to say."  And he let me say whatever my idea was that had to do with whatever they were talking about.  And I wasn't more than four years old--five years old maybe.  And what I remember about that is knowing that my voice was important.  That's probably one of the best lessons that I ever learned from my father was knowing that my voice mattered, and it was something that I will hold on forever.
Story_ID: 54919
Speaker 1: So you're, you're at--I mean, that--so at that point that you remember that he [her father, Wilbert Tatum] is deputy borough per--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --president?  [Manhattan Deputy Borough President] Okay.  And that--he served in that capacity how long?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure how many years he was there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but he was commissioner of the garment district; urban renewal; he was partially responsible for Schomburg Towers [Arthur A. Schomburg Plaza] being built on 110th Street--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But think--this is a really important historic time--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for New York's black community, politically a time that hasn't--well, it led actually to the election of, of Dinkins [Mayor David Dinkins].
Speaker 2: Yes, many years later.
Speaker 1: Many years later.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But that's where it started.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So we're talking about there's a lot of activism that's coming out of the '60's [1960s].  This is--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --happening.  There's a lot of energy.  There's--what you point to in New York [New York City, New York] that's a little different is it's very multicultural in some respects, you know.  And, and then you have the music.  What I think about this area is you have the, the music, the beatnik--you know, the movement, the communists, the--I mean, all--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of that's sort of happening.  But--
Speaker 2: The red diaper babies.
Speaker 1: The what?
Speaker 2: The red diaper babies.
Speaker 1: The red (laughter) diaper babies.  Were you a red diaper baby?
Speaker 2: No, no, but, but apparently we did go to some--there was a camp called Camp Wingfoot I think, which was up in the Westchester area [New York], which was a--you know, socialist bent type of community camp that I believe we went to (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you're--we're talking now about, you know, '75' [1975], '76' [1976], you know, '77' [1977].  So what are you--what--you're mother's [Susan Tatum] at home.  She's--you know, she's a stay-at-home mom.  So what is that like?  What is your--because your mot--your father's [Wilbert Tatum] off.  Is there--is there activity that spills over into the home or is it--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I mean, we had people coming through here left, right, and center.  I mean, to have Percy Sutton in here, to have mayors in here, to have governors here was just a--it was everyday life.  You know, these people were just part of my--the, the people that I was around--Charlie Rangel [Congressman Charles Rangel], Basil Paterson [New York Secretary of State Basil Paterson], Percy Sutton [Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton], David Dinkins.  Now I worked on my first political campaign in 1984 with David Dinkins when he was running for borough president.  I was 13 years old.  And so these were just part of--these were my parents' friends.  And, and my father tried to take me to as many things as he could.  I-- and I was out at events as a kid all the time.
Speaker 1: So what do you hear about the discussions?  What are you hearing about that are issues the day or of concern?  What do--
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean, I'm five and six years old--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --at that time, so--
Speaker 1: Definitely not.
Speaker 2: --I don--don't, don't--
Speaker 1: That's right, you don't remember.
Speaker 2: --really, really--don't really remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but I'm saying but--when you got older even.
Speaker 2: When I got older, I probably wasn't as engaged (laughter).
Story_ID: 54920
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about what memories you have of that time period
Speaker 2: Well, I, I remember, you know, people used to make fun of the brownstone down here, living down here in the East Village, and--'cause we were pretty eclectic people and so we've got a little bit of everything around.  And so in my high school year book, (unclear)--you know, they have a last will and testament, and they left me cleaning out the brownstone.  And they also thought that, you know, I dropped names a lot, but when the governor did actually call yesterday, is that really--is that dropping names or is that just your everyday life.  You know, you pick up the phone and it's Mario Cuomo [Gov. Mario Cuomo] on the phone.  And (unclear)--hello, Mr. Governor, are you looking for my father?  Here he is (laughter), and--but I just remember, you know--well, the one thing I do remember mostly about my childhood and my father was Saturdays.  'Cause Saturdays was my day with my dad, and almost no matter what was going on, Saturdays we would go to this club called the Atrium Club, which was a health club over on 57th Street, between Park and Lexington Avenue.  Though it had a fitness room, and a, a swimming pool, and all of that stuff--and saunas--it's also where my father held court.  And he would go there, and he would have meetings, and lunches, and go work out, and then more meetings and lunches.  And I used to go there with him every Saturday, and I remember one of the people that, that also brought their kids there was a guy named Sid Bernstein.  Sid Bernstein was the guy who brought The Beatles to America and--so I mean--so my childhood was rather eclectic in that respect.
Story_ID: 54921
Speaker 1: So what are you--what is the young Elinor like, though?  I mean, are you--what were you like?  Did you live inside your head?  Were you gregarious?  Were you--
Speaker 2: I was in every single show that you could possibly imagine at school, so I was out there singing and dancing.  I was part of a group called the National Dance Institute.  I--
Speaker 1: This is at what age when you were in the National Dance Institute?
Speaker 2: That was elementary school.  I went to Hunter College Elementary School.  Started there at nursery school, so I started there at three years old.
Speaker 1: So that's like a lab school--what they call the lab--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so Hunter College Elementary School was actually run by Hunter College [New York City, New York] itself, and you had to take a test to get in at--and I was three years old, and I went there through the 6th grade.  And you know, what--I was very lucky because I went there, and because I was at a school for gifted children, they found out early on that I have a learning disability and that heard--dyslex--I had dyslexia.  So in the first grade I couldn't read, and so my teacher, Mrs. Holly, said to my parents [Wilbert Tatum and Susan Tatum], "Elinor is really, really smart, but she can't read; we have to get her tested; there's something--there's something not right here."  And so a whole generation of teachers at that school learned about learning disabilities, very much because of me.  Because most of the time they just got the kids out of the school, and my parents were like, no, she belongs here; we're gonna get her the help she needs; you're gonna help her; and we're gonna make this work.  And so it was a really interesting learning experience for me and for my teachers, because my teachers later wrote to my parents and said, thank you for helping us to understand what this really meant.
Speaker 1: So they--your parents were advocates--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the truest way.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, and my father actually used to come into school once a month.  He was the cooking daddy, and he used to cook with the class.  And my grandmother on my mother's side used to come in and sew with the class and do crocheting.  So my parents were always very involved in my education.
Speaker 1: Were you ever aware that you were of mixed race during--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, what's really funny is that my best friends growing up in elementary school were all mixes of some sort.  It may not have been black and white, but you know, one of my best friends was half Irish, half Japanese.  Another one of my closest friends was half Australian, half Swedish.  And it was just--we were all these mixes of all these different nationalities, different cultures, and we all gravitated towards one another.  And it was never really about being different; it was just about being us, and we were completely accepted among each other for that.  But I was--I was very fortunate not to see growing up a lot of you know, blatant racism towards me.
Speaker 1: And you didn't really even experience that when you--in, in, in elementary school either, right?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Story_ID: 54922
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean, both-so, tell me, though, what life was like dur--you know, at home?  What was home life like?  Were there chores you had?  Or do you remember special celebrations?
Speaker 2: Well--it--because my mother [Susan Tatum] is Jewish, we celebrated all the Jewish holidays as well as all the other holidays, so it was--you know, it was always a party (laughter) in that sense.  So we always celebrated Passover; we always celebrated Hanukkah.  We went to my grandmother's house usually for Passover and then sometimes we did it here ourselves.  Thanksgiving was always huge in our house, and we always had extra people over.  I mean, we've had up to 25 people for Thanksgiving dinner, and we had a household that was very open.  And we always had visitors from all over the world coming and staying with us, sometimes for a week, sometimes for a month, sometimes for a year, but--I mean, from every walk of life, from every corner of the globe people came through and became part of our family.
Story_ID: 54923
Speaker 1: And so you're in, in middle school--you go--wait, you go--
Speaker 2: I went to--
Speaker 1: Hunter.
Speaker 2: --Hun--Hunter [Hunter College Elementary] through the 6th grade.
Speaker 1: Through the 6th gra--
Speaker 2: And then my parents sent me to private school, because at that point in time the public schools still really could not take care of children with learning disabilities.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So I went to the Dwight School, which was on the Upper East Side [New York City, New York] at the time, which was a small private school.  It had about 300 students in 7th through 12th grade.
Speaker 1: Oh, it is small.  It was fairly small.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so a hundred--like, a hundred students a class?
Speaker 2: No, not even--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --because we're talking--
Speaker 1: Three hundred you said--
Speaker 2: Five, six--6th grade.
Speaker 1: Oh, you said between--oh--
Speaker 2: Six grade, yeah.
Speaker 1: --between 7th and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's about 50, 50 per class.
Speaker 1: Wa--and that's where you graduated from?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where--
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.
Speaker 2: --I graduated from.
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell us about Dwight.  What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  It was very, very, very privileged, and there were some really horrible people there, and there were some really wonderful people there.  Some of our famous alums included Lizzie Grubman, who was the PR maven who hit some folks out in the Hamptons, and Paris Hilton (laughter).  So those are some of the illustrious students--oh, Damon Dash was also wa--and I actually have a very funny story about Damon Dash.
Speaker 1: How did Damon Dash come to--okay, go on.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, Damon was about two years younger than me I think, and he was--I just remember him being this horrible young man.  And we were in the lunchroom one day, and he yells across the room, "Look at those watermelons."  And I'm like, "Excuse me, what are you talking about?"  He's like, "Look at those cantaloupes."  And I'm like, "What are you talking about?"  And I'm playing with him at this point.  He's like, "Look at those grapefruits."  And I said, "Damon, are you talking about my breasts?  Can you say the word breasts?"  He never bothered me again.  And I told him this story when I ran into him about five or ten years ago, and his son was there.  And he said, "Okay, you have to repeat this for my son."  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 54924
Speaker 1: So what--tell me--I know it was privileged, but how do you think it affected you going there [the Dwight School in New York City, New York]?  And, and ha--they were better at services there?
Speaker 2: They were better at services 'cause I had the money and they understood learning disabilities.
Speaker 1: Because I've heard that people say sometimes they have to rely on public schools because their--
Speaker 2: Well, see at that point in time--now the public schools have a lot more resources, and they have IEPs [Individualized Education Programs] and they understand learning disabilities in a way that they did not.  Because in the 1970s the word dyslexia was like a dirty word.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: It was something to be ashamed of.  That's--
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly, and so there was no help.  People just ignored it.  In the public schools they put you in the slower track, I mean, to the point where I had a teacher in the 6th grade at Hunter [Hunter College Elementary] who basically told me that I was never gonna amount to anything.
Speaker 1: I had read that.  I had read tha--
Speaker 2: And, I mean, she was this absolutely horrible, old woman who I couldn't stand.  Her name was Mrs. Kerry.  She was downright evil, downright evil.  And so one of my favorite stories about her is I ran into her in the--in the summer of 1989, when I had just graduated from high school.  And she saw me, and I said "hello, Mrs. Kerry."  She's like, "hi, how are you?  Have you graduated from high school?"  And I said, "well, yes."  She's like, "well, are you going to trade school?"  And I said "oh, no.  Actually, I'm a scholar at St. Lawrence University; thank you very much."  And I walked away from her.  Four years--no, five years later I ran into her again.  I'd completed four years at St. Lawrence University, a year of graduate work at Stockholm University, and I was then editor at the 'Amsterdam News,' and--I may not have actually been an editor yet, but she didn't need to know that.  So I run into Mrs. Kerry again.  She lived not too far from here.  She said, "so what are you up to?  Did you graduate from college?  Do you have a job?"  I said "well, yes; I'm an editor at the 'Amsterdam News,' thank you, and what are you doing?"  She said "I've retired," and I looked at her and I said "thank God," and I walked away and I never saw her again.
Speaker 1: See those people--you never--I mean, it's that story of people, you know.
Speaker 2: But I've got--but I've got a good story from that same place.  There was a woman named Mrs. Kagan, and that name might be familiar to you, that last name Kagan.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, I know.
Speaker 2: Well, there was a woman named Gloria Kagan, who was my teacher at the same time that Mrs. Kerry was my teacher, and she worked really, really hard with me and made sure that I was successful.  She was this great woman.  In 1994 or 1995, a piece ran in the "New York Times" about me.  It was on the public lives page.  And I got a note from her, and the note just said, "It's so great to see my kids grow up so well."  And Gloria Kagan happened to be the mother of Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan.
Speaker 1: That's lovely.  But she, she's brilliant herself.  That's lovely.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 54925
Speaker 1: So can you describe to me how they went about working with your dyslexia?  How did--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: How--
Speaker 2: --what I found out later, as I--I went to a tutor three times a week.
Speaker 1: During--is this both at--
Speaker 2: That was in elementary school and then through parts of high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--but I think it went--I went a little bit less during high school.  A woman named Lynn Hacker--and I found out really not too long ago that it was my grandmother on my mother's side who had actually paid for that, 'cause my parents [Wilbert Tatum and Susan Tatum] couldn't afford that along with everything else, because we were talking about hundreds of dollars a week.  And my little old grandmother was the one that supported us through that.
Speaker 1: So what--so what were the--so was the tutor--and what did the tutoring actually help you do?
Speaker 2: Well, she ma--taught me how to learn differently, and how to organize myself, and how to be able to function in a--in a literate world, and learn how to read, and learn tricks, and learn how to spell, and--you know, this was all before we had spell check and computers and all of that, so it was a different world.
Speaker 1: So do those techniques you still employ?
Speaker 2: Probably.  I have no idea.  They're so much just a part of who I am at this point.
Story_ID: 54926
Speaker 1: So, so that--okay.  So when--so in, in high school [Dwight School], is there an active arts component to, to--
Speaker 2: The plays--the plays and the musicals.  I was in almost every single play and musical that existed.  When I wasn't in them, I was working on the stage crew.  I was in the chorus.  I did the talent shows.  I was always performing.
Speaker 1: And was there thought at that point that you wanted to do something on the stage?  Did you ever think about that?
Speaker 2: I thought about it, but when I was seven I really decided I wanted to be the first black Jewish female President of the United States of America, so that was kind of my goal.  But performing, you know, and politics are really one in the same.
Speaker 1: And you know that it's not too late for that too either (laugher).  You still could be that first.  So when you are--um, Elinor, let me ask--in high school what is sort of defining you?  Are you--you know, I know you're active in theater, but who are your friends?  What are you thinking you wanna do?  You know, what things--what are your favorite plays?  Are you going to plays as well as being in them?  You know, where is music a part of your life?  I mean, tho--that's what I want.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, my friends--I did not have a clique, so to speak, when I was in high school.  You know how there're girls that just hang out with one set of girls.  I kind of floated around everyone and everything.  But I also had a side passion, which was horses and horseback riding, so I went to summer camps that were involved with horseback riding and things like that, so not as much performance but horses.  But, you know, my friends were the people that had the same ideals and the same values as I did, and they came from every single walk of life, from all over the place.  I also had friends all over the world.  I also hung out at other people's high schools.  I hung out at the United Nations International School, UNIS, a lot.  Some of my closest friends are still from there.  The teachers actually used ask me where my homework was from UNIS.  Because I hung so much there, they thought I was a student (laughter), and that was a great international community that I became very close with.  It--and, and the singing and the plays were mostly in school itself.  We had a chorus that traveled to England when I was in the 7th grade, I think it was.  We traveled all over the UK [United Kingdom] singing.  It was also another amazing experience that I had.  So I never really fit into any mold of any one sort.  I was just a kind of person that just fit into whatever I needed to, kind of sort of.
Story_ID: 54927
Speaker 1: Now your father [Wilbert Tatum] got involved with 'Amsterdam News' at what point in time?
Speaker 2: Well, he became part of a group that bought the 'Amsterdam News'-in 1971.
Speaker 1: So all of this--1971 is the year you're born.
Speaker 2: Yes, the year I was born, right.  So that was a group that included Percy Sutton, Carl McCall [New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall], David Jones, John Edmonds, and a bunch of others, and I can't re--John Procope and a bunch of others.  So after my father got out of politics, so that's when Abe Beame [Mayor Abraham Beame] was no longer mayor, and Ed Koch [Edward I. Koch] became mayor.  Now you gotta realize that though my parents met on Ed Koch's campaign, by the '80's [1980s], they no longer--or late '70's [1970s]--no wanted anything to do with him, and they actually despised each other.  But my father ended up going to H--
Speaker 1: Now do you remember why that was?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was--it was politics.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --politics.  And so then my father became the senior vice president for marketing for the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, which became known as HIP, which is now EmblemHealth Care.  And so he did that for several years and then assumed the role as publisher of the 'Amsterdam News' in the mid '80's [1980s].  And so Koch was mayor at the time, and he did something like 200 front-page editorials of why Koch must resign or be removed.  And you know, a lot of that started over the Sydenhan Hop--Sydenham Hospital closure that happened in Harlem under the Koch administration.  And what was so interesting is that there's an organization in New York City called ABNY, the Association for Better New York, and a few years ago, they had all the living mayors on stage together.  And Charlie Rose was doing the interviewing of these mayors.  And they asked each mayor what they are--what they most regret--or what was the biggest mistake that they made?  And Ed Koch finally admitted it was the closing of Sydenham hospital.
Speaker 1: So your, your father--there's a lot of rub--I mean, he, he would--he was very, very vocal--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --when he had opinions about things.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I mean, very, very vocal.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 54928
Speaker 1: And, and so how are you--are you aware in high school?  Are you in your own little world?  Does it take time--
Speaker 2: Well, well, well I was aware of it because of how it [her father's activism] directly affected me.  Because at one point in time, and there was the huge ruckus in the 1980s with Louis Farrakhan [Louis Farrakhan Muhammad, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Now explain that--oh, my goodness, I hadn't thought about that.  Okay, because--
Speaker 2: So, so there were--there were--
Speaker 1: Explain the context, though.
Speaker 2: Well, there were--there were several different contexts, because there was some statements that he had made about Jews and being called--and so he was he called an anti--se--Semite.
Speaker 1: He, he, he made the term--he talked about--well, Reverend Jackson [Rev. Jesse Jackson]--well, there was also the issue--
Speaker 2: Well, Reverend Jackson said "Hymietown".
Speaker 1: --Town, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so what I remember--one of--one of the major events that I remember that really brought work into home was Minister Louis Farrakhan and some statements that he had made to, to mass audiences about Jews in America.  And now there were--there were several facets to this, because there were things that Farrakhan said that were taken out of context.  One of them was when he spoke about Hitler as a "great evil man."  And a lot of the press took it as him saying that Hitler was a great man, and there were a few other things that he said that, that were taken completely out of context.  And my father [Wilbert Tatum] vehemently supported Farrakhan and what he said, saying Farrakhan did not say what you're saying he said, and so then my father was labeled an anti-Semite.  Here he is with a Jewish wife, a Jewish daughter, and my father is an anti-Semite because he supported Farrakhan.  You know, fast forward not very far and Farrakhan had said something else, and I don't remember exactly what it was.  And my father was on him, saying you can't say this and saying that this was anti-Semitic what, what you had said.  And Farrakhan's followers put out death threats and kidnapping threats and bomb threats on the house, on the family.  And so for several months I had 24-hour security, with police taking me to school and staying at my school all day long every single day.  I couldn't go anywhere with a police presence.  I mean it was great because I didn't have to wake up as early to get to school because I had a police escort everyday to school, but it was scary.  That was a scary time.  But again, what was very interesting is that when Farrakhan said something that was taken out of context and my father defended him, the Jewish community said my father was an anti-Semite, but when my father went against Farrakhan, saying you have said something anti-Semitic, the Jewish community never came back and supported him.
Speaker 1: So how are you navigating?  You're seeing all of this.  What sense do you make of it?  And what is your father thinking?  And what is your mother [Susan Tatum] saying, because this comes to home?
Speaker 2: They didn't talk about it.  They really didn't talk about it.
Speaker 1: And you didn't ask questions?
Speaker 2: You know, it was--I think at that point in time, I was just about to go off to college, and I was just that--I was gone.  I was gone, so it wasn't something that--you know, the, the part of about Farrakhan and when I was actually living it, I knew the truth.  I knew my father was never an anti-Semite, never was going to be.  Some of his best friends were Jewish.  He worked together with the Jewish community on so many things.  I'd--he was a great friend to Israel.  I'd--I know when I was a kid he was going to Israel every few years.  He'd brought me to Israel the first time when I was 13 years old.  I--the mayor of Jerusalem was a close friend.  We used to spend, you know, thou--Christmas Eve with the New York ambassador from Israel to the--to New York decorating our Christmas tree every year.  So they knew the truth, and I knew the truth, and that's all that really mattered.
Speaker 1: And I think--but those things can be complicated when you're a teenager sometimes, trying to navigate.  So you were pretty comfortable in your place, and you were also maybe somewhat sheltered.  I mean, I--this is--
Speaker 2: You know, I, I--well, you've gotta remember that we're talking about the 1980s, where you've got TV and you've got radio.  You have no Internet.  You've got no social media, so it was a completely different type of landscape.
Speaker 1: Because--so you--but if it were today, it might have been different.
Speaker 2: It would be completely different.
Speaker 1: Different, because you couldn't shield yourself--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --from that and things, and that could be over and kids read it and they, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 54929
Speaker 1: So, you know, I want to go back.  I was just looking and reading about--'cause that was--that was sort of fac--that was actually fascinating about the Farrakhan [Louis Farrakhan Muhammad, Sr.] discussion and especially becau--but you--this whole time you're not feeling you have to navigate both worlds.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I had a boyfriend when I was 16 years old, and he said to me: "okay, all the blacks are on one side of the room; all the Jews are on the other;  where do you stand?"  I said "in the middle."  And he said "no, you have to choose."  And I said, "who says?  Why do I have to choose?  These are both my identities."
Speaker 1: And it's just the case where a lot of times people are not as comfortable navigating both identities at all.
Speaker 2: Well, you know--I mean, I went--I went to St. Lawrence University in Upstate New York, which is a predominantly--
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: --white college.
Story_ID: 54930
Speaker 1: So let's talk about--I wanna talk about that, how you--that was where you end up going.  But I wanna ask another question about when you were 10 and you wrote a letter.  Do you remember this, that you--
Speaker 2: To the "Staten Island Advance?" [A daily newspaper for Staten Island in New York City]
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: Asking my dad [Wilbert Tatum] to spend more time with me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he (laughter)--and--
Speaker 1: So how did that come about?
Speaker 2: I, I don't remember, but it was--but I think at that point in time at 10--it might actually--it might have been even earlier than that.  Because I think I dictated it to my mother, the story as to how I was going to hold him captive in the bathroom, and I wouldn't let him out 'cause I wanted to smother him with kisses.  And I wouldn't let him go anywhere because I was--as you even acknowledge, he was a very, very, very busy man, and I wanted to spend more time with him.  And so he got a hold of this, and he sent it to a newspaper called the "Staten Island Advance," and they published it as a letter to the editor (laughter).
Speaker 1: So cute.
Story_ID: 54931
Speaker 1: So what happens?  How do you end up choosing--
Speaker 2: St. Lawrence. [St. Lawrence University]
Speaker 1: St. Lawrence?
Speaker 2: So, I looked at schools that, number one, had good facilities for people with learning disabilities, even though it [dyslexia] wasn't affecting me a lot at that point in time.  And then I was looking at smaller liberal arts colleges.  So I looked at five schools, and they included St. Lawrence University, Ithaca [Ithaca College], Alfred University, Boston University, which was not small, and Lincoln University in Lincoln, Pennsylvania, which is my father's alma mater.  So I decided I didn't necessarily wanna go to an HBCU [Historically Black College and University] at the time, so Lincoln was off the table.  I'd visited BU; I hated it.  I visited Lincoln; I hated it.  I visited Alfred University; I hated it; St. Lawrence was the only one left.  And my parents said to me flat out if you don't like St. Lawrence, you'll just reapply next year, and we'll find a school that works for you.  I walked onto the campus of St. Lawrence, and I had an ah-ha moment.  This was the place I had to go to school, and I have never regretted that decision.  It was one of the most wonderful educational experiences that I could have had.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about it?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if it's place or if it's the school itself or a combination or it, the people.  I'm not really sure, but it was a place I just ended up fitting in.  Did I have my issues there?  Of course I did.  Every young person has their issues going to college.  I'm--in my first week of school, on my dormitory hall there were maybe one or two other black kids.  And on my third day of school I walked into the lunchroom, and this black student, an upperclassman, said when you're finish with lunch come over and talk to me.  I said okay, sure.  Guy's name was Andre Beacoats.  I even remember his name.  And after lunch, I walked over to him and he said, so you don't have a lot of black friends here do you?  I said I've been here for three days.  I just haven't met folks yet.  He's like, "So, how'd you pay for school?  Grant, scholarship?"  I said no.  "Oh, so daddy paid?"  And I said excuse me?  And we talked for a few more minutes, and I walked away, and I was like, this is really odd; this is really weird.  And you know, I started getting involved in the Black Student Union; I started getting involved in the Jewish Student Union; I got involved with the student government; I got involved with the choir--the traveling choir.  And as I said in high school, that I didn't belong to one clique.  I could float from any part of campus to another being just exactly who I was.  So it didn't matter if I was at an event for the Jewish Student Union or for the Black Student Union.  And I did not say that I could only be friends with one group of people and not another.  So I was just as comfortable hanging out at the BSU as I was with any other group including a sorority that I had joined, which was predominantly white.  I took classes that I loved.  You know, I was a government major, but I ended up minoring in history and sociology in my last two years because I could, and I was having fun doing it, and I was learning.  I was always overcommitted.  You know, I was one of those people that, if I'm doing a lot, I get it all done.  If I'm doing too little, I get nothing done.  And so, you know, I was involved with up to 11 extracurricular activities including the equestrian team at St. Lawrence.
Speaker 1: So you kept the, the riding.
Speaker 2: Kept the riding going.
Speaker 1: Did they have stables in place?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did.  And I was in a sorority.  I was a--in the student senate.  You know, I just--I was a student ambassador, which meant that I worked in the admissions office.  And I just--I got myself completely intertwined into campus life.
Story_ID: 54932
Speaker 1: So what were--what were summers like?  What were you doing summers?
Speaker 2: Well, growing up my summers were incredible.  And this is another funny story about how my family kind of collects people.  So, I think it was right before I was born.  My father [Wilbert Tatum] was at a housing conference in Washington, D.C. where he met a woman named June Rolands, and she had a cottage on a lake in Canada.  And she invited my mother and father up to visit her on this late in Canada, and so my parents went up to this lake in Canada, and they fell in love with it.  Well, there happened to be a land auction I think a week or two later.  My parents came back up, and they bought a plot of land on this lake in Canada.  So for the first nine years of my life my summers were spent on this lake in Canada.  My mother [Susan Tatum] and I used to go up for the entire summer, and my father used to come up on the weekends, and so I was in the middle of nature.  It was an eight-mile dirt road, a forty-five-minute drive to the nearest store.  So I was catching frogs and tadpoles, and swimming in this 14-mile lake, and just being a country kid, so I had the best of both worlds.  I had New York City [New York City, New York], and I had this place in the country.  So that was until I was nine, and then at nine is when I got my love for horses, and I started going to summer camp.  And so I went to summer camp from nine all the way through high school basically.
Story_ID: 54933
Speaker 1: And then I had the most amazing summer of my life in the summer of 1990.  In nine--in the summer of 1989, my parents and I went to Sweden to visit some of my father's [Wilbert Tatum] friends.  It was the first time I had ever gone to Sweden.  And I met a woman there named M. A. Fitzgerald, who was a journalist who had been stationed in Africa.  And I told her how I really wanted to go to Africa, and she said sure.  Come with me next summer as my assistant.  So next year goes, and I'm finishing up my first year at St. Lawrence University.  And I'm in the choir there so we stay all the way through senior week because we sing at graduation.  And I go to my mailbox one Sunday morning, 'cause I hadn't gone the day before, and I found this letter from this woman, M. A. Fitzgerald, saying "Love for you to come to Africa with me, but my flat mate's son is doing a trip with a bunch of young people.  I think you'll have a lot more fun if you go with him."  And I read the information.  It was an organization he had put together called Student Transport Aid.  They were gonna be helping refugees fleeing from Mozambique into Malawi.  I said oh, this sounds amazing, so I immediately got on the phone and I called this guy named Dan Eldon.  It was 7:00 in the morning LA time.  I'm calling a college student on Sunday morning at 7 a.m.  I'm just speaking ten million miles a minute--said "Hi, my name is Ellie Tatum.  I'm a friend of M. A. Fitzgerald.  She told me about your trip, and I really, really wanna go."  And he said "what, who, what, huh?"  And I repeated everything a little bit slower.  We talked for about five minutes, and he said "okay, here's my mother's telephone number in England; call my mother; she'll make your travel arrangements."  I called this woman, Kathy Eldon, who I'd never met before, gave her my parents' credit card number, and then called my parents.
Speaker 2: And then so--wait, but that is like a chance of a lifetime.  Now-
Speaker 1: And it--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: So this is after your freshman year?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So this was the summer of 1990.
Story_ID: 54934
Speaker 1: So when you are--I still find it--so nothing--how large was the black population on campus [St. Lawrence University]?
Speaker 2: I think there were 60 students.
Speaker 1: Okay, out of--so it's--
Speaker 2: Two thousand.
Speaker 1: So it's a small--so it was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --even smaller than smaller.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So there was no--they--was there a black table--you know how like on a lot--
Speaker 2: Well, this--BSU, the Black Student Union.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but they were not intimidated.  'Cause sometimes people want you to choose.  You know--
Speaker 2: They wanted me to choose, and that's what that guy Andre did.  And I told him point blank that I wasn't gonna choose one--I wasn't gonna choose 60 students versus 1940, because I wanted to have a full experience, and I didn't wanna limit myself to just one group of people.  And eventually he learned to accept that, and we became great friends.  I remember performing with him at the Black Box Theater on campus one--for one event singing a Prince song together.  He was a great, great guitarist.  But I, I just wanna--I wanna get back to that trip to Africa because it was--
Speaker 1: Yes, please--(simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 54935
Speaker 1: It--'cause it--what, what happened was really fascinating.  So after I called this woman, Kathy Eldon, and told her I wanted to go and gave her my credit card (laughter)--my mother's [Susan Tatum] credit card information, I called my mother and father [Wilbert Tatum] and told them what I was doing.  And so that summer I ended up going back to Sweden with my parents, spent about--spent, spent a few weeks there, took a boat from Sweden to England where I spent my--well, my best friend's birthday with her the night before I was leaving.  And I met Dan Eldon for the first time that night, and the next day I got on a flight to Nairobi [Nairobi, Kenya].  And so there were fourteen of us from seven different countries.  We traveled over land through Kenya, Tanzania, and Malawi helping refugees fleeing into Mozambique.
Speaker 2: That's pretty--now there were--that wa--a lot was happening politically during that time--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --even--so was there any concern on the part of your fam--your parents or--
Speaker 1: You know, they were so good.  They never voiced a concern.  They let us go, and we were all under the age of 20.
Story_ID: 54936
Speaker 1: We were all under the age of 20.  Not one of us was over the age of 20.  Now the most fascinating part of this trip was where we all are now.  There were 14 of us from varying places around the world who all had one common thread, which was Dan Eldon, in a--but I had never met Dan before I got there.  So here I am now 20 years--23 years after that trip still close friends with everybody that was on that trip.  Actually, my friend Marta from Norway, who I met on that trip, left this house yesterday.  Haden, who also was on that trip, was here two weeks ago.  So Haden runs an orphanage in Kenya, while she is also the chair of the English Department at a college in Washington State.  Marta's the head of communications for the Flying Doctors of Nor--of Norway.  Now that's some of the stuff that is mundane compared to what some of the other folks are doing.  Amy Eldon, who was Dan's little sister, she turned 16 on the trip, was nominated for an Emmy Award for her documentary called "Dying to Tell the Story." [1998] Dan Eldon, by the age of 22, had had the front cover of every single news magazine and newspaper in the world basically, covering what was happening in Somalia.  He was stoned to death in July of 1993, so he died at age 22, three years after our trip.  Roko Belic, who was also on our trip, a Chicago native, was nominated for an Academy Award for his documentary 'Genghis Blues' [1999]; Jeff Gettleman [Jeffrey Gettleman], East Africa Bureau Chief for 'The New York Times;' Eiji Shimizu, producer for the movie 'Happy,' [2011] which has won awards all over the world, talking about what it means to be happy.  He worked on that with, with Roko Belic.  And probably one of the most famous out of all of the folks that were on this trip was a movie director named Chris Nolan [Christopher Nolan], who did 'Batman,' 'Batman Begins,' 'Batman Returns.'  [sic, 'Batman Begins,' 'The Dark Knight,' and 'The Dark Knight Rises.'] So we were all under the age of 20, and this group--and none of us would be where we are today if it was not for the influence of that young man, Dan Eldon, who was, was killed in 1993.
Story_ID: 54937
Speaker 1: So tell me what the whole trip was like.
Speaker 2: It was crazy.  I mean, it was--it was insane to think that our parents actually let us go (laughter), but it was wonderful.  We all had our jobs that we had to do.
Speaker 1: So what were some of your jobs?
Speaker 2: Well, for me, I, I ran the kitchen basically.  Because I actually--I mean, I figured out how to make crepes on safari, and because we--it was an easy thing to make because we could always take flower with us, we could always get eggs, and we could always get something to put them in.  And so we traveled over land, we camped, we stayed in really sleazy hotels, and when we got down to Malawi, we split into groups, and we went to all the aid agencies and interviewed all the aid agencies until we decided which aid agency was gonna do the best with what we had to give them.  And so we ended up, we--using two different aid agencies.  One was Save the Children, Malawi, and the other one was the Norwegian Refugee Council.  Through the Norwegian Refugee Council, we were able to give enough money for them to build two wells on a ref--on an island that housed 300 refugees and blankets for a children's hospital.  Through Save the Children, Malawi, we donated to them Arabella, which was one of our trucks, and money to keep it on the road so that they could transport supplies and refugees as needed in the area.
Speaker 1: So who's financing Dan [Dan Eldon] on--you know, how was this--
Speaker 2: We all raised the money.
Speaker 1: You all raised the money.
Speaker 2: All of us raised the money, and we raise something like $15,000.  And we pulled all the money together and we used it for, whether it was, you know, food, or shelter, or money that we actually ended up giving over to the different aid organizations at the end of the day.
Speaker 1: Do you know what happened with the work that you did, you know, that--
Speaker 2: Well, our, our, our, our wells are named after our, our trucks, Desiree and Arabella, and as far as I know, that they're still running today.
Speaker 1: Did, did you come across other American groups there like the Peace Corps, Peace Corps volunteers, or--
Speaker 2: Not that we saw when we were there, but we made a lot of friends with all different sorts of people.  I mean, the--when we were down in Malawi, we ended up living on somebody's lawn for a week.  We just camped our tents out on somebody's lawn that we became friends with.
Speaker 1: And so you--now, it's English--no, it's not, is Malawi? --is it--
Speaker 2: It--there, there--they did speak English, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's English--English speak--English speaking, okay.  So that--you come back and it's your junior year, right?
Speaker 2: Sophomore, sophomore.
Speaker 1: Sophomore year.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's between your freshman--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and sophomore year.
Story_ID: 54938
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So you come back.  You're feeling quite, quite, quite worldly at this point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so does school still have its same fascination?  I mean, usually people--I mean, I know this is the summer--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but you know, when you've been doing something so meaningful and--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, at that point in time I decided you know what?  I wanna try something different, so I actually left St. Lawrence [St. Lawrence University] for a minute to go to Lincoln University.
Speaker 1: I read that and I wasn't--so you--well, why, why did that strike you?  This is just, it seems like out of left--
Speaker 2: Because I wanted--I wanted the experience of being at an historically black college.  I didn't necessarily want four years of it, but I wanted to try it, and I wanted to go to my father's [Wilbert Tatum] alma mater.  And I ended up having one of the worst experiences of my life.  The young women that lived on my hall stole my credit card, spent thousands of dollars on it, tried to tell the police I was in on a credit card scam with them, and basically ran me out of the campus, so I lasted a month there.  And it was a very disheartening experience, because the then president of Lincoln would not even give us a call back, and my father was a donor to Lincoln.  It was his alma mater, and--oh, what--the part about Lincoln that I never finished about my father was 20 years or 30 years after he should have graduated, but he hadn't paid his full bill, he went to the registrar's office--the bursar's office at Lincoln and said, I've got an outstanding bill; I'd like to pay it.  And the woman said we don't have our records from 40, 50--30, 40 years ago.  And he said well, I think it was about $500, and so he settled up with Lincoln University.  And so after this is when I went to Lincoln.  And the president of Lincoln never returned a phone call.  She had underlings call us.  At the same time, the president of St. Lawrence University--
Speaker 1: Was her name Niara Suda [Niara Sudarkasa]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, at the same time there was a--the president of St. Lawrence University was a woman named Patti McGill Peterson, and we informed her as to what happened.  It was too late in the semester to get in--back into St. Lawrence for the semester.  She said go to school anywhere, and we will take the credits, so I ended up going to The New School for Social Research right here in New York [New York City, New York], where I had one of the most brilliant academic semesters I have ever had, and it was amazing.  I took the most amazing courses, and that's when I decided to minor in history and sociology.  And I went back to St. Lawrence and--
Speaker 1: So you were living at home when you were going to The New School?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was living at home when I went to The New School.  And--
Speaker 1: So then you go back to St. Lawrence your junior and senior years then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can't remember when I actually did that semester.  It's, it's mind-boggling how the mind plays tricks on you, but I can't remember if it was the, the spring of my sophomore year or the fall of my, my junior year.  And actually I can't even remember what I did in those summers either (laughter).
Speaker 1: I don't remember in the summers in the--
Speaker 2: I don't--but that--the summer of 1990 sticks out in my mind--
Speaker 1: Because that's--I mean, it's--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that's a life--
Speaker 2: And that--
Speaker 1: --changing experience.
Story_ID: 54939
Speaker 1: Right.  And then those other summers I don't remember until the summer where I decided--the summer of 1993, after I graduated from college, and I decided to go to Sweden to go to graduate school.
Speaker 2: Which is--this the other thing your father [Wilbert Tatum] had been--
Speaker 1: My father had lived in Sweden.
Speaker 2: in Sweden, so that's--
Speaker 1: And--but there was a key--there's one key reason why I wanted to go to graduate school in Stockholm.  You didn't have to take the GREs to get into the program (laughter), and I didn't test well because of my learning disability [dyslexia].  And so that was a reason, and I got in, and I loved Sweden, and I had a place to live.  But while I was there that summer, that's when Dan [Dan Eldon] was killed.  And so the first person I was on the phone with was to my friend, Marta in Norway.  And you know, Dan had been in New York visiting us, and he was so much a part of, you know, my, my life, and his death affected us profoundly.  I mean, his pictures were the thing that brought the Marines to Somalia to begin with.  His pictures reopened people working on the famines in Ethiopia.  He had a profound impact on American media and also on where the news went.  So then I--so I ended up in Stockholm, and I went to Stockholm University for a year studying social welfare and the Swedish model and hoping that I could apply what I learned in Sweden, bring it back to the U.S.  What I found out was---I watched the Swedish model kind of sort disintegrate in front of my very eyes, and saw that the issues that they were having there were the same issues that we had had 20, 30, 40 years prior.
Speaker 2: So you're saying in Sweden--so what is happening in Sweden at this time that the Swedish model sort of falls apart and disintegrates?  So I don't--I'm not aware of that, that, that--
Speaker 1: So there's, there's an increase in immigration, and the immigrants no longer are white.  They are now North African, Southern African, Turkish, Iranian, people of color in general.  And the Swedes didn't let--lower--when there were just a few, it was a novelty.  But when they came in mass, they weren't taught about difference.  They didn't know about people that were different from them, and so when there are a lot of them, it's something to be feared rather than admired and revered.  When my dad was there, he was one of--you know, one black guy in a million whites, and it was something exciting and special and interesting.  But when they were there in mass, as refugees, the Swedes just didn't know how to deal with them.  They were ghettoized, and there was a different standard of living; they were living in places that were meant to be wonderful but just really weren't.  At the same time you had the rise of the---some neo-Nazis up in, in Sweden, which you never saw before--white supremacists.  I mean, there was the head of the Swedish Social Democrats, the Student Social Democrats, which is like the Democratic Party here in the U.S, had a swastika carved into her face while I was living there by some skinheads.  There were protests through the center of Stockholm by young people wearing masks protesting against immigrants, but so afraid to show their faces and not even knowing what they were standing for.  So that's what I meant when I say watching it fall apart.
Speaker 2: Because all--you know--(unclear)--seem to pe--be an idyllic community--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: ---is what you're saying and that shows--you know, and they ha--don't they have a, a nationalized medicine program too--
Speaker 1: Yes, they do.  All of Scandinavia does, yeah.
Speaker 2: What else are your learning about yourself through Elinor I mean in--you know, at this point in time because, you know, you're, you're an a--young adult at this point, and you're forming your own ideas.  What else is informing those ideas and--you know, you're having international experiences which let you see the United States in a different way.  I'm just--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was--I mean, you--it was very interesting, especially when I was living in Sweden, because my friends and I would talk about American politics, and I would agree with them.  And they would be like, why do you agree with us?  You were supposed to be, you know, pro-American.  I said I am pro-American, but I'm also pro what's right, and we're not necessarily doing all the right things.  And so having that world view of the United States and having--being able to look at it from a different perspective I think added a lot to, to what I was seeing and what I was understanding.
Speaker 2: So you, you graduate from St. Lawrence.  You, you spend that--no, no, you've already graduated.  You go there for three--
Speaker 1: One year.  One year at Stockholm.
Speaker 2: One year.  Okay, one year.
Speaker 1: So I'm on a bus--
Speaker 2: You mean--but all of that happens in that one year.
Story_ID: 54940
Speaker 1: So I'm, I'm on a bus with my father [Wilbert Tatum] in Stockholm [Stockholm, Sweden].  It's I think August of 1994.  And my father looks at me and he goes "okay, it's now or never."  I'm like, what do you mean, Dad?  He's like, you're coming to work for the 'Amsterdam News' or I'm selling it.  I start crying and I say, Dad, you told me that you wanted me to go out and do my own thing first, and now you're telling it's now or never?  And he said, "yeah, it's now or never."  So the Tuesday after Labor Day of 1994, I started working at the 'Amsterdam News.'
Speaker 2: So did you have a discussion with him about why he said it was now or never?
Speaker 1: Well, it became apparent.  Within six months of me starting at the newspaper, my father had a quadruple bypass.  And from there his health--he had more and more health issues over the next eight years.  And then I was named publisher and editor-in-chief in 1998 [sic, 1997].  At point in time, my father--I can't remember if he had just had an accident or just about to have an accident, where he fell when he was sitting at a table.  The chair broke and he hit the back of his neck on the table behind him, and it caused a stenosis on his C5-6--4, 5 and 6 vertebrae, which when he finally went in to have surgery on it, he became an incomplete quadriplegic.  So for the last 10 years of his life he was confined to a wheelchair.
Speaker 2: So--but he--so you literally took over.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, at that point in time, you know, he was still very, very much involved with--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --the paper, and--
Speaker 2: Now for what period of time did you overlap.  Because what--
Speaker 1: We, we, we overlapped until his death [2009].
Speaker 2: Oh, so he would go to work?
Speaker 1: Yeah, when he was in the wheelchair, he worked from home.
Speaker 2: He worked from home, okay.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But that's 10 years that he worked from home your saying.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, about 10 years.
Speaker 2: Ten years that he worked from home.  The thing that I, I wanna ask because I'm just trying to--your father--so you come back in 1995 or '6' [1996]?
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-four [1994].
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-four [1994] you come back.  And so what are you learning about the newspaper business?
Speaker 1: Well, I started at the very, very bottom.  I mean, literally--and this is when there were still faxes and photocopying, so I was faxing and photocopying and going and getting lunch for the editors.  That's where I started.
Story_ID: 54941
Speaker 1: But you know what?  I have--I have to back up for a moment because I've gotta go back to St. Lawrence University, where I worked on the newspaper for all four years.  And I was an editor there, and I learned how to cut and paste.  And this is before the digitization of newspaper production, where you actually had to take letters out if you spelled a word wrong and move copy using wax and x-acto knives.  And I got really, really good at it.  I was the layout editor for quite a bit of time while I was at St. Lawrence as well as the editor-at-large.  So when I got to the 'Amsterdam News,' we were still doing pagination that way.  And so when I started going to the production house and started to actually work on laying out the paper, the other editors were really upset because I could do this stuff really well because I'd learned how to do it in college.  But, I mean, I really--I started at the very, very bottom.  Eventually I got to rewrite press releases, and then I got to assigning stories, and then I got, you know, promoted, and then I got promoted again.  And then I decided to go to graduate school, and I went to NYU [New York University] for graduate school.
Speaker 2: In journalism.
Speaker 1: In journalism.  And so I was working--
Speaker 2: And you went in 1996--6.
Speaker 1: Yes, '96' [1996], '97' [1997].
Speaker 2: Seven.
Speaker 1: So I was working full time and going to school full time, really trying to apply what I was doing every day at work into school and from school into work.
Speaker 2: So what are you learning, because this is before the cataclysmic change maybe--
Speaker 1: Yes, so email was probably--it was--it was there.
Speaker 2: It was coming in, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Internet is coming in.
Speaker 1: The Internet--they had something called Switchboard.  There was a few search engines.  I think Yahoo was around, but not everyone had--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yahoo was big.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Knew it was com--right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just starting out.
Speaker 2: Well, now, no, but more than that was AOL.
Speaker 1: AOL, yes--AOL and CompuServe.
Speaker 2: Right.  That's right; that's right.
Speaker 1: AOL and CompuServe were the big ones, so you had to go on through it--Internet provider.  So, you know, before I got to the 'Amsterdam News,' no one was using computers.  That's the one thing I refused to do when I got to the 'Amsterdam News.'  I said I will not work here unless I get a computer, because we all had typewriters.   And I was like, "I do not know how to use a typewriter.  I will not use a typewriter.  I want a computer."  So that was really the start of the change at the 'Amsterdam News' into--to modern ages.
Story_ID: 54942
Speaker 1: So you--I bet this the--for your father [Wilbert Tatum], this is--means a lot to have you there I bet.
Speaker 2: I, I think so.  I hope so.
Speaker 1: So, so who was this--who was on staff there at the time?
Speaker 2: Cathy Connors, Willia Jeer, Mel Tapley, Duke Baldwin, Henrietta Hogan, Hattie Duran, Larry Hicks.  I'm trying to think of other people, other names, but some of these folks had been in journalism and in the newspaper business advertising for, for, for decades.  Some had been at the paper for 40, 50 years.
Speaker 1: So what did they think of this little young one coming on and--
Speaker 2: Little young upstart?
Speaker 1: Yeah, little young upstart.
Speaker 2: Well, Cathy Connors thought that she needed to get me killed, so she tried to send me to places that could have gotten me killed like the Polo Grounds in the middle of the night.  That's the only time I've ever refused to go on an assignment (laughter).  Others just took it in stride.  Others took me under their wings.  Henrietta Hogan, who had been at the paper forever, she raised all of her kids through the 'Amsterdam News.'  Her oldest son was George Jackson, who had been the president of Motown.  He grew up at the 'Amsterdam News.'
Speaker 1: And can you talk about--is this--are you--at that point before you began, do you understand the importance of the paper--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: You do?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, you do?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, you do.
Speaker 2: You know, when I was--when I was about 13, I asked my father why he didn't run for mayor.  And he told me that it was because he had more power where he was.  And that's-- at that point, is when I really understood the true power of the 'Amsterdam News.'
Speaker 1: And so what was an average day?  How--what was the culture of the paper?  Can you describe that and--you know, were there regular meetings or how were assignments done?  You know--
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --he was much revered there.
Speaker 2: Right, well, my father was not involved in the day-to-day putting together the newspaper, except for the notes that he would send upstairs from his office.  So it was really Cathy Connors and Willia Jeer basically deciding what was gonna go in the paper and telling x, y, and z person to write it.  There weren't really staff meetings (laughter).
Story_ID: 54943
Speaker 1: Okay, and this--did you learn at this point in time about the other black newspapers around the country?
Speaker 2: Yes, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so my father [Wilbert Tatum]--I guess it was probably 1994, 1995--would have been 1995--June 1995, right after the Oklahoma City bombing, my father took me to my first National Newspaper Publishers Association meeting, which happened to be in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  And that was my first entree to the black press of America, where I met black publishers from all across the country.
Speaker 1: And what were your feelings about that, or what did you think when--you know, 'cause there's a lot of history in that.  I mean, you, you, you--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I was really young.  I mean, I was--I was 24 years old.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.
Speaker 2: And so I was just listening to what my dad was saying, and following in his footsteps, and just being where he was, and just trying to soak it all in.  And so as the years went on he stopped going to those meetings, and I continued to go and getting to meet the publishers across the country, joining the board, joining the executive board, being a real part of what was going on.
Speaker 1: And can you talk a little bit about the history of that organization, then I wanna go back, but what, what can you share about the history of the NNPA and how it came into being, what its role is, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, it's all founded on the premise of--that the Black Press [Freedom's Journal] was founded on.  And when the first editorial was written in the Black Press [by John Brown Russwurm and Samuel E. Cornish], it said, "We choose"--oh, gosh, I, I know this by heart and it's gone out of my head all of a sudden.  "We choose to plead our own cause, for too long have others spoken for us."  And that is basically the credo of the Black Press, that we need to be our own voice in our communities.  And the NNPA came together to really help to bolster that voice of black newspapers, to come together to be a news service to help to cover the wars and everything else.  Because the Black Press was the only place that black people were getting real news because daily newspapers weren't covering black communities.  You know, nobody died, nobody was born, nobody graduated from college if it didn't happen in a black newspaper.
Speaker 1: And--okay.  So at the time you come in, who is the leadership of, of NNPA?
Speaker 2: Dorothy Leavell [Dorothy R. Leavell] or Bob Bogle [Robert Bogle] or both.  I can't remember exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And these--this is--this is an older group, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and they--
Speaker 2: Not as old as they are now and they're still involved (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, they're in the 80's now, though (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, no, because it has a history--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and these pa--these often were, you know, family businesses and things that got passed down too, so--
Speaker 2: And what was very interesting with the black press, a lot of times it actually ended up being the daughters or the wives that are the second grouping of ownership of the black press.
Speaker 1: So give examples of that.  That's with the 'Amsterdam News'; that's what--
Speaker 2: The, the 'Washington Informer'; the--Dorothy Leavell and the 'Crusader'; Alexis Scott [Alexis Scott Reeves] with the, the 'Atlanta Voice'; Rachel Reeves with the Miami-'Miami Tribune.' [sic, Miami Times]  Let's see who else--Alice Tisdale with the 'Jackson Advocate.'  It was her husband who had--who had started the newspaper.  And the list goes on and on across the country.
Story_ID: 54944
Speaker 1: All right, so my father [Wilbert Tatum] was part of a group of investors that brought the 'Amsterdam News' in 1971.  Over the years, he bought out the other investors until it was only him and one other investor left, a gentleman named John Edmonds [one of the original buyers with Tatum].  And John Edmonds wanted the newspaper.  My father wanted the newspaper, and John Edmonds decided to take my father to court, charge him with embezzlement, and also sorts of other things.  And the judge said, well, yes, there may have been some improprieties, but Wilbert Tatum, you are still able to buy the 'Amsterdam News' outright from John Edmonds.  Here's it he price that I am setting if you so choose.  And so my father bought out John Edmonds and became the sole owner of the 'Amsterdam News' in 1996.
Story_ID: 54945
Speaker 1: So in 1996, this--you know, the--everything is sort of set in motion now.  Is there a discussion with you and your father [Wilbert Tatum]?  I mean, you know, he ha--remember his words were, you know, it's now or--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there, there really wasn't a discussion.  I was going to graduate school at that point [New York University in New York City, New York], and I was learning the business from the ground up.  I was I think Chief Operating Officer at that point at the paper, and I was--I was learning everything, and I was learning it at my father's side, which was one of the greatest gifts I could possibly have gotten.  And then I graduated from NYU.  And the National Association of Black Journalists--actually no, it was the local--it was the NYABJ [New York Association of Black Journalists] was having their annual dinner.  And we had two or three tables at this dinner this year, and I had no idea why.  We had never participated in NYABJ before.  I knew very little about it.  And I'm sitting at the, the table at the dinner.  And Terrie Williams, the PR guru, says, "Ellie, have you read the, the 'Amsterdam News' ad in the journal?"  And I said no.  She's like, "Well, look at it."  So I open up the journal ad, and I said, oh, it's looks nice and close it up again.  She's like, "No, read it."  I open it up again and I read it, and I read the whole thing.  And it's signed by me as publisher and editor-in-chief of the 'Amsterdam News.'  That was the way my father announced to me that I was now heading the organization.  So that's--that was my father's way of telling me, "okay, kid, your turn now."
Speaker 1: Was he there that evening?
Speaker 2: Yep, he was there that evening, and he gave a speech, and it was really--it was an amazing evening.  It really was an amazing evening.  I was completely dumbstruck.  I had absolutely no idea it was gonna happen.
Speaker 1: So wait, he had written the, the--he had written the--he had written and it's signed by you.  Did somehow Terrie knew that you didn't know?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, she was one of our guests at the table.
Speaker 1: Wow.  So what did that mean then, him handing over the reins?  What did that mean at that point 'cause you're just finish--you just finished.  And, and--
Speaker 2: Right, but I'd all--already been at the paper for, you know--well, actually no, I had not been--
Speaker 1: No, you, you--
Speaker 2: --had not--had not--
Speaker 1: --hadn't been there--
Speaker 2: --for very long.
Speaker 1: You'd been there--you'd been there for two years.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I'd been there for--it was 1998.  I'd been there for four years already.
Speaker 1: Oh, 1998, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you had already finished NYU--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --at that point, okay.
Speaker 2: It was after--it was right after I finished NYU--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that was done.
Story_ID: 54946
Speaker 1: So, so when you fin--I wanna ask one thing about the program at NYU [New York University in New York City, New York] and whether you felt that program helped you--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and why?
Speaker 2: It gave me some of the mechanics that I didn't have.  And the other thing that it did was to show the community that I just didn't get this because I was Bill Tatum's [Wilbert Tatum] daughter, that I actually had the degree behind me, the Master's in it.  So it was proving to myself that I could do it, proving to the community that it just wasn't something that was handed to me, and again, the mechanics and the history that I got from doing a Master's program.
Speaker 1: And at that point I time, journalism schools are still teaching in a traditional way.  The newspapers are looking at the Internet and trying to see how it can be maybe a marketing tool, but they're giving away their content.
Speaker 2: Oh, but the content wasn't even on the web yet.
Speaker 1: Right, it wasn't on but later they would go to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --give their content away, you know, not real--just wanting sort of to be part of it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and not understanding that they would be, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: How to monetize it.
Speaker 1: Monetize it, and not understanding that they would be victimized--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and almost destroyed in the process.
Story_ID: 54947
Speaker 1: So you then--your father [Wilbert Tatum] makes the announcement in this way.  So what--how does the role [Editor-in-Chief] change internally at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, within not too long from there is that my dad becomes a quadriplegic.  I think it was within six months.
Speaker 1: And--I mean, when you think about that, it was almost he had--like he had an eye--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for what was gonna happen to him.
Speaker 2: But then I got another 10 years being able to sit by his side.
Speaker 1: And so what did he teach you in those 10 years, because let's think about the 10 years--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean--
Speaker 1: --and those--look, those are amaze--I mean, we're talking about Clinton [President Bill Clinton] to Bush [President George W. Bush] --I think Clinton to Bush to Barack [President Barack Obama] almost.
Speaker 2: Well, Bush [President George H.W. Bush] to Clinton to Bush.
Speaker 1: Bush--oh, Bush to Clinton to Bush is right.  So alright, Bush to Clint--so he had a lot to, to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He taught me how to stand up for what was right.  He taught me how to navigate New York City politics, and introduced me to the people that I needed to know, and showed me how to open the doors to those that I didn't know, and how to connect people, 'cause my dad was a great connector.  That's one of the things that I loved most about what I do, is being able to connect people.  And you know, one of the things that I find so important that my father found so important was to help people out, in terms of their careers, in terms of their trajectories, and that helping somebody else takes nothing away from you and just can add to whatever you do.  And you know, and where I see that is like the other day, I was at breakfast with a young woman, a political operative, and she's in her late 20's, early 30's.  And I sat down with her for breakfast.  She called me and asked me, and so I say down.  At the end, she said "thank you so much."  I said "For what?  I just sat down for breakfast with you."  She said, "Most people wouldn't do this."  I said, "What are you talking about?  That idea of somebody not doing that is so far from my head.  It takes nothing from me to give you advice, to give you help, to brainstorm with you.  It takes nothing away from me, and maybe it'll help you to get to the next level.  Why wouldn't I do that?"  And she made me understand that not everybody does that, and that makes me so sad and so angry because we should all be helping one another.  I mean, this whole crabs in a barrel syndrome that tends to run in our community is what is keeping us from being around the tables of all the (unclear) in this country.  'Cause we have to realize that if we don't bring each other along with us, we're gonna be the only ones at that table.  And then when they wanna get rid of us, there's gonna be no one else to fight for us.  And that's why my father taught me.
Speaker 1: So he gave you the heart of sort of civil action--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in, in a way, you know--I mean, not in a way, but he, he did that.  I wanna ask--so taking over is different than, you know, working for--so what shape are you finding the paper in?  And what ideas are you wanting to implement?  And how difficult or not difficult was it, you know?  And who is--is the staff that when you--'cause you were talking--let's see.  I'm trying to still get the time period.  You come in 1994.
Speaker 2: My father gets full ownership in 1996.
Speaker 1: Six and then ninet--
Speaker 2: I become publisher in 1998.
Speaker 1: Ninety-eight [1998].
Speaker 2: My father becomes--well, he has his accident '98' [1998], '99'-ish [1999]--actually, maybe a little bit earlier, but he didn't have the surgery yet; then he has the surgery, becomes a quadriplegic, and then he dies in 19--no, sorry--in 2000 and--
Speaker 1: Six--
Speaker 2: --nine [2009].
Speaker 1: Nine, okay.
Speaker 2: Two thousand and nine [2009].
Story_ID: 54948
Speaker 1: So what, what are the things that you have had to do in that time period?  Because we're talking 1994, but let's say 1998 to 2000--you know, to 2000.
Speaker 2: Well, we had, I mean, a huge boon in black press in the early part of the 2000's.  It was some of the strongest advertising we had had in years.  And then when the recession--
Speaker 1: Now can you explain--expl--just--I'm sorry, I'm surprised by that statement.  Explain why.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I can't tell you.  The--it--the only thing that I can figure is that they realized that black folks had money, and that if they wanted to reach 'em, they needed to reach them, and they needed to actually advertise in the black press.  And so we were doing pretty well.  I mean, we were well into the black.  We were actually making profits.  Well, then the recession hit, and where the last place they put in ads is the first place they take them out, and that was the black press.  So, you know, over the last few years, we've gone through all our reserves, and it's a struggle.  We've had to make layoffs.  You also have to realize we're one of the few black newspapers that's actually unionized.  Our entire newspaper is unionized, so that throws another layer of issues that, that happen on the day-to-day operations of the newspaper.  And then we also have an--at least then had a much older staff.  Because once people started working at the 'Amsterdam News,' they never left.  They never left.
Story_ID: 54949
Speaker 1: So how were you at--how were you able to navigate?  I mean, I look at--let's say someone like Linda Johnson Rice, you know, who took over, you know, Johnson Publishing [Johnson Publishing Company, publisher of 'Ebony' and 'Jet'].  And she would pret--you know, she had an older staff, but the transition was pretty rocky.  How was your transition?
Speaker 2: There--it was actually interesting because every time I--I didn't go on vacation often when my father was still alive, but every time I went on vacation someone else got fired.  And so my father took care of a few of those folks for me that were the most difficult to deal with, others died, and others retired, and some are still around.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So it's been mostly attrition.
Speaker 1: So that's, that's an easier transition in some respects.
Speaker 2: Yes, it wasn't as rocky.  I mean, there were definitely people that resented me for what I was doing and the fact that I was just there, but that was even before my father died.
Speaker 1: That's right; that's right.  You're gonna have some of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then there's the old way, the traditional way, and then there's the young--maybe what they would call uninformed way or the--
Speaker 2: Or the up--or the upstart way.
Story_ID: 54950
Speaker 1: So what things have you put in place that you've been sort of proud of?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, 13 years ago we [the 'Amsterdam News'] got our first website, so we've actually been online for a good amount of time.  Under the last editor before me, not including my father that is, you know, the 'Amsterdam News' was not as newsy as it is become over the last 10 years.  And it was really more dedicated to social things, and now we're really facing and tackling the issues of the day that are really affecting our community.  You know, I've got a really talented young writing staff and editing staff that are--that are fantastic.  You know, a lot of them came out of our intern pool.  And we've got a different perspective than the old guard did, while we still have some of our freelancers that are still from that time who were brilliant writers like Herb Boyd, who was just phenomenal, and I'm so happy to have him as part of our team.  So we've got some real wonderful, wonderful talent.  And if you look at the roster of people that we've had walking through those doors, you know, some of them have become great book authors and TV personalities and whatnot, but a lot of them have their start at the 'Amsterdam News.'
Story_ID: 54951
Speaker 1: You know, I also have been struck.  We're staying at the Aloft, and I've been struck--
Speaker 2: Up, up in Harlem [New York City, New York]?
Speaker 1: And I've been struck by what they--what people are calling "New Harlem," and so I wanted to--and I'm struck because, you know, Harlem in the early 1900's was really intended to be a white community.  And there's, you know, a lot of change.  How do you feel, because the 'Amsterdam News' is in the--in the midst of all of that?  And so what is perspective on that, because Harlem will look and be different--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the Harlem that your, your father [Wilbert Tatum]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --represented and Percy Sutton and all of them.  They--I don't even know if they could have envisioned the Harlem that we will see.
Speaker 2: You know, it makes it difficult for a black newspaper that's based in Harlem because the landscape is changing so much.  And you know, while we are looked at as a community newspaper, we're looked at--we're a black newspaper so we represent the black community of New York, so that's not just Harlem.  It's--you know, it's Brooklyn, it's Queens, it's parts of Staten Island, it's parts of the Bronx.  But having Harlem almost systematically almost taken away from the black community is something very hard to watch.  And we have to watch the infighting that's going on between groups that are black within the area, plus the outside forces that are displacing so many tenants.  And some of the changes, change--some change is good, but there is so much uninformed change that is going on that that really affects our communities negatively.
Speaker 1: So what--can you be a little more specific?
Speaker 2: Okay, what I mean by uninformed change is, for instance, those folks that own those beautiful brownstones that sold them for pennies that now really have no place to live in New York City because they just can't afford the real estate; for those people that were said we'll give you $20,000 to move out of your rent stabilized apartment, and now somebody is taking those apartments and charging, you know, $3,000 a month--$4,000 a month for.  That $20,000 isn't gonna last them very long at all, and they're not gonna be able to stay in the communities that they grew up in.  That's what I mean by uninformed change.  They think that they're getting a good deal when they're actually getting raped.
Story_ID: 54952
Speaker 1: So what are your plans for navigating the future, the strategy for it?  Because I think all--you know, there--at a time when there's--I mean, first of all, you are multicultural just by your being, and--but how do you think, because this is an issue that lots of people are trying to--you know, struggle with as they sort of--you know, times are changing, they're shifting.  We're not really in a post-racial society.
Speaker 2: No, I don't even know what that word means.  As long people of color are not dictating what is on the front pages of major newspapers, magazines, the Internet, and at the head of television news, there will be a need for the black press, because no one else is speaking for us or about us in ways which our community needs to be respected.  So the black press is necessary.  What form that exists in is anybody's guess.  We've gotta have a better presence on the web, and that's something we're working towards diligently every single day.  We've got to figure out how to monetize the web, because less and less people are picking up newspapers.  We at the 'Amsterdam News' are very lucky because we're in a commuter city, so I think the actual printed work will last a lot longer on the--on an actual piece of newspaper print.  But it's changing, and it's changing rapidly.  And if we don't keep up, we will fall behind.
Story_ID: 54953
Speaker 1: So what is your--so, Elinor, let me ask you how you have actualized your role, because--have you actualized your role the way your father [Wilbert Tatum] actualized his role, or are you looking at actualizing your role in a different way?  Your--
Speaker 2: I, I, I think I follow very closely in my father's footsteps but, you know, I had to push him to do computers, to do the web.  So in that sense I'm going out on my own direction, but I'm still using the tools that he taught me: connections, people, the, the necessity and the need to work with others, and finding out how you can help each other to get to a better place.  And, and that's what I'm really banking on, is those relationships, and trying to find mutually beneficial ways to partner with other organizations that are gonna bring us all forward and let us survive in a very troubled economic time.
Speaker 1: So you--your father did that, though.  He was very active politically, you know, and it was politics that really led into publishing.  You know, it was activism--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that led into politics, politics that led into publishing where he was--essentially what he told you was "I'm a kingmaker, you know, so I don't wanna be the king, but I'll make the king."  So how are you--that's what I'm trying to understand.
Speaker 2: Okay, well--I mean, we still--in the 'Amsterdam News,' I mean, we still play a very vital role in what's going on in New York City politics--New York State politics.  For instance, when Governor Cuomo [Andrew Cuomo] was running for, for governor, I wrote an editorial about where's Governor Cuomo, because he hadn't spoken to the communities of color.  He hadn't spoken to anyone.  That editorial was picked up by over 150 outlets across the country and across New York State, talking about this little black newspaper and what they were saying about the governor.  You know, I sat on the governor's transition team.  I am on one of his task, taskforces, so I, I stay involved.  But he still knows that I'm gonna write about him no matter what he does, good and bad.  You know, we're at the forefront of the Barneys issue [Barneys New York's racial profiling], what's going on here in New York, and what's happening with, with Barneys and Macy's.  You know, we worked with Macy's years ago when they had their first incidences of real blatant racism and issues in the store.  And Macy's has become a partner to the black community like no other retailer ever has.  And as the years have gone by, those ties have gotten stronger and stronger and stronger.  And even when the recession hit, Macy's was still a very strong part of the community when so many people abandoned us.  We still do our endorsements every year for, for all facets of government.  I mean, in a chair right behind you [President] Barack Obama has sat, [Secretary of State] Hillary Clinton has sat.  So we still are doing those kinds of things.  I sit on many boards--not-for-profit boards here in the city and, and across the country.  I'm involved in women's organizations, so I'm out there.  You know, I do a desk segment on Reverend Al Sharpton's daily radio show, 'Keepin' it Real' every week.  I do two hours on Thursdays, which is a black press roundtable--been doing that for over six years now.  I appear on WNBC on the Cozi Network [Cozi TV] on New York One, talking about the issues as a go-to for what's happening in black New York.  So we were out there.  We have a voice; we are a voice.  Do we need to do more?  Absolutely.  Are we gonna do more?  Absolutely.
Story_ID: 54954
Speaker 1: We have to become multimedia.
Speaker 2: And, and what does that mean, becoming multimedia to you?
Speaker 1: Well, besides the web, you know, we're [the black press] gonna have to be doing more video online, more audio online, really trying to combine everything together, to, to make a holistic 360 approach to covering the news.
Speaker 2: And when you look at others in the--the black me--media that have integrated that, and I wanna say--well, The Grio--I mean were video, but the TheRoot.com just, you know, init--initiated video I saw on their site.  What, what are you--I'm tryin' to thing.  Where, what is your--what are you thinking you want to do, and how do you wanna do it?   And is the 'Amsterdam News' still New York [New York City, New York] focused, you know, in its regional base?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, we are still New York focused because this is where we are, and it's the community that it would cover.  But we do have, you know, news from all over the country, all over the world.  You know, I got an email from a young woman out in--out in the Midwest, and she wants to be doing stories for us.  And the story that she just sent us was about the first Somali elected to city government in the city that she's in.  And you know, that's really interesting to see where immigrants, especially immigrants of color, are showing up and where there laying their roots and what they are doing to add to the fabric of our communities.
Speaker 2: Now I think that there's a lot--I think it's really a sort of a key time and it's an equalizer.  It's just what you're talking about is the ad support.
Speaker 1: Yep.  And so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --we have to figure out how to monetize it, and we are working on that very, very diligently.  Because without that there's no way we can survive.
Speaker 2: That's right.  But do--how do you feel about your future, though, as, as a newspaper--as you sit here?
Speaker 1: I'm still optimistic.  I--as I said earlier, who knows what form it will exist, but I'm convinced that the 'Amsterdam News' will exist.
Story_ID: 54955
Speaker 1: And I--you know, you're a new mother, and your daughter is absolutely beautiful.  Can you talk about what being a parent has meant and you know, you're, you're--you know, you're working and you also are, you know, being a great mother it appears.  And so I want you to talk about your daughter and what she means to you.  And I also--you know, I just was thinking also your mother [Susan Tatum] --because the 'Village Voice' was in publishing too, you know, in a different--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But the--you know, you were all--okay--
Speaker 2: Well, I'll start with my mom and the 'Village Voice.'  I mean, she was an integral part of the 'Village Voice' for over a decade, you know, being the head of distribution for it and having a company that made sure that the newspaper got to the newsstand.  So she's actually been a great resource for me when it comes to talking about distribution.  So that's been really, really wonderful.  And she's also--you know, my mother, and I, and wa--my daughter, Willa, live in the same house.  And there's no way I'd be able to do what I do without having her around.  I mean, she'll be 80 years old next--in January.  You would never know it from meeting her.  She's one of the most vibrant people that I know, and she has been such a wonderful support to me, and my daughter is just crazy about her.  But, you know, you make sacrifices, and you make compromises, and you do what you need to do to be the best parent you possibly can be.  Sometimes it means leaving work early so I can get to the end of her ballet class, and I can watch her doing her pirouettes or her tendus or--you know, one of the greatest pleasures I had when she was really little was every Monday morning, from six months until she started preschool, I went swimming with her and took her to swimming class every Monday morning from nine to nine thirty.  And that was just this wonderful time that I had with her, every week, come rain or shine, or snow, or sleet, or hail.  And I got to watch her grow up and progress and learn and-- something just so incredibly special.  And you just take all those moments that you can, and do as much as you can with them, and enjoy and just watch her looking at her new kitten, or taking her to the zoo and seeing her see a lion for the first time, and seeing places for the first time through her eyes.  You may have been to the same place a dozen times, but when you see it through the eyes of a child, it's a completely different experience.
Story_ID: 54956
Speaker 1: So I wanna ask you, so I wanna move to philosophical questions, and I--that's how we sort of end our interviews and I--you know, you're on the very young side of, you know, people we've interviewed, because the average age where--I mean, we're coming down, but the average age has been, you know, 60--really late 60's and above.  In fact, our oldest just died this year.  She was 114.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous).  So I wanna ask you about your thoughts about the black community and, and I wanna start with hopes and concerns, and then I, I have a series of questions I wanna ask.  But what are your hopes and your concerns?  Now your generation--is there a title for your generation, you know, how the--
Speaker 2: I'm Generation X.
Speaker 1: You're Generation X.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.  I think I'm Generation X.  Yeah, I'm generation X--the Gen Xers.  My hope for my community right now is that we will learn how to cooperate more so that we can actually make change.  Because if we're at odds, there's no way that we can be a cohesive group that can make the change that is needed to make our communities and our country stronger.
Speaker 1: So the inverse--is that your concern?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what would be--what--when you think of the black community, how do you define it now?  I mean, there is--you know, you can't--you--how do you define it?  And what do you think--where do you see positive action of that community?  And, and--
Speaker 2: Well, okay so there's the black community.  There's the African-American community.
Speaker 1: Now that is very interesting.  So let's, let's--
Speaker 2: So the African-American community are the--
Speaker 1: Wait, there's the black community, and there's the African-American community.
Speaker 2: Right, so the black--
Speaker 1: We're splitting--
Speaker 2: --community--
Speaker 1: --we're splitting hairs.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we--but we have to.  So the black community is everyone that's black in America.  So that doesn't matter if they are African immigrants, if they are from the Caribbean.  If they're from England and now live here, then you've got the African-American community, and the African Americans are those whose lineage goes back to slavery.  And with those two communities, there is a different set of issues and a different set of baggage that, that comes along with those things.  Because when you have your history embroiled in slavery, you come from a different perspective than when you come from Africa as a free person and of your own will coming over to this country.  So there are these strains within the black community between all of these desperate [sic, disparate] groups of what black America actually is.  And unless we can come together, we are not gonna be able to use our collective to make positive change.
Story_ID: 54957
Speaker 1: Okay, but what if you could have your perfect solution--if you could make things happen because--what would you--what would you--what would you change?  And then my--what would you change if you could--
Speaker 2: Change the world?
Speaker 1: Change--well, no.  I'm talking about the black experience.
Speaker 2: The black experience.  I would wanna make sure there was parity so that every college and university had at least the percentage of African Americans as African Americans were in the population, that every boardroom had at least the population of African Americans in the boardroom that was part of the population, that we were fairly represented in every sector of American life so that we really could have a way to effect change and not having to be the only one at a table.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what do you think your generation's responsibility is to make that happen--or the potential responsibility and/or the potential?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a responsibility that I think a lot of--a lot of people have shirked that responsibility because they're really out for self, but that's in every community; it's not just the black community.  But if I were to give a responsibility, it would be to make sure to bring people along with them and not to just jump to the head of the class and leave everyone else behind, and understanding that there's room for more than just one at the top.
Story_ID: 54958
Speaker 1: When you look at the work of your father's generation, what do you say the significance of that was?
Speaker 2: I have a very, to me, sad story about that actually.  So when I first started working for the 'Amsterdam News,' I covered City College [the City College of New York].  And I was 23, 24, 25, and I was covering all the protests that the students were having.  And I was watching them trying to reinvent the wheel when it came to protesting and learning how to be activists.  And one day I asked my father [Wilbert Tatum].  I said, "Dad, why didn't you teach us how to fight?"  And he said, "Because we thought we had already done it for you."  And so my father's generation fought so hard, and they gave us so much, but what they didn't do was teach us what was next, and how that if we weren't vigilant and diligent, that we could lose everything.  And that's what we see going on right now.  Our rights are being stripped away from us piece by piece by piece and sometimes in these huge chunks.  And so I think in some ways they hurt us by almost making it too easy.  But the one thing that I'm seeing now is organizations like the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the National Urban League, the National Action Network are stepping up once again, or being created like in the National Action Network's example, and really becoming relevant because they have to be; because if they don't stand up and bring us all along with them to stand up, we will all fall down.
Story_ID: 54959
Speaker 1: I have three more questions.  That was very nice. I have--I have three more questions.  One: what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I want my legacy to be one that my daughter can be proud of, one that says that I left this world a better place than I came, and where people will say, "I remember Elinor; she helped me; she gave me an opportunity."
Story_ID: 54960
Speaker 1: And when you think of Elinor as a--you know, a little girl who maybe navigated the streets in front of her house, loved to ride horses, loved to be in plays, and you see the Elinor of now, what, what do you think?
Speaker 2: I think that she did exactly what she was supposed to do, and that she still rides horses, and that she still sings, and she is not very far from that little girl that she was, walking on 3rd Street [New York City, New York] 40 years ago.
Story_ID: 54961
Speaker 1: And then the last question--I'm interviewing you 'cause I haven't seen you in I think maybe six years.  It's been awhile, and I'm trying to remember.  But, you know, we didn't have a black president, and what do you think the legacy of, of the Obama Presidency [President Barack Obama] will be?
Speaker 2: What do I think it should be or what do I think it will be?
Speaker 1: Both.
Speaker 2: What do I think it should be is I think the legacy of the black president--and partially what it will be--is for every little boy and girl of color in this country and around the world knowing that they can actually be anything that they want to be, you know.  My daughter will never know a time when we did not have a black president.  That is his legacy.  Now what the right wing and the Tea Party are gonna make his legacy is government shutdowns, and Obamacare [the Affordable Care Act], and all the negative things.  But for me his legacy will be the actual possibility, that anybody can achieve anything in this country we call America.
Story_ID: 54962
Speaker 1: This is my daughter, Willa, in the summer of 2013, up near our country house in Delaware County, New York, after she had been running through a field of daisies, and came up to me with this wonderful bunch of daisies.
Speaker 2: Her name?  How did her name come to be?
Speaker 1: Willa's name came to be because my father was Wilbert [Wilbert Tatum], and I wanted to name her after my dad.
Speaker 2: This is me at age three.
Speaker 1: So that would have been 1974.
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974]--about, about three I would say.  I mean, if you look at those two pictures, there's no way to tell that they're not the same person.  Did, did you notice that?
Speaker 1: All right, this is me, Ellie Tatum, at age three or four, so 1974, 1975.
Speaker 2: This is me and a friend that I was on the Youth Advisory Board for David Dinkins with when he was borough president [of Manhattan, New York City, New York] with Michael Jackson at an event near Lincoln Center that Michael Milken had put on for young people in New York.  I don't remember her name, but that would have been--I would have been around 16 years old at the time, so we're talking 1987.
Speaker 1: That is a family portrait that was taken for the 'New York Daily News' by David Handschuh probably in 2006.
Speaker 2: That is me at the Million Man March [in Washington D.C.]
Speaker 1: In what year?

I got to D.C. at about 4:30 in the morning, and it was pitch black out.  And there were already thousands and thousands and thousands of people gathered.  And I didn't know where the area to walk in to the press area was, so I just started making my way through the crowd--the sea of black men.  It's pitch black out.  I am by myself, and I have to kind of push my way through.  And someone says: "Excuse me. What are you doing?"  I was like, "I'm trying to get up to the press area."  Well, who are you with?  I said I'm with the 'Amsterdam News.'  And he started a chant that said "let the black press through; let the black press through."  And the sea of people just opened up.  And there was always a hand out if I stumbled, and help to get over a wall.  And it was one of the most beautiful experiences I've ever had being a journalist.

And he had gotten that hat and just always loved it.
