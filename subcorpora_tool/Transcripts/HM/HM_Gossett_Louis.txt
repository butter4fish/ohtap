Speaker 1: Well before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions we always ask and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay. They're lightweight questions, a warm-up sort of.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 1: My favorite food, boy I've been around this world and my favorite food probably would be conch fritters.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Conch, c-o-n-c-h fritters.
Speaker 2: Like the conch shell in--?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  Soft shell crab is real close though.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 1: My favorite color is earth tones and the, the browns.  My favorite color is brown and black.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year is around my birthday time, around this time around May.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 1: My favorite vacation destination was anywhere where I can do some scuba diving around water, around the Caribbean, Africa, South America, around water.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: Favorite phrase or saying for my entire life is that there is no such thing as being--"there's no such thing as impossible".
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 111337
Speaker 1: All right.  Well I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  I'll start with your mother's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full maiden name was Hellen with two Ls, H-E-L-L-E-N Rebecca, R-E-B-E-C-C-A Wray, W-R-A-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, W-R-A-Y, okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't remember that.  It would have to be somewhere in the 20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was born in Watkinsville, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: The ancestors on my mother's side of the family, it's a combination, two-thirds American Indian and one-third African American, southern Georgia around Athens, Watkinsville.  The history of my great-grandmother on my mother's side, she--the bible, it was started after [Abraham] Lincoln freed the slaves.  And in the bible was recorded births and deaths, weddings and my great-grandmother's name was not recorded in the bible.  And so she lived a long time because she helped raise myself and some fifteen or twenty cousins.  So according to some crude arithmetic, she must have died at approximately 115 years old.  Her husband was Uncle Ruben.  He was a Cherokee with a red feather in his camp and he moved up north after the young people moved up north and he became a beach comber and he walked maybe ten, twenty miles a day.  He was a Cherokee. The other part of the heritage on my mother's side through marriage, and through convenience and desperation, was across the border to the south, were the Seminoles.  So obviously the Seminoles and the Cherokees and the Africans intermixed.  So I have a family portrait that you'll probably see later on of a rainbow of people on that side of the family.  The American Indian--I remember my grandmother, my mother's mother, combing her hair and her hair went down below the back of her knee.  That was not African American that had to be American Indian.  She was a very light, a kind of an earth yellow tone, if you put yellow and brown together.  And the hair was semi-kinky but very, very long and thick, and she had that hair and I don't know where it went to but when she was finished it was all in a knot up on top of her head.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember that distinctly.  It was something else to watch her take every morning, comb that hair and the hair would touch the ground.  So that was even--it had to be the Cherokee/Seminole.  And now if you put the, connect the dots and you know about the history, then you'll understand why that happened. They received the runaway slaves and they went into the Everglades where nobody could catch them and they--they intermixed and now you know why the phrase is that Stonewall Jackson had.  But Jackson, General [Andrew] Jackson came to Florida, stopped at the edge of the Seminoles giving up the war against the Seminoles, and that's where Jacksonville, Florida is.  That's as far as he went.
Story_ID: 111338
Speaker 1: Now there's a, there's quite a bit of information about that now and some that a lot of people didn't talk about for years about the relationship-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --between blacks and the Seminoles and the Creeks and the-
Speaker 2: Well I think that history is done, is given to us over the years for a purpose, you know.  I came to the mindset even in movies, you can see--we know, all of us can sit down and at length for hours talk about King Arthur, the Romans, the Vikings, Napoleon, the Greek civilizations, because of the movies.  But there are other civilizations that have never been done on the screen in top form, possibly for a reason back in the old days so that we're not informed about our history and our roots so that the--a certain consciousness must reign.  That was then but today it's different, you know?  So now there's a gap that has to be filled in our schools, in our films, in our libraries to replace that misinformation so that we can walk a better path in our lives.
Story_ID: 111339
Speaker 1: Are there any stories passed down from that side of the family about life in Watkinsville, Georgia or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were many stories passed down.  Let me see where I should start?  My grandmother's sister married a man by the name of Guvnor Stevens, obviously mixed with African American, Caucasian and [American] Indian.
Speaker 1: And his name is Guvnor?
Speaker 2: Guvnor, but it was spelled G-U-V-N-O-R--well I guess maybe 'cause nobody knew how to spell in those days, but his name was Guvnor Stevens.  And so according to that between his family and my family, between the forty acres and a mule, Guvnor Stevens was a man of the earth and this is Watkinsville, Georgia, right outside of Watkinsville, Georgia, a very small town called Bogart.  Named after Humphrey Bogart at the time but it was only a block long and it was all farmland.  The brown earth turned to be very fertile for watermelon. So when I first met him, me and all my cousins were shipped to the south starting in the early '40s [1940s] and went on through the early '50s [1950s] so that our parents could get a break for the summer.  And he had, almost four-hundred acres of watermelon land.  It was the yellow watermelon and the three different kinds of watermelon that was on the planet.  Where he got this expertise I don't know but he was the number-one watermelon man of southern Georgia to such an extent that we knew that the watermelon was going up on the train, the eastern seaboard train, and go up to the major cities, all the way up to Boston.  So what we'd do is we'd take little thumbprints and we'd have a little thumbprint on the end of the watermelon to see if we'd ever see the watermelon later on.  And sure enough, my cousin's thumb print was in a watermelon that I ate at Sardi's during opening night of a Broadway show.  He was the number-one watermelon shipper.  He never got that kind of money but he got the fame.
Speaker 1: Now Sardi's is an-
Speaker 2: Sardi's-
Speaker 1: --Upper East Side--it's the big deal in New York. That's the-
Speaker 2: --opening night.  That thumbprint, I swear--it was a yellow meat watermelon, and my cousin--only his thumbprint could look like that.  And when I thought--Cousin Johnny.   But my thumb print was different, I'd take this way and this way, it was a curve this way and curve this way with a space in the middle was my thumb print.
Speaker 1: Have you ever heard the expression about a watermelon, it being called a letter from home?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: It makes me think about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the relationship of the African American and the watermelon is a legacy.  Even that we were kind of-- because of the depiction of the African American on film, we became ashamed of watermelon.  But my father [Louis Gamal Gossett] said, "I don't care, I love it", and me too!  And my--I love, it was such--it's one of the greatest fruits on the planet.  Of course the watermelon came from Africa.
Story_ID: 111340
Speaker 1: Any other stories on that side?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, there's many stories.  My great-grandmother, according to that bible, she was not recorded in the bible, she lost her finger so she had her finger up to here and she would point that finger, and she didn't go to school but she knew about syllables because you had to go downstairs if you did wrong and make a switch.  But you had to plait it and all of a sudden she would know all about syllables, how-man-y-times and she picked those words with a lot of syllables to get the point across.  And you never did that again.  So since her birth was not recorded-
Speaker 1: This is something that's so common.  I mean it's just--you talking about culture, transition, that is so, it's so common to hear that same story in my family.  Same-
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.  It came from the dark continent [sic, Africa] and it was, it was the one village raising everybody raising the child.  It's what was in place to keep us to behave in the rights of passage were proper, which was interrupted.  So those lessons, she's my-- if there is such a thing as a guiding spirit, the lessons from here are indelible.  So even though I might do wrong in my life, I didn't do but so-wrong because that switch lesson was there.  So there was a limit.  Now there's no limit in our children because of the absence of that teaching.  So the only thing I remember was, a very funny one, is she was the first--she was the mother of the First Baptist Church of Sheepshead Bay [New York].  She was the mother and-- First Baptist Church of-
Speaker 1: First Baptist Church of Sheepshead Bay-
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --on East 15th Street between Nick Road and Sheepshead Bay Road.  And we lived next door to that church.  And she used to have these coffee sessions with her two girlfriends, her friends, two deaconesses from the First Baptist Church.  And at one time they were, maybe about eighty years old at this time.  They'd keep each other alive by telling stories.  And I overheard--I tell this in my speaking tour--and one lady said, "You know, I think I'm getting a little senile and forgetful.  I stood in the front of the doorway of"--at the time it was the icebox--"my icebox for about ten minutes trying to remember what I wanted to get out of there, could not remember."  The second one says, "I know what you're talking about 'cause I stood in the doorway of the closet for about ten, fifteen minutes trying to remember what I wanted out of the closet."  My great-grandmother had such pride, she said, "You should be ashamed of yourselves, talking about how old and senile and forgetful you're getting.  I'm at least ten years older than both of us, and thank god--(knocking)--who is it?"  (Laughter) She would never admit, but she--she could not remember sometimes, 'cause there was sometimes fifteen, twenty of me and my cousins around, our name but she knew who we were and she knew that, who needed to get the spanking and who needed to get the hug, and that was indelible.  And when the youngest cousin, Cousin Dari [ph.], got married and moved to Long Island [New York], that was the youngest, she [great-grandmother] took a deep breath, caught a little cold and went in the bed and didn't wake up. I think it was instilled which is the good part of this story, and if we can remember some of us had the same kind of thought, somewhere the installation of the stuff that remained when we did the passage from Africa to America, the things that remained, was our relationship with the earth, our relationship one generation to another, which was deeply instilled, and the connection of the entire family, which is a tribal thing, is still remains today that we have to maybe stop for a minute and pause and reexamine.  This is, this thing that we're doing here is more important than maybe we realize, the reinstallation of our connection of our heritage from back in the dark continent, slavery notwithstanding.
Story_ID: 111341
Speaker 1: Tell me this.  Now, I've done over 500 of these interviews now, but there's almost--there's hardly any person I interviewed that talks about an African heritage when I ask about ancestors.  They hardly ever do it and I guess they, I don't know they take it for granted and we already know that or-
Speaker 2: Well-
Speaker 1: --but they never say anything about it.
Speaker 2: --if you look at history, and it's not singularly African, it is--the history was in Europe alone, when the Greeks took over, they wanted to have the Greek culture be predominant.  So they made sure that the English and French culture was interrupted.  That's the system and history, that's the way the mindset is.  So when those same people went to Africa they saw a culture that was evolved.  They went to Asia, they saw a culture that was evolved.  The concept is to interrupt the information about who you are in order to control.  That's natural.
Speaker 1: Now what I was going to ask you-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was, do--is there a tradition in your family about being from Africa?  Do they talk about that?  Do--was that something that was discussed?
Speaker 2: No.  It was not discussed.  This is my-
Speaker 1: This is something you had to pick up later?
Speaker 2: I've connected the dots because I was fortunate enough at a young age to go around the world to know about history, doing history about the characters that I got fortunate enough to play, Jamaicans, Africans--I know about their history.  I began to connect the dots and there's no resentment and anger about it, it's just information.  And you learn history which is my pet subject because of the stories that I like to tell, you begin to get assumptions or connect the dots about how this happened, how this planet got to be, how people got to be and civilizations got to be the way they are so that's the way it was.  And my concern today is the absence of that history causes a domino principle in our young people--they don't know where they come from, it's not on the screen, it's not in the books, it's not in the libraries or in the schools or no longer in the house.  So they don't think they belong, properly.  They step away from the respect of education and film and create their own society which they are now successful.  But they're young and they make immature decisions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the information must be put back into place just like the Jewish community has their synagogues and their yeshivas, the Catholics have their schools, we have to put back into place that reconnection of who they are so that when they know about that, the last thing they have on their mind is to shoot one another.
Speaker 1: I don't want to get too far away from chronology -
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that's what happening now.
Speaker 1: --at this point in the interview, but do you have any ideas as to what venue? 'Cause you mentioned the synagogue doing that for-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, those of us who have been around the Jewish community know they send their kids to-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for cultural education.
Speaker 2: And so those kids come out (whistles) upwardly mobile.
Speaker 1: Right, well they get a cultural education-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --focus on who they are when they go to school,--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: -- being a minority and it helps them.  But what venue do you see in the black community that could-
Speaker 2: Well-
Speaker 1: --transmit that cultural knowledge?
Speaker 2: I have a foundation which is being born with [HM] Father [George] Clements, etc. and it's, that's why I spoke this way, it's a foundation to replace that information and a thing called--we've copyrighted a thing called a Shamba Center.  Shamba is Swahili, S-H-A-M-B-A, it's Swahili for farm.  It's just a name, it's a Shamba Center.  And the Secretary, Alexander of HUD, has heard about it--he didn't know the name Shamba but he knows about what I've just said, he says, "My god, you could do that across the country." But I'm an actor so I'm doing a little bit at a time with putting together--and some of these centers already exist in some of the major cities, they're called Boys' Club, Boys and Girls Club or they're called the such-and-such club or the--they have to have the responsibility of putting those films, those lectures, those rites of passage, the respect from boys to girls, girls to boys, the prevention of AIDS, the hygiene, the history.  So the stuff that was taken away from them it's put back about their history--once, by example, they know that, then there's a pride instilled in these young people that was consciously taken away.  That was then, this is now.  That's no longer necessary to control the information given to our children, but the practice still exists and it has to be dissolved.  That's why 'Eracism' is so important.  And it's not just a black and white, it's religions, it's power mongers, there's got to be lines of demarcation for control.  All those lines have to be lifted for the salvation of the planet and the salvation of mankind.  Otherwise we're going to perish, obviously.  So maybe that was good then, today we don't need it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're working on, you all are working on creating a venue to transmit this-
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's called Shamba Centers.
Speaker 1: --cultural--Shamba Centers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now let--I'm going to get back to the chronology.  We'll talk about that towards the end again, but-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 111342
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Hellen Rebecca Wray] talk about growing up--what was it like growing up for her?
Speaker 2: I have scrapbooks to show as we--I'll show you in the future.  It was good and bad, but I think it was all good.  It was tough and it was--but what they had in the South was enough to eat, kind of rickety schools but they went.  They had a family in place.  The most important parts of the family--'cause you know they had to go out on the farm and grow that food, fresh food, man, and it's organic now and expensive here in Los Angeles, but there it was right outside the door.  So they had, they knew about the poisons, they knew about the medicines, all African.  They knew about the--I had a--the flu was going around, I remember, when I was about five years old and my grandmother put a thing around my neck that--put a thing around my neck that I had no friends but I was the only one that didn't get sick.  It was called asafetida--I don't know how they spelled it, -a-s-e-t-i-p-h--afedita, asafetida.  And in there was some kind of roots and herbs that kept me from getting sick.  Everybody else was getting polio, but we got something around our neck, come from my great-grandmother. She didn't go to school, I don't know where she got it from, but I was only one--and me and my cousins were the only ones that did not get sick during a virus of polio. Another time we got the--the whooping cough was going around and she took some stuff from a flannel and put something on my chest--and the flannel in the oven, and put that hot thing on my chest and the next morning I went to school, everybody else was sick.  That is African, I don't know where she got it from but it was instilled inside of her that she remembered maybe from her mother and her mother's mother.  All those things have been disconnected. So I'm, had the fortunate--I'm fortunate to have been born in the '30s [1930s] where I know that knowledge and still be alive here in 2005 to see a transformation and an omission amongst us, not as African Americans but us that some of it needs to be replaced because it was successful.  I remember my grandfather [Lacey Gossett] he lived in Coney Island and he worked in the corrugated box factory.  Now Coney Island is one thing, Bedford-Stuyvesant is another--not Bedford-Stuyvesant but Red Hook, that's maybe twenty miles.  He woke up in the morning and walked that twenty miles every morning and came back.  Walked!  I don't know anybody who would think about doing that today.  Where did he get that in him, in his system, to walk?  He couldn't afford a trolley car so he did what it took to get to work on time and to get back.  He died of alcoholism 'cause Friday night he was so tired he had to do something. Then I remember my Uncle Ruben, my great-grandmother's husband, the Cherokee, was a beachcomer.  He found diamonds in the street of Coney Island, in the sands of Coney Island.  But he had to do something 'cause in his system was a physical dedication to survive, back in those days.  There were not equal opportunity at the time so they developed-
Speaker 1: So a beach comber is such--I mean-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --those of us who never, weren't raised along the beach-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is it somebody that actually rakes through the sand to find-
Speaker 2: Rakes through the sand with a shovel, in an organized way-
Speaker 1: --that finds-
Speaker 2: --and a big sized strainer, and he found diamonds and watches and money and wallets, and everyday he had something.  And that money fed me, took care of the whole family.  The stove was coal and wood, the biscuits and the pies, which were delicious, done by hand, in African way, obviously, but I've never tasted anything as good as that in my life.  I was the one that got the cakes, I could put my finger in the cake (pantomimes swirling and licking his finger), with my finger. I was raised like that, but we were all raised together out of necessity.  The older women raised the children and the young people had to go the work.  The young men had to go and do the physical work and bring that money back, and most of the time they were butlers, porters, maids, laborers.  They had to work two, three or four jobs apiece, no time to raise the children.  But everybody raised the child-
Story_ID: 111343
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Hellen Rebecca Wray] --when did she come to--when did the family come to New York?
Speaker 2: New York?  I was the firstborn generation north so they must have come to New York, maybe '25 [1925], 1925, somewhere like that.
Speaker 1: Is there a story associated with it or--?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Is there a story associated with when they moved and how they moved and how they got there?
Speaker 2: Let me think. (Pauses) It must be similar because the history in our books is about the exodus.  So--and the rules were, if you're young enough and strong enough, you made your way north to Baltimore [Maryland], Washington [D.C.], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], New York, Boston [Massachusetts].  And once you got a job and you set yourself up, then you could send for somebody else.  So what that time was would be, guess, middle '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: I don't know any specific stories but I do remember a train called the Silver Streak or the Silver Comet and the Silver Media.  And I remember the stories which--I remember going back South is you were on the cattle train from Atlanta or Athens, Georgia to Baltimore or Washington, then you could get off and get on the silver part of the train and go north.  Going back home, the Silver Comet--I'm fifteen years old, I'm a movie star, I'm a--so I'm in the first class part of the train--the first class part of the train until our nation's capital, where I had to go out and go to the black man's washroom and drink out of the black man's faucet, and then go back into the cattle train where all the cattle was, and the barbecue and the brown greasy paper bags, to go South.  That was in place all the way past the '50s [1950s].  So my mother-
Speaker 2: A lot of people--we find that hard to believe, and that's true.  That's what was going on-
Speaker 1: Absolutely true. Our nation's capital was where the Mason-Dixon Line was.  I didn't like it for a while because my upbringing from Coney Island [New York] was different, there was minimum of racism there.  There was a combination of the families of the Mafia, the Jewish people who ran from the blacklist, from Estes Kefauver's blacklist, turned out to be the intellectual cream of the crop of America.  They come--they concentrated in Sheepshead Bay, Coney Island, Brighton Beach [New York], Canarsie [New York], Bensonhurst [New York}.
Speaker 2: Now Brighton Beach-
Speaker 1: We went to the same high school, Neil Simon, Arthur Miller.  But those schools--were the intellectual cream of the crop and created the renaissance of culture and politics and sports that run, ran the world.
Story_ID: 111344
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Louis, L-O-U-I-S, I don't know where he got this middle name but it's Gamal, G-A-M-A-L Gossett, G-O-S-S-E-T-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh boy, I couldn't, I'd have to--boy let's see-
Speaker 1: Born in the '10s you think?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I'd have to do some crude arithmetic.  Thirty six--probably born in the '10s [1910s].  He was born in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know what town?
Speaker 2: I'd have to guess but it's somewhere like Bennettsville.  There's a whole area of people born in Bennettsville, South Carolina.  As you do your research, all the African Americans in Bennettsville look alike.  For some reason in slavery, they replicated and they look alike so that's a fascinating--I'm fascinated to know how that happened.  But they were warriors 'cause they fought an awful lot.  They were hard to be enslaved.  They fought and they looked alike.  And when they came up to the north--if you came from Bennettsville, you left that man alone.  Now my father came from an area close to that which was not--he wasn't--looked like them but there was part of him in that because of the roots.  So it was Bennettsville, there was--I don't remember those names 'cause I went to Georgia most of the time.  The South Carolina people were tobacco.  They worked in the tobacco and the cotton plantations.  So my father's father was able, for some reason--and his name was Lacey [Gossett], L-A-C-E-Y.  That's my grandfather, my father's father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 111345
Speaker 1: Yeah. We were talking about the people from Bennettsville--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --South Carolina.  Are they known as Geechee?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a great deal.  It's the personality of the Geechee, sometimes there's jokes about them.  But if you go deeper, that's a certain kind of tribe, obviously must have been enslaved because they, sometimes they were kind of vindictive and powerful and very prideful--probably the Igbo--were taken on en masse somewhere and put in a slave ship and deposited to South Carolina.  And as they got freed they found themselves in Bennettsville.
Speaker 1: And they have a very strict code of conduct.
Speaker 2: Very strict culture, and no funny business.  They took care of business.  That pride had to come from the Igbo, from across the land.
Speaker 1: And you were telling some stories about some of the people from down that way that you knew and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well there was a --
Speaker 1: Deacon--
Speaker 2: --deacon, Deacon Jackson. And it's very--eyes were never really bright, there was a little red in them, and the lips were a little maroon-ish and their eyes were a little further set, very African kind of look--and they took care of business, very faithful, but don't mess with them.  And I stole a dollar, at the age of eight years old, to buy me some bubble gum or something, Fleer's bubble, Dubble Bubble.  When that thing went around, I took the dollar--my own dollar!--and put it in, took it back out, and I didn't think nobody saw.  And the next thing I know somebody grabbed me by the ear, and this was months later, and took me out and said, "Now I want you to know"--and my ear was hurting, there's nothing I could do.  And he looked at me and he said, "Now I want you to know something--I saw you take that dollar four months ago,"--and he kept on going, my ear getting worse-"and don't, don't ever forget it.  Now, you're a child of God.  So I want you to take it upon yourself--do you hear me?" "Yes!" Of course I heard him. "You need to pay that dollar back." I could not wait to pay that dollar back.  That was an African, something in that man and those particular people--when it was turned around Bennettsville, South Carolina was the place where most of the violence took--self-inflicted a lot--because of the turnover from the pride to lack of pride.  Most of the alcoholism, most of the cuttings and shootings came because of this proud people were squashed.  But on the good side, they're the most prideful people of the state.  But that was-- a warrior from Africa, squashed, and out of that came that particular personality.
Speaker 1: I was saying off camera, Chancellor Williams, the author of 'Destruction of Black Civilization', was from Bennettsville.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he will tell you the same, probably.  Left alone to grow, they would have reached all heights because of the inborn generational pride that they had.  There were other kinds of tribes that were taken as slaves--in Texas, for example, Beaumont specifically, the oversized African, to handle the horses--So we'll get back to my roots in a minute.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They handled the horses, the same thing.  So--
Speaker 1: You know the Beaumont group, they're famous for football you know, all--it was Mel Farr and a whole bunch of them.
Speaker 2: They knew exactly what they were doing, you know?
Speaker 1: It was a whole bunch of them down there.  They take pride as being the football capital of the United States.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All of them are playing in the American Football League.
Speaker 2: At the age of twelve.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The generation, the genes of those particulars, they came from a place in Africa specifically designed to handle heavy stuff so that's why they all come out of there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's--none of that's on the screen. None of that's in the books. (Chuckles)  But in travel you kind of connect the dots and I could--I had an opportunity to tell my son so he could tell his children.
Story_ID: 111346
Speaker 1: So your father [Louis Gamal Gossett] was born and raised in Bennettsville [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Right outside of Bennettsville.
Speaker 1: Right out--
Speaker 2: I cannot remember the name of the town.  Maybe before the day is up I'll remember.  I'll look on these pictures.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was kind of partially from Bennettsville, so there's part of him, part of that character, but then there's another part of the tobacco growers.  His mother came from, and I don't remember where this is--is Spartanburg North or South Carolina?
Speaker 1: I think it's --
Speaker 2: South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Spartanburg is where she was born.  Her name was--her maiden name was Walton, and we'll tell you, I'll tell you a story about that later.  But there was all tobacco.  That's the home of The Lorillard Company, Winston-Salem was another place--that might be North Carolina.
Speaker 2: North Carolina.
Speaker 1: That's, the whole area was my mother's--
Speaker 2: Or Lorillard Tobacco and all that?
Speaker 1: Lorillard.  Lorillard.
Speaker 2: Oh Lorillard.  Lorillard, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's Winston-Salem.  That's Winston-Salem cigarettes.  That's my father's mother's side.  --My father's father's side was the Bennettsville part of South Carolina, and he looked just like Jack Johnson.  Somehow, through his maneuvers, a lot of it probably illegal, he had the homburg hat, he looked like Jack Johnson. He was big man, first time with bald head and I have a photograph of him.  But there was something about him with his double-breasted suits--in the '40s [1940s]?  And his cars, his gold tooth--something about him doesn't make sense for a man of that stature to be that independent and powerful and successful.  I don't know what he did and how he did that.  But that was part of my father who knew the same route. I have photographs of him on the side of Cadillacs--I don't know what he did. But him and his wife kind of separated, and it was my father, his two brothers and a sister were getting ready to be sent to an orphan home, and my father was adopted by an Italian man, part of the mafia.  The other--and he was able then to take care of his two brothers and sister.  And this is Brooklyn now, and there's an oversized newsstand at the end of the BMT [Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit] D train in Brooklyn [New York], and there's a photograph I have that, of my father and this Italian man who was Mafia.  So my father was adopted by the Mafia, and in retrospect, why did he have that money? He got it from his father--the numbers, the lottery, and--what do they call it, the policy, the policy and the numbers.  So started with a horse and buggy delivering the Sunday Times up and down Brooklyn [New York], and inside was the numbers.  So every year, that man had a brand new car and double-breasted suits and homburg hats.  Not until retrospect that I remember, realize he was doing that for me.  When I got to that point and I did 'Roots', I changed my name from Lou Gossett to Louis Gossett, Jr.  His job was working in a newsstand and sweeping a broom with the Brooklyn Borough Gas Company. But he had a big Chicago Bank Roll, and he knew where every penny was.  And he'd lock the door with his bottle of Four Roses or Prince and his water and do these scrapbooks that I will show you.  That comes from his father, and his father's father--The end place was 'Roots.' So regardless of what they were doing, they were never too tired to spread a story of pride from one generation to another.  It's been interrupted again today.  We have to put it back in place.  So I've come to this conclusion today, after fifty-two years professional, what has been missing has to be put back, and not in anger or resentment, but in necessity, for healing.  Those children don't know that they come from a great place in history.
Story_ID: 111347
Speaker 1: Now so when you were growing up, I mean, how many brothers and sisters--do you have brothers and sisters and--?
Speaker 2: No, it was--it's a tribal thing, of cousins--twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven of us around the kitchen table sometimes, of all different ages run by my great-grandmother, the matriarch, and then our grand, grandmother and her sisters, aunts, old enough--too old to work but old enough to help raise us.  So it was hand-to-mouth, and so that's why I got a long arm 'cause I had to learn how to get to that drumstick before my cousin did.  And around the table it was us.
Speaker 1: So you don't have any siblings as--
Speaker 2: No, no siblings.
Speaker 1: But a lot of cousins.
Speaker 2: A lot of cousins.  We had to sleep sometimes head-to-toe, head-to-toe.  When I got next to the, my cousin with the dirty, smelly feet, so I had to tell him about himself, you know?  But that's how I was raised.  That's what makes me feel secure-it's still today close, close family.
Story_ID: 111348
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory, yeah.  First time in the South, maybe about eight years old, it's not in the record book, but it was the first time I broke the olympic record of running. I saw this beautiful thing picking up peaches from the tree, and apples.  There was this thing, it was yellow and black, and it was fascinating, I wanted to know what it was.  And it was a nest of hornets, and they lived on my body, and I ran as fast as I could to the water trough.  Almost died, I didn't know what it--I come from Brooklyn!  It was gorgeous, what is--and they rained on me, wasps or hornets, I don't know. What is yellow and black?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's some kind of a wasp.
Speaker 2: The only thing that would save my life was my--Guvnor Steven's young brother--young brother, he was sixty years old--got tobacco, chewing tobacco and the saliva on every one of the stingers, and they died.  And I went into a coma, there ain't no hospitals.  I was this big. So they put the tobacco on every one of the stingers, and by that evening I was able to go and eat me some barbecue.
Speaker 1: Well that fast, that's pretty good.
Speaker 2: Saliva-(unclear) he called it, (unclear). So it was chewing tobacco and saliva on every one of the stings, and they died immediately, stopped stinging, and then he would have to pick it out.  You could see him picking them out of my body--you don't learn that in medical school or anything, I don't know where that came from. But I know, "That's pretty, what is that?" (Makes explosion sound, gestures toward face). So that's not in the Guinness book of records but I'm sure that record still stands today, as fast as I ran.
Story_ID: 111349
Speaker 1: So, did you spend like every summer in the South? Sounds like it--
Speaker 2: Every summer possible.  We would work in the farms, the watermelon. And then Guvnor Steven's wife had a little garden so the tomatoes--Beefsteak tomatoes, that big (gestures with his hands)--and cantaloupe and strawberries, and that's what we ate.  Talking about getting healthy--I mean the milk straight from the cow and the cream and the butter and the clabber milk, I remember clabber milk biscuits, I remember butter milk biscuits.  Nothing was wasted.  Nothing was wasted.  What a wonderful way to live. And then going back at fifteen, with that memory, and being on Broadway--I got a combination.  Most of it was good, but some of it didn't mesh, like a machine. Because that was freedom--there was racism, but we had nothing to do with it 'cause we're on a farm.  To come to Washington, D.C., change trains and go from one world to another was a strange thing that happened to me.  Coney Island really had no racism, in a sense, because after the depression everybody needed one another.  But there was the Italians, the Irish, the Blacks, the Jews, but it wasn't--there wasn't that clash in that small community, there was outside in that world.  So I was raised with a strange combination of information which, which I guess, God made special in me, to be able to be the first African American to--and you fill in the rest. My heroes of course are Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella, etc.  Dr. Ralph Bunche.  So I kind of--must have been free of the self-imposed, less-than feeling, so by the time I got out to the public at fifteen or sixteen, you couldn't tell me any different.  I couldn't walk with Dr. [Martin Luther] King too long 'cause if a dog came to me and bite me, I would break the dog's neck.  So he said, "I love you but you need to go back home."  I know what he meant today.
Story_ID: 111350
Speaker 1: What were some of the--you've been talking about them but this is a question we have to ask.  So what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds and smells of growing up--(pauses). The sights were radio, sounds were radio.  The sights were horse and buggy, trolley cars, the El, the BMT [Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit]. And I come from Coney Island so it's the sights of the amusement park.
Speaker 1: There were still a lot of horses and buggies when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.  Of course my father [Louis Gamal Gossett] had one, delivering the newspapers, and he had a--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you kept a horse on the property and--?
Speaker 2: No, he had to go to a stable, because he was of service, he delivered the newspapers, so he went to a stable.  The other sights and sounds, of course, in the--in Georgia, were the mules and the pigs and the dogs and the hens and the chickens.  So that sound was in Georgia.  In New York was the cars, the amusement park sounds--I remember the spell of the ocean.  And in the streets was a combination of ethnics, ethnicity.  This man would come by in a cart and sell knishes, that was the Jewish part of it.  And then there was the Good Humor Man, which was ice cream, early ice cream and the sounds were, Bee bop, Good Human Man. I remember that. There was something very secure and wonderful in times of crisis about that one community.  We didn't--we couldn't get along without one another.  So the pseudo-rich needed the pseudo-poor in order to survive.  Something was going on nice there.  So those are the sounds I remember, the Charlotte Russe, the corner candy store, the sounds of the schoolyard, stickball, handball--thing called stickball where you hit a homerun if you hit three sewers long.  Everybody played those games, everybody--stoop ball.  It was a great--and today, in Beverly Hills High School, as a result of the success of that neighborhood, we have a reunion at Beverly Hills High, and there's three thousand seats in that thing, and there's standing room-only, once a year.  So I have friends and relations, that's over fifty years.  So something was right about that mix.
Story_ID: 111351
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little kid when you were growing up?  I mean, what kind of personality did you have and what did you like to do, what were your concerns?
Speaker 2: My concerns were sports--sports, sports, sports, sports.  Other than that I was very shy, I was a wall flower--I'm a reluctant star, if they want to call it that, a reluctant famous person.  I like being quiet, and I'm very shy, but I had to overcome that in order to do what I was doing, with the encouragement of my family.  I kept things to myself, stayed with my cousins, stayed with my buddies in the schoolyard.  And for some reason I was chosen as the first president of the junior high school--first African American president--and everybody went crazy about me, for some reason, I don't know why.  And then in high school, the same thing, I was captain of the basketball team, and that's not what I really wanted to do, I want to be quiet, I want to play ball.  But we had a mutual admiration society there.  So beyond my desires, I was always chosen.  I don't know what that is, that's God.  I'm not going to ask no questions today because it was a long time ago.
Story_ID: 111352
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: First of all it was P.S. 135, and I lived across the street, 2832 W. 35th Street. And it was--then we went to the Mark Twain Junior High School, P.S. 209, which was in Gravesend, Gravesend Park, and I was the senior--and I have photographs--the student body president.  Then went on to Abraham Lincoln High School, where I was senior class president and captain of the basketball team, and it was during that time I opened on Broadway, during my junior/senior year in high school, in 1953.
Speaker 1: Now, were you always interested in performing?  You said you were shy.  How did you--?
Speaker 2: I was shy.  Well I was shy except when I had a basketball or a baseball in my hand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But those same teachers--
Speaker 1: You were a baseball pitcher, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a pitcher, and I played basketball and those same teachers who taught us--we were, see, we learned Latin at ten years old--whose children I grew up with, excuse me--those same teachers, their children were going to school with me, so they wanted to make sure their children got a great education, and I was there with them. So I was in the synagogues, in the Catholic churches, in their churches and they were in mine.  We insulated ourselves, and those teachers made sure that I learned along with their children.  I was in their homes--regardless of the financial thing, I was in their homes, they're still friends today. So that--in them making sure that we have that knowledge, one of those teachers said to me, "They're doing this play on Broadway, and I know you don't--you've never done a play, never seen a play--but they can't find a young, African American boy, young Negro boy to play this lead in this play called 'Take a Giant Step.' It's an autobiographical piece by, written by a man by the name of Louis [S.]Peterson.  Tell your mother to take you down there.  What can you lose?"  That's how it started.
Speaker 1: And how old were you?
Speaker 2: Fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All I knew was that I was president of the student body, worked for the Lincoln Log which was the newspaper, writing, and captain of the basketball team.
Speaker 1: Okay, and about what year is this?
Speaker 2: 1952.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1952.
Speaker 2: And here I am, I'm the only one, me, I was the only African American in the crowd, and then some others kind of who had come to crowd but there was something over our African--it was a black neighborhood and my parents took me out of there -cause there were gangs and stuff. So I was raised in a homogenous area, me and a couple of other African Americans, Italians, Irish, predominantly Jewish, Russian Jewish, very family-oriented people, Russian Jews. And everybody takes care of everybody, and we had that in place.  It was one of those kind of consciousness--because my mom was probably the maid and cook for them, and she, she showed love, they showed love back, and I got all of their toys and their love.  It was more like, not us--not them being superior but, we need one another, kind of existence.  And one of those teachers got me started.  His name was Gustav, G-U-S-T-A-V Blum, B-L-U-M.  His real name was Gustav Blumberg, former Broadway producer/director who ran from the blacklist.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were saying earlier that a lot of the people, I mean a lot of the Jewish people in that community were blacklisted, people who had--
Speaker 2: They ran. It was not communism, it was left-wing, it was a labor movement.
Speaker 1: And these were people that were the cream of the intellectual crowd.
Speaker 2: Intellectual cream of the crowd.
Speaker 1: You were saying some people like Neil Simon went to school with you--
Speaker 2: Neil Simon, his representative, Arthur Miller--
Speaker 1: Arthur Miller.
Speaker 2: That was the backbone of early television and--
Speaker 1: So they were classmates?  I mean Arthur Miller is older.
Speaker 2: Arthur Miller is older, but that generation, those people, his cousins and stuff, all contemporaries of mine.  My contemporaries are Harvey Keitel, Sandy Koufax from Lafayette--how many other people, there are so many, so many.  And we're today, around the world, they are in place, in positions of honor and tradition, from that little small community of Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge, Sheepshead Bay, Brighton Beach, for some reason.  And the reason in, connecting the dots again, those grandparents were those who ran from the inter--from all of the top universities of the United States, away from Estes Kefauver, and they were accepted by secretary of education in New York City, [Dr. William] Jansen was his name, and put us, put those in the boondocks--Staten Island, the Bronx, Long Island and Brooklyn--thank God.
Speaker 1: So they were assigned to those schools out in the, on the--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they changed their names.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They should be--they should have been--be in college, they should have been teaching college. But they hid, and they created their own society, and I grew up with their children, And their children, my contemporaries across the world, could be Barbara Streisand, could be Mamas and the Papas, could be Neil Simon, could be Harvey Keitel, could be--there's so many others.  But you should see that list, out every year, of who came from Brooklyn, who are successful, the success rate of the high school alone was above 65 percent, above 65 percent--that's not true today, but if you went through that neighborhood and went through those schools, your success, your potential for success, was above 65 percent.  It's supposed to be impossible.
Speaker 1: That's incredible, yeah.
Speaker 2: But because of the foundation of the neighborhood, and the support system.  It's still in place in some of those families, and they're still kind of making it.  We need the same thing.
Story_ID: 111353
Speaker 1: Now at some--you were fourteen years old.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You're in a--you go down and you audition for this Broadway play, 'Take a Giant Step.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I auditioned, didn't know nothing about no theater. My voice was shaking and I had a Brooklyn [New York] accent, a Brooklyn-Jewish accent.
Speaker 1: Can you talk like that now?
Speaker 2: But of course I can talk like that, I can still talk like that--(unclear) Hey! I can talk like this all day if you want, you know.  That's the way I was raised, you know? So, there were maybe about five thousand kids, and I was skinny, my voice was changing, and the story was about a kid my age who was going through the growth of adolescence into feeling his body, and there's nobody to date in his neighborhood, and he's going a little crazy--called 'Take a Giant Step,' from a teenager to manhood.  Anyway, I was going through the same thing.  The only difference was that I could date anybody from Coney Island but this kid in the play could not.  So to make a long story short, on Labor Day of 1953, when I was fifteen years old, I opened at the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], in a lead, in a play called 'Take a Giant Step.' Took the entire summer to get rid of the Brooklyn accent to teach me Actors Studio-moment-to-moment acting, and the people who taught me, besides the late Louis Peterson, was the John Sticks, who was one of the founders of the Actors Studio, and on the right, sitting on the stage, was a great actress by the name of Peggy Feury, she was Mrs. Louis Peterson at the time.  And then the other lady on the other side was--I'll come up with her name later today, another top actress.  So I had the director and those two actresses, and some of the people of the Actors Studio, teaching me how to act in a fifteen-week summertime, away from everything, in Connecticut.  I had a tutor, great food, fresh air, and seven days a week, I'd go through this play.  So by the time I opened I could do it backwards, I'd do it in my sleep.
Story_ID: 111354
Speaker 1: --But that foundation-
Speaker 2: You were fourteen, now you're like kind of away from what, the stuff you used to do, like play ball and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah I'm away from it.  It didn't feel good, but in retrospect, it was necessary. I would not have known that I was a good actor unless this--one more time--fickle finger of fate picked me up by the nape of the neck and put me there.  And it picked me up by the nape of the neck and made me an outstanding citizen in school.  It picked me up by the nape of the neck and made me an outstanding citizen in the church. But there was a loneliness in it, for some reason, because it's an ill-fitting job for an African American boy in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] to be isolated, there's no childhood, it's responsibility time.  So I had to sneak my responsibility, and the only way to do it is to go to the black neighborhood and do that, or go to the hippies or to the jazz musicians. So a split personality became apparent there. But history was being made with me.  My heroes, the late Roy Campanella, Jackie Robinson, Dr. Ralph Bunche, Paul Robeson, who I didn't know who he was until I met him, Josephine Baker, and people who were in the plays with me, Fredrick O'Neal, who's probably in your archives, the late Estelle Hemsley, who played my grandmother, Estelle Evans, Maxine Sullivan, who's got to be in your archives. And they kind of molded me. And the people around the theatrical society was Paul Robeson, Maxwell Glanville, James Baldwin, [HM] Roscoe Lee Browne.  And then the whites at the time was [Marlon] Brando and James Dean and Anthony Quinn--those people were steeped in artistic discipline, and for some reason, that one more time, God put me in the middle--Shirley Booth, put me in the middle, and taught me some kind of discipline and lifestyle. So I kind of bypassed the childhood and became totally responsible, and got all the work--since there wasn't none before--and I got the job. I got all the early television work, thank God to Mr. David Susskind, also from Brooklyn, and Fred Coe, also from Lincoln [Abraham Lincoln High School]. All those particular people with early television, 'The Philco Playhouse' in the early days, 'The Goodyear', 'Omnibus', 'You Are There', 'East Side/West Side', 'The Nurses', 'The Defenders', all-'Judd for the Defense', all came from early New York television, and I was the only one working.  That's my growth into the business.  Those still in my--those who are still alive are still friends today.  So something, I don't know what it was from all of that, that community background, the South, the American Indians, something happened in me that they put me in a place outside of the--ready?
Speaker 2: Finish that sentence.
Speaker 1: After that--outside of the African American neighborhood to a melting pot neighborhood saw some reason I was picked out of the crowd as a role model, as an example of it's possible to make it.
Story_ID: 111355
Speaker 1: So, well tell us about the run of this play.  The--yeah, 'Take a Giant Step'.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was mostly a black cast, about a black kid--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about a black kid going through his growth from adolescence to manhood.
Speaker 1: Was this a play--this is a--this had to be something unique on Broadway in those days 'cause I don't think there were any other plays about black kids on Broadway?
Speaker 2: Absolutely unique.
Speaker 1: There aren't any now I don't think.
Speaker 2: Well it gets, it's getting there. But absolutely unique in the sense that it was forwarded--it was put on Broadway because of those same people, those same people sensitive to a wonderful story.  Those people who--descendants that were from that blacklist, the Arthur Millers, those kind of people wrote those plays.  And Louis Peterson who wrote the play, his wife was a white actress, Peggy Feury, one of the top actresses from the Actors Studio, she was known in society, the [HM Harry] Belafonte society, was responsible for putting that play on, financially, etc.  So there was a collision, a good collision course between me and that part and my place in life and those particular people.  I looked just like Louis Peterson when he was that age.  So--
Speaker 1: So this is autobiographical?
Speaker 2: It's auto, autobiographical, and it was a natural thing that all African American kids who lived away from the ghetto in the semi-Caucasian neighborhoods, or even more, aspiring to be better had to go through 'cause there was nobody to date, you know?  But it was a wonderful piece--I walked through that piece every day, each time there was something more, so I--it felt like something I should have been doing all my life.  But in the back of my mind, I wanted to be a doctor and a professional athlete.  So I got a scholarship to New York University.
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute, before we--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --get you into New York University, you were telling us off camera that you won an award, a Tony--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --for best newcomer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had an award for the best newcomer, it's called the Donaldson Award.  And my competition was James Dean, John Kerr, Ben Gazzara, Anthony Franciosa, and I can't remember the other guy, and I won, so I beat James Dean for an acting award, for the best newcomer.  James Dean was doing 'See the Jaguar,' John Kerr was doing 'Tea and Sympathy,' Ben Gazzara and Anthony Franciosa was doing a thing called 'End as a Man,' and I was in 'Take a Giant Step.'
Speaker 1: This was 1950--
Speaker 2: --'54 [1954]-'53 [1953], '54 [1954] area, the Donaldson [Awards], there was no Tonys [Tony Awards] at the time, Tonys were not so big as they are today--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 111356
Speaker 1: About that time around '54 [1954] the [Joseph] McCarthy hearings crashed--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and the blacklist stuff starts breaking down.
Speaker 2: The blacklist had started-- but the blacklist had really started before that, with Estes Kefauver--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --from Tennessee, and McCarthy took it from there.  So then, all of a sudden, here we go running again, and at the time, if you remember, Academy Award for Best [Adapted] Screenplay was won by a man with a pseudonym who couldn't show up, William Holden was in it, Bing Crosby and Princess Grace, it was called--I cannot remember the name of this movie, about an aging actor and a young actress.  It was written by a man who was the Academy Award, his real name was Dalton Trumbo.
Speaker 1: Dalton Trumbo, he wrote the screen play for 'Spartacus'.
Speaker 2: He was one of those guys that ran.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So he couldn't come up to the show for that--but he got the Oscar because they knew how good he was so he just used a different name.  I cannot remember the name of that play, it was play first and then it was a screenplay.  It won the Academy Award.  That was my era in Broadway. Those people who ran from the blacklist, original names like Gustav Bloomberg was Gus Bloom, Jack Schwartzman was Jack Schwartz, Greenberg was-Green was Greenberg, Ross was Rosenberg.  And they, thank God they were around me cause they put--pretty instilled in me stuff that I had in order to catapult.  So I had knowledge that my African American contemporary did not, because that's where I was raised, which is why I guess God separated me, as God separated Jackie Robinson in Pasadena [California], etc.
Story_ID: 111357
Speaker 1: So here I am with that information, being a person of the church, First Baptist Church of Coney Island [New York City, New York]--another part of history, which I saw on the screen last year in 'Ray', story of Ray Charles. The entire intermediate choir, all the girls, were Raelettes. But The Raelettes were also a group called The Chiffons, so The Raelettes could do a concert in nine places in America at the same time (laughter)'cause there were only three of them so they'd be in Florida and Detroit [Michigan] at the same time 'cause they were also The Chiffons, they were interchangeable, he had twenty-five, twenty-six Raelettes, but the money was pouring into the main office, 'cause the Raelettes were the Chiffons, and they made a lot of money, the Dorothy Jones and Ethel (Darlene) McCrea.  That was my intermediate choir.  And then intermediate choir--are we at that level? Am I speaking--?
Speaker 2: Yeah you're talking about the choir, the church choir?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So on that level, out of that church, came a group called The Gospel Brothers, and that was our thing, music was wonderful.  So we'd go to the Brooklyn Paramount [Paramount Theatre], at the time, and we'd sing you know 'Sweet Hour of Prayer' and all that, then we first got the lead singer to go (sings/howls), and the first, original Ray Charles-kind of screaming, and we'd have these contests, these battles, these gospel battles, and our competition was Ray Charles and Al Hibbler, the original Five Blind Boys.  And on the stage would come the Dixie Hummingbirds--That was Sam Cooke.  I can't remember the other group, but the leader of that group was Jackie Wilson. That's where they started. And Ray started this whole gospel-R&B, went into R&B, that's where those superstars came from.  We'd have these competitions every Sunday afternoon--I smell the food, I smell the barbecue, I smell the laughter, I smelled the--I've never seen that on the screen, but that was a very important. And it happened probably in every major city in America, the gospel contest.
Speaker 2: The Mighty Clouds of Joy.
Speaker 1: The Mighty Clouds of Joy. The Dixie (Southern?) Harmonaires. The (unclear), you know what I'm saying?  It was amazing, it was incredible, you could bite it like a sandwich, it was so beautiful.  That's when churches were at its optimum.  It was a cornerstone Baptist out of Brooklyn, and the contests with Adam Clayton Powell's church, Abyssinian Baptist Church, and they'd meet somewhere, in some theater, and try and out-sing one another.  And the feeling--I still get goose pimples from that era--it's been interrupted.  We got to get back to it, because it was too good, you know?  The roots, our roots, our children don't know anything about, they think that they're lost and orphans, they have no idea how, from what kind of people and culture they come from.  They must be told.

Speaker 1: Now the play, 'Take a Giant Step' ran for seven months, you said?
Speaker 2: Seven-and-a-half months, yeah.
Speaker 1: Seven-and-a-half months.
Speaker 2: And then again for another year-and-a-half off Broadway.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were in it the whole time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in and out of it.
Speaker 1: And going to school too?
Speaker 2: I don't know how that happened.  I was from Coney Island [New York City, New York], Coney Island to Broadway after school, Wednesdays I had a tutor because I had a matinee, and then Saturdays I had a tutor for the matinee, and then I'd be home for the weekend.  That segued into college when I was doing--not when I was doing 'Take a Giant Step'--I had a girlfriend in New Rochelle [New York], I don't know how I did this.  And I went from Coney Island to NYU [New York University], which is Washington Square, got on the train to go basketball in Morningside Heights, and then from Morningside Heights, went up to New Rochelle to my girlfriend's house and slept--you can't sleep in the BMT [Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit] now--but then get back on a plane, back on the train, and go all they way back to Coney Island, studying and falling asleep, and the last stop was the last stop.  I would wake up and go home.  I did that for three years.  I don't how how I did that.
Speaker 1: This is--that's amazing.
Speaker 2: Love is good though, ain't it?  (Laughs) But I did it. And then I did theater, the same route, until finally I decided to move into Manhattan.
Speaker 1: At the same time you're pitching base--you're a baseball pitcher--
Speaker 2: Playing--
Speaker 1: --and you're playing basketball.
Speaker 2: Well I wanted to--
Speaker 1: And at a higher level, apparently.
Speaker 2: At a high level.
Speaker 1: You're the captain of the basketball team and at the same--
Speaker 2: That was the summer after school.
Speaker 1: So this is--so for three years you're doing--that's a lot.
Speaker 2: Went through a complete physical, in great shape, great energy, minimum of three, four hours sleep a day.
Speaker 1: Six feet four-
Speaker 2: Six-four, lean and mean.
Speaker 1: As they said on the Internet, at one time, "at your peak at six-four".
Speaker 2: (Rolls eyes, laughs)Yeah, lean and mean and doing it, doing it to death. Pretty good marks--every now and then I do, ended up on a television show.  I did not want to do that--I wanted to be a sports--I wanted to be an athlete and a doctor.
Story_ID: 111359
Speaker 1: What was your first TV show?
Speaker 2: First TV show?  First TV show was a live--was called kinescope, which is the tape for later--in case you made a mistake, was The Red Buttons Show.
Speaker 1: Red Buttons.
Speaker 2: Red Buttons (Imitates Red Buttons), you know that guy--
Speaker 1: And the Jewish comedian, do the finger thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: With Phil Silvers and all those guys.  'Sergeant Bilko' was second.  Then I walked into the David Susskind series, the thing about history--and I did, I played the soldier who had tears in his eyes during--when Lincoln was assassinated and the train went by, and they had a close up of the soldier with tears in his eyes.
Speaker 1: This is 'You Are There'?
Speaker 2: 'You Are There,' 'You Are There.'  Right.
Speaker 1: 'You Are There.'  I remember yeah.
Speaker 2: And then I did 'The Big Story'--
Speaker 1: Walter Cronkite was the host of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  'You Are There.'  So--
Speaker 1: And said, "You are there."
Speaker 2: 'You Are There,' that was it, exactly.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Then I did 'Omnibus', and then I worked my way up to the David Susskind chain of episodic television of 'The Defenders,' 'The Nurses,' 'East Side/West Side,' and all of his specials, I was in all of them, they all went to the same school as I did so I was called "Louie! Hey Louie!", you know?  So I did all the theater, and I didn't officially graduate from New York University, but I my diploma 'cause I was busy in the theater.
Speaker 1: Are we up to the place in theater for me to talk further?
Speaker 2: Well did you go to the Tisch School at NYU [New York University]?  Were you a part of the Tisch School?  Did they call it that then?
Speaker 1: This is before the Tisch School.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: The theater program at NYU was not very good at the time, it was dated, I had to study at the Actors Studio to learn.
Speaker 2: That was right around the corner.
Speaker 1: Right around the corner. 'Cause now it's one of the best in the country, in the world, but at the time, it was dated.  I had to learn my acting at the Actors Studio--
Story_ID: 111360
Speaker 1: We don't want to skip over the sports stuff okay, before we get to that.  But there's a--you had a--you were a serious candidate for professional sports.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I--yeah.
Speaker 1: You were a pitcher with Sandy Koufax- I was a right-handed pitcher, and Sandy Koufax was pitching--
Speaker 2: --who some people think was the greatest pitcher of all-time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I was a right-handed pitcher and Sandy Koufax was the left-handed pitcher.  We played against each other in the winter in basketball, he was probably one of the greatest athletes, pure, natural athletes I've ever seen at his youth.  He was just oversized and strong, and he could throw a ball 110 miles an hour at the age of fourteen years old, could not throw a strike until-[Kenny] Myers is his last name, a coach, taught him how to throw a ball through a tire.  And then--he was great then, but he was the greatest after his operation.  They had a natural drop, nobody--it'd come off a table, be coming at you at ninety-five miles an hour, and it would disappear, nobody could touch it.  At that same time, I was playing college ball with Happy Hairston, Satch Sanders--
Speaker 2: Right, who played for the [Los Angeles] Lakers, Satch Sanders, who had a great career with the [Boston] Celtics.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was that NYU [New York University] team, twenty-one [wins] and one [loss].
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Sanders went to the Celtics, Happy Hairston went to the Lakers, Cal Ramsey went to the Knicks and hurt his knee that first year, he still works for the Knicks.  It was Russ Cunningham, there's Barry Kramer.  But I was in and out of that team 'cause I was a professional actor so you don't see me in that history books.  But one of the main claims of fame--and he still won't talk to me today--is holding [Rodney Clark] Hot Rod Huntley down to six points.  But I was discovered from the Knicks from my summer league, the Rucker Tournament.  In the Rucker Tournament I played against the Ricketts, the Ricketts Brothers, Dick and Dave [Ricketts], Sihugo Green out of Boys' High--
Speaker 2: Sihugo Green.
Speaker 1: Connie Hawkins, Lenny Wilkens, those are the guys.  I keep teasing Lenny, he said--he would bounce up to me, he's left-handed--he looked at me and said, "Lou, you need to go back to Broadway,' and he'd disappear. (Laughs) But those are my guys, that's when I was drafted to the Knicks, not from the college but from the Rucker Tournament, 'cause I was pretty good in the Rucker Tournament, I averaged about sixteen, eighteen points a game.
Speaker 2: So you're like, you're acting, in shows every now and then, you're playing basketball in the Rucker league--
Speaker 1: That was my love.
Speaker 2: And you were pitching.  What was the team that you and Sandy Koufax pitched for?
Speaker 1: First of all it was the Parkviews. Then it turns into the (Meissners?), which was the petroleum company that put the heater for the heating systems. Then it turned to the Sugar Rays, and Sandy went to one team and I went to the other, it was sponsored by Sugar Ray Robinson. (Laughs)  I got a photograph there, Sugar Rays--I was the only black guy on the team, everybody else was Italian (Laughs).
Speaker 2: Or I guess Jewish, in the case of Koufax.
Speaker 1: Jewish and Italian.  But Sandy went to the Parkviews.  Now Sandy--if you talk to, ever talk to Sandy, he doesn't, he hasn't connected 'cause I haven't had a chance to talk to him.  I said, "Do you remember the Parkviews?" a few years ago and he looked at me, said, "How do you know about the Parkviews?  That's where Sandy was discovered, it was a semipro level of baseball in Coney Island-Dolph Camilli, Lee Mazzilli came from that same area, he's now a coach.
Speaker 2: Right, and a great ball player with the Mets--
Speaker 1: Ed Kranepool, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They all got to play with the Mets.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Steven/Steve Limball (unclear)--yeah.  So it's pretty upwardly mobile in sports--of course, the basketball players like Stephon Marbury and those people came to the same schoolyard.  Sebastian Telfair.
Speaker 2: He's a new guy, yeah.
Speaker 1: He's the new one, yeah.  That--so it's a fresh-air community which is good 'cause there's the nice little--it's fresh air and it's right by the ocean.  The Mets farm team now is there, they're--called the Coney Island Cyclones.  So that area is good and bad But I was doing all of that, I would take off from sports in order to do a play or a television show or-and then go back.
Story_ID: 111361
Speaker 1: Tell us about this tryout with the [New York] Knicks and then we'll just pick up and just go over--the rest of it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The tryout with the Knicks came in the mail, because of the Rucker Tournament, and getting it in the mail, I hadn't saved it, I wish I had.  But it's up in the Catskill Mountains and it was either, it was either a Kutsher's Country Club or one of those, Grossinger's, I believe it was, Grossinger's Country Club in the Catskills.  And G-R-O-S-S-I-N-G-E-R- or Kutchner's, K-U-T-C-H-N-E-R or something like that, Kutsher's Country Club, they're all close up there in the Adirondacks, the Catskill Mountains. That's where the farm, that's where the training was for the basketball, the rookie camp.  And we'd get up there--they come from all around, Pennsylvania, Bronx [New York] and we all, some hundred of us, and we'd do scrimmages and scrimmages, and eventually, they would start pulling people off and then we'd get down to maybe twenty of us.  We'd play and play, all day and all night--then we'd take a, a one light, and play all day and all night trying to make that team, and I was with them.  And then finally we got to the final cut, and there was twenty-five to thirty of us, and this stuff got serious. Out of the bags become brass knuckles, little switch, little razor blades, that's when people would cut tendons if you're too good, they would knee you, they would elbow you.  They'd get in front of you, and if you have the basketball, put their knee and their elbow in your nose. And I saw blood up there, and it started to get quite serious, and it made me a better basketball player because nobody could touch me then.  But I got hit with brass knuckles in the thigh so hard--
Speaker 1: This was during a game?
Speaker 2: During, during one of those scrimmages, and the scouts were watching to see who was going to make the team.  My name is on the final cut, and the Knicks were not very good at that time. I think it was the end of [Nathaniel] Sweetwater Clifton's career, and my contemporaries, the young guy was named Phil Jackson. At the end of the--Ernie Vandeweghe was my coach at NYU [New York University], I can't remember, it was '59 [1959] so--
Speaker 1: It's Kiki Vandeweghe III's father.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Kiki's father, you know. Anyway, it was--we're still playing on 8th Avenue in the Old Madison Square Garden and the rites of passage, they were killers.  So I had to make a decision, after I saw that injury, it was like a watermelon.  Sat there and I said, now, I'm going to go on a train and come back to Manhattan and play in 'A Raisin in the Sun' tonight 'cause I'm in Broadway-'Raisin in the Sun' with Sidney Poitier. This was just curiosity, I can't afford this.  I'm not desperate, I'm not hungry, they are hungry. So I left, and I limped for a couple of weeks and that went away.  And we were successful in 'A Raisin in the Sun' and I became an actor.  I think that was when I made a conscious decision not to do anything else but act.
Story_ID: 111362
Speaker 1: Tell us about getting this part with--in 'Raisin in the Sun.'
Speaker 2: Well I was chosen to be in--it was nice.  Lorraine Hansberry, God rest her soul, I wish she was alive, and of course Lloyd Bridges-[HM] Lloyd Richards.  But we were chosen--we did not know what part I was going to play.  It was me and Ivan Dixon, either I was going to be the African or he was going to be the African, but one would play one role and the other would play the other.  So he got the African, 'Asagai,' and I got 'George Murchison,' the rich college boy with the quotes 'A Raisin in the Sun') "faggoty-looking white shoes."  Lasted about a-year-and-a-half, longer than that.  The--but to be chosen--That's a great honor. I began slowly but surely to accept my role in theater and made the conscious decision, "I'm not a doctor, not a sportsman, but an actor."  So I kind of rolled up my sleeves and studied hard and hung out with those particular people and learned from them and taught them what it takes to be an artist, not just an actor.  Hard work began, and I wound up in 'A Raisin in the Sun,' thank God.  And I got to work with Sidney [Poitier], and eventually [HM] Ossie [Davis] and [HM] Ruby [Dee], Ruby at that time, and Claudia McNeil and Diana Sands, and met James Baldwin who was in the-- at the Actors Studio. And I got to meet all those people and get to know exactly-Sidney--what a great, great, great man.  I got to know them, I got to know what they were about.  Isaac--Ivan Dixon.  And I got deep into those particular people who were really taking care of me because I didn't know what I was doing. I was a kid and I wanted to do something else, and they kept saying, "You got to be devoted, you got to be devoted," and finally, I became devoted, and open arms.  To make a long story short, here I sit today.  But that was my roots.  So I've been very fortunate to have what they call guardian angels somewhere from Brooklyn [New York] all the way up to early theater.
Story_ID: 111363
Speaker 1: And did a lot of the black actors I guess in the, I guess just the group before you they were part of the American Negro Theater [New York City, New York].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And they were part of the, what's--the Negro Ensemble Company--
Speaker 2: Negro Ensemble is later.  The American Negro Theater.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: And the New Lafayette Theatre before that.  The New Lafayette Theater has a hell of a story that people should remember, of the story of Canada Lee and Rex Ingram and those particular people, earlier, before the American Negro Theater, which was Sidney Poitier, [HM] Harry Belafonte and those particular people.  Was a--that was quite a society up there in Harlem, the Harlem Renaissance time where culture was at its optimum.  And you know about Paul Laurence Dunbar and Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen and the original, Adam Clayton Powell, Sr., and Marcus Garvey and Hubert Julian and Bojangles [Bill "Bojangles" Robinson], Lena Horne, Billie Holiday, Cab Calloway [Cabell "Cab" Calloway] and Count Basie [William "Count" Basie], ad infinitum.  It was the Harlem Renaissance, never been on the screen--What a rich, rich, rich period.  I came up during the end of that era, so Sugar Hill was still kind of in place, and I got a taste of it.  Very exciting to have a taste, as I said before, from the 30s [1930s] until now, to see the history and to be part of it all, makes me kind of maybe a, kind of an encyclopedia in a way, 'cause I knew all the people and I've seen people born and die and I'm still here for some reason, maybe to tell these stories.  It got me deep in the middle of the devotion of my craft, taking it from them and carrying it on.  All those who are still alive, I must thank them for that contribution in my life.  All those who are gone, they're still here, I want to thank them also.  The roots must be continued that way.  I have some stories to tell about those eras that last for the rest of my life, the [HM] Roscoe Lee Brownes who are still here, but the Fredrick O'Neal who are not, the first African American President of Actors' Equity [Association]--
Speaker 1: Tell us some of these stories.  That's what--.
Speaker 2: Oh boy.  Well, in 'Take a Giant Step, he played my father, and he had to slap me once a performance.
Speaker 1: This is Fredrick O'Neal?
Speaker 2: Fredrick O'Neal played my father.  And I, I keep-'cause my father used to slap me when I was a kid, so that memory would hit me and I knew he would--I knew it was coming (laughs). I knew it was coming, so he used to do a little thing, he used to fake, he'd go, 'cause I got to get slapped. And it wasn't hurting, but one time I faked the wrong way, and he damn near dislocated my jaw.  I mean that was--that hand that he had was fifteen pounds alone.  But he used to slap me with his fingers, you know, and I'd have to go like that. One time he caught me, but he did fake--'cause I was ducking, I couldn't stay still for that slap.  And I was talking like this for a while, you know?  But he was the one that used to put the--my eye makeup on, 'cause in theater you have to accent your eye so you can see it in the balcony.  And he used to do my makeup for me, I have a photograph of that.  Estelle Hemsley, who played my grandmother, I was adopted by her.  The people, Maxine Sullivan, all those people took such good care of me.  If it was not for those particular people I wouldn't have survived--made sure I stayed out of trouble, I was hand carried from one to another to another during that early period.  I'm very grateful for those people.
Story_ID: 111364
Speaker 1: During one of the previews, I had to say "Goddamn it, I'm not doing that!", screaming at my grandmother.  At the end of one performance, a Sunday matinee, a knock on the door, I opened the door, and this woman came and hit me on the head with her purse--That was my grandmother, for cursing on that stage.  I still had a--she hit, she knocked me almost unconscious, and I had to pull her off and remind her that this is a line in a play, but she had no concept of her grand--grandson speaking to anybody that age ever again.  That was one thing I remember.  The other one was during a sad part the following Sunday, everybody's crying because grandma is died, dead, and I'm crying, and in the audience, you can hear the person saying--And (unclear) then you hear in the background (laughter). People really upset, "Who is that laughing at this terrible time?"  It was my grandfather--he was, "That's my grandson."  He had never seen a play before.  But he was so proud that I had influence, he fell into a giggle, everybody is crying and he's laughing -"That's my grand, that's my grandson!"  That's where it come from, from my grandmother one Sunday slapping me all upside the head for cursing-"If I hear you cursing one more time I'm going to pull you off that stage"--to my grandfather, "That's my grandson!"  Again, in retrospect, our children don't have that anymore.  One more time--if that was in place we wouldn't have so much of a problem.
Speaker 2: And we don't have enough of it that's for sure.
Speaker 1: We don't have enough of it, you know.  Those are the two stories I really remember.  Opening night, I dislocated my toe, I didn't remember doing it until later.  There was a turning thing, and it was a set where I had to go in this middle and take off shoes and change shoes, and it was this phosphorescent paint that you can see in the dark, and I had grown. (Laughs)  So they measured my feet when I first--I wore a size eleven-and-a-half, by the time it was opening night I was a size twelve-and-a-half!  So my toe went over the border where the thing came down, where the set came down, and it hit my toe, "boomp", it was a clean break.  And I don't remember it, I don't remember it until after the play was over, my mind just went away, but I looked down there's a big oversized toe that they reset.  But it's amazing what happens to you when you're involved in something--dancers, athletes, you don't know till after the game that you broke something, you hurt something.
Story_ID: 111365
Speaker 1: Well tell us some more stories about the old days, those early days.
Speaker 2: Okay, as I remember, let me see what I can remember again.  Let's see.
Speaker 1: We just finished the toe-breaking story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I broke the--I broke my toe opening night, didn't--and I played with, in a little bit of pain.  But I'm a basketball player, I play in pain, I even played basketball with that bad toe, I limped around.  I still scored about fifteen points, and it hurt, it hurt like hell. But there's something about sports and theater--it goes out of your mind until it's over, and when it's over, it hurts twice as bad--until you start playing again. (Laughs)  So it's amazing how it--and it went away, and I still got a lump, I got a lump on my toe, I can still see it through the sock where I broke my toe.  I broke it again and again and again playing basketball.  That's the name of the game, all my fingers have been broke, there was no sophisticated medicine at the time. But I had a, a desire to be a doctor because some of the people that I loved very much in my family died on me.  And I didn't want that to ever happen anymore, died too soon, too early. And I--just some connections, my uncles and stuff, my cousins, they've disappeared, and I felt alone.  And I wanted to be a doctor, I didn't want that to happen to people close to me, I wanted to make sure they lived a long time, like my great-grandmother did.  So I went almost to the end of premed and missed, and I missed it, because I was pulled out.  And this time, I was pulled out to do a play called 'Take A Giant'--'The Desk Set' with Shirley Booth, another one of those standards in my life.
Story_ID: 111366
Speaker 1: Shirley Booth, the late Shirley Booth was in a thing called 'The Desk Set.'  And the system of Broadway was that you would rehearse in New York City [New York], and then you'd go to New England or Boston [Massachusetts] or New Haven [Connecticut] or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to try it out. (brief pause) That's my poor puppy, hang on, let me go see--
Speaker 2: Okay, so we wind up in Wilmington, Delaware in 'The Desk Set' trying out. And I had never been to Wilmington, Delaware--been to New Haven and Philadelphia and Boston.  And what you do when you check into the hotel--the du Pont Hotel [sic, Hotel du Pont] that's a famous name in America--check in, go out and get something to eat.  So I knew I was on the borderline of the South, so I had sensitivity.  So I looked around, I saw the New England seafood restaurant, went into the New England seafood restaurant and I'm standing there for about fifteen, twenty minutes, people coming and going.  Finally a lady comes up to me and she says, "Can I help you?"  I said, "I'd like to have something to eat." "I'll be right back"--and she talked to the man and blah, blah, blah.  She came up very slowly and said, "Well, we don't serve colored people here," very soft.   What a feeling I got.  I don't know what that --I can't comp--I can't describe--It was abject racism, at the age of nineteen, that I'd ever--New, this is the New England, I'm coming for some clam chowder, from New England. And I'm here with Shirley Booth. Now, I go from there, I'm just--tears are just on this side of coming out, I've got to go to the rehearsal. And I have a line, I can't say the line, I can't say the line.  (Unclear)-"Oh, let's try it again.  Let's give the kid a chance, he must be nervous."  I can't say the line.  So finally Shirley says, "They're about to fire you, come here, tell me what happened."  And tears came down, and I told her.  What Shirley Booth did was call the du Ponts--I don't know this until afterwards--she called the du Ponts.  She said, "If you don't change this law today, we're all out of here."  And I got a personal invitation from that same restaurant that night.  I didn't know until afterwards--"Anything you want, Mr. Gossett, in this town, is yours."  But Shirley Booth did that.  So that's one, again, one of those people.  That's a tribute to the great Shirley Booth.  She didn't have to do that--he stage manager didn't care, nor the other actors, they were eating there, saying, "Hi Lou, ha, ha, ha, ha."  But Shirley Booth, the star of that play, said, "If you don't take care of this boy, I'm gone."  And she was at the top of her career, so what she said goes.
Story_ID: 111367
Speaker 1: And one of my best friends today is a lady by the name of Pennie DuPont, who was twelve to fifteen years old at the time, who came with a personal invitation to come and see the [DuPont] mansions. And she was my--one of my friends, I have to see her again, she's in the--obviously very wealthy, in the business now, Pennie DuPont.  So thank you Pennie DuPont, thank you Shirley Booth, for saving--I didn't--if they had done that in a negative way, or not done anything, I probably would have been out of show business. 'Cause I didn't want to do that--there's too much good stuff happening in basketball, baseball and medicine.  But she did that, which embarked me on a wonderful career, with faith in people like that.  That's Wilmington, Delaware, 1954, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Delaware, and during the tour of those mansions, those family mansions, they have a mansion for the retarded children, all the retarded du Ponts, another mansion for all the ones who are questionably mixed in the races or incestuous, they have a mansion for that, a mansion for the cousins who are upwardly mobile.  A mansion for the--that's how they set their society, what a movie that would be. But that's quiet, that's the du Ponts.   But out of that came Pennie DuPont, who I met as a friend, today, she's in our business.  It was a hot and cold kind of experience--I needed to grow up, to realize that it [racism] does exist. And so, I became sensitive of the growth of the du Pont, and of the strikes they had eventually, the workers in the DuPont factories and how they had to fight for their rights, a lot of them were slaughtered a little bit during history because of their injustice 'cause it wasn't Americans, now, it was owned by family--and how they had to release their control so that the people came, and now it's a different town.  That's history.  But I have a personal experience so I--every time I see the name DuPont I can say, "Oh what's going on--look at the progress this town has made."  The same with the Lorillard, Winston-Salem, South Carolina [North Carolina], look at the progress this town has made.  Now they're against cigarettes, what happened to the society?  How did it affect the people?  All of that, some wonderful stories that always, should have been on our screen.  We've done all those things with Sissy Spacek about those particular things about the river rising and all that stuff.  We have stories, so many stories to tell.  But thank God I'm part of that history, of being there firsthand to know about the changing of the color line, the Mason-Dixon Line, I was alive.  I was alive for Jackie Robinson.  I was alive for Roy Campanella, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Ralph Bunche.  So in retrospect, that's very chosen to have me--my feet in all those generations and still be here to talk to you today.
Speaker 2: And you were like a--
Speaker 1: It's incredible.
Story_ID: 111368
Speaker 1: As an early black performer in television, you know, I think before--now what was the first? You made a lot of television shows, and you were saying that you were in everything from the 'Philco Playhouse [The Philco Television Playhouse],' 'Omnibus,' and we talked about 'You Are There,' 'Judd for the Defense,' all these different--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --TV shows, early TV shows.  But what kind of roles did you get?  I mean were they like--?
Speaker 2: Early New York television was pretty good roles.  I played anything from a gangster to a soldier to a--pretty, pretty nice roles.  Then when television was moved from New York to California, and we had to shuttle back and forth, the first role I was offered, this is probably the next thing in time I should talk about, this is 1960s.  Now I'm on Broadway with the late Menasha Skulnik, this is after 'Golden Boy' with Sammy Davis, Jr.  But now I'm on Broadway--and we're talking about film now, if you want, then we'll go back to the other stories, if you'd like.  We're going, propelling our planes, going from New York to California and I'm--
Speaker 1: Pan Am [Pan American World Airways] to TWA [Trans World Airlines] and all that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I'm--what a noisy sound.  My ears, the air--the pressure was not as good as, so I had terrible ear problems.  But here we are with contemporaries, [Marlon] Brando and [Anthony] Quinn, doing the shuttle from New York, doing as much episodic television as we can and coming back and trying to do some theater, that was the system.  And we were the core actors that they needed for California early on, Steve McQueen, etc.  So my agency, the great William Morris Agency [WMA] made a deal with Universal [Universal Studios, Universal Pictures] before they did the first movie of the week in '65 [1965] or '66 [1966] was a thing called 'Companions in Nightmare,' and it was casted by New York actors, New York casting people, and in it was Gig Young, Melvyn Douglas, Anne Baxter, Dana Wynter, Patrick O'Neal, William Redfield, the top of the line, and myself.  The part was the chief of police, trying to find out who did these murders, right?  So they got me on a plane with these great actors, I'm overwhelmed. And here I am at Universal Studios, car picked me up at the airport, and I'm put at The Beverly Hills Hotel and I'm treated like a king--I don't know what to do.  Wow, I'm the first African American in the Beverly Hills Hotel, right?  Prime rib, what else can they do? Charlotte Russe, I'm eating strawberry shortcake.  So my stomach's out to here, I better go for a walk.  So it's 9:30 at night, and I go for a walk.  All these movie stars' homes, here comes the police.  They said, "What are you doing out here?" I said, "I live at the Beverly Hills Hotel." "Yeah right." "Right?  I--go check." "We'll check, but first of all here's what we're going to do--" and they handcuff me to a tree on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Coldwater Canyon boulevard [Avenue] for twenty-five minutes so they could check me out, to teach me that you do not walk in Beverly Hills after 9 o'clock without some reason.  And they came back and said, "We're sorry, we're going to let you go now, but don't let us catch you here after 9 o'clock." And then of course Universal and William Morris complained, and they gave me an apology. But not that--I still was handcuffed to a tree for almost a half-hour.  In that hotel was also Sidney Poitier, first time there, and I think Eartha Kitt finally came in after that, and then more people came.  But I was one of the first. The first 'Companions in Nightmare,' and you can get that on tape, as the chief of police--and I had to scream at Melvyn Douglas.  And the director said, "Scream at him."  I said, "Yeah, but that's Melvin Douglas." (Laughs) Melvin Douglas says, "Louie, Louie, scream at me, all right?"  So I had to scream at him.  It's on record somewhere that called 'Companion...' the first movie-of-the-week for Universal.  But there was a bitter and sweet story about that experience.
Speaker 1: That's something, wow.
Speaker 2: See the dichotomy, the New York influence?
Speaker 1: Now you did other movies of the week after that right?
Speaker 2: After that I did quite a few but that was the first one they ever did called 'Companions in Nightmare,'--Dana Wynter and all those particular people.
Story_ID: 111369
Speaker 1: Now is there a story around your first major movie role?
Speaker 2: First major movie role.  First movie was an African movie, I was in Africa. But the first major movie was 'The Landlord,' and 'The Landlord' was directed by the late Hal Ashby, and Hal Ashby won an Oscar for the editing of 'In Heat of the Night,' produced by Norman Jewison.  So Hal Ashby was directing 'The Landlord.'  And in 'The Landlord' was Lee Grant, Pearl Bailey, Beau Bridges, the late Diana Sands, playing my wife--and we did it in New York, that was a major, major movie. We had a great time doing that.  I play a man who was a little on the borderline--a great movie, great book--what about, you remember the scene with Lee Grant and Pearl Bailey and the ham hocks and the purse? Great movie, great movie.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw that, and I forgot I saw that one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I did see that, yeah.  Diana Sands--
Speaker 2: Diana Sands, that was my girlfriend at the time, Diana Sands, kept me from having to go up to New Rochelle [New York] (laughter). But we had a good time, me and Diana, I loved that woman, what a great, great actress, great person--whoa, what a woman she was.  So 'The Landlord' was the first major movie, and I know Norman Jewison again today, another one of those people from that time.  We came--
Speaker 1: From that area of Brooklyn?
Speaker 2: That area, another one of those people.  He's Canadian, though, but the same people, the same mindset.
Story_ID: 111370
Speaker 1: Somewhere along that line I segued from theater, because it belonged--the theater, Broadway belonged to the British, there were separate tables, there was 'Becket,' 'Hamlet,' 'My Fair Lady.'  All the theaters were taken over, so we were forced to either subsist by television or off Broadway--off Broadway you can get paid anywhere from $45.00 a week to $75.00 a week.  And Jean Genet's 'The Blacks' came, now we're talking about '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: Now this is a Negro Ensemble Company?
Speaker 1: This is before the Negro Ensemble.
Speaker 2: It was before that? Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, same theater, same complex, way before the Negro Ensemble.  And now 'The Blacks,' we were rehearsing 'The Blacks' at a place called the Yon--no, not the (unclear) the Provincetown Playhouse basement, which is a church upstairs, it was turned into a theater.  In 'The Blacks', James Earl Jones, Cicely Tyson, Godfrey Cambridge,  [HM] Maya Angelou, myself, the late Charles Gordone, Lonne Elder, III, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, [Remus] Lex Monson, and Raymond St. Jacques [James Arthur Johnson]. That was the original cast.
Speaker 2: Now when I--I saw a copy of, I bought a copy of that, it's 1968, and I was reading the cast list.
Speaker 1: '61 [1961], '65 [1965], yeah.
Speaker 2: And I was reading the cast list, and when I read the cast list, I wondered, did they all know that they were famous, (laughs), when they were in it?
Speaker 1: No.  No, we saw--
Speaker 2: I mean even if--and they all--how did they feel, you know?
Speaker 1: The most famous person in there was Abbey Lincoln [Anna Marie Wooldridge], Mrs. Max Roach, who opened it but then she left--(unclear)
Speaker 2: (Unclear), yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unlear)
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But the most famous person was her.
Speaker 2: I want to say all these people--
Speaker 1: Cicely Tyson--
Speaker 2: --that I've heard about in '68 [1968], I said, "Did they all know they were that they were that special then?"
Speaker 1: We knew we were special though, we knew we had something going.  [HM] Roscoe Lee Browne, I forgot him.  We knew we were special because that lasted five-and-a-half years, and people came from around the world to keep us going.  It was a French writer, and then the people replaced was Billy Dee Williams and Lincoln Kilpatrick, and everybody who you could think of came from that caucus of people, it's incredible, incredible.  So we'd go away and do something, come back and play another part, going home.  And from there came the Negro Ensemble afterwards.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: The same place, the same physical place.  But we started it, that was home.  A credible, creative era but it was also the era of the Vietnam War, the era of folk music. And underneath where we were rehearsing--we were at a play called the Cafe Wha?, and I went downstairs during my lunch break, and they're singing gospel songs and folk slave songs, and they're passing this (unclear) basket with twenty and fifty dollar bills up in there.  I said well, now, wait a minute, I used to play--we used to sing against Ray Charles at the Brooklyn Paramount.  How about this one, sweet hour of prayer- Boom. Slave songs. Gon knock Johnny Booker to the low ground, Tu-da darlln' day, Hey. Money.  I said wait a minute, flag on the play, hold on. So I got me a guitar and learned me three chords, that's three-thousand songs--I knew the music.  So to make a long story short, I ran that hootenanny for two summers, solid summers. My partner, Paul Stookey-Noel Stookey [sic, Noel Paul Stookey] which is Peter-Paul-and-Mary Paul [sic, Peter Paul and Mary].  And through those stages was Bob Zimmerman, Bob Dylan; Cass Elliot, the Mamas and the Papas, John Phillips; John Sebastian, Jr.; Jimi Hendrix too--
Speaker 2: This is Hendrix before he became--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, his music was too loud, I had to take him off the stage--"Get off the stage, too loud, freaky look--Get out." (Laughs) So he found his place in a cafe basement, and he got his self together, and Jimi Hendrix was resurrected in the Cafe Au Go Go in 1962?  Something like that--and then summer of 1962, boom. My partner then was Felix Pappalardi, Jr. And Felix Pappalardi, Jr. and I, and John Sebastian and the late Fred Neil, we all formed a group that opened for the Four Freshmen, in a college, folk thing, and it came to a crossroads when I was offered an acting job, and it was 'The Blood Knot,' that James Earl Jones had finished about two half-brothers in South Africa, followed by an offer for a television series.  So now we're into 1967.
Story_ID: 111371
Speaker 1: Now I want to go back to something you said before--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --that I didn't follow up on.  But you said the first movie you were in was about an African--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The first movie was called 'The Bushbaby,' British, Canadian-British director by the name of John Trent, T-R-E-N-T.
Speaker 1: John Trent, who subsequently died in an automobile accident. And it's about the son of a man in East Africa who was the houseboy for the family that ran the game reserve.  And in place now is the transition from the British control to the independent African government.  Now the house boy now turns into a game warden, right, that's what the heir apparent is.  But there was a transition there called the con--the--not construction, the--I'll think of the name.  They made the transition difficult.  The obstructionists, they were called. So they made the transition from--the transition of government from British to African, in the middle were the Indians and the Dutch, they made it difficult to show that it was not going to work.  So during that period, when that game warden, the British game warden, was sent back home to England-- where he really didn't belong, he belonged in Africa--and his daughter, she has a pet called the bush baby, it's a galago, looks like a combination of a monkey and a squirrel, and they won't accept that animal in England.  So she gets off the boat to let the animal go, and the boat sails away. Now the obstructionists think that I've kidnapped her, so there's a race between the father coming back from the boat to say that I'm not the bad guy, and the police chasing me as the bad guy, and the rain season.  So the movie was about us running from Dar es Salaam [Tanzania] all the way up to Lake Manyara in the Ngorongoro Crater, with the animals.  Gorgeous movie, learned a great deal about Africa at the time.
Speaker 2: Did you shoot it on location?
Speaker 1: On location, in Kenya and Tanzania.
Speaker 2: That was at--was that your first trip to Africa?
Speaker 1: First trip to Africa.
Speaker 2: Guess it would be.
Speaker 1: First trip to Africa.
Speaker 2: (brief pause)
Speaker 1: We were at Africa, first movie in Africa called 'The Bushbaby'.
Speaker 2: You were in Kenya in 1964.
Speaker 1: I was in (laughs)--here's a little story about Kenya.  Kenyatta in Power.
Speaker 2: Jomo Kenyatta [first president of Kenya].
Speaker 1: Jomo Kenyatta, great African gorgeous rose, very regal man, worldwide fame, and his wife [Ngina Kenyatta, Mama Ngina].  And I had just done 'The Nurses,' one of those shows I told you about in New York, and now national television is in Kenya and Tanzania.  So I show up in Nairobi, to the Nairobi Hilton [Hilton Hairobi], and the guy is sweeping the floor, black guy, and he looks at me and just, "Oh my god, he's here. They had just seen 'The Nurses'--'cause they took all of the stuff, wherever there was a black guy, that was on television including, 'I Love Lucy,' 'The Honeymooners.'  And so now--this is the power of television, early television.  Screen ain't no bigger than this, everybody's watching television, watching the World Series, they're watching basketball and stuff.  And I'm a big star now in Nairobi.  But the other big star was Lucille Ball, and she had the crinolines.  So there's a poster of Jomo Kenyatta and his wife in crinolines--the shoes could not fit--and a hairpiece like Lucy.  That's the incredible impression of American television--when she looked best, really, in her natural place, with the ceremonial gowns, but that's how powerful, even then, that screen was. They made her get off of those outfits to go back to her ceremonial robes and stuff where she looked like a queen but--
Speaker 2: She wanted to look like Lucy.
Speaker 1: She wanted to look like Lucy. And she had ambitions like Lucy had--she wanted to do the housekeeping and do the little budgets and steal the money from her husband and do the whole thing that housekeepers like Lucy did.  They all replicated Lucy, That's how impressionable that early television was.  And there was Jerry Lewis then, and there was Milton Berle [Milton Berlinger], that's what I saw in Kenya.  And they started to change their outfits to match what they saw on the screens, the statesmen, that's how impressionable--
Story_ID: 111372
Speaker 1: How did you feel at that time and how did you feel in retrospect about that first trip to Africa?
Speaker 2: The educational system was overwhelming, put--and today, I'm still so curious, because what I heard about Africa was not so delicious, about the natives and the primitive--there was nothing primitive about what I saw. The number one citizen was Tarzan, the word 'bwana' was to make me feel bad. 'Bwana' means sir, it means mister.  So I learned firsthand about the Kikuyu, it's right after the Mau Mau thing [Mau Mau Uprising]. I learned about the Maasai--What a proud people.  I learned about the Makonde, which the black Oscar, family tree, and I got to, in fact, to play one of them--once again, the Actors Studio application of a character you play in the background took place, and I learned about the Kikuyu and the Makonde.  The Makonde tribe were the predecessors of the serap--the therapists and the doctors, because the tribe, they took the ebony tree, and you came with a problem or solution--I need to get a man, I need to get rid of this disease, I need to get rid of this thought process--and they--you talked to the witch doctor, and the witch doctor would dictate to the carvers what to carve, and you took that carving and you put it outside in front of your house, and the spirits would go into that carving and you'd be free.  For centuries, the Makondes had that job.  Now you're talking about that civiliza--now you're getting an idea, firsthand, about how that civilization worked, so that when man came and saw that, he cut it.  We need to reconnect.  That's mystery, that we need in order to survive, continues on.  It's spiritual, it's traditional, American Indians have the same thing, Jews have the same thing, Asians have the same thing.  Ours was interrupted, we need to reconnect all of that stuff.  So I learned, playing an African, what an African was. So I portrayed--it's called 'The Bushbaby,' the bush baby is an animal.  I learned about the history of the transition, why it's so difficult to go from the colonies, from the British colonies, to independence, there were the obstructionists who didn't want that to work, an example of the obstructionists was the problem between the Nigerians and the Biafrans [Nigerian Civil War].  When they left, they put the guns in the hands of the warriors who, for centuries, wanted to destroy the intelligent Biafrans because they ran things.  So the gave the guns to the warriors, the Igbos. And what did they do? Genocide. They knew what was going to happen.  But before it was only bows and arrows and knives, so every seven years they'd do it, but with guns and bombs and planes? Genocide.  You can replicate that story across the entire continent, the destruction of the history of the message. All of those tribes cooperated, at the head of the Nile, every ten years, in peace--if you needed a knife, you'd go to this tribe and get your knife, if you needed to learn about farming, you go to this tribe, if you need about animal husbandry-- and they met, the alchemy, the medicine, you're in the marketplace.  And they go back in the Nile and go back home with that information.  No money was exchanged--ideas and thoughts, money came in the picture that changed things, the dollar.  Today we are going after the dollar as opposed to what we have to offer the world, it's been changed--The dollar is the one most important thing.  That civilization was in place, and highly evolved, and our children know nothing about it, some of our grown-ups don't know anything about it. But it's in place in our system still, because we survived, and it's a miracle that in less than four hundred years, we--look at where we are one more time.  It's a statement.
Story_ID: 111941
Speaker 1: So 'The Landlord' was the first like major film then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes it was.
Speaker 1: That was fairly--that was a critical success, it seems to me, if I remember, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes it was, it was a great critical success.  They made it a good (unclear).  It was the--Hal Ashby, it was his second movie, his first movie was 'Harold and Maude,' I believe, or maybe it was afterwards, I can't remember.  But as a result of him winning an Academy Award for the editing of Heat of the Night, he got that--I forgot to mention Rod Steiger [Rodney Stephen Steiger], another one from that era.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The next big one was 'Skin Game' I think.
Speaker 2: Ha-ha. Now 'Skin Game', 1971. Coming to California, I did some theater, another one of those particular kind of people coming out of New York was the producer of 'Skin Game' and the agent for James Garner, Meta, M-E-T-A Rosenberg.  Her history would be similar to my New York history, she was the agent and then producer.  She saw me do a theater piece playing--and I won the Drama Critic Circle Award in Los Angeles [California] playing Patrice Lumumba.
Speaker 1: Oh, now did you?  I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And playing Patrice Lumumba, and the story about the Congo, at the Mark Taper Forum.
Speaker 1: Now tell me, are you aware there's another project where they use Patrice Lumumba as a model.  So--and they called it 'Black Jesus.'
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: The Italians did it, and it starred Woody Strode.
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And they did another one since then, which was a factual--
Speaker 1: That was a-what was the name of the one that you were in?
Speaker 2: Called 'Murderous Angels.'  It was written by a man who worked at the United Nations who was involved in that whole Congolese crisis, an Irishman by the name of Conor, C-O-N-O-R Cruise, C-R-U-I-S-E O'Brien.  He was one of the people behind Dag Hammarskjold [Dag Hjalmar Agne Carl Hammarskjold] at the United Nations.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was from Ireland, but he was put unto that project.  See--
Speaker 1: Many people believe Dag Hammarskjold was murdered, you know, deliberately--
Speaker 2: Both of them were, because they were going to be successful in bringing peace to the Congo, but it was not economically, financially and powerful necessity--it was not economically, politically beneficial to certain people for there to be peace in the Congo.
Speaker 1: United States, the Belgian, the French, the--you could go on and on.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, right.  And they were going in the wrong direction, quote unquote, underline wrong direction.  They would--those two, in learning, in the--
Speaker 1: (brief pause)
Speaker 2: Those two men of history were prevented from being together, they were together at the United Nations when Lumumba spoke at the United Nations, but when they both had correspondence and agreed to meet, a plane was stopped over in Katonga [Uganda], and Lumumba was sent--stopped somewhere else.  They never got together again--had they gotten together again, it would have been a different story in the Congo.  Before Lumumba could get to Hammarskjold, he was dead.  Before Hammarskjold could get to Lumumba, he was dead.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a friend of mine that remembered--was there at the time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who said that she heard the news of Dag Hammarskjold's plane crash before the plane actually crashed.
Speaker 2: Abso--yeah.
Speaker 1: There was some sort of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so you know that was pre-prepared. Now we talked earlier about how people were killed and killed and dismembered, their arms and their bodies and stuff.  The power and spirit of Lumumba was so strong that he was killed, thrown into a pit, and they put lye on him, and on top of the lye, they burned him and they covered him up, they uncovered him, and they killed him again.  That's how strong his power and spirit was. They made sure that he never came back.  That's fear, that's a deep, deep fear that even though they did all of that--so that's symbolic of the African culture, so-called voodoo, magic, whatever it is, that the spirit of a man is so strong that the body does one thing, but traditional spirit that goes from one generation to another, that made us free from slaves and made us survive so quickly in America, is the strongest, one of the strongest connections, spiritual connections, on the planet.
Speaker 1: And we still are--
Speaker 2: We still don't know it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Raoul Peck just did a movie on Lumumba--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There's the play by Aime Cesaire, 'A Season In the Congo.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: They still can't kill him, really.
Speaker 2: They still can't kill him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Nor can you kill Malcolm [X], nor can you kill Mike -- Martin Luther [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] or [Mahatma] Gandhi or [Nelson] Mandela.  It's imposs--let's stop trying because there's nothing bad about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let's stop trying--let's enhance that.
Story_ID: 111942
Speaker 1: So 'Skin Game' is an interesting movie.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You played a slave in this movie who was--
Speaker 2: He wasn't a slave.
Speaker 1: Okay, I guess he wasn't, actually.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he wasn't a slave.  It was two con men from the North--Jimmy was a con man, doing all of his card games and stuff, and I was a con man, I was a fast talker. And we got together, and we were conning one another--very dynamite friendship which still exists today, by the way.  And they went down to the South to take advantage of the slave market, and we were making a fortune, a fortune, and we got caught.
Speaker 1: People don't realize a slave--
Speaker 2: Way before his time.
Speaker 1: --a slave, a male slave in the prime of life is worth as much as a car is.
Speaker 2: It's like a resource today, like a resource today, that's property.  That's property, It's an industry, it was an industry. And they paid attention to their slaves like you pay attention to your dogs--that's not a bad thing, hat was a good thing.  They made us the best to get the best out of us, and it was a business.
Speaker 1: Now this is a western-type movie, but the next movie I think that you made that was a big movie was 'Travels With My Aunt,' with Maggie Smith.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Sir Alec McCowen and Dame Maggie Smith and Sir Robert Stephens, and that started in North Africa and went into Spain and Paris and London.  I had learned--I was chosen out of that by people 'cause they knew I could play all kinds of different accents, once again, it was the last film done by the late George Cukor, C-U-K-O-R, who was responsible for Greta Garbo, Tallulah Bankhead, Elizabeth Taylor, top divas.
Speaker 1: And I think anyone that saw you in this--now I did see it way back when--saw you do a number of accents, as you say, and really, and be convincing in a number of different roles--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in this movie.  And it's--
Speaker 2: It was a wonderful experience.  Once again, the good fortune to having traveled, to learn the people--and I have a thing, you know, that I could copy people, I could take their accents sand their behavior pattern and understand deeply how they came to be that. So that's a God's gift, I guess.
Speaker 1: Well black actors rarely get that chance in Hollywood to--
Speaker 2: Hardly ever, except for maybe--
Speaker 1: --play anything but a servant or something.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And you played like a--you know all these different characters in the movies.
Speaker 2: But then again there were those Brock Peters and Roscoe Lee Jones and the [HM] Roscoe Lee Browne's and the Raymond St. Jacques who did, and I followed them, you know?  I had that good fortune--and we wound up in London, and I lived there for a while because they wanted me to join The Old Vic Company to do 'Othello,' etc.  The only reason why I couldn't--it was very funny, 'cause in retrospect--is the African and Jamaican actors were not working, and they objected to any American actors coming in to take their work.  But the strange thing about that is that they had African and Jamaican accents, you had to have a specific way of speaking without an accent in order to do [William] Shakespeare, and they did not.  So there were a little jealousy there for us--for them not to allow me to work with Maggie Smith and the Old Vic with Robert Stephens doing 'Othello' and 'the Prince of Morocco' and all those particular things. But they couldn't either, they couldn't speak properly with the King's English.  So it was very funny. But I was there for a specific reason, and I left because my mom [Hellen Rebecca Wray Gossett] was dying, so I came back to New York.  But it was very strange not to be prepared to do the work that somebody else got because you couldn't speak properly--but God gave me that ability to speak properly, and to do Shakespeare back in New York, and then wherever I could, and to be able to play different languages.  And it started back in 'Take a Giant Step,' when I had to get rid of a Brooklyn-Jewish accent.
Story_ID: 111943
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you said back in those days too you had a--your teeth were, something was wrong with your teeth, too.
Speaker 2: Okay. (laughter) Talking about, I had a big gap in my teeth, and I got that gap in my teeth by the effects of television.  How did that happen?  Superman [The Adventures of Superman].  I was so much of a fan of Batman and Robin and Superman, and Captain Marvel, that I took my mother's bath towel, wrapped it around my neck, and said, "Up, up and away."  And I landed on my face.
Speaker 1: Now it's--this is a story that's told in most families of someone who tried this.
Speaker 2: I had to try it, I believed so much that I could do that. And I got a rude awakening and wound up, my teeth grew this way.  So when I entered show business, they had to do dental work to make sure that that gap wasn't so big.  So it's small now, but it used to be very wide.
Speaker 1: Well the story you tell though--
Speaker 2: But on Cinerama boy, in CinemaScope, boy? Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's such a common story, it happened to so many people.  And once again, it's the power of the movies, right?
Speaker 2: Oh it's a powerful, powerful media.  So you imagine being that age, say fifteen, twenty years ago, and now, kids looking at that screen--they don't see themselves, they don't see their history.  "Wow, let's call--let's create another culture, hip hop," and now they're successful.  "Let's go sell some crack, We can have our own little thing going on, later for you."  Now they got millions of dollars stashed in some warehouse somewhere, What can you tell them?  But you can't blame them for being that way cause they didn't think that they belonged, had they thought they belonged they wouldn't have had to do that.  But they're being blamed on the outset, and what you have to do is go back to the roots of the problem and put in place those things that keep them from doing that.  So let them get pride--probably now what they can do today is take some of that money and buy some of their own properties and make it their neighborhood.  Who's going to do that in their neighborhood?  Nobody.  But you have to reinstall something that's been missing, who they really and where they really come from.
Story_ID: 111944
Speaker 1: I don't know if we should skip over some of these.  We probably can't cover all of them but--
Speaker 2: We can do another session.
Speaker 1: 'J.D.'s Revenge'.
Speaker 2: 'J.D.'s Revenge', way ahead of its time.
Speaker 1: We're at '76 [1976]--now this is interesting, 'cause this be under the first--was this the first, like, all-black cast movie that you--
Speaker 2: Pretty close, it was the first all-black cast since the black exploitation, of relevance.  I forgot the director's name, but he was way ahead of his time--early Glynn Turman, who was in the original 'A Raisin in the Sun,' on Broadway--had to do with New Orleans and voodoo and history and spirits and church, way, way ahead of its time.  Out of that cast, people were chosen to do other movies, including myself.  I never did a black exploitation movie 'cause I didn't like them, had no--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'J.D.'s Revenge' was a different kind of--
Speaker 2: Was a different-if, had that been replicated, we would have gone on a search with--but not enough people saw that.  Then, back in that same era, not in that same era but in the same time slot, was a movie that a lot of people never saw, it was called 'The Gathering of Old Men,' Hines I believe his name was, Chester Hines.
Speaker 1: No, it's Gaines, Ernest Gaines.
Speaker 2: Ernest Gaines, Ernest Gaines, Ernest Gaines.  And same era, same power of those old men finally saying enough, way before the deacons of defense.  And out of there came Will Patton, great actor, and of course--what's her name that got nominated for an Oscar later on was--
Speaker 1: Not Beah Richards?
Speaker 2: No, white actress.
Speaker 1: White?
Speaker 2: You know who I'm talking about, Satie?
Speaker 1: Holly Hunter?
Speaker 2: Holly Hunter.  Richard Widmark was in it, great man Richard Winmark.  And of course, all those other people, Sandman [Howard Sims], Tiger [Haynes] from Tiger, all those people.  I was the youngest playing the oldest, another very special, very special movie.
Speaker 1: That's something.  Now you're awful humble, but you've been able to do that for a long time as a young man play an old man.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played Fiddler in 'Roots' and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're just--and you're pretty convincing.
Speaker 2: --got to be the youngest actor playing an older character.  That comes out of grandpa, grandma, them people raised me, I got their stuff.  That's what 'Roots' was about, and that's what those characters are about.  That's a direct copy from my grandparents who raised me.
Story_ID: 111945
Speaker 1: Tell us about the 'Roots' project and when you first heard about it.  I know Alex Haley for years was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --on a speaking circuit talking about it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: About the book, before the book came out and the movie came out.
Speaker 2: Well, when they started to do 'Roots' and I was approached, I wanted to play Kunta Kinte, I wanted to play one of those characters.  And the only thing that was offered to me was the uncle Tom, quote unquote.  I said I can't be playing no uncle Tom, until I did some research, He was not an uncle Tom. He was the first American African who knew how to survive, and in order to keep this boy alive, he had to teach him those tricks to stay alive, it's a different character.  And then I started to fall in love with Fiddler, and realize who he really was. Then during the time when Kunta Kinte was whipped, Alex Haley wrote everything except the last line, which came out of me probably through emotion. And after he was whipped, because he needed, he said--Vic Morrow [Ames] said, "Your name is Toby," and he said, "No my name is Kunta Kinte." And then finally he said, "Okay, my name is Kunta Kinte [sic, Toby]." I came and took him off the--untied him, and I said, "It doesn't matter what they call you, Toby, Kunta is your real name.  You hear me? Kunta is your real name."  Then I said, emotionally--we only did it in one take--"There's gonna be a better day, you hear me?  There's going to be a better day."  That was my line, for some--I don't know where it came from, and they kept it in the script.  And Alex talks about it, used to talk about that, on his tour, I don't know where it came from, but it was that personal.  Probably, I think it came from my great-grandmother who told me, "There's gonna be a better day," you know?  And there is going to be a better day, it's already happening.
Speaker 1: There's a line in Dianne Reeves' song, 'Grandma's Hands' ['Better Days'], "It's gonna be a better day."
Speaker 2: Yeah, "It's gonna be a better day, don't you worry about it, you just keep on doing your thing."  There is going to be a better day.  So now I've got two [favorite quotes].  "There's no such thing as impossible" and "there's going to be a better day."
Speaker 1: Now the impact of 'Roots' I mean this was the first--this was another story about the impact of film.  Never before had this--a story of slavery been shown in this manner of--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --of television from the point of view of the black people that were enslaved.  We were always like in somebody else's story dancing in the background and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --running, whatever it is, serving somebody.
Speaker 2: For a purpose, yeah.
Speaker 1: But not--here's a story where we weren't the backdrop for somebody else's story.
Speaker 2: No, we were the main.  We were the main.
Speaker 1: It was about us, right.  And so the community--
Speaker 2: There were some--
Speaker 1: --had this emotional reaction to it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very emotional, all of -- the world, obviously, and once again, it's the healing truth.  And the healing truth--some of the kids got angry and went to school and had fights and stuff, that's not the way.  The way is to take the information, and by example, help lead.  Now that I know who I am let's us do this together, it's the necessary way, there's the next step.  But 'Roots' is that way, but the other information, in those Shamba Centers that I spoke about, it's got to be--there's roots on all subjects.  We have to fill the gap, it's an empty barrel right now. Especially those kids who are so angry, they've already made their point--you can go to Israel and see a guy with his hat over here talking about, "What's up?"  He don't know how powerful he is, that kid who's still shooting one another, he doesn't know, he must be told.  I don't know how much of a success we can do for that generation, but the next generation, that could be seventy-five percent.  But they must be told about themselves.  It's extremely important.
Story_ID: 111946
Speaker 1: Did you expect, when you were involved in the 'Roots' film, that was in '76 [1976], '77 [1977] when it's filmed, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense that it was as important as it was?
Speaker 2: None of us had a sense.  We knew it was important to us, that's why we put so much of ourselves in it. But the original reason for 'Roots' to be done was they had made a deal--with the great David Wolper --to put it on, and they said, "Well, we don't know if the South is going to buy it, but we have to put it on something, I'll tell you what we're going to do, Let's put it on one day at a time--Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday--and we'll be finished with it."  They had no idea that all of the country stopped to watch it every day, it was a way of life.  And they said, "Oh we knew it all along." (laughter)  That's not what happened but that was magic, you know, the same thing that happened with 'An Officer and a Gentleman.' Richard Gere had his final commitment on a contract, they sent him up to Port Townsend--Taylor Hackford won an Oscar for a documentary, "Let's send him up there and do this thing--we knew it all along." It was not the case. We just did this labor of love.  So we never know in this business what's going to make it and what's not, we just to put all of ourselves into every project, and let the audience make that decision.  'Lackawanna Blues,' they didn't know what to do with that, boom. 'Ray'? Whoa, you know?  So it's an indication that maybe an audience is kind of hungry and thirsty to see these stories and know the story, just for the information and the entertainment, you know?  So I think this is the best times, I think the better day is here now for that.
Speaker 1: Yeah so much of Hollywood movies are like formulaic, you can almost--when you see the first part you know--
Speaker 2: Well, there are a lot of re-runs. The same story, again and again and again.
Speaker 1: But like you said, when you went to get the towel, "I knew the rest of the story." (laughter)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: You said, "I saw Superman," and you said guess, uh-oh.  I knew what was--
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: "--I know, I know the rest of it."
Speaker 2: You knew I was going to try and fly, you know?
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And so many movies you see you know what's going to happen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you're saying that people really want something.
Speaker 2: Oh they're hungry, everybody, everybody.  So that job of, for obvious reasons of control, that absence of, that instant thing to take another mentality--which is why Hollywood was created, for us to be one nation against Hitler through the movies--it worked. Different story now, have to have the media for a different reason now, we need to put people together now. We need to get rid of the reasons before, for the control, We have to get rid of all of that and replace it with one nation under God, indivisible.  We need that now in order to survive as a country, we're getting a bad reputation around the world.  We need one another today.  That was then.  This is now.  We desperately need one another in order to survive.  We can't do without it.
Story_ID: 111947
Speaker 1: Okay 'An Officer and a Gentleman'.  Now this not--this is in the '80s [1980s] now right, we're talking?
Speaker 2: Yeah, now '80s [1980s], yeah this is the '80s [1980s] now.  Once again me and my agent, one of those guys from Brooklyn, God rest his soul, Ed Bondy, we started in television.  "Why do we always have to play these black villains?  Why--I'm going for the district attorney."  So I did 'Petrocelli,' I played the district attorney, first time, played school teachers. And then here comes a movie, Not one African American actor went up for that part.  And he [Bondy] said, "What are you talk--this is the Marine DI [Drill Instructor], two-thirds of the Marine DIs [drill instructors] are black.  Go on out there and do it, and I'm going to call them and tell them you're coming."  So I walked into a casting place, all white actors, into the room, opened the door and Taylor Hackford said, "You got the job."  That's all it took, half of racism and segregation was in here. The other half is real, the other half is not.
Speaker 1: So that's not a part--just for the sake of those who are watching this--this is not a part that was written for a black--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --man necessarily.
Speaker 2: It was just written.
Speaker 1: It was written as a part.
Speaker 2: Right.  So then when I went down to the MCR [Marine Corps Recruit Training] recruitment division where they train the DI, two-thirds of those guys were black.  But still that old habit lives in both of our minds, to keep us from getting together, 50 percent is white and 50 percent is black.  We have to get rid of both of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you--coming from an Actors Studio and all that, I guess you, you really--did you really study these marine sergeants?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went away for a week, for a month, to MCRD [Marine Corps Recruit Depot] in San Diego [California] next to Camp Pendleton, the DI school--an old good friend of mine, I want to do his story, his name is Richard D-A-W-E-R, Dawer.  His story is a monster, I want to do his movie.
Speaker 1: Now is he a marine sergeant?
Speaker 2: He was the head of the DI school, in charge.  So I used him as a role model, and they put me through the thirty days of the training, that was what it would take, and I did everything but smoke the Camels and drink the beer.  But I did the iron man course, I did the running.  I did the--all those lines, "Don't drive on me." all that came from there.  I brought those dialogues into the movie, and because I was so popular amongst my contemporaries, the director, Taylor Hackford, made me move twenty miles away so I couldn't see anybody.  So when I showed up, I was the Marine DI every time they saw me, I was nuts. "How come you don't hang out?" "Don't you talk to me like that." I had to do that in order for them to believe who I was.  And then at the end we all had a big party, you know (laughter)-"Oh, so that's what you was doing." you know?  But--
Speaker 1: So you really stayed in character for the whole thing?
Speaker 2: Every time I was around them, yeah.  And at home I could hang out--Richard Gere stayed in the same complex, and so did Debra Winger, but we stayed away.  That application, that Actors Studio application, worked. I want to do Richard Dawer's story because it's an amazing story, how he saved people in Vietnam, great man.  Finally maybe the doors will open for those stories, finally.  But now let's come to this particular thing. The African American dollar, upwards of 80 billion, is bigger than the economy of Spain, but it does not come back to the African neighborhood. By example, Magic Johnson has invested in--he's the number-one Starbuck's owner in North America.  He takes those neighborhoods, in the neighborhood where it was--the crisis neighborhood--and makes it a highly upwardly mobile thing.  By example, we have to do the same.  So we can do our own movies now, but we have to trust one another, like Magic [Johnson], and do those relevant stories, this Dawer story, the story about--the proper story of the liberator, the prop--the kings of Haiti, the stories that are--the cowboys.  Ah, it's amazing for, just for making money, you see it's worth it, and then the money gets turned back into the neighborhood and investments in the neighborhood, and the movie houses and in the Starbucks and the supermarkets and in the banks, so we give loans and scholarships just like everybody else. And the American dollar cannot be stashed in the mattress, It's got to be circulated.  That's how everybody else does it, and that's what people are waiting for us to do.  We have it in our possession and our power to do it today.  We don't have to worry about a palms up attitude, you owe us.  Get rid of that, we now have the power.  We must do that.  And one of the things to do is to raise the consciousness of those kids and those people to know that we are powerful--we don't have to be angry, we don't have to carry placards anymore, we don't have to demonstrate anymore.  We just have to help ourselves, and get on with it.  And add it to the communal American pot, by example.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We've come a long way.  We have a long way to go.  It's in our ballpark, we just have to do it.
Story_ID: 111948
Speaker 1: Now I want to go back to 'An Officer and a Gentleman,' and this is really significant for a lot of--I mean in terms of the history of our people in the entertainment industry.  You won an Oscar for that, for best supporting actor.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And this was the first time a black person had received an Oscar since--
Speaker 2: Since Sidney Poitier.
Speaker 1: --had--since Sidney Poitier for 'Lilies of the Field,' that was 1964, I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: 1963, '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so--
Speaker 2: What Sidney Poitier had in place when he won the Oscar--which he had it before, 'The Defiant Ones' with the Stanley Kramers and the Tony Curtis' and all those people from back in New York who made it--got him his work, they soon retired.  So when I got my Oscar, I didn't have that support system in place, so I got no work.  So I was a man with an Oscar without a job.  I was doing television series, second lead, and I still had to live in the mentality which I had.
Speaker 1: Now how did you feel about that, I mean leading up to that Oscar, did you have any idea that you were going to--
Speaker 2: Win?
Speaker 1: --receive an Oscar for--?
Speaker 2: I thought I was just going to be one of the top five, and that was good enough for me.  Because in front of me, the way they sat us in the Oscars, there was James Mason to my left, his last movie he was dying, they got to give that man an Oscar.  But on the other side was Robert Preston, and he was dying, from 'Victor Victoria', they got to give him one.  Then there was John Lithgow, that's a hell of a performance playing a woman.  Then the other guy was the guy that hung himself in 'An Officer and a Gentleman', those were the people. I had no idea.  I was sitting next to my son.  I said, "You gonna go with me if I win the Oscar?"  He said yeah, but when they called my name (laughter), he's with me now.  But I had no idea, I thought I was dreaming--my agent had to hit me and--"They said you."  So I thanked them, and I did that, went and took the Oscar, put it on the shelf, and waited for the phone to ring, and it did not.  And of course all of that thing--that support system from Coney Island, from Broadway, all of that, all the aspirations of [Marlon] Brando and Steve McQueen and all those people came--to win the number-one prize and not get an Oscar broke my heart, and I went on drugs.  As a result, I did not look like I could do movies, but that's the only place I could do more movies, but that's the only place I could supp--what do you do when your dream has stopped?  As the results, I come out of that, because the thing with the Oscar is a purity of heart.  It's a different time today, and God chose for me to stay alive, to be off of drugs and off of that whole mindset, to tell that story to young people who might arbitrarily do it, that they have a bigger, stronger way to live.  It's not the Oscars, it's not the limousines, it's not the money, it's not the gold and the diamonds, it's not the women. But it's inside, whether you win it or not, in order to grow in God's light.  And because of that you get more Oscars and more, more things, and you live a longer time.  And by example, that's what I tell people.

Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Observing is Paul Brock.  Sir, could you please state your name for us?
Speaker 2: Louis Gossett, Jr.
Speaker 1: And today's date is?
Speaker 2: What is today's date, April 26?  No, April 25, my son's birthday.  April 25, 2005.

Speaker 2: We're in Malibu, California in my guest house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 111382
Speaker 1: This is a continuation of an interview we started back in March and we, I think we were just talking about the aftermath of '[An] Officer and a Gentleman'.  And you said it was hard to find work after that?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, after I got the Oscar, you know when you apply yourself all your life and you survive against all odds and you make it, you expect a reward.  And the reward did not come to me.  I didn't get any phone calls for quite a while.  And I did a lot of television cause television is dependent upon consumers so they kind of come to the plate sooner.  And the only place I could celebrate was with those particular people who celebrated and partied.  And I partied a lot and--until I realized that that's not what I was put on this planet to do.  And having down time if you want to call it that like my father used to on Friday and Saturday nights like our forefathers only to come to work on Monday and be responsible is not the way either.  The way is conscious contact with god which is an inside job.  And in order to get that clear conscious contact there are certain things that have to get out of the way like resentments, anger, rage, revenge, stuff like that.  It's not good for an individual.  It's very much like the first Watts Riot [1965] when everybody got angry in Watts [Los Angeles, California] and they started burning their own house down.  It's not a way to go.  So from there to now is a different kind of mindset and as a result all those things I expected from the Oscar are coming to me now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you think, you look back on the way you were raised and coming up, I mean you achieved a lot of success early.  I mean it wasn't without hard work.  But you--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --the play you were in, you were kind of like drafted for that.  You got involved in acting sort of as a--as something that you really weren't focused on doing, it just kind of happened.
Speaker 2: Yeah, kind of happened.
Speaker 1: You know kind of happened kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was for some reason chosen.  So my nickname is the Jackie Robinson of theater and movies.  Not so much Sidney Poitier who was a Bahamian and had a different mindset, but he was my--he opened the door for me.  But a certain kind of living syndrome has to happen with us African Americans who are first to be accepted in society.  Become, we become--if we're not careful we become two people, the one in which you have to behave a certain way in order to make it and the other is the real person who has to--who suffers those slings and arrows in private at home.  In order to not react in those negative ways, while we're working we have to be that front runner because we represent an awful lot of people.  The pressure is like my father on Friday night when you have to let your steam out.  And all of our heroes probably have to have that.  Have had that syndrome in the past, the Jackie Robinsons, the Pearl Baileys, the Satchmo [Louis Armstrong]--all of us.  Ray [Charles]--all of us had to have the double personality in order to make it, open the doors and work.  And be happy, joyous and free when the real thing is that there are some things that were not equal and make us lose our pride.  We had to swallow those for the greater good.  So now today we don't have to do that.  I'm one person today and as a result of that not getting that work as a result of winning an Oscar, that's why I went left until I realized that's not the way to go either.  And I have now contemporaries who are still alive and well that I can share that with.  And it's the only way to go.  My role model today Nelson Mandela.  If there's anybody had a right to come out of jail and say kill everybody, it was him and he did not.  And in examinating--examining why he did is the only way to go for us as a people.
Story_ID: 111383
Speaker 1: Now you--one of the roles that you got close on the heels of '[An] Officer and a Gentleman', this academy award (unclear) was the role of Anwar Sadat on television.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now there's a lot of drama associated with that as I understand.  People who didn't want to see you play a black Egyptian even though he was a black Egyptian.
Speaker 2: Yeah he was a Nuba, that was his descendant, his heritage.  But the person who chose me was his wife Jehan.  She had Omar Sharif who was the number one actor in Egypt.  Dustin Hoffman and couple of other people but she said none of those people could play that.  My father's favorite person, "my father's favorite thing that he saw--my husband's favorite thing that he saw was 'Roots' and then 'Officer and a Gentleman'".  So he had a private collection in his library of all African American product.  That was Anwar Sadat.  I knew that all along.  And he was just more than a pipe smoking leader.  Something was going on there.  And so a lot of the stuff that Jehan chose me for all those reasons.  I had to do service to her and her ex-husband, her late husband.  It was a--but that was television.  Television came to the plate through--just have to because of their consumers.
Speaker 1: Now but how did you feel about some of the negative--did you, were you aware of all the negative letters and so forth about you playing Sadat?
Speaker 2: I was aware of a lot of it but I kind of had tunnel vision by that time.  I was just flattered to play Anwar Sadat.  And it was very funny but both Israel and Egypt boycotted because they said it wasn't true.  But everybody had it in their house.  (Laughter).  Everybody had their own private collection of that movie.
Speaker 1: I was playing basketball last week and somebody yelled across for a brother and they called him, hey Sadat, come on--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I think I know about what time he was born, you know.  But you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --contrary to what some people thought about you playing Sadat, a lot of African Americans were very extremely proud--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that you are playing a world leader, you know.
Speaker 2: Even Israelis and Egyptians privately.  They came to me and says your story was different but we loved the way you play Sadat.  But I had nothing to do with the story I wanted to play Sadat and that was important.
Speaker 1: Did you know him before you--did you ever meet him?
Speaker 2: I shook his hand once.  Also I shook [Nelson] Mandela's hand once and (Unclear) and all those early leaders cause I was at NYU [New York University] and the United Nations was right there.  So I got a chance to shake some very important peoples' hands. But at the time you shake their hand you don't know really who they are.  Now it's retrospect.  Whew, now I know.
Story_ID: 111384
Speaker 1: Okay.  So some of the other, I'm just going to try--I guess we'll just to one, 'Enemy Mine' in 1985 was a science fiction movie that had a lot of racial implications in it.
Speaker 2: Well it was not so much racial but it was.  The earth man, Dennis Quaid, and the man from another planet having a war over some land mines and stuff in the third planet.  Then they get shot down in the fourth planet and they need one another in order to survive.  So they have to drop all of their prejudices, their mutual prejudices in order to survive and in dropping them they become the best of friends.  So it was racism in its best way.  But then again it did not get a shot, maybe because of the subject matter, maybe because somebody else bought 20th Century Fox from someone else, but I don't know.  It should have gotten of a--more attention because finally when it was seen in cable and on DVDs, people went crazy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it got sort of a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --cult following then.
Speaker 2: It got a cult following.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Do they have conventions around, I mean meetings around that movie (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Kind of yeah, especially around Canada and different places.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: All right.  'Iron Eagle' in '86 [1986].  Now this is a movie, you know well as 'Enemy Mine' was.  But 'Iron Eagle' is like the first of six movies I think they did.
Speaker 2: Well it's first of four actually.
Speaker 1: Four okay.
Speaker 2: Three was Iron Eagle, the fourth was Aces which the same character though.  And once again when it was first on it was kind of pulled down and didn't make enough money until it came to the second run and eventually cable and then eventually DVD.  But I don't know what that is.  Maybe we can connect some dots.  But once again more people liked it than I was told.  And more money was made by the particular people who did it than I was told and it was another one like Enemy Mine, Iron Eagle and a couple of others that we'll speak about in the future that were pulled out of front run, first run and a lot of money was made by somebody.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how--now you played a character by the name of Chappy.
Speaker 2: Chappy.
Speaker 1: Was he patterned after Daniel Chappy James?
Speaker 2: Yeah he was, yeah.  So maybe somewhere in the future there is a part off Chappy James himself.  He does need to be--that story needs to be told.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have any thoughts about that part or--?
Speaker 2: Very outstanding man, very knowledgeable, should have been done a long time ago so now it should be done now.  He's a man of history, he had a lot of accomplishments.  Some of his predecessors as far as fliers were concerned were of course the Black Eagle, Colonel Julian and there are more.  So there's a gap to be filled about those stories for myself and others to know.
Story_ID: 111386
Speaker 1: Okay, let's see.  We talked about 'A Gathering of Old Men'.  We talked about that last time.  'The Father Clements Story' in '87 [1987], I believe we might have talked about that last time but I'm not sure if it's on camera or not.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: But let's go over it again, maybe.  But [HM] Father [George] Clements is, you know is quite a legend in Chicago [Illinois].  He lives in [Washington] D.C. now but did this, how was this role brought to you and how--?
Speaker 2: It was brought to--by a mutual friend, Chicago man by the name if Zev Braun and I've worked with Zev Braun before and he's won--
Speaker 1: Is it B-R-A-U-N?
Speaker 2: Z-E-V B-R-A-U-N, yeah.  I think he's out of Chicago and he knew me and he knew Father Clements.  And he figured it would be a match made in heaven and when I met him I knew it and I put on a microphone and he talked about his life and about how he adopted the boys and how he had his trouble with the Catholic churches and how the pope said okay you can have it and now he's--I have a foundation.  He's one of the board of directors of that foundation so we have resurrected our career to an even hopefully higher plane because he's worth it.  A very blessed story.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah that got--that was, I know it was real popular in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know yeah.
Speaker 1: Kind of (unclear).
Speaker 2: It got--it won a lot of rating awards, you know.  But once again they put it on opposite something like the Super Bowl.  But it still got its just desserts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So all these roles are memorable roles, I mean I'm not just saying that cause I'm here but you know, and can't get out.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: But these are, people remember these roles.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: There's a movie called 'The Principal' and I think that like, that predated the one about the guy with the baseball bat, Joe, but it's a similar kind of a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about a principal in a tough situation?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah Joe Carter.  Joe Carter was originally written for me and all of a sudden there was Morgan Freeman doing it but it's okay.  What the Principal was about, it was shot by the way in what used to be Merit College in Oakland [California] and Merit College is where the Black Panthers were born so we're doing the Principal in their--in the confines of Merit College.  It was an already built set so you know the ghosts that ran up and down those halls were the birth of the Black Panthers in Oakland.  It was pretty exciting to do that kind of character with those kind of people especially Jim Belushi and the--some of the people.  And it was a beautiful experience.  It was a very entertaining and educational experience understanding the dynamic of those kids cause a lot of those kids were high school kids.
Story_ID: 111387
Speaker 1: Now let's see, we go up, I guess in 1988 there was a kind of a reprise of 'Roots'.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What did they call it, Roots Revisited?
Speaker 2: Roots Revisited [sic, Roots: The Next Generations].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Myself and LeVar [Burton], we did it again and it still worked.  It still works today.  And you know there was--it was just a reprisal, not the big thing but another way of doing those two characters.  We had a good time.  I think we shot it in Kentucky.
Speaker 1: It was shot in winter right where it was cold, I mean--
Speaker 2: Not so much cold, it was chilly but all that was Hollywood snow.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Well you see it fooled me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hollywood snow.  Didn't fool me cause I've been in winter before.
Story_ID: 111388
Speaker 1: Now you play a lot of mentors it seems to people.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You know to Toby in Roots you're Fiddler.  You know in Iron Eagle you're like a mentor to these fliers and Officer and a Gentleman, you're a mentor to Richard Gere.  You seem to play a lot of mentors, you know.  I don't know, you have any thoughts about that why you're chosen to do mentors?
Speaker 2: Well being mentors, I guess the part that I became famous for, two parts, both in television and film were mentors.  And then there's a mindset as far as people casting you what they have in mind for you to do, it continues that way.  But even Sadat was a mentor.  [HM] Father [George] Clements was a mentor.  But I have come to the conclusion that all fathers have to be mentors if they, especially if they have children. If they don't they have to be mentors to somebody of another generation. I think that's the way we used to be in Africa.  That's the way we were in early United States, all of us, everybody.  And somewhere along the line we forgot that role.  It's not an awesome responsibility but it is a responsibility.  And I think the way to be the mentor first is you have to take care of yourself so you have the right message to mentor to a young person. It's kind of like they say in airplanes, when the oxygen mask comes down make sure you put it on yourself first, damn somebody else. So I think that's the role of a mentor.  I think we're on this planet each generation to raise the conscience of the generation a little bit at a time going in an upward direction not a downward direction.  And we definitely need male and female mentors, every generation.
Speaker 1: I remember a movie that was on I guess in the early 90s [1990s] where you played a father who was reunited with his son and I'm trying to think of the actor that played the son.
Speaker 2: Blair Underwood.
Speaker 1: Blair Underwood, right exactly.  That's--
Speaker 2: Well I produced that, it was called 'Father and Son'.  It came out in one paragraph in the Los Angeles Times.  Father reunited with son in prison.
Speaker 1: That's the--
Speaker 2: And we took a script I mean because that happens with oh, how many of our--today it happens about 60% of father and sons in the hood meet one another behind closed doors, behind bars.  Been there together, either one or both are always been there.  One, either they--if they were not there together they're there independently.  So that was important things they--to say at the time.
Speaker 1: It's one of the number one problems that people say just in the black community now are people coming back--
Speaker 2: From prison.
Speaker 1: --now with nothing to do and being in the same situation--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --then going right back again.
Speaker 2: Well see, it's kind of pleasant now to go to prison.  You don't miss out for anything and you don't have to pay no rent.  You get fed, anything you want you can get and it has--all the gangs are in there and they're making statements about they're controlling the streets outside the prison.  The last one is the Latins who declared war on the African Americans and that must stop.  But the orders are coming from the prisons.  The separation in prisons, the separation from the blacks, the Latins and the Whites, can't be replicated in the street.  That can't be the dominate mentality in the streets.  If it is then something is wrong with the mentality already out here.  That has to be the dominant, not that prison mentality.
Speaker 1: Now do you come in contact with everyday folk a lot?  I mean you know--
Speaker 2: Oh everyday.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This time yesterday I was on a march down in Watts [Los Angeles, California] on Vernon walking down 100 and--I can't remember what street.  We were over that high school that had the shooting now.  I can't remember the name of the high schools, one of the presidents who named after--but we marched because there was a gang shooting and we marched and stopped on the site and prayed.  So--and I wasn't in the front I was in the middle and then I had to speak.  I was the last to speak and what I have to say is we've been practicing this.  Man has been practicing that separation for centuries and now we've come to a place where it's a collision course with failure.  That mentality no longer is necessary today.  It might have been necessary before but what we need first to do is to be together in order to save the planet.  It becomes ludicrous for us to think about anything less than that right now.  There's nothing to gain if everybody is going to go away.  So the gang bangs, the drive-bys, the fights between the Latins and the blacks, the white the whole thing is ludicrous.  And it involves now nine years olds, children of nine years old.  So I went up to the schools and I went to all of them--
Story_ID: 111389
Speaker 1: --With their faces you know they just--and they look you in the eye.  That's what happens in prison, you can't look nobody in the eye.  I said look me in the eye and they look at me and after about two or three minutes, I got a smile and I got--who is this man?  What does he want?  I just want to shake your hand sir and tell you I'm here to help you if you want it.  Eventually at the end of the march they were nine years old.  That's all they want in the first place, most of them.  Some of them are gone, can't be saved.  But every now and then those kids voluntarily turn back to the age they really are if the older people are interested and stick with them.  It works.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm trying to go chronologically through your videography--I mean filmography which is I don't know how useful this is.  But I guess it is, we'll just keep-'The Josephine Baker Story' is one.
Speaker 1: Ah!
Speaker 2: Now if there's something that I pass over that you think you ought--we ought to discuss, let me know.
Speaker 1: I don't remember.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: But Josephine Baker had the same mindset, adopt the homeless kids from everywhere around the world.  It became number one instead of her performing.  So she devoted her life to those children and she went back to theater, went back to Broadway which was when I met her.  But it was an honor one more time to play somebody of history or play with somebody who was playing somebody of history.  That, that--those are our perks in our business.
Story_ID: 111390
Speaker 1: 'Diggstown'.  Now this was a big hit and I, you know I was surprised when it came out it was, that it was such a big hit.
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't a big hit when it first came out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: First couple of days and then it left and then it came back as a big hit, once again on television and DVD.  But this time the publicity was wrong.  They publicized nobody knew what it was about but when finally saw it the word of mouth made it a big hit and it's still a hit today.  They changed the name eventually in Europe to--cause it was a big hit in Europe immediately, from 'Diggstown' to 'Midnight Sting'.  Then when it came back people said oh, that's what that was about and then the word of mouth came out.  So now today it's a cult file also.  It's a classic.  Once again it was advertised wrong.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You think that this is a--well do you think that Hollywood has a problem in trying to promote the movies that you were in or was it just, that you just, I don't know unlucky side of the--?
Speaker 2: Well both I think I'm on the unlucky side of it but also I think there has, there used to be cause it's not happening anymore, still is a little bit, a psychological obstruction to the character with the exception here recently, psychological obstruction to the success of the successful African American man or woman.  Hurricane was wonderful but he came out of prison, Malcolm X is dead, thank god for Joe Carter.  There's got to be something that indelible for our audience on a big screen about upwardly mobile and successful African Americans, men or women as a point for people's minds as opposed to somebody who is temporarily successful or died or whatever.  We need to tell more of those positive stories.  Another good one was a lot of Denzel's movies are like that so far thank god.  And it's going in that direction.  But I think one more time not only is it Hollywood's responsibility but it is also mine to do those stories.  That's a mindset that we have to wait for somebody else to tell our stories for us has to be over.
Story_ID: 111391
Speaker 1: Now you produced a few projects.  What--can you tell us about the projects that you produced and what were trying to achieve?
Speaker 2: Well 'Father and Son' was one, Ray Alexander, an upwardly mobile private detective who retired and had to be a private detective in order to keep his restaurant together.  And it was only on and at the end of every show he had an entertainer.  So first time had Johnny Mathis, second time had Ray Charles.  It should still be on the air, the other one, Gideon Oliver, anthropologist world renown going from country to country.  Another one was Lazarus Syndrome, a surgeon.  This is the 60s [1960s], 70s [1970s].  For some reason we were the lowest series on the totem pole.  For example, Gideon Oliver was part of a wheel with Colombo and the others.  And my series is the only one that travels.  We really needed a little bit more money but we got the least amount of the money.  I was in every scene.  It was a burnout for me.  It's different today.  I don't want to in this interview put my finger on what is wrong.  I need people to connect their own dots.  But that was then, this is now.  This is a different time.  Maybe at that time the so-called audience might not have been there but I'm not sure.  Now it's a brand new ballgame and I'm very grateful to be alive and be able to contribute again with what I'm doing from now and the future.  It's still working.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now just recently we're talking about there was a--well you played in it says, it must have been a lot of TV projects--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --like 'Lonesome Dove', Gail Devers' story--
Speaker 2: That was mine.  I produced Gail Devers.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear) Bob Kersee.
Speaker 2: Yeah, with Bob Kersee.  And another one I produced was the series which I loved, still love very much was to dance and in love with Olivia [sic, To Dance With Olivia] with you know Lonette McKee which would have been a wonderful piece in order to tell history because it was during the time of Martin Luther King so through this first African American statesman, lawyer, he could have gone to Washington and the background would have been wonderful. It won the--it took the ratings but for some reason it doesn't continue.  Another one was 'The Color of Love' that I did with, I've forgotten what the lady's name is, Kim Stan--not Kim Stanley, I can't remember.  Anyway, once again it had a great message and it took the ratings.  So I think now is the time for those stories to come back and they've come back a lot in other cable networks.  So I've had and I guess Sidney Poitier could say the same, and of course the late Ossie Davis could say the same, the door has finally opening for us to contribute relevant stories both with the establishment and without the establishment.  The audience is hungry like a sponge.  People of all colors around the world and in this country are hungry like a sponge.  We've already proven that we do take the ratings like 'Lackawanna Blues', etc.  So now is the time.
Story_ID: 111392
Speaker 1: If you could--well you know as things are opening, do you have--what big projects do you see for your--I mean are there stories that you want to get out here that you think that you'll be able to do that?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.  I think that keeping in touch with the history.  I'd like to remake--I hear Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar] has written a script about the liberators, the African American soldiers that did fight for, for [General George S.] Patton.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you narrated a story--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about 761st tank.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So now Kareem has written it and so Denzel [Washington] wants to direct it and that story will be told the amazing stories in that story.  I want to--I don't have to play him but I do want to be responsible for the story of Haile Selassie.  His importance is more than anybody realizes.  I asked a woman who was interviewing me at the Black Oscars who had a Masters [Degree] in African History.  Did you know who Haile Selassie was?  She said no.
Speaker 1: They're not giving these out are they?  It makes you think--makes you wonder doesn't it?
Speaker 2: So that becomes extremely important because she knows who Napoleon is but she doesn't know Jean-Jacques Dessalines.  She knows Alexander the Great but she knew just a little bit about Hannibal.  And she was African American.  So there's an imbalance that I'd like to help balance by the movies and documentaries that I do.  Haile Selassie's on the top.  The true story of Cleopatra and her culture, Kwame Nkrumah, the Timbuktu, the Benin civilization, etc. Plus the cowboys.
Story_ID: 111393
Speaker 1: You said something fascinating just now off camera but you were saying that Vin Diesel had a project to do Hannibal [Hannibal Barca of Carthage].
Speaker 2: Hannibal.  Hannibal, yeah.  He's a good actor, he can play it but I'd like to see it already, but it's not been shot.  It's very important.  It's very important.  If they're doing every year some of the top filmmakers have done the Romans one more time, the Crusades is about to come out.
Speaker 1: Right, Heaven and Earth.
Speaker 2: Heaven and Earth, beautiful to look at.
Speaker 1: 'Kingdom of Heaven'.
Speaker 2: Kingdom of Heaven, but there's another story.  Where did they go?  Who did they conquer, who did they--and what happened?  There's a whole other side from another point of view that has to be done so that, so people can take both sides and find out the truth of history.  It's always told on one side.  You don't get that.
Speaker 1: Right, for African American people often when we go to the movies, we'll see a movie about Egypt or someplace else and if it's in ancient times--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --the black people in it they're carrying somebody or carrying some burglars or criminals and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: With Woody Strode in 'Ten Commandments', I know he's a king in one scene.  The next scene he's carrying stuff to him, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah (unclear) and he'd better hurry up!  (Laughter).  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: You know as a kid I guess you know I did and probably a lot of other people when they look at--they see the movies and television you know you get more of your impression of history from those sources than you do from reading books.
Speaker 2: Right, and it works right there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And people say no, I don't want none of that, those kids, no I don't want none of that.  I'm going over here where I can feel better.  Well we have to bring them back.
Speaker 1: Yeah, then on the other side, white people, academics as well as movie people say well it's not important to show black people doing these things.
Speaker 2: It's important.  It's important to show everybody.  Everybody cause we need a melting pot today.  We need one another.  We really desperately need one another and we have to teach our younger to teach their younger and start in that process upwardly cause it's necessary.
Story_ID: 111394
Speaker 1: Now in the '90s [1990s] you made another piece about a black man in Canada who's daughter is kidnapped.  That's--
Speaker 2: James Mink.
Speaker 1: Yeah, James Mink.
Speaker 2: Now James Mink back in those days during the time of slavery which is what, 1850s, '55 [1855]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think--
Speaker 2: --somewhere around there, '60s [1860s], his father was a run away slave up through the Underground Railroad.  Knew how--about horses so he had a stage coach kind of business, livery stable and his son was able to get a little bit more of an education in Canada and assumed an inherited from his father and brought it up to the livery business which are limousines today and also breeding of high stock horses.  So he had a choice of going to the next level in this business or becoming the first mayor of Toronto [Canada] and they chose to stay in business.  He had a daughter that he got from a mail order Irish wife during the potato famine and by letter she showed up.  She didn't know he was black and they fell in love.  Out of that wedlock came a daughter, upwardly mobile, upper middle class, highly established with friends.  But his daughter went to finishing school and there was no kind of reputable young men in Toronto.  They were all kind of play boys.  So he met during a horse auction a young man from America, white and he seemed the one to wed his daughter to.  Spent a great deal of money on the wedding and the party and that night they went to Niagara Falls, consummated the wedding and she got up--he got up and split and didn't know he was a slave trader, true story.  And they went--she was subsequently taken all the way down to the deep south.  And then finally years later, not a lot but years later they finally got one letter from her.  So now him and his white wife have to go back into slavery south to get their daughter which they did and come back by way of the underground railroad.  They're all buried in the same cemetory in--cemetery in Toronto.  Beautiful, successful story.
Speaker 1: And a kind of story that you don't, you know you don't hear these kind of stories.
Speaker 2: No, well yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean it's a unique story.
Speaker 2: Somebody had to look for that story and then wrote it and thank god would have a mutual admiration society when they called me and asked me if I would like to do that.  Of course I would.
Speaker 1: It's a kind of drama with the extremes that can only come out of a slave system and that period of time.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: I mean that's really something that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, great story.  Great story, great timing, great opportunity to wear those old outfits you know.  It was nice.  He was a well dressed, successful man.
Speaker 1: And that was produced, was that produced in Canada or--?
Speaker 2: Produced in Canada for Showtime.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For Showtime, I believe it was Showtime.  But Showtime's as did Jerry Offsay etc., who he's gone on to another--somebody else.  But you have to be--have to have a sensitive person to do that, to have that kind of insight.
Story_ID: 111395
Speaker 1: Now recently what have you been working on recently?  What are your projects?
Speaker 2: Well after 'Lackawanna Blues'--
Speaker 1: Which is--well we talk--we should on that too.  'Lackawanna Blues' was just--man that was a successful one.
Speaker 2: Totally successful.  It was Ruben Santiago [sic, Santiago-Hudson], great actor, you see him all the time, about his life and his mom like my cousins.  They let everybody in the house who can't live anywhere else.  And there's big parties every Saturday night, barbecues and great food and everybody helping one another, great, great--and all of the actors went there and did their little cameos.  For Halle Berry who was the executive producer, beautiful experience.  It was directed by George Wolfe who his claim to fame is all the wonderful things that happened on Broadway and a public theater.  He's been honest so I've taken that out there to honor him.  What's happening now is hopefully a fruitful relationship between one of the major studios and come by them one way because of my foundation and the other way is with business, with and without the studios, hopefully with outside financing.  What I'm doing in the present time is one of the leads in Stargate SG1 so I now commute every week from here to Vancouver where the shoot is.  It's wonderful.  The character is a man from another planet.  I don't know where they got that idea.  But his philosophy is really nice you know.  It's about having faith in the overall philosophy of everybody on the planet and if you don't then you're out.  But it's nice to see him being leader of his planet and Beau Bridges, my old friend being a representative of his planet and us trying to--we haven't hit yet but we're allies but we really haven't hit yet and therein lies the series.  What--how can we be together?  And it's not always graceful but it's a great thing to do on a daily basis.
Story_ID: 111396
Speaker 1: Now are there any--I've heard it said, now I don't know about this project but I've heard it said by other people I've interviewed that it's hard to find black writers on a lot of projects in Hollywood.  It's hardly any--in the TV series, it's hardly any black head writers on any of these shows.
Speaker 2: Well yes there are.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes there are.  It's time for those black writers to identify themselves.  'Diggstown' was a black writer.  'Lackawanna Blues' and others.  But they work amongst--one amongst many.  And they write the scripts according to their dictates from their boss.  They need to put their stuff out somewhere lest that umbilical cord get frustrated.  They need to have dream scripts that hopefully I can provide an avenue or a venue for.  There are some wonderful writers out there, both here and Canada.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That being said you're interested in historical films?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, I'm interested in historical things number one.  I'm interested in life today because everybody is not a gangbanger.  That's only a tenth or one-fifth of our society.  I'm looking for psychodramas, life and death situations, normal situations, all kinds of stuff that includes the way the world is today rather than telling them this is the way it really is when it really isn't.  So I'm once again saying 'The Wire' is a great show but it's this much of our experience.  So it has a little danger for me if you don't see the other part of the experience as great as it is, and it is great.
Story_ID: 111397
Speaker 1: Now a project, say a project like--I know years ago Anthony Quinn was involved in a project to do King Christophe of Haiti.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  He had asked me to do it and he asked me to help him, for some reason asked me--had to get my help to get it on and we--both of us hit a brick wall.  There was nobody interested.  It's different today.  I have other--
Speaker 1: So you think a project like that might work or--?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Project like--and the story of [Jean-Jacques] Dessalines?
Speaker 2: Dessalines, Louverture [Francois-Dominique Toussaint Louverture], Christophe and how they beat--how they were outnumbered twenty to one and they beat Napoleon [Bonaparte].  And in order--this is a small piece of information.  In order to get battle ready to fight Napoleon, they were sent to Santana [sic, Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna], the Mexican General and they fought at the Alamo.  Just found that out.  And they went back battle tested to fight Napoleon.
Speaker 1: Right, I think I remember something like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were sent to--maybe about a fourth or a third of those soldiers were Asian, that's good stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of this stuff is really, it's so amazing.
Speaker 2: About our west, you know we know about Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson [William Barclay Masterson] and Wild Bill Hickok [James Butler Hickok], but the most successful marshal was Bass Reeves.  There's never been a movie about Bass Reeves.  There hasn't been a proper movie about Jim Beckwourth, buffalo soldiers, ad infinitum.
Speaker 1: Right, Bass Reeves, what a character he--
Speaker 2: Oh incredible.  Incredible character, thirty-five year success.
Speaker 1: Now there is a--I talked to someone who admitted to me that the Bass Reeves Story was probably--there's a Clint Eastwood movie called 'Hang Em High', I think it's based on Bass Reeves.
Speaker 2: Bass Reeves, yeah.
Speaker 1: But they didn't--couldn't use Bass Reeves so--
Speaker 2: They used Clint Eastwood.
Speaker 1: --riding out of Fort, what's the one in Arkansas, Fort Smith, Arkansas.
Speaker 2: Fort Smith, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, just like Bass Reeves was going out into the territories-bringing people--
Speaker 2: Hired by--yeah hired by the hanging judge.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he was--he had to be bad for thirty-five successful years, even had to go get his son who killed his wife.  He was quite a man.
Speaker 1: Right.  James Beckwourth [James Pierson Beckwourth], we see him off camera--
Speaker 2: James Beckwourth, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of him being played by Jack Oakie and--
Speaker 2: Jack Oakie and Sterling Hayden.
Speaker 1: --Sterling Hayden.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it moves on.  But that's one mindset.  We have a different mindset today.  We also have our own power to do that so it's not a negative thought in my bone about this today.  It just must be done.
Story_ID: 111398
Speaker 1: In terms of power in Hollywood, we have like a, you know got a (pause) I guess that black folks like John Singleton, we got the--
Speaker 2: Hudlins [Warrington and Reginald Hudlin].
Speaker 1: The Hudlins.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Spike Lee on some level.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't know, how much power do they really have in Hollywood?
Speaker 2: Very little.  Very little, they have to call the shot.  And the only place I think they're going--eventually going to call the shot, including Denzel [Washington] and Jamie [Foxx] is in their own little entity which is the name of the game.  It's not racism, it's the name of the game.  It's the mindset of doing your own and making money and proving it like Mel Gibson has and then doing business with the establishment.  The mindset of you owe us has to go away.  We have the ability to do it ourselves and then add that to the pot.  We're not owed anything.  We need to prove that we are worth doing business with.  And all of those people you named are well worth it but they're employees today.  No matter how much money they make, they will not be able to call the shot in that established field.
Speaker 1: So they need to--?
Speaker 2: Have their own.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then with brotherhood and love, here's ours, there's yours, let's join.  That's the way everybody else has done it and we have to do the same.
Story_ID: 111399
Speaker 1: I don't want to miss any major project before I go forward.   But do you have one dream project that you want to do more than anything else?
Speaker 2: Yeah and it might come out of left field.  But in doing the research I want to play Lincoln Perry-Stepin Fetchit.  The stuff I found out about him makes a great performance for an actor because when he was at his best he had nine limousines, two Duesenbergs and seven Rolls Royces.  He had fifteen Asian servants, he had four phones in his house to each of the major studios.  And he did that to prove to his son that a black man could make it during those times, and he did.  He owned--they didn't give money at the time, they gave property and if you know Los Angeles from the Hotel Watkins at Crenshaw and Adams to the Los Angeles Arena belonged to him, right?  He lived very close to Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford.  They all had property.  So did Will Rogers have property down by Malibu [California].  Leo Carrillo had all of Malibu up north of the Ventura County Line.  It was property at the time and he was highly mobile.  Very brilliant man, died broke.
Speaker 1: Yeah, died in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Broke.  Why--?
Speaker 1: In the projects, right Stateway Gardens.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So now, why?  His son went to Korea, came out ashamed of his father, a little battle shocked and wound up in an insane asylum in Chicago.  Got out and took his M1 and shot seven or eight people because he couldn't stand it any longer and died I think incarcerated.  At the same time Lincoln Stepin Fetchit was doing a movie and had to do that talk and there's a before and after.  There's that duality of him having to make money and his son is dead and that's why he's doing it, to being that character that people misunderstood as an uncle tom which he was not.  The others who copied him were.  But he was a highly upwardly mobile man, highly respected and what he was doing was minstrel talk.  Everything after him was the uncle Tom.  He was never scared of a white woman.  He never took second best.  They always asked his advice, especially Walter Brenan.  And when he was working, Walter Brenan, Eddie Canter and all those people copied him on the set.  They watched him and they took his stuff.  That was Stepin Fetchit was opposed to the rest of them.  So now you got a thing called absolution is what I want to call it cause he needs to be absolved of that image.  But as an actor there's a challenge to put on the screen that bittersweet story.  The reasons for him to prove that you can make it died.  They went from there to death and broke.
Story_ID: 111400
Speaker 1: Now how did he--is--did you know how he lost his--?
Speaker 2: He just didn't care.  Just didn't care, didn't pay attention.
Speaker 1: So he didn't just take care of his finances and--?
Speaker 2: Didn't matter anymore.
Speaker 1: Did he lose--was he--did he lose film roles as a result of changes or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at one time called for Amos and Andy to be taken off the air for instance.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean was it that kind of pressure that kept him out of work?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he outgrew--society outgrew his image but his image was misunderstood.  The image of the uncle Tom was not him.  But I won't mention any other names but all those people that copied him.
Speaker 1: Well the image certainly was uncle Tom-ish but you know--
Speaker 2: Well would you say, call--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) that he in real life--
Speaker 2: --would you call Walter Brennan's character and uncle Tom?
Speaker 1: Well--?
Speaker 2: He imitated him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You'll call Andy Devine's character an uncle tom?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they played like the comic foil for you know for a sidekick--
Speaker 2: But it was okay because they were white.  But when a black man did it, it was--it's something to be ashamed of.  But it really was original--originated in the minstrel show.  That's the way they spoke then.  But the depiction was misunderstood on our--only on his part, the rest absolutely true big difference between him and the rest.
Speaker 1: I guess I don't--
Speaker 2: See there's (unclear) but his stuff was copied successfully, especially by Walter Brennan that he did things with George Wayne--John Wayne and all those people playing Stepin Fetchit.
Speaker 1: It's like Walter Brennan's role in say 'Red River'--
Speaker 2: And made a fortune.
Speaker 1: --Red River where he plays a cook.
Speaker 2: And made a fortune playing Stepin Fetchit.  He got it because he did three movies with him.  Yeah, he got it and made a fortune with it.
Speaker 1: It's certainly a history we haven't heard about Stepin Fetchit.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Yeah well it's an actor's challenge you know.  It's not--I'm not resurrecting his image or anything but it's a great challenge to play that kind of character.
Speaker 1: So you think it would be instructive to show the real Stepin Fetchit as opposed to his role and to show what--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  See what he was really like, yeah.  There's an absolution story there.
Speaker 1: That's, you know the Lincoln Perry homes in Chicago [Illinois] I mean I saw there's senior's facility--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --named for him and very few of the people inside know who Lincoln Perry was.
Speaker 2: Know who he is, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean I was there last year and a lot of staff didn't know who he was, the people who are working there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's like the James Weldon Johnson High Schools, Benjamin Banneker Junior High in Washington, D.C.  "Who is he?"  He just designed the city you live in, you know.  But there you go.
Story_ID: 111401
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite role?
Speaker 2: Oh boy.  No, I have the mindset that I--whatever that favorite role is the one I'm about to do.  But I know what you mean.  One of my favorite roles besides Fiddler [in 'Roots'] is 'Ceremonies in Dark Old Men' and of course 'Enemy Mine' and (unclear) 'Sadat'.  Thank god I had those more than one.  But for a healthy mindset, whatever the role I'm about to do is my favorite, put a hundred percent on it.
Speaker 1: Is there any one that you rate as your best performance?
Speaker 2: Oh it's difficult to say that.  'Diggstown' was one, 'Enemy Mine' was the most difficult because I had to come through makeup and it was a lot of pain everyday.  Enemy Mine probably.  Enemy Mine, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How long did it take to put on all that make up?
Speaker 2: Started out with eight hours, then cut it down to five.  I lost my eyesight almost for thirty days and--because the--
Speaker 1: Was the adhesive or something--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the adhesive fell on the eyelids and the double contact lenses.  Didn't know whether to take them out and let the vapor come in or keep them on and take the stuff off.  It just--they couldn't figure it out but they had to do the movie.  And then I was supposed to take them out every twenty minutes which was prohibitive.  So they were taking some of the contact lenses out with suction cups.  So I was in a dark room for about twenty days with a candle at the other end and that candle light was too bright.  But that you know, I had to do it.
Speaker 1: Now when they designed these, they don't use as much make up as they used to.  They use a lot of artwork now since there are computers to make people change, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But they still do.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they don't--they test it on you, on the project--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, even the test, I tested before the movie started, took six months to shoot.  Before the movie started they must have tested 200 different sets.  So my eyes to begin with were a battle field, you know.  Open your eyes.  Okay.  So what I did I had to incorporate into the character somebody who never closed his eyes cause it hurt too much so I just never closed my eyes.  And in one of the episodes never--there's no blinking in that performance.
Speaker 1: This is the part of Hollywood you hear about now.
Speaker 2: No blinking.
Speaker 1: So this is tough, hard work, I mean that's some serious--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh yeah, it's more than sunglasses and limousines, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's serious losing your eyesight.
Speaker 2: Oh you got that right, you know.  I told that to a couple of pretty girls, I said look what I would have missed, you know.  But it's--I'm very grateful to be here to be able to see you and have fairly good eyesight.  Thank god for our mutual pharmaceutical glasses (laughter).
Story_ID: 111402
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?  I know you talked about some of them but--
Speaker 2: Well my hope and my concern is the African community--African American community is not look at another society, the outside society the African American community for salvation.  Look inside yourself and your own people.  That is the American way to take care of yourself and then contribute your full healthy spiritual self to the whole.  That's why the country was started.  Forget what happened in the past and continue to the--for the present and the future going in this direction.  The African American is the number one consumer on the planet.  Equal possibly to the economy of Spain.  It is no longer necessary to get angry at what has not been given you from top to bottom.  We have in our hearts and in our abilities to do it ourselves by example, the right way.  And that's not isolating other races or other people to help us, but we need to be responsible for ourselves, our children and the statements we put on screens, magazines, etc.  We cannot rely on somebody else to tell our story or tell us how to live.  And once successful, we must add that to the American pot with love and fellowship.
Story_ID: 111403
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on all the projects that you've worked on and the things that you've done, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: No.  I think it's god's plan for me to be the sum total of everything I've done, to have come up with this idea today.  So my concern is to give back to the African American community.  I think we're doing that and whatever I can do to help or to show I will do.
Story_ID: 111404
Speaker 1: I haven't asked you much about family.  Do you want to talk about your family?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, I have two sons.  One was spoiled there for a while with my success, had governesses and housekeepers, feeding him in the bed with his little Lord Fauntleroy stuff on.  And the other one, he was hungry and homeless at the age of five.  Saw him on Good Morning America, being the chairman of the homeless committee back in those days, went to St. Louis [Missouri] and I was going to just put a fund together so that these kids would take care of themselves.  The bottom line, is if everybody had free education, free health, free clothing, free shelter and free love, and medicine of course and every (unclear), the results would be different.  So I was going to do that.  And he came into the hotel and I said you want to live with me?  He said, yeah.  So that's my second son.  Each one has given me two grandchildren so I have four and they both now work for me.  So the adopted boy, my real son also is the computer technical, technological expert.  The other one went to Syracuse [University] and he's a filmmaker so I have two assistants, the two of them.  And it's the best time of my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 111405
Speaker 1: Now likewise when you look back over your life and everything you've done up to this point, what would you consider if you had to look, assess it now as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I guess hopefully by what I'm doing now is--and hopefully I got another fifty years ago, maybe fifty minutes, I don't know.  Doesn't matter anymore, it goes one day at a time.  I'm doing the best I can.  The legacy is the legacy of hopefully a pioneer, somebody who can induce an upwardly mobile mindset amongst all people and hopefully the legacy is that I really didn't hurt anybody.  Hopefully I educated people, made them better by my presence on or off the screen.  Hopefully it's more selfless than selfish and hopefully I raised somebody's consciousness a little bit with each person.
Speaker 1: Now is there anything we haven't raised or asked that you think we should?
Speaker 2: No, just the number one problem or situation that everybody has to have is eliminate the racism of all sorts first in our minds and then with others.  Without getting rid of that we can't go any further.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  In--how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd just like to be remembered as Louis Gossett, Jr., actor, humanitarian, activist, father, not necessarily in that order and grandfather.
Story_ID: 111406
Speaker 1: All right.  One more question before we--just to make sure this is covered.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You're a versatile actor, can play a number of different parts.  You've played people from all over the world.  And how do you approach a role?  What's your acting technique?  How do you approach playing a role?
Speaker 2: Well today it's different.  When the--there was a process and the process started with my first play because the people were actor studio oriented and it was moment to moment but you carried whichever character.  It's different now because I think today acting is what they call a misnomer.  You do really have to act in theater because you got to get your performance and your voice to the last row.  In film, they take care of that for you.  So your difference in--television is different than it is in features because of the size of the screen.  But the bottom line in the preparation of a character is like putting on clothes, personalities, sometimes it's just with a pair of shoes, sometimes it's as you're going toward--you got the part and as you go through your life you take things from other people, some things from your past qualities.  And you play them trial and error and at home before you even get there you figure out what's going to fit this character is going to be making people rivet you, rivet to you, what quality.  And then you practice those things, the speech pattern, the walk, a mood, other things that might be bothering you so it makes you say I love you differently, all kind of stuff.  And you fit it into the overall thing of the script with the other characters.  So now you're doing other people's jobs for them.  You got so much to do.  So they bounce off of you, you bounce back off of them and then you might have to throw half of the stuff you got away cause they brought some stuff.  And what you got when you take the--all of it away is something real.  And the bottom line is it's got to look like it's happening for the first time so you have to trust your instrument so that you can rehearse and rehearse and rehearse.  And when the man says action you have to trust that it's going to be the first time and do it again sometimes fifteen to twenty times in a row, making it look like it's happening for the first time.  So you develop your instrument to be fast enough, all of it to be fast enough to adopt that attitude and that talent and that ability to make it look, all your moments look like they're happening for the first time.  On film you're going to do it in different--three or four, five different angles.  You have to match all your movements, everything.  So when you get into the editing room they can cut to you rather than somebody else who doesn't know how to do that.  So it's not as easy as you think.  But now after fifty years, it's a little easier cause it's built in, something you automatically do.  And I look and see what somebody's telling me, really listen to what they have to say and to see it like the character, not like me, then I become that character.  I react because of my research on that character the way the character would react, not like the way I would react.  So it's a--and it's ongoing, there's no diploma.  None.
Story_ID: 111407
Speaker 1: Now you have not--you've played a lot of as I said before mentors--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --strong mentor type characters.  And I think you're unique in that you've played a lot of strong mentors for white people--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --you know, which is, it's not the usual situation in movies.  You don't see a lot of black people mentoring white people in the movies.
Speaker 2: In a sense you do but it's just that he's a--it's a much more ugly moment in (unclear) with Sidney Poitier and Frank Silvera and all those, they were mentors to white folks.  Sometimes there was--even Archie Moore but that's a different kind of mentor today.  He's also upwardly mobile.  He's a colonel rather than a slave, but it's the same relationship.  They needed somebody like that to make the little--the young white boy, white girl better.  And it's happened--that's the way it was.  That's the way it was in society so they're writing from personal experience.  We needed somebody like that to take care of ourselves and take that information so we could make it so we could then go back and thank them but they still down there kind of consciousness.  Today he's at least a brigadier general now as a mentor.  He's not a retired football player, he's up here now.  It's different.  So evolution has taken that mentor up because the students are up and the mentality is up but it started down here and it's worked its way up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's an interesting observation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's progress.
Speaker 1: And then the other thing, you played a lot of older people even from--I think we talked about this earlier.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll just bounce off it since we're talking about acting now.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You played a lot of older people even when you were younger.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you seemed to be very good at playing an old black man.
Speaker 2: I was raised by old black men and old black women.  Not much schooling but very wise.  Their impression on me is indelible and I bring that with me.  I was able to salute my grandmother as Fiddler and my grandfather.  But later on I was able to salute my grandfather in Gathering of Old Men, that's who they were Uncle Yani and Aunt Sid, that's who they were.  I'll show you pictures of them.
Speaker 1: Now sir, do you have a favorite actor or actress?
Speaker 2: Favorite actor?  Mr.--
Speaker 1: Well I guess they're all actors.
Speaker 2: Mr. Sidney Poitier, can't be touched.  The late Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn, [Robert] De Niro, [Al] Pacino, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda hopefully again and quite a few others.  But there, that's the mainstream right there.  That's the rock, those are the rocks.
Story_ID: 111408
Speaker 1: --Gossett, I'm rolling on the one that's on the easel right here.  Can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's my great grandmother and she died at approximately the age of 115.  The bible was not started until the slaves were freed and she remembers color wagons leaving the thing and they ran over her finger.  I don't know if you can see her finger is missing there.  But she--her responsibility was raising along with her daughters, all, some twenty-five or thirty of me and my cousins.  She cooked, cleaned, washed all by hand, including the switches.  She was the matriarch.  That's Grandma Ray.  Her husband was a Cherokee, Uncle Ruben and that's part of the--they married into the Cherokees and the Seminoles so some of my ancestors obviously escaped across the Georgia border to Florida, the Everglades.
Speaker 1: Now the date of this photo would be--?
Speaker 2: Oh my god, let me see.
Speaker 1: You're like about 15 there you think?
Speaker 2: 19--1950.
Speaker 1: 1950.
Speaker 2: '51 [1951], something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: I was an athlete and I lived in Coney Island [New York] and I played softball and baseball with some of the older people.  And the edge of the outfield was bordering on a place called Graveshead Bay.  So every three or four years the water would reclaim the property and they'd have to break the concrete down and fill it full of sand and re-cement it.  And I ran up this pile of sand and caught the ball and let myself fall and in front of me was bricks and mortar and I went face first.  So that was maybe about the age of twelve, thirteen years old.  That's me and my father.
Speaker 1: You said you were out for three days?
Speaker 2: I was out--unconscious for three days, concussion, broken nose, broken sinus bone.
Speaker 1: We'll focus in on it.  When he gets focused it--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Of course you can see that scar on my head from that accident.  It's up there.  I still have it here today.  That picture was in Birdland, 1954.  It's my prom picture, sitting in Birdland.  Across the street was a place called The House of Chan but this picture was taken in Birdland. And on the stage was Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Lester--
Speaker 2: Young.
Speaker 1: --Young, Lester Young.  A young Powell, piano player.
Speaker 2: But Powell?
Speaker 1: Yeah the young--not Bud Powell, the other one.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Played with Max Roach.  There was Art Blakey then the other one was Max Roach, those two groups were playing.  Peewee, what's his name, Peewee, shortie (unclear) I can't remember.  That's him, Max Roach, Art Blakey.  He would be on at Birdland and he would mispronounce your name if you didn't give him no tip.  So every now and then Art Blakey was never Art Blakey, it's Blakesly, Arts Blakeslys.  He didn't give him no tip.  Mix Richie--Max Roach, right?  Told Max, I'd better tip this boy before I kill him.  Max Roach ladies and gentlemen.  But that night Charlie Parker who was obviously under the influence at the time near the end of his career, in front of me as I was leaving was thrown out on the street.  That was the night in 1954.  Along with him was Bud Powell.  I didn't know who or how important they were at the time.  But the man's called Bird--Birdland and he was thrown out in the street in front of Birdland because they just wouldn't--couldn't communicate.  Couldn't play, couldn't do nothing.  See there on the upper--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  There's Charlie Parker--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There's Ella [Fitzgerald].
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Sarah Vaughn, Benny Goodman, Dinah Washington and they're all gone now.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: And they're all gone now.
Speaker 2: Who's that in the middle?
Speaker 1: Symphony Sid.
Speaker 2: Symphony Sid.
Speaker 1: Symphony Sid.
Speaker 2: Symphony Sid.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it does you know, but this is--this team here was sponsored by the Great Sugar Ray Robinson.  And to prove that the mafia took care of him all those guys on that picture had a Vito or a Carmine in front of their name and I'm the only black guy on the team and it's--Sugar Ray Robinson sponsored the team.  You could pick me out of a crowd.  Some of those people who are still alive are still my friends today.  My father was adopted by the mafia and took care of everybody.  When everybody couldn't have anything he'd go and ask and they'd take care of them.  Obviously the neighborhoods of the mafia where the families lived were the most well-behaved neighborhoods there was in New York City.  There wasn't nothing happening in their neighborhood and that was Coney Island and Sheepshead Bay.  And that's how I was raised, a well-behaved, evolved multiracial neighborhood.  So it had to be the mafia, the white mafia, the Jewish mafia, the Italian mafia, the Irish mafia and the Russian mafia.  But where their families lived was model.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At fifteen.
Speaker 2: (BRIEF PAUSE)
Speaker 1: First play, age of 15.  The late Francis Foster.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Right?  Take a Giant Step, the Lyceum Theater, 1953.  That's what I looked like.  I had a part in my hair.  Now the part goes all the way around my hair.  (Unclear) there, you don't see them here.  But that's the First Baptist Church of Coney Island.  The lady with the hat is Ms. Chapel.  She is the first lady of the church.  And you don't see them in this picture but the Choir, the Intermediate Choir consisted of myself, the Chiffons and the early Raylettes, Dorothy Jones, Ethel McCray.  That's not in that picture but that's the church it came from on 17th Street.  And the Raylettes could be playing in six places in America because there's twenty-one of them.  And they interlaced themselves with the Chiffons.  So our Intermediate Choir was highly competitive in the gospel world and we would compete against the Five Blind Boys in the Brooklyn Paramount.  And then the Five Blind Boys was Al Hibbler and Ray Charles, the Dixie Hummingbirds, Sam Cook.  And I forgot the name of Jackie Wilson's group, but that's who we saw every Sunday.  Choir, the original Raylettes right there from First Baptist Church of Coney Island.  They're looking good don't they?  And then that's my father on the right and my uncle on the left and in the middle that's the news stand at the end of the Coney Island BMT IND, Coney Island, that huge news stand.  And that man, that white man is Rocco Sylvester and he adopted my father to keep him from going to an orphanage.  My grandmother and grandfather separated so that--so my father was adopted and took care of the rest of his brothers and sisters.  So half of his heritage is Italian, serious Italian.  He's the one that ran the numbers and he had a car every year.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now are you in this one?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I played his brother in that.
Speaker 2: Wow, that should have been quite a difference.  You're like 6'4" and he's like 5'4".
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah and I had to dance and I was also an understudy in Billy Daniels at the time so I had to do a little dancing and I had to take my athlete steps and cut them down cause I kept stepping on his feet.  He was very patient.  He was very patient.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: That's 1954, graduating Abraham Lincoln High School, senior president.  And I was (unclear) and I was graduating after I was on Broadway so that was my graduation picture.  This was the first picture I had when I was in show business and 1954, '55 [1955].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And the next one is there was a strike in basketball in New York City in the lower--and the teachers struck.  So we were forced to play for the police athletically.  No, no, this is NYU [New York University], I'm sorry, this is NYU.  This is the freshman team of NYU.
Speaker 2: Okay, sure is.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's the freshman team at NYU and we were pretty good.  But the next year was Happy Hairston, Seth Sanders and--
