Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Whispers) My favorite phrase or saying: "Have you lost your mind?" (Laughs) It is.  I say it a lot. "Have your lost your mind?"  Or "That person, I think they lost their mind."  You know, or "I think I lost--I don' lost my mind."  Yeah, I say that a lot.
Story_ID: 18674
Speaker 1: And I'd like to first ask about your mother [Madeline Tillman] and what you know of her background and her growing up.
Speaker 2: I don't know a whole, whole lot about my mother's background with the exception that she grew up in Port Huron, Michigan, the same place I did, and her family is basically from Alabama. She is one of, I think, six children. I'm not sure where my mother fell in line there, but--everybody's alive, too, except her.
Speaker 1: Did she talk at all about growing up?
Speaker 2: No, but I mean, I sort of know what--well, yeah. I mean, they were poor like everybody else and the only thing that my mother used to say about growing up was--I mean, the saying is that, "Yeah, we were poor as church mice," but my mother didn't have that attitude. She used to kind of, in her own way to us, bad mouth some of her siblings and or friends by saying, you know, that they'd go to school looking haggard--haggardly and maybe not smelling as fresh and clean as they should. And my mother prided herself--she would borrow soap from people, she'd say, and scrub her clothes and she'd use bleach to make sure that her white blouse was white, and she used--you know, whatever that starch is--that sometimes they used to eat starch, but she also used it and diluted it and she'd make sure that her white socks were white and that her white blouse was starched and the pleats in her skirt were always pressed, and she always looked nice. And they used to say--people used to say to her that they didn't know she was from the same family when they'd see her sometimes with her sisters and brothers, because she was always just so clean and nice and neat and her hair was always done and she prided herself on that. And, you know, when we were growing up, basically, you know, I mean, I just saw a kindergarten picture--and I realized--not just me, but I realized that almost everybody in that picture-- we were sparkling, you know. Because even then, you know, she knew we were black and we were poor, but the bottom line is we still had pride. That made all the difference in the world, and it showed--and it shows in every picture that we're in, you know.
Speaker 1: Did she share anything else?
Speaker 2: About her childhood? She didn't want to relive it, and she didn't want us to relive it. That was very clear--very, very clear--that: "You guys are going--not going to go through what I went through. You're not going to see what I saw. You're not going to have to do what I did. You're not going to go without. It's going to be easier for you guys." And she didn't mean that it was going to be easy, but that it was going to be easier. She made that very clear that--'cause my mother only went to eleventh grade when she got pregnant with me, and she told--point blank--"You are going to college, no ifs, ands, and buts about it. If you bring a baby in here, I will kill you and the baby, but you're going to college, okay." And she was very adamant about that. So she was also--she also was very strict about the way we spoke, even though she didn't speak proper English a lot of times--well, maybe she did. She was very, very, very cognizant of the fact when we didn't. She--we couldn't say "ain't."  We couldn't say "can't," and in those days it was "cain't."  "I cain't do this," "I cain't do that." She wouldn't let us say that. It couldn't be--if you say, "Gimme dat," she would smack you or pop you upside your head. "There's no 'gimme dat.'  It's T-H, It's not D-A-T. 'Give me that' it's 'this,' 'that.'  It ain't no 'dis,' 'dat,' and 'de other.'  It's 'this,' 'that,' and 'the other,'" and she made us--and if she ever heard us speak like that, oh, it just unnerved her. It just made her sick to hear us speak like that. And it wasn't that we couldn't use slang, but she just didn't want us to speak improperly, and she knew for the most part--I mean, she may not have known if it was supposed to be "she and I" or "her and I" or "he and I," but the bottom line is for the most part she knew when it didn't sound right. She knew it and she would pop you and make you say--"You know what, I'm not raising no heathens. I'm not raising no uneducated hooligans in this household. You know, speak like you got some damn sense. Talk like you got some damn sense," you know. And she said "You're going to school, talk like you go to school." And she meant it too.  Oh Lord, did she mean it, and I'm grateful to her for that, even though I still make grammatical errors, but we all do. I don't care how educated you are, sometimes you just do, you know. But that was very important to her, and I thought it was kind of almost ironic, you know, in light of everything else that this was really important to her--for somebody who was uneducated, that this would be the way that her children sounded was important. And of course with that, you know, everybody in my family, we all graduated from high school and we subsequently have all gone to college, and that was important to her.

Speaker 1: Now your father, can you give his name and tell about his background?
Speaker 2: My father, his name was Edward Louis McMillan, and he was one of--I mean, I can see all of his siblings, but I don't know how many there were. I think probably about eleven of them or nine. There was a lot of them and they, too, grew up in Michigan. And I'm not sure of my father's family. I think they were from Alabama too, come to think of it, but none of them knew each other in Alabama. I mean, you know, when we migrated north and his folks left--went--kept going from Chicago [Illinois] and ended up in Michigan. And--'cause I grew up in a small town--it's north of--called Port Huron, Michigan, and it's almost right on the Canadian border by Sarnia, Ontario [Canada]. So there was a nice, little pocket in that thumb of black folks, but when I was growing up--and I was born in 1951--it wasn't anything--you didn't talk about where people came from, they were just there and in some cases it's still true.  And it wasn't until I was probably in my twenties or thirties that somebody said, "Where is your family from?" And then you say, "I think we're from--" you know? But my father, he used to box. I never saw him box, but he was quite the boxer from what I understand. Mischievous, but he was smart. Unfortunately, he ended up with tuberculosis.  Back in those days, there was no real cure for it, so he had to go away to a sanitarium. My mother [Madeline Tillman] divorced him when he [sic, I] was thirteen. He also turned out to have a problem with alcohol, which a lot of black people did and do. And my father drank, and he ended up with diabetes, and it ended up killing him at thirty-nine years old. So he didn't have a long life.  I didn't really get a chance to know him very well, except for the fact of his violent side and even that was--I know now--was basically spurred on because of alcoholism. I mean, most people are not born violent. Something--something has--something makes you that way. So I don't hold it against him now like I used to.
Speaker 1: .
Story_ID: 18676
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of growing up? Well, I have a--well, my earliest memory is not a good-is not a happy one. It was when my grandmother died, and I was five, five or six or something. And I don't know what I was doing over at her house. It's my mother's [Madeline Tillman's] mother. But apparently she ended up having a heart attack. But she couldn't breathe, and--I had to--she had me run out of the house and go get someone, and I didn't know what was going on and I ran and I ran to the pool hall. There was a local pool hall about a block away. And I was going to find this guy she was going out with, who was drunk at the time. But all I remember is she died, and I remember back in those days, they would bring the bodies home and sit them in your living room and that's where they would have like a wake.  And I remember seeing my grandma, Grandma Maybelle, sitting up in her little, tiny living room. It seemed like she took up the whole room, and she was in a casket, and I remember somebody picking me up. I know who it was, this woman that I couldn't stand and I'm not saying her name, but I don't even know if she's alive now. But she picked me up. Well, she was going to make me kiss my grandmother, and I didn't want to kiss her because I couldn't understand why she really was not moving. I did not like that. And I kicked the daylights out of this woman, and somebody told her just to leave me alone. But that's one of my earliest--one of my earliest--and eating chili. I don't know what it is. My mother used to make chili and I don't know why, when I think about being a kid, I always think about chili and cornbread, you know, and butterbeans. And being cold, I'll tell you that much. Being cold, that--if you want that kind of memory--being cold. Because we lived in a house that had no insulation upstairs, and I froze my ass off--and my sister. But we had heaters. We had heaters and a bed that had no box spring, but we had those wooden slats underneath. And sometimes, of course, when you jump too hard or whatever, one slat cracks and the bed sort of dips in the middle. So--. And they didn't have Crazy Glue in those days.
Speaker 1: You know, speaking of which, since you're recalling, you know, some real vivid--I mean, you know, nice things. I mean, not--you know, the chili and the cold. But I often ask people what sights, smells, and sounds remind them of their childhood, and I was wondering, you know, what you would say.
Speaker 2: I think burning coal comes to mind, because we had a furnace and it was a coal furnace--and soot. Sometimes, you know, I mean, my mother had the living room painted--it was so pretty--a really nice creamy--creamy color and sometimes you'd wake up in the morning and you'd see soot just floating up out of the vents, and you could really smell it.  So you'd have to like kind of go to sleep with your head under the covers 'cause it would get up--sometimes it'd be in your nose when you wake up. You know, black soot. Now that I think about it. Butterbeans cooking, and cornbread, maybe a peach cobbler, dogs barking and a--trains in the background. I always hear a train, always hear a train. But dogs barking.

Speaker 1: Now what was Port Huron [Michigan] like? I mean, what was the community like, because it's sixty miles, you said, north of Michigan?
Speaker 2: North of--it's sixty miles north of Detroit [Michigan]. It was pretty much a--it was a predominantly white town. I think when I was growing up, I think the population was about fifty thousand or so, I think. 'Cause I think it has shrunk and grown again over the years. But, you know, it was a hick town, and they had--most of the people there worked at the car companies in Detroit, or outside of Detroit. I don't think--there was no such thing as an industry.  Not there, not that I knew of. But we were right on the water on Lake Huron, which made it prettier, which wasn't for years later--until years later that I was able actually to see the beauty of it, because it seemed like a really hostile environment to me. It was either really hot, it seemed, or really cold, one of the two.  And we suffered when it was either. You burned up in the summertime because nobody had any air conditioner. You had to live for fans and the humidity in Michigan is really ridiculous. But, you know, I would say that--it was--there were a lot of rednecks there, definitely a lot of rednecks. But--back then it was something you just sort of accepted, but we didn't really refer to them as 'rednecks.' They were just 'white folks,' and when you said 'white folks,' you just sort of knew what that meant, you know. But I went to a predominantly white high school and a predominantly white junior high school, but, you know, we didn't really have any real incidents or problems, but it was the town itself. It was pretty segregated. I mean, black people lived in pockets.  We had certain parts of town that we lived in, and they weren't all ghetto either, you know.  Not at all. Even--even. And when I say, you know, like that--I mean, there was a poor part of town. Don't get me wrong, and I did live in one of the poor parts of town for a while when I was younger. But then times changed--and times changed. And I mean, we weren't living in the Bel-Air [neighborhood, Los Angeles, California] of Port Huron, but the toilet flushed--it was clean, you know. I don't think I ever had a paved driveway while I lived there, but I don't know if that was necessarily the standard.
Speaker 1: That sounds sort of the like town I grew up in Ohio, but-- .
Speaker 2: It was Ohio. I mean Ohio, Michigan, you know, Kansas, it's all the same. The Midwest, it's all the same and a lot of it is still like that, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, how much was the black population in your town?
Speaker 2: I don't know how large it was, but it wasn't large. I would probably say about five percent, if that. If that.
Story_ID: 18678
Speaker 1: Now, what I'm curious about, though--where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: In Port Huron [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Cleveland Elementary [Port Huron, Michigan].
Speaker 1: And what--but one picture that I saw, it's all black kids except one white--.
Speaker 2: Go ahead, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: In the classroom.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that's what's so strange. My second grade teacher, Mrs. Hurd, was black. I think my kindergarten teacher--I think her name was Mrs. Johnson, the woman in that picture. When I was in kindergarten--when I was in the elementary school--we did live in an area that was predominantly black and the one little white girl in that picture, Kathy [sic, Eva], she was what would be called 'white trash.'  I think she lived in a trailer to be honest with you and she used to come to school smelling like pee. I'll never forget it. And I remember the day we took that picture, too. We couldn't believe how clean she was. It was so nice to see because when it was nap time, nobody ever wanted to sleep next to her. She wasn't the only one there smelling like that though. She was not the only one. I always liked that little girl, though, you know.  And she--if I remember--she--she didn't realize she was the only white kid in the class, and I don't even think we brought it to her attention because I don't think we paid any attention to it either. We were just kindergarteners. 'Cause I'm telling you, when you just told me to look at the picture, I didn't even realize that she was the only one in the class. That was forty-five years ago. It didn't--I never even paid any attention to it and really that's how it should be.
Speaker 1: It was just--it just struck me, you know, because I'm looking at the picture. So, you--was there anyone else? Did any of your teachers influence you in that elementary school?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Hurd and Mrs. Malachi. They were both black too. I think because it was just--you know, I mean, I'd only been in school two years, kindergarten and first grade, but I knew then that, you know, they placed a lot of importance--they basically seemed to mimic, in some ways, my mother [Madeline Tillman] and her attitude towards learning and education. But the difference is they were a lot gentler about it and soft-spoken, and it was kind of refreshing to be around them.  I mean, I loved my mother. Don't get me wrong, I did. But when she told you to do something, it was like she just told you. However it came out of her mouth, that's how you got it and I was used to it. So to hear someone speaking gently and softly--and they got--they got results from me. But they just really stressed--they wanted us to know how smart we were. They wanted us not to think--and back then they used--we were 'colored,' and they used to say little things like, you know, "Just because you're colored, don't think you can't do this. Just because you're colored, don't think you can't that." And they would just kind of slip that in. And I think between them and my mother, over the years, that they had a really positive effect on me--among other kids, I'm sure.
Story_ID: 18679
Speaker 1: I'm wondering what type of child you were like--.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: What were you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I didn't get in any trouble. Well, yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: Were you outgoing? Were you, you know--were you talkative?  Were you shy? Were you a dreamer? Were you--?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to lay--lie up in my room and daydream a lot about getting the hell out of Michigan. Seriously, because I could not stand that place. It was ugly to me. Even though--that's what I'm saying--it took me years to realize how pretty--I mean, even though we had boats and things downtown, we had a bridge, a drawbridge. And I mean, now, it's like I realize it really is a pretty place. I just--I did not see the beauty there because there was too much violence. I saw too many--too much violence, and I didn't know a whole lot of--quote, unquote--happy people and it kind of just wore me out, as a young person, seeing all the domestic violence and there was lots of it. And again, I know now that it had to do a lot with alcoholism. I mean, a lot of that. But as a child, I was an adult. I had a lot of responsibilities because my mother [Madeline Tillman] had five kids [Edwin McMillan, Vicky McMillan-Banks, Crystal McMillan, Rosalyn McMillan-Smith] by the time she was twenty-three and as many husbands, but only one father for us [Edward Louis McMillan].  And she would work and so someone had to be there to take care of everything and that was me. So from, I mean, a very young age, I was doing--washing clothes, cooking. You know, I cooked my first Thanksgiving dinner when I was twelve and I'm talking turkey, dressing, sweet potato pies, potato salad, and collard greens, if I'm not mistaken and it was good. My mother was a little jealous, you know. But, you know, I just kind of took it all in stride. I had a big mouth. I mean, I had a big mouth and I think I was bossy. I'm still bossy. I was bossy, yeah, but I didn't have a choice. I had four sisters and brothers, and in order to get them to do what I wanted them to do and what they needed to do--because if they didn't do what they were supposed to do, I was the one that got my ass beat when my mother got home, okay, and I wasn't having that. So the bottom line is is that, you know, I wasn't like my teachers at school. The polite thing didn't work with them, so I would just threaten them, you know, or just tell them "You better do this, you better do that, you better do this." And sometimes I would beat their ass too to stop mine from getting beat, even though my mother never really beat me, you know. I can count how many times--I don't even think my mother ever really spanked me, to be honest with you. I can't remember. I think I got a spanking once, but it was the threat of it that would do it for me.  That was enough 'cause I'd seen everybody else get beat and I didn't want to go that route. I did get beaten once. I remember because I still have that little horseshoe on my leg from where she whopped that switch after me and that was enough for me. I think I was twelve or something, and I still have that mark, you know. And I told my mother as years went by, I said "Look what you did to me. Look what you did to me." And she said, "You better be glad that's all I did," and then we'd laugh about it, you know, because it's not like she did it on purpose. But I was a cheerleader. I was the first black cheerleader in my high school [Port Huron High School, Port Huron, Michigan], or was it junior high? I think it was high school. I know I'm getting old. I'm getting it mixed up.
Story_ID: 18680
Speaker 1: You said that you experienced a lot of violence and your parents [Edward McMillan and Madeline Tillman] would fight a lot, right? But you said also violence in the town.
Speaker 2: No, not in the town.
Speaker 1: But in home.
Speaker 2: In other people's homes. I mean, I was just aware of it, in my own family and, you know, you know, you'd always hear on a Monday when you went back to school whose parents were fighting and, you know--. I mean, kids too. We'd fight too, each other. It was really ridiculous, and I never--I never really understood what it was proving.  Even then. I never understood and I had to fight a couple of girls just to prove whatever--that I wasn't afraid, when, in fact, I was afraid. It was really stupid.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when your parents first fight--fought and how that made you feel?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't remember the first time, but I--it was enough of them. Who knows when the first one was. But the thing is is that one of the things I really remember is I couldn't stand the noise. I couldn't stand the sound of things being broken and furniture being--knowing that somebody was being thrown up against the furniture and usually it was my mother. I couldn't stand the sound of broken glass or glass breaking. I just couldn't stand that. I actually would hide in a closet so that I wouldn't really have to hear it, and--but as I got older and my mother was going fight someone else or somebody else was going to do something to her, things changed. Then I got a little bolder, and I jumped in the middle of one or two of them. 'Cause one man had a knife, and I took it from him and put it up to his throat and asked him how did he like that. I don't know how I did it, but I picked him up and threw him from one room into another room, to a bedroom, and his head hit--you know bunk beds? You know they have those little metal bars? I don't even know how I did it, but you know they say people on the side of the freeway can lift a car? Well, it was one of those moments. Because he had a knife, he was--like he was going to stab my mother, and I said, "I don't think so."  And I'm standing in here and it's sort of like--because they always tell you in those days--and people still do it, "Get out of the room. This is grown folks' business, you know. Just get out of the room." And I'm like: "Oh, I'm supposed to just sit back and watch him stab my mother?"  No. And I will never forget that. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever. And I took that tip of that knife, because I was on top of him. I was fourteen, and I took the tip of that--and I said, "Move and I will cut your fucking throat. You know, you act like you want to touch my mama again and let me show you. How's it feel to be on the other end of this? What does that feel like?" You know. And again, it's alcohol-- alcohol behind all of this. This was the nicest guy, you know, he was the nicest guy, but he just--he was a different person when he drank. Everybody is, you know. But I don't--I had one man slap me as a adult. I mean, I tried to be careful about who I picked as my companions or partners and the bottom line is I'll tell you: "If you ever put your hands on me, you don't even have to apologize for it." Once, I'm out of there. And I had one man hit me once, and I was--he was gone 'cause I said it won't be a second time. And I don't care what the reasons are.  I don't care. There's not an excuse long enough. But you put your hands on me--because if you hit me once, you'll hit me twice, three times, four times, and I'm not going to kill anybody. You're with the wrong woman. And I made a bad choice, you know, because I don't--it's too many women out here who are victims. And in some cases, men too, you know. And we do ourselves more harm, it seems, and it's really sad.
Speaker 1: Do you think your mother was a victim?  Was she a victim?
Speaker 2: In some ways, yes, in some ways, no. My mother, basically, she fought my father. He didn't just beat her. She kicked his ass as a matter of fact, sometimes, you know. 'Cause we would sort of keep score. We could say, "Sounds like mama's getting the best of him out there." 'Cause sometimes it just depended, you know. She whopped him once with a frying pan. She got him good. And when he died, he had that same knot on his head (points to head). It was sad, but she stopped him from hurting her, you know. No, I don't think she was a victim, my mother--and I think she--she basically--she basically defended herself and--. I don't know, it was sort of like, back then, life was a war. It still is. And she did what she needed to do to protect herself, and she had five kids [Terry McMillan, Edwin McMillan, Rosalyn McMillan-Smith, Crystal McMillan, Vicky McMillan-Banks]. So she protected herself and in so doing, she was protecting us. And she also, in doing this--every time they fought, for the most part, it was because she was trying to hold my father accountable for his actions. That's all it boiled down to. She was like: "Be a man, live up to your side of the bargain," you know. And if not, then he'd drink, and he'd get pissed about it, and then they'd fight about it. And so her thoughts were, you know, "It's not my fault you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing." But of course, you know, it was hard for him too, but it was still us. So, no, I don't think--I mean, of course, she was a victim, but I don't think she saw herself as a victim.

Speaker 1: Your siblings--can you give their name and--I know you're the oldest, but can you give their name and order of, you know, the rest of them?
Speaker 2: My--I have a brother. His name is Edwin [McMillan]. He's a year younger than I am. And then I have a sister, Rosalyn [McMillan-Smith].  She's third. And a sister, Crystal [McMillan] and my baby sister's name is Vicky [McMillan-Banks].
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense--? Were you a typical oldest child in that you had most of the responsibility and you felt that responsibility?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I had all the responsibility. Yeah, I said that earlier, but yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Definitely. I was like their surrogate mom and they knew it. And I think to this day they still see me that way (laughs).

Speaker 1: I know you said you wanted to get out of--of--.
Speaker 2: Port Huron [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Port Huron. But I'm wondering what--what you would--would you dream of things or dream of what you wanted to be or were you that type of kid?
Speaker 2: No, I never had a clue about what I wanted to do when I--when I grew up. I didn't really know, not when I was a youngster. I would always--I mean, I watched a lot of television, and I remember watching '77 Sunset Strip' [TV private eye serial] and something about "Kookie, won't you tell me your name," or something [sic, "Kookie, Kookie, lend me your comb"]. And I used to always see it. And I used to love 'Adventures in Paradise' [TV adventure serial].  Those two shows used to do it for me, as well as 'The Beverly Hillbillies' [TV comedy serial] (laughs). But the thing is is that aesthetically, it was just, you know,  I loved it when I saw that big ship or big, giant sailboat, whatever it was in 'Adventures in Paradise' with  Gardner McKay, I'll never forget. And I just used to think, "Where is that?"  I mean, "Where the water is that blue and it is just beautiful." And then I'd see, obviously, Sunset Boulevard [street in downtown Los Angeles County, California] and it would be, you know, palm trees. You'd see California and it was beautiful. And all I knew was that there was another world out there. That's all I knew and Port Huron was not as big as it was. It got bigger than this, and, you know, I knew that people, you know--by the time I was sixteen I worked in a library. My first job was working in a library, and I knew that the world was big and that you could, in fact, find your place in it, but you had to do something in order to make that happen. And I'm not talking about fame and all that kind of business. I just mean that the way I grew up, under the conditions and circumstances, I didn't have to settle for that. Not at all. And I also don't mean that I just--I was just primarily interested or looking for fortune. It wasn't even about that. It wasn't about that. All I knew is is that this little place on the map--that just because I was born here and raised here, I don't have to--I don't have to settle for this. There's other places in the world to live, and when you grow up, you're free to choose. You're free to do and go as you want to. And I just knew as a young person that somehow that's what I was going to do. I mean, when I graduated from high school, I'd been working as a keypunch operator for Pacific Telephone or whatever it's called over there in Michigan, Bell whatever [sic, Michigan Bell; AT&T subsidiary, telecommunications provider]. And when I got paid every week, I'd give my mother [Madeline Tillman] a few dollars. I think I made $62 dollars a week, and I'd give her twenty and I put forty in the bank. Maybe I'd keep a few dollars or whatever. But by the time I graduated, I had enough money. I'd saved up enough money. I graduated June 14th. August 14th I was on a plane out of there. And I'd say I had $362 dollars or something like that to my name, and I left and I've never gone back. And I don't think it's a bad place, but I don't regret not going back there, because some places are oppressive. And to me it fits the bill. It really fit. It was oppressive to me. It doesn't mean it's oppressive to anybody else, but it was to me, like a lot of places in the Midwest are.
Speaker 1: But you know, I just wonder what was forming you as a person or what was occupying your time and attention. Were you a (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, I was--I had--I was antsy. I was discontent, as you would--as I would have to say it now. All I know is is that something was wrong with this picture, and it's the same reason why I write, something's wrong with the picture. But then I didn't know it. I mean, when you're younger, you don't really assess your own behavior, your own thought patterns. You don't think about it. All you know is that that's what you're doing. And so in fantasizing about living a better life, I'd fantasize about being in love, even though I didn't even know what that felt like. I just knew that it was something that you--that felt good obviously--'cause I'd seen it in movies. And so--that's really what it all boiled down to, because I wasn't sophisticated as a child. I mean, I wasn't abused. I didn't have--I don't think I had what the term now is called, an 'abusive childhood.' I wasn't emotionally neglected. My mother didn't--they didn't beat the daylights out of me. I was not sexually abused. You know what I mean? I didn't go hungry, you know. I saw some things I didn't like, and if we could have--if I could have changed some things about growing up, I would have, but it didn't happen that way, you know. And so I wasn't one of these children that was like--when I fantasized, it was about when I grew up and what I was going to come back and fix and do for my mother to make her life better, you know.  That was the way I looked at it, and all I knew is that--I knew then that you don't have to settle. My mother helped me understand that, and she used to say, you know, "Learn how to tell the difference between shit and Shinola [brand of shoe polish], okay. And get rid of the bullshit, and when you get rid of the bullshit, you'll end up maybe with something good. But you got to be able to spot it," you know. And just little things, you know. I always tried to look at things for what they really were, and up here (points to head), some other stuff was going on and there was this dichotomy between the two and that's what got me out of there. And over the years, I guess that's what caused me to write.

Speaker 1: You talk about the fact that--when you got your library job that--you said age fourteen?
Speaker 2: Fifteen. Maybe it was fourteen, 'cause I think, yeah. Fourteen, I think I had to get a work permit, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. And that you--that's where you saw the book on James Baldwin [novelist/essayist]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know what? I keep saying that, but you know, I realized that it wasn't--James Baldwin, that was like the first book. I don't even remember which James Baldwin book it was. I think it might have been 'Go Tell it on the Mountain.'  I don't know. I don't know when he wrote that book, but I know I saw his face. I don't even know--. It could have been 'Giovanni's [Room]'--I don't even know, but that's what looms large in my mind. But I was an avid reader then. I was just shocked when I saw here's this black face. You know, and then of course later on, I see Frederick Douglass [abolitionist/politician]. I mean, I found out about Countee Cullen [poet], et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, but it was seeing somebody really--I mean a black man's face on a book, I was, like, "Whoa. Why don't we get this in English class?" That's not what I'm thinking then. Maybe subconsciously I was, you know. Or--'cause I--it probably was because that's why I was taken so aback. You know, like, "Why didn't they tell us about him, you know." And I'm sure that probably--I mean, it kind of frightened me in a way because I didn't know exactly what this guy was talking about, but it was scary and refreshing at the same time.
Speaker 1: Now were you impacted at all about the activities around the Civil Rights Movement at all, you know. Like, the riots in Detroit [Michigan] when they happened or [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]  dying? Or any of that?  Did that impact you or was there any discussion, you know--?
Speaker 2: The thing that I--I was really young, but all I remember--I remember when Dr. Martin Luther King died and how sad everybody was. I remember I used to hear him on television and he used to scare me, you know. Just when--his voice, the way it carried and resonated. He just used to scare me. But it was like sometimes I'd go to church on Sunday and our preacher wouldn't preach the same way, and I'd think, "God, I wish he sounded like him," you know. But when I said "scare me," it wasn't like a bad kind of scare. It was sort of like he just aroused something, you know. But I didn't hear him enough and know enough about him except when--after it happened, when they started selling those clocks. They started selling these clocks with Bobby [Kennedy, political advisor/U.S. Attorney General], Robert [Kennedy, sic, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, U.S. President], and Martin [Luther King, Jr., civil rights activist/reverend]. Did you see those clocks?  Oh, they were grotesque. They were like this fake gold stuff that looked like lace--gold, and it was metal. It was just sprayed gold, and then it had like a clock in it and it had a picture of the three of them, a real picture of the three of them like kind of blending together. Every black person in Port Huron [Michigan], I think, had one of those clocks. You know, somebody came around selling them. And they represented a lot to black people. They represented a whole lot, and that's what--that's all I knew then because--I'll never forget my Aunt Jean who always cried broke, but she bought one of those. And there was a lot of people that didn't have any money, but they all bought one of those clocks. And they were all prominently--even though they might be crooked, they didn't--you know, they up too high, down too low, you know, propped up on something or whatever, but they were all prominently displayed. And of course, in retrospect, I know what it means now, but then I don't really think I did. It wasn't until 1969 when I moved to--I graduated from high school [Port Huron High School, Port Huron, Michigan]--well, I'll put it this way, I learned in my--in 1967, `68 [1968], the Vietnam War was going on. A lot of drugs. A lot of people were starting to use heroin and Malcolm X--I didn't know about Malcolm yet. If I did, it was vague. But all I knew was that there was this thing happening about black pride, and I found--the first thing I found out was that in 1968, my junior year of high school, I'll never forget it, that we didn't have to straighten our hair, that it wasn't a sign of beauty. You don't have to straighten your hair. So when I--my senior year, I went to my prom with an afro. My mother [Madeline Tillman] almost had a stroke. She was like, "Terry, please don't tell me you're going to your prom--I been waiting thirteen years for you, not to go with no nappy head of hair and blah, blah, blah, blah."  I said, "Mama, you know what? I am so proud to be black and I'm not straightening my hair for anybody," and I have never straightened my hair since then in 1969. I've not had a straightening comb in it or a perm to straighten it. And I don't knock it, but it was just something I knew inside--that I'm not straightening my hair, because then it meant a lot to me. It meant a whole lot to me--whole lot. And then plus--it just meant a whole lot to me.
Story_ID: 18684
Speaker 1: Let me ask one question. Did you--you were--were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: So your mother [Madeline Tillman], she was--she had high hopes for you, didn't she?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother had high hopes for all of her kids [Terry McMillan, Edwin McMillan, Rosalyn McMillan-Smith, Crystal McMillan, Vicky McMillan-Banks], and her hopes were basically--it wasn't even hopes. I don't think it was hope. No, I wouldn't say high hopes. She knew that we were all going to be a success at something, or she was going to kill us, you know. Because she used to say,"I'm not raising no dummies and whatever you do--." 'Cause even when we were kids, you know, she'd say, you know, "You don't half-ass do anything. If you're going to do something, do it right. Give it everything you've got. I don't care what it is," and she used to tell you that. "I don't care if you go--if I tell you to iron this shirt, don't half-ass iron it. Don't just iron the collar in the front just because you're not going to see the back. Iron a shirt right. You know, take your time and do the cuffs. Put some creases in the pants. If you're going to clean house, you know, move the furniture. Clean under the furniture. Just because nobody can't see it doesn't mean it shouldn't be clean." And so she helped instill in us a certain sense of pride, you know, that when you do things, you really do it with gusto. And so as a result, everybody in my family--we were all good students. All of us were good students. I stayed on the honor roll. Everybody, just about. I mean, she was right, she didn't raise any dummies. You know, I had a three point whatever [grade point average], and I got a scholarship when I graduated from high school [Port Huron High School, Port Huron, Michigan], and I turned it down. She was pissed 'cause it would meant--I would have had to stay in Michigan, and I was not staying in Michigan. So when I left, my mother was like not very--not hardly speaking to me. But I said, "You know what? I don't want to stay here. I will pay-- I will work and pay my own way through college," you know. So she knew--what she said to me by the time 'Waiting to Exhale,' you know, hit, whatever you want to call it--and she sat there one day tapping her foot. She loved to tap her foot. Oh, she would just tap, tap, tap. And she said (whispers), "I knew you was going to be something." And I'm looking at her and I said "Mama, what are you talking about?"  (Whispers) "I knew it. I always knew it."  And I said, "Yeah, you can say that now because--." (Laughs) She used to crack me up. You know, she--(unclear) they always act like they know they're telepathic. She wasn't telepathic--bullshit, you know. But the bottom line is is that she was--as the oldest, I think she just sort of--I think, what my mother had hopes of was that her children would grow up and find some semblance of happiness and success and not that the two were synonymous, you know. That they would find both in whatever they did.
Story_ID: 18685
Speaker 1: Now when you went to California [1969], can you talk about that? Because you just got on a plane and went out there. Who did you know out there?  You just went.
Speaker 2: A third cousin, a woman, her name was Sharon, and she was--she was like a distant cousin, but she used to babysit for us. And my mother [Madeline Tillman]--somehow--you know how you're the cousin of a cousin of a cousin, but black people all say "We're just cousins." So we didn't really distinguish between second, third, fourth cousins and all that. And she was probably about ten or twelve years older than I was, and she had moved to Los Angeles [California]. When, I don't remember, why, I don't remember. But she had said, you know, "If you want to come out here and live, you're welcome to come and stay with me." And I said, "Okay." But I had already called and we had talked about all this long before I was in my senior year, because I knew before I was in my senior year I was leaving. And so she had said I could come and live with her, and she just had like a studio apartment, yeah. And I lived with her for three months. I didn't last long. But when I was in high school, one of the things that I did was I took typing and shorthand, and I could type my butt off. I could type very, very fast. Like--it was like--I could type ninety words a minute and that was not on an electric typewriter, okay. That was one of those old-fashioned Underwoods [typewriter manufacturer] . And I took dictation. I could take dictation, like a hundred words a minute. So that meant, you know, I could get a job anywhere, and that's one of the things that my mother taught me how to do was be resourceful and so I said, you know, "When I go to California, at least I know I can get a job and make a few dollars and pay my way through college," and that's what I did--precisely.
Speaker 1: And your family joined you, right?
Speaker 2: About three years later. 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' [TV comedy serial]  that's what it felt like. I was like, "Oh, my goodness. Oh, Lord, have mercy. Here they come." And my mother rented a U-Haul [vehicle rental franchise] truck, wrote a bad check to pay for it, and the following morning, the truck was gone, and I had to pay to get it out. She was great. I loved her. I mean, that was kind of a cool thing to do. It was embarrassing as hell then, of course, and I wanted to strangle her, but my mother had personality and she had chutzpah, as they say, and she didn't care what anybody thought. That's what I loved about her.  She didn't care, you know. And she used to say "You're damned if you do, damned if you don't, so you might as well do it the way you want to do it 'cause people will talk about you if you do and talk about you if you don't." And I think she has a lot to do with one of the reasons--well, I mean I have my own personality but she, I think, has had a lot to do with one of the reasons why I can tell stories the way I tell them, in the voice I tell them in. Because if I sat up and worried about what everybody thought, Lord knows I'd be constipated. I wouldn't be able to say anything, or I would sound like Toni Morrison [novelist/critic/professor], or I would be imitating all the classics writers and stuff, you know. But my mother liberated me, and I thank her for that.
Story_ID: 18686
Speaker 1: When you're in college you get--you start--you go into a journalism program, right?
Speaker 2: No. Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, eventually, yeah. When I moved to Los Angeles [California], I went to a junior college, Los Angeles City College, and that's how I got really introduced to black writers. I mean, from the Harlem Renaissance, from Countee Cullen [poet]--I couldn't believe it--. But of course then I was not thinking about any writing. But I ended up, I think--I wrote a poem when I was there and this brother who--what's his name? Eric?  Who ended up starting--he wrote the TV show or the movie called 'Cooley High,' but he was doing a literary magazine at the time, and he was over at my little apartment, and he published it, to make a long story short. And I subsequently ended up applying to Berkeley [The University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and got in. I didn't have a major, but by now, I've sort of developed what was called a perspective, I guess, in that I realized, number one, that--when I discovered the impact of slavery--that it hadn't been that long ago and what all the implications of slavery were and the ramifications of it and how it really was affecting who we were as black people, whereas when I was growing up, I didn't even think about it. Nobody even brought it to our attention. We didn't have to think about it, you know. It was just--there were slaves, and they were like something independent and outside of us as black people. We weren't slaves They used to be slaves--we weren't slaves, and we saw them as two independent things  And then in college, I realized that the two were not separate--that I was who they were and that really blew me away. And so I started looking at my role and black people in the context of the world and our lot and how we were faring in it and I saw it as a really sad thing that a lot of us were victims of racism and--on a whole--on a major, major level and that some of us didn't seem to be aware of it. And as a result, there was a proliferation of drugs and it was acting--it was working the same as genocide because we were--it was a lot of negativity. I think we were dying and most of us were doing--we were killing ourselves. And that kind of frightened me when I realized that--especially after having gotten wind of Malcolm [X] and really, really meshing Dr. [Martin Luther] King's [Jr.] philosophy along with Malcolm's and realizing that both were valid. 'Cause I never really believed in violence, but I believed in what Malcolm represented and what black people could do for ourselves--that, I've always believed.  And I just--the consciousness that I developed as a result of listening to what he had to say, I think had a lot to do with shaping me and my belief system, because I realized how much power we actually did have if we were--if we allowed ourselves to and the power-- being a control over our own lives And--but first we had to stop feeling like victims and acting like victims. So with that I thought, "Well, gee whiz. I'll major in sociology and help save the world." That was my thought. And then I got to Berkeley and I took Harry Edwards [sociologist/professor], and he was so dynamic and I just loved that man.  And he was brilliant and he was just magnetic, and I couldn't believe--I hadn't met a black man that was this articulate face-to-face, you know, and I loved his class. But I realized that I could not save the world. That  became very clear to me. And as a result of my discontention, I started writing a lot and I would write these scathing editorials in reaction to whatever it was at the time going on: drugs, well, you know, the end of the Vietnam War, of course, because it was 1977, but just the aftermath and some of the things that just were going on, you know, in the Bay area  [California] at the time. But not just that, but things that had to do with being--that were racially--things that affected us, as black people, that I saw--sometimes we might not be paying as close attention to as--it would--that would be in our best interest if we did. So I would write these editorials. And people asked me to, that's the thing. I didn't just, you know--. So then when it was time for me to declare my major, my counselor or advisor--you know, you have to meet with them to discuss it and all that--he was like, you know--and I was still going to major in sociology, and he said, "Why?" And I said, "Well because, you know, there's something that I want to do that's more altruistic and--you know, I just--there's something in me that feels like there's something I should do," you know. And he said, "Well, you know, what about this writing thing?" And I said, "What about the writing thing?" I said "It's a hobby.  It's a hobby." 'Cause I'd written tons of poems--tons of poems and had a lot of them published in campus newspapers all over the United States, mostly black colleges and stuff. It was a little thing I was doing. But I didn't think of myself as anybody's poet. And the same is true with the articles that I would write. It was just a nice way to let off steam and back then I actually had a vocabulary (laughs), you know, I feel like I was a lot smarter then, to be honest with you.  But anyway, this guy says to me, "Well, you know, why does writing have to be a hobby?" I [sic, he] said, you know---"Why couldn't you think about--" I said, "Major? My mother wants me to get a--I need a job when I get out of here. Who--. What kind of job can I get majoring in--what do you mean writing?"  "Well there's always journalism and rhetoric and English." Well English--. And I said, "Journalism?" He said, "Yeah." And anyway, he said "Why don't you go home for a couple days and think about it? Just because it's easy and not difficult doesn't mean that you can't make a living at it. It doesn't have to be hard."  I said "I didn't say it had to be hard, but this is a hobby." So anyway, the bottom line is I ended up--I went home and thought about it, you know. And he had asked me a whole host of questions and that really caused me to think. And so I had to rule out rhetoric; I ruled out English because it was really a literature program. It wasn't really geared towards writing and I did not want to study English literature, American literature. I didn't want to--that's not the route I wanted to take, so I ended up majoring in journalism and didn't like that. I mean, I did while I was there, but the bottom line is is that I got so tired of answering the "who, what, when, where, and why," and then I found out when somebody told me about a class--Ishmael Reed [writer/lecturer] was teaching a fiction writing class and I found out you can lie and tell the truth, that--I was on to something.
Story_ID: 18687
Speaker 1: Now Ishmael Reed [writer/lecturer] had a great influence on you--or a good influence on you.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, because he was the one who told me that I could write, and at first, of course, I did not believe him. But Ishmael taught me about the power of fiction and basically it is sociology; it's anthropology; it's sociology; it's psychology. You know what I mean? It's theater; it's all of it. And, you know, Ishmael, being a great satirist, you know, I under--you know, he had a sense of humor. He had a personality. And he rejected a lot of things that we had been given in high school and I loved that about him. And so he also helped me to understand freedom about--in terms of writing in my own voice. And I will be eternally grateful to him for that, and he knows it.
Speaker 1: What do you think? Do you think you have found, under him, your own voice at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely, definitely.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the moment?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah (laughs). Well, I had written this story or maybe it wasn't a story, but it was something-- and he had said--we had to read in class--and this is early on--and he said something about--he told me after class, he says, "You got a great voice. You got a great voice, Terry." I was like (whispers), "Great voice, great voice, great voice." This is before we discussed what it was--even implied or inferred by it, and, you know, I have a deep voice and I'd always thought that's what people were referring to, 'til he cleared it up for me, you know. Basically he said, you know, like, "The way that you write is the tone. You sound like you. Don't lose that," you know. "Don't try to sound like anybody else. Write like Terry. Don't lose that." And I haven't and I'm not going to--.
Speaker 1: So you think at that point you were thinking--you still weren't thinking you would be a writer, though.  Do you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Lord no. I was not planning on--. Who knows you're going to--no. I was no prodigy, and I had no aspirations to become a writer per se. Even majoring in journalism, it was a way to get a college degree, you know, that--okay, I need to declare a major. Writing is something I enjoy doing. You know, I never thought I was going to get a job as a journalist. I didn't know what I was going to get a job doing. I really didn't,. And I really wasn't that worried about it, to be honest with you. But no, it wasn't 'til I graduated and I took about a year and a half--I took a year off and then, you know, I always loved the movies, and I was like this film buff. And so I loved the power of storytelling. But then, you know, I didn't know any of my--quote, unquote--and there weren't a lot of us at the time, contemporary African American novelists. There just weren't very many of us. And so I didn't think--even though I was taking a--writing short stories in Ishmael's class, it never occurred to me or dawned on me that one day I might actually be a writer. So I thought, "Well, you know what, maybe--?" And Ishmael also told me, "Don't go to any of these creative writing programs, Terry. It's a waste of time." He said "If you're going to write, you got to write. That's it."
Story_ID: 18688
Speaker 1: I applied to Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], and I applied to Columbia's [University, New York, New York] film school--to their film schools--and--because I figured: "You know what, there are a lot of ways to tell a story. And to tell a story on a big screen--movies that, you know, would have some meaning and some value and be entertaining and funny and dramatic at the same time. Yeah, I can do that. I can do that. I can do that." So I got accepted to both film schools and at the time I was sick of this boyfriend I had and one way to get away from him was to go to New York, which I'd always wanted to do anyway, so there I went to Columbia. And then I ended up becoming a member of the Harlem Writers Guild 'cause one day I was watching this show on television that John Oliver Killens and Gil Noble [journalist/producer], who had a show called 'Like It Is,' and he was interviewing John Oliver Killens [novelist] about the Harlem Writers Guild. And I was like, "I heard of that--." And I didn't even know it was still in existence. And he talked about how they meet and all this, and I had had--I mean, by now I've got a little suitcase of stories that, you know, I hadn't done anything with--these vignettes and all this kind of stuff. But also I'd written this story--short story--called 'Mama Take Another Step.' And so I called them. They said just send your work and we'll let you know if you get accepted. And I was like, "Well, okay." So I did and I got in, and I started meeting with this group of wonderful writers, some of whom are being published right now: Valerie Wilson-Wesley; Grace Edwards; Rosemary Bray, who works for--worked for 'The New York Times' for years and she ended up writing a non-fiction book; Arthur Flowers; my good friend who passed away, Doris Jean Austin.  A lot of really fine writers came out of there and the bottom line is is that I joined the group. They told me my little short story 'Mama Take Another Step,' when I read it out loud, was not a story. It was the beginning of a novel.  I didn't agree. I was scared. I went away to a writer's colony. Finished the story. It became a novel [entitled 'Mama']. The first publisher I submitted it to, they bought it. And then I suddenly became--I was a novelist, but then I had to rewrite it. So--.
Speaker 2: Were you sort of blown away by all that? That's all very quick, right?
Speaker 1: Well, we're talking about--I moved to New York [New York] in `77 [1977]. My first novel was published in `87 [1987], so we're talking about ten years. I went to graduate school and then I worked. I just had a job and I wasn't ready to leave it--it didn't even occur to me that I was leaving New York. I was a New Yorker by, you know, three or four years. It was like: "This is where I live." And then when I became a member of the Harlem Writers Guild, I think that was about `81 [1981] or `80 [1980]. And, you know, I just--I ended up--I mean, I was a member of the Harlem Writers Guild for quite a few years.
Speaker 2: Terry, tell me why do you think that group was important, and what was its history as a group?
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, Zora Neale Hurston--it's a lot of people affiliated with the Harlem Writers Guild and the whole period, you know, the Harlem Renaissance. You know, painters, musicians, writers, artists--I mean, painters--artists. A lot of stuff was going on then and the Harlem Writers Guild, itself, played quite a role, and I think it was historical--it was its historical and cultural significance that meant a lot to me when I got accepted.  I think I was prouder getting accepted into the Harlem Writers Guild than I was getting into Columbia University. It meant more to me and still does, to be honest with you. It meant a lot to me, especially at that point and at that time in my life. But it was just really nice to be--to sit around a table with eighteen to twenty--anywhere from fifteen to twenty-four other writers or so and be able to read your work out loud and knew that people were going to understand it and that you didn't have to explain a whole lot, and you didn't have to apologize for it. But they were critics and they were really keen critics and smart critics, and they knew what they were talking about, so it wasn't just a bunch of people sitting around stroking each other. They were very, very smart and very supportive, and we did it for each other. And I learned how to do that as a result of being a member of that organization.

Speaker 1: Now, when you got published the first time there was a whole interesting story about--well, you got the call and they said they were interested, but then you were under the assumption that they would promote it--the book ['Mama']. Did the name--? That's what I'm wondering, how did the name--how did it shorten? Was that part of the publisher's recommendation, 'Mama'? You know--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. They said, you know, "The thing is this,Terry, the title's a little didactic. You don't need to really tell her what to do. We know that's what you want Mama to do, but how about just 'Mama--' so we can see her take that step?" And I said, "Well, that makes sense," you know, but that was the beginning of--I probably would have ultimately shortened it myself had I just continued in the vein that I was in, you know. But I've always been open to what I would like to think of as constructive criticism and suggestions. If it seems like it's smarter or better or wiser than what I've done or seen, I'm open to it 'cause I don't always think my way is the best way, although some would beg to differ with that, but (laughs)--.  Basically, you know, my publisher was all thrilled and everything when they bought the book, and you know, at the time there were a number of other writers, Mona Simpson, Tama Janowitz, Jay McInerney. There was a--it was a whole host of writers, white writers, being published that were on the lecture circuit, the talk show circuit, and all this, so I just assumed the same thing was going to happen to me. That's how naive I was. And so when they bought my book and then I said, you know--like, I know I'm--I wanted to know where--how many cities am I going to and, you know, am I going on a book tour.  "No." And I was like, "What?" "No. We don't have it in the budget." And I knew then--I mean, I had already--I mean, this is like--I mean, it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure this out, but I was like: "Wait a minute I know I just moved here [New York, New York] from California where I didn't really experience what I would call overt racism, but this is it in the flesh, right here." And I was like: "I am not having this. If you guys think I'm going to sit--." And I told them I said, "You know what? Why is it that some of these--all of these other white writers are, you know, going on--." Oh, what was that show at the time?  Anyway, they were talk shows. And I said, "This isn't right."  "Well, Terry, we're going to see maybe what we can work out."  Well, this was June--like my mother [Madeline Tillman] always said, "Do it yourself." You know, you don't depend on anybody for anything. If you can't--if you got to wait around, do it yourself, and that's what I did. So I found out--because I've always been--I always want to know how things--what's underneath, okay. So I knew about research and this is long before the Internet. And so I went to the--I went to--I had a book--I had a book of my own called 'How to Get Happily Published' [Judith Appelbaum] and for some reason, something just ding, went off in my head. And I opened that book and sure enough there was a whole section in there about how to be your own best--your own publicist. And then there was an organization called 'Poets and Writers,' which of course, I knew about. And I looked in their catalogue also--I think this book referred to that. They had a book called 'The Business of Writing,' and so--in combining the forces and suggestions of both, I ended up sort of creating my own little marketing strategy whereby I basically wrote letters. And I used--I was working as a word processor and we had learned how to merge, and it was a sister who was the supervisor and they used to let me get away with stuff because I had a baby and all this. So the bottom line is I did all the work myself, but I did not try to shove my book down anybody's throat. I did it in what I thought was a very classy way and apparently it worked because the heads of some of the major chains, like Barnes and Noble [book retailer] or whatever, ended up calling the heads of my publishing company, the head of my publishing company and said, "Who is this kid? We like her--." Because all I did was introduce myself, I said in my second paragraph that, you know, there are horror stories I've heard about with first novels that nobody ever knows they even exist. And you know, I'm hoping not to be one of them, basically. And then the next paragraph--I just--and I said all I'm hoping is that you just consider ordering my book for your store Then in one paragraph I told what the book was about, and I thanked them. That was it, you know, and I did it to about three thousand buyers--all the university bookstores, African American bookstores, at the time weren't very many of them, and all the chains and all the rest of the independent bookstores. And I did the same thing--they had, it's called a reading series where all the universities and places where you can read from your work and they pay you. So since my book was being published, I used that as leverage, so I wrote this letter and I sent a sample chapter. And I wrote a--I just reworked the same letter that I submitted to the buyers, and I was faxing--or not faxing, because at the time we didn't have fax--I was sneaking and have it messengered over my itinerary to my publicist, okay. And it ended up--and I was getting paid for these readings. And I mean I couldn't believe, I would get like five hundred for a reading and four hundred dollars and I mean I was making that a week. And I was like--I could just--. And they would pay my airfare.  I was like, "Whoa." I told my son, I said, "Solomon [Welch],  you're getting some chicken hot dogs this week," you know.  It was great. But they got really upset with me and we sold out of the first printing before it was even published, the book was published, because all these letters, the bookstores started ordering the book, okay, because the sales reps that go around to the bookstores, they weren't pushing it. And my publisher--when they started realizing the sales, they were like "What is this child doing." And then when the book came out, I told all the public magazines that were interviewing, I told them all--I told them the truth I said, "They did not put their money where their mouth was, so you know what?" You know, I wasn't saying that I had written the treatise of human nature here with this book, but all I'm saying is this, you know, I put my heart and soul into it. They acted as if they were excited and thrilled to publish it, but then they didn't want to do anything to promote it. If nobody knows it exists, how are they going to know to buy it? And back then, we didn't have bookstores--African American bookstores in every city where they could prominently display a book. It wasn't like that, you know, you had to rely on these folks, and I said, "No, I don't think so--."
Speaker 1: Now, so they were upset, is that--.They were--they were upset about that, though, that you had done that, even though they were selling. Did they get that upset?
Speaker 2: No, they were upset because I made them look bad. That was it--I made them--. And the way I--when I was questioned about it, I told the truth. I said, "They did not put their money where their mouth was. They acted enthusiastic about my book and then they didn't want to spend any money to promote it, but there are other white writers out here--." And I said it point blank. "There are white writers out here, whose books are no better written than mine, that they're going to fifteen and sixteen cities. They're on talk shows, okay."  And back then, I didn't even know about Europe, you know. And I said, "Don't treat me like a stepchild." I just--I have a problem with it. They should never have bought my book if they weren't going to promote it. I didn't even know there was such a thing. I said, in fact, "I think it's bad business practice to buy something and pay for it and don't promote it." I said "What if it was toothpaste? What if Crest never spent a dime advertising? Do you think we'd be using Crest?"
Story_ID: 18690
Speaker 1: 'Disappearing Acts' had done really well, and I was in my publisher's [The Viking Press] office in New York [New York] and he says, "So, Terry, are you thinking about your next book?" And I had already thought about it. And they said, "Well, what are you thinking?" And I said, "Well, I realize that, you know, most of my girlfriends--" because I was about thirty-four or so.  I said, "Most of my girlfriends, we are educated. We can take care of ourselves. We're independent. We're outgoing. We're not necessarily a zero on the Richter scale of how we look. We're attractive. And the one thing it seems that we all have in common, none of us are married, which we would never have dreamed in a million years that we would be at this point in our lives, and we sort of followed the rules. We did it by the book, and we can't get a date on a Friday night with somebody who's intellectually stimulating, sexy, interesting, maybe a little bit handsome. It's hard and I don't understand why, and I would like to explore it." And they said, "Well, okay." And that's how 'Waiting to Exhale' came about, even though I had come to this conclusion on my own and I knew the title 'cause I said,  "That's all we basically are trying to do. We just want to--we're waiting to exhale." And I didn't know it was going to be such a phrase over the years, because that's exactly how I felt, you know. And that's how I knew it was the title. So fast forward the film. The book comes out in May of `92 [1992], but before the book comes out, my editor tells me "We've got a bestseller on our hands." And I was like: "Please. You know, you don't know. You know, how can you determine--? How can you guesstimate what's going to be a bestseller? Get real." Well, it became a bestseller, and I was still a little shocked. I was shocked at how that book took off. It was really kind of--it was exciting at first and then as it just kept going and going and going. And then when the paperback auction happened--when Oprah Winfrey [talk show host] calls--and Oprah was still a big deal then. You know, 'The Tonight Show.' I was like: "What is going on here?" And then the paperback auction sold and it was like I was the second highest ever paid and I was like, "What? I didn't even know this." I was like--when it was sort of over--it's still not over. I was exhausted. I was drained. I was depressed because all of a sudden I'm rich. All of a sudden I'm famous, and I hadn't anticipated being either and especially in a matter of weeks. And then people just started descending on me. Everybody wanted a piece. I mean, it was amazing how your life can change, and I didn't like it. I really didn't like it. I did not like it. You know, I always wanted my work to get the attention, if anything, and it didn't have to get that kind of attention, you know. And then, you know--as subsequent years--what the book represented, and then when the movie rights sold and then the movie became a success, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And then they started giving me all this credit for what started happening in the publishing industry, what it signaled to the publishing industry, which I did appreciate, but I still didn't want to--I still couldn't take the credit for. But the bottom line is is that all 'Waiting to Exhale' did, to me, for publishing was just--it was like a wake-up call to the publishers that, you know, black people do read. We've always read. We just read your books, because we didn't have as many. And now somebody has written one, in a contemporary--a contemporary story in a voice that they relate to and a story that obviously they relate to. And so they just came out in huger--bigger numbers. That's it. We've been reading all along, okay, but they wanted to give me the credit for it. I did not want to take, nor do I still take credit for it, but I just say, "Okay, I helped contribute to making publishers very--much more aware of the fact that black people do read." Okay. And--(pauses). I'm proud of that.
Story_ID: 18691
Speaker 1: Wasn't this a validation when you sold, you know, for the movie rights ['Waiting to Exhale']? What--because you had gone to film school and I was just wondering if it represented a circle to you at that point.
Speaker 2: The only thing that represented a circle to me at that point was when the movie came out [1995], 'cause I co-wrote the screenplay with [Ronald] Ron Bass. I didn't write it--I wrote it but, you know, Ron sort of structured it and all that. And because at the same time when I was at Columbia [University, New York, New York], I had--that was my first real what I call experience in racism, institutional racism, because I had this Czechoslovakian screenwriting professor, and not only that, but Milos Forman was the head of the department at the time and it seemed like every week when it was time to work on our little school budget--budgeted projects or whatever, you know, my friend and I, who were black, her name is Deborah Robinson, she and I, and there's another girl whose name I can't remember--there were only like four black people in the program--we could never get equipment. We always ended up with the equipment that was out-dated, out-moded, didn't work, was broke. Something was wrong with it. And all of a sudden there were--you know, Milos Forman was working on 'Hair' or whatever--and there would be this list on the board and it would already be filled up. And we were like, "When did we--did we miss the sign-up opportunity," you know. And I knew then something was going on, okay. So when I was in the screenwriting class, my professor told me and it was this African brother, pulled us aside and made us read Jack London 'Sailor on Horseback: [The Life of Jack London],' [London biography by Irving Stone] and then when we go back into his office, he wanted to know how we felt about it. And I said, "I want to know--" because I found out he only gave it to the African brother and myself. And I said, "You know what, this is really kind of tacky." I told him. I said, "Why did you just give that book to us?" "Well, you guys are the ones who really want to be screenwriters, and I just wanted you to know how tough it is in California if you really are serious about it." And I said, "You know what? I came to this graduate program--. This is not what a graduate program is supposed to be. You're supposed to be encouraging me, not being discouraging. Why didn't you give this to everybody in this fucking room--in this classroom? Why didn't you do that? Why did you single us out? You don't have to tell me.  I already know." But I said, "You know something? My mama [Madeline Tillman] taught me everything in life is hard, but that doesn't make it impossible, so thank you very much."  So when my movie came out, payback is a bitch. That's how I look at it, you know. That's exactly how I look at it, you know.  I'm serious. And that's why even after 'Mama' was published, you know, my publisher--they were all: "Oh, well, Terry." And the publicist--and God bless her, she's a nice person and all that--but she said, you know: "I won't work with her on her next book." Well, she didn't have to, you know. And she made it seem as though I embarrassed her, you know. I didn't mean to--intend to embarrass her and the bottom line is that she wasn't in the position at the time--I didn't realize it--she didn't have any power. She wasn't the one who, you know, dictated what the budget was, but she still could have said something, you know. And I mean I understand now this whole pecking order thing, but, you know--it's, you know, sort of like old boyfriends. They always want to come back.
Speaker 1: So were you happy--you were happy with the film, I take it.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is is that the book meant more to me than the film. The film meant more on--in terms of--in terms of--just the power of the media and what black people--'cause black people turned that book into a movie. They're the ones who made it a movie, you know. 'Cause there are other books written by other black authors that would have made better movies, but black folks made this bestseller--this book a bestseller and because of that, it became a film. And I thought it was a--I enjoyed the movie, and everybody had a good time watching that movie, you know, except for the brothers, who thought I dogged them. And it set up some things, you know. But it was entertainment. It was Hollywood, you know. That's what it was.
Story_ID: 18692
Speaker 1: Now, how about 'How Stella Got Her Groove Back?'  I mean that--you said you went into depression after--.
Speaker 2: After my mom [Madeline Tillman] died, yeah, and my girlfriend Doris [Jean] Austin died.
Speaker 1: At the same--around the same--?
Speaker 2: They died a year apart. And I wish they could teach a class in grieving, you know, teach you how to do it and put a time limit on it, but they can't, and I didn't know that. So finally, you know, the world pretty much knows that I got tired of being sad, and I put myself on a plane and went to Jamaica for a week. And while I was there, I met a younger man [Jonathan Plummer], and I just decided to go ahead and have a little fun, and I did. And something else happened, it wasn't just fun, and I didn't realize it until I got home, and I was like, "Whoa, Terry."  And it wasn't like I was desperate. It wasn't even about that. And he and I continued to talk and I would say, you know, "This is a little weird." And the next thing I know I'm writing this poem and I tell this young man, I said "You know what? I think this is like illegal and I'm old--I'm too old. I'm too old. This is ridiculous, blah blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah." And he said "What's so ridiculous? What's so ridiculous?" So I started writing this poem--I write this nine page poem and I said "You know what, this does not make any sense to me. I am like so confused, but this feels so good and I don't understand it. And when I do that, I usually write about it, but I can't write about it because I don't want to tell your--" and he says, "Well, you told me that you lie when you write, so just lie."  And I did. And, you know, the part in the story that's true is me going to Jamaica and meeting a younger man, but I made it up. You know, I mean there are certain little nuances in there that are pretty accurate as far--just little things, you know. But the parents and all of that stuff. But I was there so it was easy to manipulate the space and all that. And I wrote that book basically to give myself permission to go ahead and enjoy this man, regardless of what he--how old he was, you know, because I thought--it made me think more about double standards--the double standard and how men basically do whatever they feel like doing and they don't even think twice about it. And I couldn't understand why I was feeling so guilty and I really wasn't doing anything wrong. It wasn't like he was twenty. I lowered his age in the book intentionally to make it more risqué. But also, you know, the story for me was about people who make choices that they wish they could change. And women, in particular, who have high-power jobs in high-power--in--in these professions where they've been educated and they're on the fast track, and then they get there and realize: "What the hell am I doing here. This is not fun. This is not gratifying. It is not as meaningful as I thought it was going to be. It looks good on paper, but this is not working for me emotionally, spiritually. I'm not getting shit out of it." And so they have to make choices and they say, you know, "I reject this." And that, to me, is what the story was really about. That was what it was really about for me. It was about freedom and a right to choose your own path and your own happiness, regardless of what other people think.
Speaker 1: I mean, a lot of your stories come from your personal life, as people do--you know, I mean there's the whole pattern of everything from 'Mama' all the way, you know, through. But did your husband mind the fact that he was sort of in a fishbowl? I mean--okay, the previous relationship had minded because he had tried suing you.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, he tried suing but the bottom line is is I had pretty much done the same thing. You know, everything that he seemed to assert was accurate was a lie--was a lie. He said, you know, "She said I did this, and I did that, and I did that, and I did that, and I never did this, I never--yeah. I never did this. She said--I never did this, I never did that, and you know, I never did that, I never did this." And the judge says, "Well, you know, that's why it's fiction."  The bottom line is is that, yes, I was involved in a relationship with a man like him, who was a construction worker, but the events and the sequence of events and the situations, I made them up. And he said that's how people write stories and a lot of people don't understand that. And a long, long time ago--a lot of people think--the idea is to get them--people to believe it, that this really happened. And of course, with 'Stella,' because people knew I went to Jamaica, they really bought into this, okay. And I tried to tell them. I said, you know, "This is as close as I've gotten." Jonathan loved every minute of it. He became a celebrity, you know. You know, he thought of himself as this--you know, I portrayed him as this sexy, young, you know, black Adonis. You know what I mean? And so when we would go--when the book came out, we'd go to read--he'd sign the books too. He loved it. He had never gotten this kind of attention, you know. And these women were drooling over him, you know, like "Golly, do they have any more--? Do you have a brother?" He loved it and plus Jonathan knew what was made up. He knew what was real and what wasn't real, so he just kind of loved it. And plus it would be different if the male character in the book was the source--was the antagonist, but he wasn't. He was not antagonistic, so what did he have to complain about?  His privacy wasn't violated 'cause I didn't tell the truth about who he was. Not at all. It was all a big lie, and he knew that, but he loved the residual. He loved the effects that--you know, people thinking that it was him. It was good enough for him. He loved the attention and it was good--I think it was healthy for him, you know. I think it was healthy for him. He grew up fast--faster than he probably would have because he had to learn how to, you know, field questions himself, deal with the public, all of that. And you know, he had a little bit--he was not--quote, unquote--I mean, he was naïve about some things, but he wasn't a youngster. I probably would not have been attracted to him. He wasn't--he wasn't the same as your average early twenty year old--I say early twenties, not twenty year old--in the United States. He was a lot more mature and poised and graceful, and he didn't even behave like somebody in his twenties. His mannerism wasn't the same. It was obvious to me that he was, but he doesn't--didn't even--his whole thing was just different and still is.
Speaker 1: So what is the real story?
Speaker 2: What real story?  The real story of him.
Speaker 1: You said it was all made up.
Speaker 2: Oh well, he didn't go to medical school. I mean, when I finished that book, the way I ended it was that they were getting married. That book came out in `96 [1996]. Jonathan and I ended up getting married--this is 2002. We'll be moving into four years. We've been together seven going on eight. I can't believe it. The real story is I'm not telling the real story. You know, that's our private business, you know. But he did not go to medical school.  Not--no. I think in the book he was going to be a chef. I don't remember, but he's a pet groomer, opening his own business.
Story_ID: 18693
Speaker 1: Which of your--your books are you happiest with?
Speaker 2: I think 'A Day Late and a Dollar Short' is--next to 'Mama.'  But they're books in the same vein, you know. They're familial, about the family, and I think I just--I like the interplay between the characters because it was very, very realistic to me--what can sometimes happen in a family, and family is important to me and to us--to me--as a black person. And the breakdown of the family in this day and age is such--is in such a state that it was important to me to write a story that could show the breakdown, how a family can break itself down, but what we have to do to hold ourselves together, because we're all we have. That was--that's probably why it's important to me. And that you--family is the one thing you can't get back. You can get another husband, you can get another boyfriend, but your family, you can't replace them.
Speaker 1: So what do you think you--so you have other stories, obviously. Are you working on something now?
Speaker 2: I'm working on a book now, a couple of them. Stories and a novel.
Speaker 1: And how do you work when you--? I mean, what is--'cause your lifestyle, you know, is--do you spend a lot of time speaking and a lot of--?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head, no)
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I limit it because I have a child [Solomon Welch] and I've had him for about eighteen years. I pick and choose when and where I travel. Sometimes, you know, when a book comes out, you have to do a book tour. Solomon is my son. He's pretty much aware of that and he knows that when a book comes out, but even when--since he's school age, I've done it so that I'm only gone a week at a time and then I have to come home for a week, or at least I'm home long enough that I can cook him dinner again and give him his hugs so that my absence isn't so large. And especially--it was especially before Jonathan got here because, I mean, I've always had really good friends who always seem to have children Solomon's age that when I'd go away, you know, I didn't have to worry about him, you know, who was going to take him to school. So he didn't really feel like abandoned. At least he hasn't acted as if he has. But it's few and far between. I don't travel all the time. People think that a lot of times. Even people think that about movie stars and musicians, and in some cases it's true, but in a lot of cases people don't understand, you like normalcy, you know. You know, I pride myself on being at home, which I do spend a lot of time at home, but every now and then--it just depends. It just depends. And I just got back from Spain and I was there for a week, but my book came out in Spain and it's March. In September my book comes out in France, so I'll go over there for a week, but my son will be in college then. But I've said--I turned down a lot. I have over the years just because--I mean, there are certain things I'm not missing.  I'm not missing birthdays, holidays, recitals, track meets, basketball games, soccer games, little league games. I'm not missing them. I just would not miss them, so--you know. And a lot of times a lot of things--and my son knows that I said no to these things because of him, and I wanted him to know that I've said no, because I get offered a lot of money, a whole lot of money to just show up. And I just wanted him to know that he's more important.
Speaker 1: You have a great love for your son. It comes across. A great love.
Speaker 2: He's my sweetheart. He's my chocolate chip.
Speaker 1: He seems like your best friend, too, in some respects.
Speaker 2: No, he's not my best friend. No, he's not my best friend.
Speaker 1: (Laughs)
Speaker 2: No. Let's be clear about that.
Speaker 1: There's a parent-child relationship.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) He is not my friend. I like him and he likes me, but he is not my friend. He can confide in me, which of course he doesn't do. But, no, he is not my friend, but I love him and I like him. I like the person that he is becoming, and I'm very proud to be his mother.
Speaker 1: And as a single parent, how have you found that whole process?
Speaker 2: You know, I think, to be honest with you, I've thought of my--I think I was--I think of myself--I would like to think of myself as a good mother. My son has told me that I'm the best mom he's ever had (laughs). Literally, he has said that in my cards and he doesn't even know what he said. I think that--I wish that he had had a father who was there for him, particularly when he was younger, but he didn't. But he had me and I was his mother and I was his father, and in some ways, I think he's probably better for it because I made sure that he got the stimulation--male stimulation that he needed. And I think--the things that I've instilled in my son in terms of his value system, his sense of morality and justice, and just being a good person, and understanding the role that respect has and pride and all that and having a good heart and all of that, you know, and I'm glad I gave it to him. I'm glad that he was, you know--as a single parent, it helps if you do have money, but only if the money itself is just--what's the word I'm looking for--. The only thing that the money has helped us do is be more mobile, because he wasn't a spoiled rotten little brat like some people think, you know. He says--I--he said no, he's had to earn everything, just about, that he's gotten, like everybody else. But--I don't--I don't--. My son has been able to travel to different parts of the world. That's what the money has done. The money has also afforded me an opportunity to make sure that he was in good hands when I wasn't around. But other than that, I do--I think I've done the same thing and had the same kind of concerns like everybody else. And I personally have not thought that being a single parent was all that hard. I can't imagine--when I--when I look at parenting--children of two-parent households, it's almost the same. The women still do everything. They do everything, you know. And it doesn't mean that there are households where fathers don't, 'cause I don't--but the majority of them--you know, when I was at those soccer, little league games over the years, the little junior basketball games, the fathers show up for the games, the mothers are the ones that take them to practice. Now, it doesn't--I mean, I'm not knocking it, but I'm saying that, you know, a lot of times dad was at work. But sometimes now mom and dad have to go to work, but mom is still the one that's doing the driving, you know. And I said, you know, that's one reason why when you look at every major football game and basketball game and the Super Bowl when they put the camera on those guys, who do they say hello to?  "Hi, Mom" (waves and smiles). They don't say hi to their wife. It's always mom and most of them grew up in households like this. And I just think that, you know, they call us matriarchs like it's a bad thing. But the bottom line is is when you have to do it all, you learn how to do it all.

Speaker 1: Do you think success has changed you? Has it changed Terry McMillan?
Speaker 2: I would--I don't know how to really answer that question except for the fact that I've always had the same heart and kind of spirit that I have. The only thing success has really done and money has done for me is probably made me more guarded. Fame and all of that stuff, you can't separate them. You're not quite as trustworthy because people--everybody seems to want something from you. And it's like if somebody says, "You know, Terry, you got a minute?" I know something's coming. It's either money, time, or they got a book. "Can you read it? Can you do this? Can you do that?"  And it's like you're constantly imposed--your time is being imposed upon, and everybody thinks that you're there for them. They don't really think of you as having a life of your own--that you do the same thing that they do. They think just because you have money that you don't have problems, or that you're just as free as a bird, you know, that you don't wash dishes or you don't do the laundry, you know. They just think that you don't have a care in the world, that you just come and go as you please and jump in your fast car, you know, that the housekeepers do it all, which they do, but they don't do it all, you know. And in that sense, that part of me has come up to--come to the fore. But I know what success is. It's a temporary thing and it's a stamp that they put on you. And I don't really take it that seriously as far as when I define who I am as a person. I didn't do it when I first wrote my--when I wrote my first novel ['Mama'], and all the success of the other books doesn't make me feel more successful, not at all. And plus, I do believe in my heart that, you know, when you get this kind of spotlight and attention, then use it for something good because everybody doesn't get this kind of an opportunity. Everybody doesn't have the light shining on them. And so do something good with the light, you know. And I would like to think that my work is doing that. I mean, I'm not changing the world, but I would like to think that my work has a positive effect on some folks' lives, you know, that it's not just--quote, unquote--entertainment, because there's a whole lot of other things they could do to pass their time. But I'm grateful that I've been given this blessing, even though sometimes it's a curse. And I know that I'm blessed, believe me, because it didn't have to happen this way, not at all, not at all. And plus, I know other writers who write better than I do and authors whose work I really, really admire and love--that--their work may never garner the kind of attention that mine has. And mine has for a reason, and I don't want to abuse that.
Story_ID: 18695
Speaker 1: What other writers would you--are the ones that you admire?
Speaker 2: Oh, Randall Kenan, Diane McKinney-Whetstone, Valerie Wilson Wesley, Walter Mosley, Bernice McFadden, the brother who wrote the 'The Intuitionist,' which--.
Speaker 1: Colson Whitehead.
Speaker 2: Colson Whitehead. There's another young brother who wrote a book called 'Ten Seconds' [Louis Edwards], and, you know, Trey Ellis. I mean, there--these are up and coming writers. Jacqueline Woodson, who writes young adult books. She's really a fine writer. Martha Southgate. There are some really fine young writers. I mean, I've got shelves of them. But--and if I ever get my website up and going, one of the things that I'm going to do on my website is promote other authors, young up and coming authors, since I know people will hit mine. This way--you know, 'cause it occurred to me when I'd go to order a book through Barnes & Noble [book retailer] or Amazon [online bookseller], you know, when they tell you, "Based upon your ordering habits, here are some other books you might like."  And I'm saying to myself, "How do they know? Who do they think they are they're going to tell me." "People who ordered this book also ordered these books."  And I said, "Talk about a damn good marketing strategy," 'cause sometimes, I have actually ordered those books, at least one or whatever. And I'm saying to myself, "That was pretty ingenious, whoever thought about that--thought of this," okay. And so it occurred to me when I was thinking about doing my own website, I said, "You know what? There are millions of people that read my books, and if they ever could tap [www.]terrymcmillan.com and get something," (laughs). I said, "You know what?" because people are always asking me, "Well, who do you read? What do you like?"  And I said, "You know what?"  You know, I was a judge for the National Book Award, and I was really pissed that, you know, how few books there were by people of color. And there are just some really fine writers out here, not just black writers, but young writers. And--but I'm talking mostly about writers of color, that somebody needs to know their work exists, especially the ones that are good. And they deserve a bigger audience. And if I can help them do that, that's what I'm going to do.
Speaker 1: Well that's--I mean--that speaks--says a lot. And I think about the fact that you did the anthology [Breaking Ice: An Anthology of Contemporary African-American Fiction] at the time that you did the anthology, just--other people could have just been continuing to enjoy their own limelight.
Speaker 2: I wish I--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Not using it as a stage to introduce other people.
Speaker 2: I wish I could do it again, but this isn't the time, you know.  It's not the time. And I don't even know--. There are also a lot of bad writers out there, a lot of them, who because of that 'Waiting to Exhale' book, you know, publishers jumped on the bandwagon and they started publishing everything and anything. And it did a great--a grave disservice to a lot of the young writers whose work deserves the attention and the big advances that some of these folks got who don't even know how to write a declarative sentence, you know.  And it's sad. But now, instead of an anthology, to some extent, they have websites. I don't quite mean it that way, but I have an idea for a kind of an anthology, but one that's ongoing.

Speaker 1: If you had anything to do to change the world of publishing, what would you do?
Speaker 2: If I wanted to change the world of publishing. Well, first of all, I think that editors need to be paid a lot more money. And if they were paid more money, there would probably be more people of color doing it because there are a lot of young black editors. You know, there's a woman, Martha Southgate. I don't know if you know her work. She's really a good writer. And she went to the--is it the Radcliffe Publishing Institute [at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--years ago, and she's now a novelist. But she was editing. She edited for 'Essence' magazine, and she was a book editor. But you starve to death. A lot of editors are rich. Their parents are wealthy, most of them. They can afford to take those jobs, most of them, you know. "Oh, I'm a Vanderbilt, or I'm a this, or I'm a that," or whatever, you know. They can afford to take those jobs, because you don't make any money being an editor. And I would--I think that if it was--if it were, in fact, more lucrative, I think that more black people would probably go to some of these publishing institutes and embrace it. And thereby, we probably would see a little difference.
Story_ID: 18697
Speaker 1: What do you think--what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: (Pauses) That I was an honest person and a good mother [to son, Solomon Welch], and I tried to tell honest and compelling stories that I thought represented black people in a manner that would offer us hope.
Speaker 1: One last question. What are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: I hope that as a--as a race of people that we continue to reinvent ourselves, that we continue to realize when we do ourselves more harm. And to stop destroying our lives and blaming it on others. I--I think more for a lot of the young people, the hip-hoppers, I'll be glad when the gangster rap changes to something more affirmative and positive. You can still be angry. I'll be glad when we as a people have more pride, the kind of pride that Malcolm [X] wanted us to have and exhibit and display in our behavior and our--just our behavior and our lifestyle so that we don't have to be afraid of each other, so that you don't have to worry if your kid's going to be dead at twenty-five, which is ridiculous. And I just really hope that the young kids stop killing each other. And I'll be glad when they realize how ridiculous and how senseless it is, you know. That is what eats me up, you know. 'Cause, you know, I mean, my son is headed for Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California]. It didn't have to work that way. He could be a crackhead. He could be a gang-banger, you know. But I prided myself on trying to raise him in such a manner that he would find learning exciting, that he would test himself and take pride in being the best that he could, the way my mom [Madeline Tillman] basically taught me. But I just added to what she taught me, and I may have given it to him a little softer, sometimes not. And I wish for--for our community that more parents would take parenting more seriously and realize that what we give our children lasts the rest of their lives, you know, from the way we love them or don't love them, from the non-attention that we give them to the abuse to all of it. And everything that we do they see, and we don't think this adds up to something, but it does. And that's why we end up with such screwed-up adults, because they had screwed-up parents. So if you don't know what the fuck you're doing, don't take the job.
