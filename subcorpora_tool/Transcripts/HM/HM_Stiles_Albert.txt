Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm gone tell you something--I--do you know I haven't taken a vacation in the last thirty years. The only time I consider myself taking a vacation is when I went to Las Vegas [Nevada] to visit a couple of guys that I started in the business-- Checkmates [music group].  I was out there four days.  I consider that a vacation.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was just this past year, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or, or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I've got quite a few but I have a philosophy that I think is very important.  And my philosophy is to live according to your means--,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --And to be--I always think that people, if they want to be successful, there's certain things that they need to do and, if you form a habit, make sure it's a good habit.  And another thing is to be dependable and my daddy [Daniel Stiles] used to always tell me, "A man without a word is no man at all."
Story_ID: 13470
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your background.  Can you give me the--please give me the names of your parents and their birthdates and where they were born, if you know.
Speaker 2: Well, my daddy's name was Daniel Stiles, S-T-I-L-E-S.  My mother's name was Leona Stiles.  My daddy was born in Florence, South Carolina, and my mother was born in Nassau.
Speaker 1: Nassau, in the Bahamas?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, did, did your mother have a story about how she--about her family history and where her people came from, and how she, she came to (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Well, my mother's father, he was a very talented guy because he built yachts.  Very good, talented.  He built a yacht for one--I don't know whether it was Theodore Roosevelt, the one of the old presidents.  Then he built a yacht for the guy [Henry Flagler] that owned the Flagler Railroad down on the East Coast.  I don't know if you every heard of him, but he was a big millionaire back then, you know.  He built a couple of yachts for them and then he built yachts for a lot of wealthy people.  He was very good, talented.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was a skill he brought with him from Nassau?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that's how the family came to the United States?
Speaker 2: I think so, I'm now all that sure, but I think that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever get a chance to meet him?
Speaker 2: My grandfather?
Speaker 1: Mh-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure!  Sure.  He practically raised me.  When I was a little boy, he was up in age, and so my mama and them, used to--he used to babysit me when my mama and them would go out.  And boy, he told me a lot of worthwhile stories that helped me to develop myself, you know.  Because he used to tell me--he'd say, "Son," he said, "I want to tell you something."  He said, "There's three things you need to be careful about."  He said, "That's women, gambling and whiskey."  And, I been real careful most of the time about it--I had a good family.  I raised two boys and I was married and I had a lot of respect for all that because I think that--and I know, and I think this is the reason why I was successful with the Talent Factory [program teaching inner-city youth the theater arts] because I had a good upbringing.  My, my people spent a lot of time trying to train us because for you to leave Tampa, Florida at eleven years old and take a kid nine, and go to New York City [New York] without any supervision is a very good thing.  It tells that you had a lot of good guidance, you know.  So there was a lot of things out there that could have tempted me, but I just had that instinct that I wanted to be somebody, you know, and do something worthwhile, and that's what I did.
Story_ID: 13471
Speaker 1: So did your grandfather tell you about his--any of his ancestors and the Bahamas or did he ever talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he talked about it a lot, but I don't remember a lot of the stuff that he told me.  But, you know, he, he dwelled on the now of things, you know.  That he knew I was going to have to confront because he saw all this talent in me, and so, you know, people have a way of seeing these things way ahead of time, you know, and if you have certain talents some people just recognize them right away, you know.  Most people round my home thought I was gonna be a preacher (laughs) because I had that, that way of convincing and talking to people and gilding people and drawing people to me, see.  That was one of my, my big things that, that I dwelled on a lot.  I used to--I remember when I was a little boy.  I use to have a bunch of kids around me all the time and I'd be on the soapbox and I'd be telling them about things.  And when I, when I think about some of the things that I was talking about--I was talking about the presidents and stuff but I was a little boy!  And I remember I said--I remember this just as good, I used to tell the kids--I'd say, "You know, it's a shame that we have to live under discrimination."  I said, "But I tell you one thing, if we would ever get a president who would stand up and say that it was wrong to discriminate against people, I think something would start happening."  And the night that I heard President [John F.] Kennedy say that, cold chills ran all through my body because I had always believed that it has to start at the top, see.  We had to have a president would stand up and face all of the people and say this is wrong!  And that's what happened.
Story_ID: 13472
Speaker 1: So what about your father [Daniel Stiles], now?  Did your father have any stories about his ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well yeah.  My father didn't, my father didn't go no further than the third grade but see, what made a lot of difference with us was my daddy's father was Dutch and his mother was a slave, so my daddy had a sense of knowing what was right and what was wrong and he had a very big heart, you know.  Everybody loved him because he was a humanitarian, you know, in his own right, you know.  I seen him do some unusual things, you know.  And that--I remember my daddy used to get us together and if he get laid off from his job, he'd call us all together.  He said, "Look kids," said, "we gonna have some tough times," said, "but the Lord's gonna take care of us."  And I'd see people pull up to my house in big limousines, man, and get out with arms and arms full of grocery, you know, and I say, "This is what my daddy was talking about," you know.  All those things had an effect on me, you know.  And I, I think--I admired my daddy because my daddy--everybody loved him.  He was one of them type of people that could draw people to him and he could tell people what was right and they would listen.  I've seen the times--we was living--we had our own home and on the street where we lived there was nothing--on one side the street was chitlin' houses and on the other side was people that owned their own properties.  And I've seen--there was some bootleg joints across the street.  And we lived in this environment. And I've seen people fighting over there across the street and my daddy would go out there and say two or three words to them and it was all over, you know.  That's the kind of--and I remember, people respected--I noticed this--people respected us because we could--if they'd be raisin' hell on the other side of the street and to see one of our kids come out on the--"Don't you see Mr. Stiles's son out there?" or "Don't you see his daughter out there?" you know.  This is the way--and these was people that didn't care about nothing but they had that respect and I always thought about this, and I'd say boy, that is somethin', that we can be--and, man, everybody around Tampa [Florida] knew the Stileses.  We was somebody, you know, 'cause we didn't--we didn't act like we was any better than nobody but we--it was something about my family that had that certain thing that people cling to, you know.  Everybody when they'd see us, they'd want to be around us or talk to us, you know.  And that's what happening right now.  Everywhere I go, man, somebody comes up and starts talking to me, you know.  And I thank God for that.  It's a blessing.  And I know in my heart that people look at me and they don't want to believe that I'm as old as I am because my mentality does not dictate a old person.  It dictates somebody that's still viable and trying to do things, and that's the way I feel.  That's the way I act.  And so--people just--when I go out in the street, man you'd be surprised if you traveled round--I go all over town every day.
Story_ID: 13473
Speaker 1: My business [Al Stiles World's Best Shoe Shine, Fort Wayne, Indiana], part of it runs--I go out and I buy used shoes and I sell them and people use to say to me, say, "Man, you a, you a celebrity, why you want to shine shoes?"  I said, "Man, I love to shine shoes."  I said, "Ain't nothing wrong with me shining shoes.  I said, "I make money.  I don't have to be begging.  You don't see me running round here borrowing off of people and stuff."  I'm independent but in my own rights, you know.  I do what I like to do.  I like to shine shoes.  I like to take old things and make them look good.  That's a hell of a thing, man!  And I do it!  I, I don't never--if a guy's shoes come in--I remember I use to see shoeshine stands where they had different price shines, you know.  I don't have but one shine, that's a good shine.  I charge two dollars for my shine, you know.  See them people that came in the door there?  They just had some shoes in here last week, him and his wife, you know.  And so, people think of me--it's just like--I used to own a record shop here, and I kept telling everybody, I said, "I'm gonna get a program on the radio."  "Oh, oh, they ain't gonna let you have no--."  I said,  "You watch me."  And I kept going down there, going down there, and going down there, and one day the guy say "Al, you gonna give up."  The last time I was down there I said, "Man, you gonna have to let me on this station because time is gonna demand it."  And he called me down there one day--and, you know, he say, "I thought about what you was saying."  He said, "I believe the time is right."  He said, "I'll tell you what I'm gonna do."  He say, "I got a proposition for you."  I said, "What is that?"  He said, "If you can sell the time, it's yours."  I looked at him, I said, "Is that all I have to do?"  He said, "Yeah."  Man, I put me a little package together and went out and sold that time, and back then man, people round here didn't--black folks didn't believe in advertising.  They didn't need to 'cause we all lived right in the same neighborhood and if you--if something was gonna happen all you had to do was put it on the telegram poles.  Everybody in town knew, (laughs) you know.  But when I went round asking people about sponsoring a radio program people thought I was crazy.  And I, and I broke it down, man I--when the guy told me that I had to--I said give me a, a, a--a rate sheet.  And when I looked at the rates of the time, I took--and I said, "Alright."  And so I bought, I bought fifteen minutes, myself.  I said well I'm gone take fifteen minutes right now.  And I went out and broke that fifteen minutes down, and put my little program together, and I went round and that made nobody didn't have to 'cause I knew it was gone be hard to get people to spend money for advertisement because they didn't think they needed it.  Okay, so I went round and I broke that down and each person didn't have to pay very much.  They would say, "Well Al, I'll just do it to help you out."  I said, "Well, that's a good enough reason.  Thank you."  And so, I knew if I got them on that program, I had them.  'Cause I knew I was gone put on a good program, see?  'Cause I like music, and I know music, and its been my life.  So, man, I put that program on there and I called it 'Red, Hot and Blue'.  And we had, we had gospel, jazz and blues.  And man, you'd be surprised.  The people started listening to that program and, so, then, after it was on about three or four months, I went back and I bought ten more minutes.  Went around--everybody was glad then, 'cause they saw--you know, they hear their name on the radio and everything, you know.  And so, when, when, when I went back around, I didn't have no trouble getting that little extra, see.  I went back and then, then I had twenty-five minutes.  So the program was such a big success that the guy called me down there one day and he said, "Al, you know what," he said, "I can't hardly believe it."  Said the, "The mail has been pouring in.  We've been getting a real good response." He said, "I'll tell you what I'm gonna do."  He said, "Since ya'll have--you don't have but twenty-five minutes, and the program goes off at twelve," so that broke that hour up, see. So he had to--when I would go off, he had to pay some--a DJ to come in and run the program 'til the station closed.  He said, "I'm gonna give you the rest of that time."  So then, I had twenty-five minutes.  I had a whole hour, but I only paying for twenty-five minutes.  But all of that was within the things that was creative about me, you know.  And I'm not hesitant to say that.  I did a lot of creative things that I know because everything that I try to do, I try to do something different.
Story_ID: 13474
Speaker 1: What did your father [Daniel Stiles] do for a living?
Speaker 2: My daddy uses to be a night watchman at the hospital, and he also worked at a pawnshop downtown.  He worked two jobs.  And my mother [Leona Stiles], she was very creative.  She used to do all of the curtains for the hospital.  Plus, my mama was a seamstress and she was a pastry cook.  For a while there she ran the cafeteria at the school.  And she used to--she used to do all those curtains.  So anyway, my mother--during the [Great] Depression, I remember I use to have to take my wagon and go the soup line everyday.  That's all we could do, man.  That was bad, man.  Lot of people don't, don't realize we are almost facing another Depression.  People don't realize it, but I do, 'cause I lived through one, you know.  And people are not thinking about how rough times can get but if you--if you notice everywhere you go now, prices have just gone out of sight, a dollar and half for a bottle of water, man.  Don't that make you think (laughs)?
Speaker 1: Now, sir--,
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Did your mother and father have a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: No, I never remember them talking about that.
Story_ID: 13475
Speaker 1: Can you tell us some more about some of the sights and sounds, and smells of growing up in Florence, South Carolina?
Speaker 2: (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Or how long did you stay there?  Did you stay there long?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember too much about South Carolina 'cause I left there when I was a year old and we went to--my mother [Leona Stiles] and them moved to Tampa [Florida].  My daddy [Daniel Stiles] use to work--,
Speaker 1: Okay, so you grew up in Tampa?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my daddy used to work on the railroad.  He used to cook on the railroad.  And they had those called shanty cars, you know.  And so I don't know too much about that because, see, I was only a year old when, when we came to Tampa.  I don't know how long he worked on the railroad after we came to Tampa, but I know that's what he used to do.  So, my mother, now, she was a very creative person.  She could make hats, she--I remember when we--during the [Great] Depression they gave us those big old bags of flour, and the government gave them out.  And my mama would take them bags and bleach them, and she used to make pants and shirts.  My mama could sew, but she made our clothes most of us, you know.
Speaker 1: Out of those flour sacks.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Story_ID: 13476
Speaker 1: What kind of things did you do when you were small?
Speaker 2: Oh I was very--I was very creative myself because I remember I started me a little business right out in front of my house.  I built me a little stand.  And I built--I did a pretty good job on building it, because it stood up under all kind of bad weather.  But, I made quite a little bit of money, because I used to--my mama [Leona Stiles] used to make me a freezer full of ice cream on the weekend.  I sold ice cream, and I sold pop, candy.  And I had one of these gallon, gallon jugs like, and I had a little whiskey glass down in there, and if you drop a penny in there, if it go in the glass, you get a nickel, see. (Laughs) I was a little hustler, man.  I shined shoes, I sold papers, and I did all kinds of stuff.  And I remember--another thing that I remember 'bout my daddy [Daniel Stiles]--my daddy had that inkling for making money.  We supplied all of the bootleg houses with flasks.  You know they made bootleg whiskey back then.  We supplied them with the flasks.  We'd get them flasks, go home and wash them real good take them and sell them for a penny a piece.  A penny was money back then, you know.  And so, I remember my daddy used to go down to the railroad and they would give him those crossties ever so often they'd pick them crossties out and put new ones down.  And they would give my daddy the crossties.  He'd get a--hire a truck and bring them crossties home, so we had one of those long saws, a man on each end, and I remember me and my brother [William George Stiles] used to saw them up into blocks and back then everybody used coal--wood, you know, or coal.  And, we, we set, we cut them into blocks and then we'd take the axe and split them up and we sold wood, man.  We sold paper, we sold rags, we sold all kind of stuff, you know.  But that's where a lot of my creative ideas come from in trying to earn money.  And my daddy used to always tell me, said "Look, son," said, "I want you to learn how to, to be independent and work for yourself," and he instilled this in me.  And that's what I been doing.  Although I had a family, and when I came out of the Army I could have went back out there, and got with [musician] Pearl Bailey, and all of them, 'cause I was working with those people when I went in the service, but I stayed here and raised my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was making $750 a week when I went in the service, you know.  That was a lot of money back then.
Story_ID: 13477
Speaker 1: I remember when I was a little boy, my--a lady asked my mother [Leona Stiles] if I could be the ring bearer for her wedding, you know.  So my mother was real excited because she knew I was talented and so she always wanted to show me off, you know. So she sat down and made me a little satin suit and got me some white shoes, and man I went down the aisle with that ring and I stole the show, man.  And so, it got to be so good that everybody, when they would have a wedding, I was all ready--had my costume and everything so people wanted--everybody wanted me to be the ring bearer.  So I became a professional ring bearer, you understand me (laughs). I made me a position, man.  I was proud of myself, you know.  And I, I had--every weekend, practically, I had a wedding somewhere, you know.  And so all of that grew into the fact that I became a, a entrepreneur in my own rights 'cause then I began to realize that I had talent.  And so then when I went to Bible school, I put the, the--the professor of the Bible school asked me if I could put a little jug band or something together for the closing exercise.  And I told her yes.  So I put this little five-piece band together and we played, and everybody liked it so we just started going downtown playing and making money.
Story_ID: 13478
Speaker 1: All of these things, man, is part of what made me have this desire to do things and to get things done, you know, because I was a leader, you know.  I could--I could do things, and, and, and get peoples to follow me and lead so that's what made me--I was excited about my accomplishments, see.  And we [with childhood friend, Nathaniel Reese] used to go--then we started going over to St. Petersburg [Florida] and playing, and we'd go out on the beach, and we had a board we'd put down, and my partner would dance and I'd play the music and we'd pass our hat around.  Sometime we'd come home with two and three hundred dollars over the weekend, man.  That was a lot of money back then.  'Cause see, people didn't realize how that was going to accumulate because if you gave a quarter or fifty cents, you didn't have no idea how many other peoples was going to do that, you just gave it.  But when we counted all that stuff up, man, we'd come home, we'd have two or three hundred dollars.  And I remember one time we was playing out in West Palm Beach [Florida] and this guy hired us to do a party he was having.  He was a--he had a, a--a, an estate.  It took you five minutes to get up to the house so he hired us to entertain.  Man, they started drinking--and I could tell they was getting drunk because the guys started pulling the women's dresses up and all, doing all kind of rowdy things, you know.  And I got a little scared. I told my partner, I said, "Man, let's go out here on the porch and get some air."  We went out there and after we got out on the porch, we realized that they weren't even missing us because they was--all of them was getting high, you know, so I told him I said, man, "Let's go on and get out of here."  And so we walked all the way out to the--it took us five minutes to get out to the highway, man. That's how far--what kind a estate he had.  And we got out there and flagged a cab down and went back cross the lake 'cause we was over in Palm Beach.  We went back over into West Palm Beach and at twelve o'clock then when the new year came in, we was sitting on the steps of this church counting our money, man.  We counted out $365.  And we'd only been out there about a hour, you know.  That was a lot of money, man (laughs).  And you know how they gave us the money?  Everybody--every time somebody would give us a ten, they'd tear half in two and give me five and my partner.  If they'd give us a twenty, they'd just--and we had all this tore up money but we sit down there and counted it, and on the first of that, the week when we could go to the bank, we took all that money to the bank and cashed it in.
Speaker 2: Now, now, did you, did, did, did you ever give some of it to you family when you got back home?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. We, we, we did--that was part of it.  You know, we helped to support our families like that, you know,  'cause my daddy [Daniel Stiles] was--sometime he'd get laid off from work, and we, we--you know, we had--it was up and down, you know, like that.  But, now, my partner, his mother had eleven children.  And lot of them was like a stair, you know.  Some of them was real small and young. But, he, they--well, when he'd come home with that kind of money, they'd just take it and use it for the family, you know.
Story_ID: 13479
Speaker 1: Well, we're back to the sisters and brothers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, I had two sisters and one brother. And my oldest--my brother's name is William George Stiles and my oldest sister's name is Christine Kinsey. And my youngest sister's name is [Catherine Dyson]--I can't think of her marriage name--her name--we called her Kitty, but her name was--Damn! I can't think of that other name 'cause after she got married, I got lost on her name.
Speaker 2: That's okay, but you're number three, is that right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I'm number three.
Story_ID: 13480
Speaker 1: Now tell us about school.  Now can, can, can you give us the name of the school you went to and--?
Speaker 2: I went to Dobyville Elementary School in Tampa, Florida. Dobyville.
Speaker 1: Was that an all-black school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And I was pretty popular in school because I, I was always creative.  I had ideas about--and I did, I performed in a lot of plays and shows and stuff, you know.  And all of these things is what helped to create my desire more and more because the more I performed, the better I got and the more I realized that this is what I was--really liked to do.  This was my calling was to be and actor and all this, 'cause most people round my home thought I was gonna be a preacher because I was pretty good--I had a good gift of gab, you know.  I could talk to people and get their attention and I had that believability about me where people believed in me, you know.  And so it created quite a desire for me to spread out and everything.  So these are some of my characteristics.
Story_ID: 13481
Speaker 1: So who were some of your favorite teachers at school and favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: Well, I had one teacher that--her name was Miss Henderson.  She lived right down the street from my house and she knew my people, and boy she was hard on me (laughs).  But I wasn't bad.  But I was, I was so creative and everything that I couldn't go along with the general flow of things.  I had to always create something of my own, you know.  And she didn't like that because it was disruptive to the class, you know.  But that's the way I was in school.  And so then I had another teacher that taught history and I can't remember her name--but anyways she was quite a teacher.  I liked her.  We got along real good because I was always interested in history and stuff like that, you know.  So then, I had another teacher that taught math and we got along pretty good, but I was never good at math.  But I got--I was good with my teacher though.  Me and her got along pretty good, you know.  But I was never good in math.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I, I went to--I went to, to junior high school and I used to play in the band.  I played trumpet and I was also a drum major at one time and I was very active in school and plays and anything would put me out front the public, I was there, you know.  That was my calling.  And so, just like I said, I was always pretty popular.  People knew Al--well, I wasn't called Al Stiles but they used to call me 'Red', you know, 'Tampa Red'.
Story_ID: 13482
Speaker 1: I used to play baseball. I loved to play baseball.  I remember I was on a team called the Nebraska Giants.  And so we would go out--they had a sand lot--.
Speaker 2: The Nebraska Giants?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In Tampa [Florida]?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughs).  That's what--but they was good, man.  And so I wanted to get on that team and finally I got on it.  So, we would be playing and--I used to--I played first base for a long time, but I wasn't quite tall enough, you know, but I could play.  And I remember they put me in center field one time and there was a big tree way out in the, way out in the field, you know.  And so guy hit the ball and I was running backwards, you know, and I didn't even know that I'd caught the ball (laughs).  But anyway, boy, when I caught that ball them people--. And another thing they made me mad, see and when, when they'd make me mad, boy, I'd play up some ball (laughs).  They'd say, "Make him mad, now!  Make him mad!" (Laughs)  And I went on back and got that ball, man, and I held my hand back and I almost hit the tree. And so boy them people just hollered and screamed and all of this kind of excitement and things. Looked like everything that I was into I was good at it, you know.  And so, these are some of the things that has lived with me all these years, you know.
Story_ID: 13483
Speaker 1: When you were eleven years old, you and a friend of yours [Nathaniel Reese] went to New York City [New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you go by yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Daniel and Leona Stiles] know you were going?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you 'bout that story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  When we would go round St. Petersburg [Florida]--we used to go over to St. Petersburg we used to play a place called the Chatterbox.  It was a real exclusive place. And so everybody use to tell us--'cause we was pretty good for what we was doing.  Everybody would say "Y'all ought to get on the 'Major Bowes' Amateur Hour' [radio broadcast talent competition]."  So, I heard it so much I decided I'm gon' find out about the 'Major Bowes' Amateur Hour'.  So when I found out more about it, it used to come on every Thursday night.  And I wouldn't miss it.  I'd listen to it, 'cause, man, I could lay up there and be looking at that show--listenin' to it, and I could just see myself out on that stage.  And I made up my mind,  I'm gone be on that show.  So one night I was listening and my mama [Leona Stiles] came through, and she said, "Turn that radio off and go to sleep!"  And I just--I said to her, I said, "One of these nights you gonna be sitting here listening to me."  She didn't pay me no attention.  Man, five months later I was in New York broadcasting on 'Major Bowes' Amateur Hour.'  Now, would you believe that?
Speaker 1: Sir, now how did you get to New York to do that?
Speaker 2: Well, it was not likely that I would go up to my mama and say, "Mama, can me and Reese go to New York?"  'Cause she'd a knocked the hell out of me, "Get out of here, boy!  New York City!" 'Cause my mama thought New York was a very corrupt place, you know, 'cause she had never been there, but all she heard was about New York.  So anyway, I knew I couldn't just ask her to go.  So I put me a plan together and I made up in my mind.  I said, "Well, nobody don't believe that I'm going, but I'm gonna go."  And so, my partner, he wasn't but nine, and so he had not--.
Speaker 1: Sir, can you sit back a little bit?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: So, my partner wasn't but nine, so I knew I had an advantage with him because he just loved to dance.  And he could dance too.  And so his people, they had eleven kids, you know, so they didn't miss him too much.  You understand me?  So, I decided--I said, "I know what I'll do--."  'Cause see, when we was in Bible school we put this five-piece jug band together.  Well, so, every time we would talk about going to New York, the rest of the boys would say, "I wish somebody'd come along and take us to New York City."  So one day I said, "Man, y'all sit around here waiting for somebody to come along, we'll be here 'til we're old men."  And that was my way of looking at it. So, I said, "I know I ain't gonna be able to get these guys," 'cause I knew we had to do somethin' audacious in order to get to New York.  And so I just made up my mind. I said, "Well, I'm gonna go to New York."  So, one day I got up, and I had done made up my mind and I went down to my partner's house, Reese, and I--see, we used to go to St. Petersburg every year when school was out.  We'd go up there and stay about two weeks 'cause we would live with my cousin up there. So my mama would let us go, 'cause we'd come back and we'd have a lot of money, you know.  So, we--I figured, I said, "Well, now this is the time I can make like we going to St. Petersburg,  instead go to New York and my mama and them won't know."  So, they didn't expect us back home for two weeks, you know.  So I got up that morning and I went down to my partner's house, and I said, "Reese, come on let's go to St. Petersburg!"  And he said, "Okay, man!"  And we went down and got our tickets.  It wasn't but twenty-one miles from Tampa [Florida].  We bought our tickets, and got on the bus and went to St. Petersburg. But when we got there, instead of going to my cousin's house we--I told Reese, I say, "Hey, man, let's go to Jacksonville [Florida]."  I had a map, and I figured Jacksonville would be the next--it was about three hundred and something miles from Tampa and it would give us enough time.  We could sleep on the bus that night.  So I caught a late bus out.  And so I was doing all of this figuring, you know.  And so anyway, we got on the bus, and--no, we went out and made the money and came back and bought our tickets and waited for the next bus.  Got on the bus and went to Jacksonville.  Well, while we was on the bus, we was playing our music and we went up and down the aisle and took up collections.  Back then, if kids was doing something, people would really go for it.  So we'd make some money on the bus.  When we got in Jacksonville, we got off the bus.  And Jacksonville was a pretty good-sized town.  It was a lot bigger than Tampa.  And so we felt little funny when we got off the bus so, I took my map out and I said, "Well, we ain't gonna stay around here too long 'cause this is too big a city," you know.  And so, I looked on the bus and the next stop was Waycross, Georgia.  And I said to my partner, Reese, I say, "Hey, man, let's go to Waycross, Georgia."  He said, "I don't care."  And so--he was enjoying it, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause his mama and them wasn't worried about him, you know.  So--.
Speaker 1: Just a word, here.  Waycross, Georgia is Ossie Davis's hometown.
Speaker 2: Oh, it is?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.  But anyway, we went to Waycross, Georgia.  So anyway, when we got in Waycross, we wasn't too successful by it wasn't too many people around.  But we found out how much it was--I think we left there and went to Savannah [Georgia], yeah, Savannah was our next stop.  So we made enough money to go to Savannah.  And when we got into Savannah, I had some relations in, in Savannah that owned a theater called the Star Theater.  And so I started looking for them, you know, but I didn't find them.  But anyway, we stayed around Savannah for a little while until we made enough money to get out of there.  And then we went to Atlanta [Georgia]--I think we went to Atlanta.  But anyway we just kept on traveling like that.
Story_ID: 13484
Speaker 1: You was supposed to write--get an application and send it in [to 'Major Bowes' Amateur Hour,' radio broadcast talent competition]. And then tell them when you would be in the New York [New York] area.  And then they would get back and tell you when to come.  Well, we [he and childhood friend, nine year old, Nathaniel Reese] didn't do none of that.  We just went on. And when we got to Columbia, South Carolina, and I told--I, I--I think I sent a telegram home saying we on our way to New York. Man, my mama [Leona Stiles] and them, they was so--they run down to the juvenile authorities and everything.  But nobody couldn't catch us, 'cause no--we didn't even know where we was going (laughs).  So, they put the truant officers out on us, but they couldn't do no good.  But anyway we--when we left Columbia, South Carolina, we went to--I don't know whether it was Charlotte, North Carolina, but in the route to there we went to Charlotte, and we was at the bus station.  And so we stopped, we run into this police officer.  So he started talking to us and so we told him that we was on our way to New York to be on 'Major Bowes' Amateur Hour.'  So the way we told it, he thought Major Bowes had sent for us, see.  So anyway, we told him, said, "Turn your radio on Thursday night and listen to us," you know. We--that's how positive we was, man!  And so the police officer thought surely we was on our way.  You know, (unclear) we didn't even know where Major Bowes's studio was, man.  But this is what happened. So anyway, we went on and finally we wound up--.  My brother [William George Stiles] was working at the Chelsea Hotel in Atlantic City [New Jersey].  So somehow we went on--I wanted to stop through and holler at him 'cause I hadn't seen him for about two or three years.  And so, when we got to Atlantic City, we got off the bus and got a cab and told the driver that we wanted to go to the Hotel Chelsea. So he said, "Okay."  So he went around the block and pulled up in front of the police station.  He--and he, he told us, he said, "Y'all wait here, I'll be right back."  But when he came back out, he came out with a truant officer. So, they thought we had ran away from home, see.  So the truant officer told us, said, "Okay, you boys get out."  So they took us in and locked us up.  So we didn't know didn't know why they was locking us up.  But that's--we couldn't do nothing about it.  So that night--that next morning the lady, she was the matron of the jail--so, they--she, found out they had two kids in there, see. So, she wanted to talk to us.  So she came and let us out.  Our cell was right there and they had a table there where a lot of people would sit down and drink coffee in the morning, you know.  And so she let us out and she sat there and was talking to us. And so while she was talking to us, she kept looking at me.  And so I was telling her that my brother had come there to work for this guy at the Chelsea Hotel and that he was the head waiter.  So she, she kept looking at me like she recognized me or something, you know.  And so pretty soon she said to me, she said, "Did your brother come up here to work for a guy named Mr. Jones?"  And I said, "Yeah!  Yeah!"  She said, "Well, he live right next door to me!" (Laughs) I said, "Is that so?"  She said, "Yeah!"  So she got on the phone and called Mr. Jones and told him to put my brother on the phone.  And so, she told my brother, said, "We got your brother and his little partner down here."  Said, "Come down here and get him."  Said, "We thought they ran away from home."  So, my brother laughed, he, said, "No, that little rascal ain't run away from home." Said, "He got something up his sleeve."  He didn't know about where we was going, see.  So, he came down and got us.  Man, we was tired so--. He had worked all day so when he got through, he took us to his room.  See, he was rooming with Mr. Jones, but--and he was working for him.  So he took us to the house and he was going to let us sleep in his bed.  He was gonna sit up in the chair all night.  Mr. Jones came in that night and put all of us out, he sure did.  Called us a bunch of tramps and everything.  He was nasty.  And so my brother couldn't do nothing 'cause he worked for him, see.  And so, we got out, man.  And we walked, and we walked, and walked.  We was tired.  And so we started to go in this old empty house, but we thought that was too dangerous. So, we went--got down by the boardwalk, man, and we decided to go up under the boardwalk, like the bridge, you know.  And we went up under there and laid down on that sand and went to sleep.  Do you know the next morning the tide came in and woke us up (laughs).  So anyway, we went, we woke up and we got ourselves together.  And my brother had to go back to work, see.  So he took us back down to the hotel.  And he worked all day.  So that night we--this was on a, a Sunday, I think that was on a Sunday night.  We caught the bus out of there going into New York.  And when we--no that wasn't what it was.  But anyway, we wound up in New York on a Tuesday morning.  I never will forget that.
Story_ID: 13485
Speaker 1: But when we got off the bus, man, we [with childhood friend, nine year old Nathaniel Reese] didn't know, we didn't know nothing about New York.  So we went to the Chrysler Building, we was looking for Major Bowes.  They sent us over to RCA building.  We went over there, they sent us over to Radio City [Music Hall, New York, New York].  They just had us running back and forth.  So we was walking down Broadway [Avenue] and I remember that Major Bowes came on CBS.  So, we was walking down and I saw this building, and on top of it, it said CBS, and that, that struck a note with me.  And I said, "It must be somewhere close around here."  When we got down there at that theater where Ed Sullivan used to do his show from, it was right there.  And there was a sign in the window that said 'Major Bowes' Studio' and it had a point--arrow pointing up--fourteenth floor. And I told my partner, I say, "Come on man, let's go!"  And I had my guitar around my neck, and he had his gallon jug, you know.  We got on the elevator, man, and went on up.  And when we got off the elevator, Major Bowes had the whole fourteenth floor.  And they had a receptionist sitting right there at the elevator.  When we got off we walked up there, and we said, "We want to see Major Bowes!"  And she looked at us, she said, "You can't see Major Bowes."  I said, "Why?"  She said, "You can't just see him."  She said, "Where you guys from?"  "Tampa, Florida!"  We was just so--you know, we wasn't scared or nothing.  So she looked at us and she said, "How did y'all get here?"  "On the bus!" And we told her how we got there. She said, "Who's with you?"  "Nobody!"  She say, "You mean you all came all the way from Tampa, Florida by yourselves?"  "Yeah!"  We was, you know, we was just ready to go, man.  So I was, I would think that what happened, we was so--you know--and she, she probably called somebody and say, "We got two boys here from Tampa, Florida, and you need to see them, 'cause they, they must be pretty good 'cause they so confident," you know. "They not scared or nothing," you know.  And so, you know, she told us, she said, "Y'all go on in that waiting room and sit down."  We went in there and, man, we was talking to everybody.  People was asking us where we was from and we was talking, you know. And we was just so happy, you know.  And so (laughs), every time I think about it now, it was really something else to see.  And so, here's two little old guys all the way from Tampa, Florida, and they ain't afraid of nobody.  They talking to everybody, outgoing, you know.  And so, pretty soon I looked up at the door and this guy was standing there beckoning at me, and I (nods)--and he said, "Yeah" and then he did my partner the same, and took us down the hall, man, and auditioned us.  And when we got through auditioning, I knew we was gonna be on the show, 'cause he told us to back down there the next day at eleven o'clock for rehearsal.  And, then we were, man--got in New York on a Tuesday and we gonna broadcast on Thursday.  And so, I got, as soon as we came out of the studio I went and sent my mama [Leona Stiles] a wire, or did I call her?  I either wired her called her, and told her we gon' be on 'Major Bowes' Amateur Hour'.  Man, she got on her bicycle and went all over Tampa, telling everybody, "Turn on your radio tomorrow night!  Albert gonna broadcast on Major Bowes!"  You know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah (laughs).  That was really something, man. And so--,
Speaker 2: So she wasn't angry or anything?
Speaker 1: No, she wasn't angry no more. And she was so happy, man, because I think it dawned on her that I said that.  But when I said it, she didn't think nothing about it.  But I guess she said, "Well, he did tell me he was gone be on that program and here it is."  So she was so happy, man, she told us she went all over Tampa [Florida].  And so, back then everybody didn't have a radio.  So the night that we broadcast, which was on Thursday night, all over Tampa, man, people had their radios out on the sidewalk. And every--this was a big event for somebody from Tampa to be on 'Major Bowes' [Amateur Hour]' in New York City [New York]!  Man, this was a big event.  And so now we broadcast.  And you know we won first prize.  And Major Bowes sent us to the Pan- American Expedition in Dallas, Texas.  And when we came back from Dallas, Texas we didn't want to go right home because we had a little time before school was supposed to open.  So we asked him if we could stay around New York for a little while.  So he told us yeah, paid all our expenses.  We stayed there until time to go back to school.
Story_ID: 13486
Speaker 1: Where did you stay when you were in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughs) it was funny--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Did they provide any kind of chaperone or anything?
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you what happened.  We, we--we went and rented a room.  And back then, man--well, it still is now--a lot of those neighborhoods all of the apartments look the same, you know.  So we forgot to get the address.  So (laughing), we went back that night to go to, we didn't know which house we had rented and all of them looked so familiar. So, I remembered that the, that the--YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] was down on 135th Street [New York, New York].  So I told my partner [Nathaniel Reese], I said, "Let's go down to the Y, maybe we get a room down there."  So we went down to the Y and we walked in there and the guy said, "Where you guys going?"  'Cause they didn't allow kids in there, only at certain times, you know.  So, we said, "Man, we want to rent a room."  He say, "Y'all can't rent no room in here.  We can't rent to no kids."  I said, "Well man, we ain't got no place to stay.  We gone be on 'Major Bowes [Amateur Hour,' radio broadcasted talent competition],'" you know.  He say, "You gonna be on 'Major Bowes'?"  "Yeah!"  And so he said, "Well, I tell you what you do."  He said, "The lobby close at nine o'clock.  Y'all come back, and I'll see what I can do for you."  So we came back at nine o'clock and, you know, he put us in there on the pool table (laughs).  We slept on the pool table, we didn't care, man.  And so the next morning he come in there and woke us.  He say he had to get us off them tables before they opened up the lobby and everything.  So he come in there and woke us up and took us in grill, bought us some breakfast and everything.  And so we supposed to be back down there that day for rehearsal.  And man, we went on back down there.  Boy that was really something.  Really was.  And so, we--tell you what else happened.  While we was on our way home we decided we gonna stop in Washington, D.C.  I was always interested because I, I loved history, you know.  And I remembered a lot of things.  So I wanted to go in all the government buildings.  So we went into [U.S.] Congress that day, man.  We sit up in the balcony, you know.  And they, I never will forget, they was passing that first housing bill.  [President Theodore] Roosevelt had that housing bill.  And so, we was sitting up in there watching that.  So we ran into this guy, and he took a liking to us so he was going to show us around Washington, you know.  He took us in different buildings and everything.  So when we got through, he took us to his apartment.  So he was gonna let us spend the night, not knowing that he was going to try to take advantage of us, see.  But we didn't care.  We didn't think about nothing like that.  So the guy was real nice and friendly with us.  And so, anyway, when, when we got ready to leave Washington he went to the bus station with us and everything and wished us a nice trip home, you know.  And so when we got home, man, everybody--my house was full of people from all over Tampa [Florida], man.  They, we, we was coming home.  My mama [Leona Stiles] done let everybody know.  It was on the radio and everything that we'd be home, you know.  So, man, that was a homecoming, you know.  So anyway, when we got in home, and got in the house my mama, the first thing she asked, "Did you get the money we sent you?"  I said, "What money?"  She said, "The money we sent you!"  I said, "Aw, Mama, we ain't--you ain't sent us no money."  She said, "Albert, you mean to tell me you didn't send home for some money?"  I said, "No, Mama!  We didn't send home for no money!"  Man, this guy had done ripped us off.  He'd done, you know what he did? He must've went in one of our bags and got a letter from home.  I'm just speculating that this is what happened.  But this is about the only way he could've pulled that off. And so he, he must have had my mama and them address or something 'cause he, he sent this, this thing to my mama and told her that we was stranded and we needed some money, and told her how much the bus fare and everything was.  And my mama and them got excited, and they sent--my mama and his mama--they sent the money down there.  And so, when we got home, man, we went back down to--I don't know whether it was the Western Union, yeah, I think it was--but anyway, they described the guy that put that--and he had a boy--a kid with him, see.  So, this was one of the things that happened, man, and I knew that he was the one that did it.  But he got by with it.
Story_ID: 13487
Speaker 1: How old were you when you went to New York [New York]?  How old were you when you went to New York?
Speaker 2: Eleven.  I was eleven, my partner [Nathaniel Reese] was nine.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  When we first, after we, we would, we got home, we went back to school that semester.  And when school was out we took off and went right straight back to New York.  And so, when we got back in New York this time, we, we went to the--we got to the Apollo [Theater].  And by us already winning on 'Major Bowes' [Amateur Hour,' radio broadcasted talent competition], it was easy for us to get on at the Apollo.  So we was in the talent show at the Apollo, and we won first prize on that.  So, we won a--back then if you won first prize, you won a week's engagement with the next band all, every week they had a big band and a big show.  And you won a week's engagement in the next show.  So we won first prize and so we was--then there was Cab Calloway [performer].  So anyway, this is where, we stopped the show, man.  Nobody else couldn't get on.  That's the kind of act--we was very sensational, man.
Speaker 1: Now, what did your act consist of?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What did your act consist of?
Speaker 2: I played the guitar and sang, and my partner danced.  And then we'd dance together.  Then we did some comedy routines and stuff.  And the way--the reason why we was so good because we was tricky.  When the people would applaud us back, we would always do something funny, and they'd call us back, you know.  Like my partner would grab the wings of the curtain, you know, and shake his butt, you know, and then come out doing some funny things, you know.  We had all kinds of gimmicks that we did, and that's what made us so sensational.  People enjoyed us, man.  They wanted to see more, more, more.  And so, my manager, our manager [Nat Nazarro] was in there that night 'cause on Wednesday nights a lot of people from Hollywood [California]--that's where they discovered a lot of new talent was at the Apollo.  And all of the big producers of plays and stuff, they'd be there on that night.  And so my manager, he was there that night.  And so when he saw us he went backstage--Mr. Marshall was the manager and Mr. [Frank] Shiffman owned the theater--so he went back and gave his card to Mr. Marshall.  Mr. Marshall knew who he was, and he told him, say, "You have them boys to come down and see me."  And so when we came backstage, Mr. Marshall gave us the card.  He said, "Fellas, look,"  he said, "this is one of the biggest booking agents in New York City, see,  y'all--."  Said, "He's got--he had Buck and Bubbles [performers], Chuck and Chuckles [performers], Stump and Stumpy [performers], Pearl Bailey [singer], Redd Foxx [comedian]."  He had everybody, you know. And so he say, "Y'all be sure to go down to see him, now."  So we went down to see him.  But, anyway, what his gimmick was, man, he didn't talk to us about what his ideas was or what he wanted to do.  He just told us, said, "Tell you what.  I don't want y'all to play on the street no more."  Say, "Any time you need some money, whatever you need, come down and tell Miss Quentin and she'll write you a check."  That was nice man.  We'd go out to Coney Island [amusement park, New York, New York], and when we needed our clothes laundered and everything we go down there and she'd write us a check.  So we went like that and so then he, he didn't never tell us what his ideas was.  He just started doing things, you know.  Then he took us over to Roseland Ballroom [New York, New York], and he had a--rented a room over there for us to rehearse at.  Then he would send one of his top-notch acts over. Like, one day Buck would come over and work with us.  Another day Chuck would come over.  And then, different ones would come over, 'cause see we had a lot of talent but we didn't have it put together professionally, you know, where we'd go out on stage and do a real act, you know.  And so, he had us doing this--he was working with us, 'cause he saw all this future, you know.
Story_ID: 13488
Speaker 1: Sir, what, what did you call yourselves [he and childhood friend/entertainment partner, Nathaniel Reese]?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a funny thing, man.  We call ourselves 'Nat and Albert,' but you know what, the public named us 'The Tampa Boys'. Everywhere we go to do a show the people say, "Well, what's y'all name?"  We say, 'Nat and Al.'  They say, "We gonna call you 'The Tampa Boys'."  And that's what they'd call us.  So we just accept that.  We said, "Well, we gonna be 'The Tampa Boys', if this is what they want."  And that's what we was, 'The Tampa Boys'.  So anyway, Nat Nazarro [manager], he started buying costumes, you know, wardrobe for us and everything.  So we, we just go down there and we write a check, you know, whatever we want.  So, it started getting up in the money.  It got up to around twenty thousand dollars, you know.  And so, I didn't know what he had in mind but a lot of people had told me, "You better watch him," said, "'cause he'll get you."  And so because I was listening to what these people was saying, I started watching him. And so one day we went up there and we was just about ready.  He had our--we had our act down, had music and pictures and all this stuff.  And I knew we was ready for something, but I didn't know when.  We went down there that day and Miss Quentin handed me this I.O.U.  And it didn't have no, no amount of money or nothing on it.  And I say, "Miss Quentin," I said, "what is this for say?"  "Mr.  Nazarro wants you to sign."  And I say, "Oh no.  I ain't signing nothin'."  I said, "We, we don't owe no money."  And so she said," Well, you better talk to him."  I say, "Where is he?" "He's in his office."  I said, "Well, I want to see him."  So she, she said, "The Tampa Boys want to see you."  "Send them in!"  So when we went in I said, "Mr. Nazarro, what the hell you mean by asking us to," I was mad, man.  "What the hell you mean by asking us to sign an I.O.U.?  We don't owe you nothin'. "  And boy, he started talking about how he'd been like a father to us, you know this shit, you know.  "I did this for you, and I did that for you." I said, "Wait a minute now." I said, I said, "Remember", I said, "we didn't ask you to do none of this.  You never talked to us about you wanted to manage us or nothin'.  You never made no agreement with us on nothin'.  You just started doing stuff."  I said, "As far as we concerned you just another good guy that came along."  Boy, when I said that he start pulling his suspenders and carrying on, you know.  And I said, "Wait a minute now, Mr. Nazarro."  I said, "You better be careful now," I said, "because, you wouldn't want to lose that twenty thousand dollar bond you got down at the courthouse."  He didn't know I heard him say that.  And when I said that, I say, "''Cause you know we are minors."  And, man, when I said that everything changed.  He just changed, just like that, man.  Like--and I didn't realize that I had done hit upon something right away. I say, "But I tell you what we'll do now."  Now, man, just think of me being that smart at eleven years old.  And I said, "I'll tell you what we'll do," I said, "since you did all these things for us, and we appreciate them," I said that, "we'll work out a deal with you."  I said that, "If you'll promise that you'll book us and push us behind some of your top-notch acts, and get us some good bookin', every time we get a good booking, we'll give you some of the money that you say we owe you."  And he fell for that, man.  And from then on, shit, we was his top-notch act, man.  I don't care who came in that office, if 'The Tampa Boys' came in, he saw us.  That's what that money he had done spent a lot of money on us, man.  And he, he knew with me thinking the way I was thinking, that he didn't have a chance of recovering it unless he did what we wanted him to do.  And that, that's the way it worked out.
Speaker 1: That's something at the age of eleven!
Speaker 2: Yeah, eleven, man.  I was thinking that way at the age eleven.
Story_ID: 13489
Speaker 1: Now did you--when you went back to New York [New York] the second time, did, did somebody from your family go with you, or did you to by yourself?
Speaker 2: No, I heard my daddy [Daniel Stiles] tell my mama [Leona Stiles] when the first time when we came back, I heard him tell--he didn't know I--he said, "Leona, you know I believe Al could, Albert could go--," he didn't call me Al.  Said, "I believe Albert could go anywhere by himself," said, "because he's responsible."  You know, that meant a whole lot.  When we got ready to go back, man, we didn't even tell them we was getting ready to go.  We just went.
Speaker 1: So you didn't tell them, you didn't even say goodbye or anything, you just left?
Speaker 2: No. They didn't even know we was--I went in my, in my bedroom that day, and I had a bag already packed, and I--my brother [William George Stiles] was laying up there asleep.  And I, I pulled that out from under the bed and went on down the alley, went to my partner's [Nathaniel Reese's] house and picked him up and we took off.  And this time we didn't, we didn't play from town to town like we did before.  I remember we--the first town we hit was a little town called Williston, Georgia--no, Williston, Florida.  Was about a hundred miles from Tampa [Florida], and I remember we got in that little town, and man, we went to the farmer's market and the guy, everybody would tell us that they didn't allow no riders, you know.  We tried to get a ride.  So we was out in there all day long.  Man, we loaded a whole lot of trucks.  Helped them, and the people wouldn't say nothing to us until after we got through we'd asked them for a ride.  We figured, well, we'd do all this work, and then they won't mind giving us a ride.  But when we get through loadin', helping them load the trucks, then we'd ask.  Said, "Well, I'm sorry, but we can't have no riders.  The company won't allow us."  And so we had, we had worked all that day, man.  We was hungry and so I remember we went down the street from the farmer's market and we sit on the, on the curb there.  And we looked down there and by that time it got dark and we looked down there and we seen this little old filling station where they sold food and sandwiches, where the truckers would stop.  And I told my partner, I say, "Man, there's a restaurant down there. Let's go down there and see what's happening'."  So we went down there, and we went inside and we told the lady, said, "Lady, could we play you some music?" Said, "We're hungry."  She said, "Well, I don't want no music," but there was a black lady in the kitchen, she said, "Maybe."  She called her name, said, "Maybe she'll like to hear some music."  So we asked her, and she say, "Yeah, y'all come on back."  And so we went back there and she fixed us some sandwiches, you know.  And so this one guy, we had asked him about a ride, and he told us no. But when he was still in the restaurant eating while we was playing our music back there.  And he started listening, you know.  So when, when he got, after he got, he got real friendly, you know.  He liked what we was doing.  And so when we come out, we asked him where was he headed for.  He said Dothan, Alabama.  And we said, "That's where we going."  And so we said, "Could ya give us a ride?"  He said, "Well, only thing I got is those watermelons.  If y'all want to get on top of them watermelons, I'll take you on into Dothan."  Man, (laughs) we got up on top of them watermelons and, man, we caught hell, 'cause that wind was blowing, man, but we wanted to get out of that little town 'cause it wasn't nothing happening.  But we made it into Dothan, Alabama.  And we rode all night long on top of them watermelons.  Man, that wasn't, that wasn't easy, wasn't funny.  But we made it into Dothan.  And you know what?  When we got into Dothan, he went to the farmer's market and, man, we got out and we, we was hungry, and we started playing our music, you know.  And so people started crowding around us and we passed our hat around.  And we made enough to buy a little breakfast, you know.  And so, this one guy was there from the theater downtown, and he went back and told his boss, says, "Two little black guys down there at the farmer's market, and they can dance and play music."  And so the guy said, "Will you go down there and bring them back."  And he come down there and got us and took us (laughs) back to the theater, man.  So the guy got this idea about--'cause all in this little town, Dothan, all of the farmers and people would be in town on the weekends, see.  They always liked to have something at the theater to draw them in, you know.  And so he said, "You bring them back down here."  And so he brought us back there and the guy got this idea, and he asked us a lot of questions.  And so he made up this little wagon, you know, and, and had some writing on it.  And we was called--we wasn't callin' ourselves 'The Tampa Boys,' though.  We was called ourselves 'Nat and Al.'  My name was Al, was Albert and so I used Al, and my partner's name was Nathaniel, so he went under Nat.  So they made this little wagon and had a guy pulling it all around town.  See it wasn't a big town.  But anyway, man, that theater that weekend was packed!  We packed that theater on Friday, Saturday, and, no it was just Friday and Saturday because most people went back to the farms on Sunday, you know.  But anyway, you know that guy paid us forty-five dollars a piece, each day.  And then some guy come along talking about, "Hey, hey, boy! You wanna pick some cotton?"  I say, "How much you pay?"  "Fifty cent a day."  I said, "You pick it!" (laughs)  But anyway, man, when we left out of there, we left out there in style, man.  We left out of there on the bus.  You know, we had a pocketful of money.  We stayed there and played Friday and Saturday, and he paid us forty-five dollars a piece, a day.  That was good money, man.  But--'cause we did them shows.  But the people enjoyed it.  Well, you know, we was kids.
Speaker 1: 1932 or '3 [1933]?
Speaker 2: No, this was in a, this was around the late '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: You are about teenagers around then, weren't you?
Speaker 2: Yeah--.
Story_ID: 13490
Speaker 1: You got your own career launched. So, so but you always come back and go to school during the school year and then would go--.
Speaker 2: Well, after, after that, that, we didn't come back to go to school.  We stayed out there [New York, New York] 'cause we went in the Cotton Club--see, after I made this deal with Nat Nazarro [manager] he booked all these places, The Paramount Theater [New York, New York], all them big theaters on Broadway [Avenue].  He booked a lot of the big plays, he had Pearl Bailey [entertainer] and all them people, man, you know.
Speaker 1: Can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Nat Nazarro.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Nazarro?
Speaker 1: Z-A-R-R-I-O (sic, N-A-Z-A-R-R-O).  Nazarro.  Nat Nazarro.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was pretty popular back then because he had all of the best acts.  He had Buck and Bubbles, Chuck and Chuckles, Stump and Stumpy, Red and Curly, Pearl Bailey, Bill Bailey, Redd Foxx, Red and Curly, let me see, who else he have? Oh, he had, he had most of the, all the good black acts back then.
Speaker 2: So you were kinda on the circuit with all those acts.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, well, what he would do, he would a--those a, those big agents they put a circuit together, you know. And they'd, they'd have a big band, and then they would hire different acts to, you know--vaudeville acts to fill in.  And that's how he got hooked up.  We worked with Duke Ellington.  We worked with--I worked with a Frank Sinatra right up here in a Kalamazoo, Michigan, but when he was with Tommy Dorsey's band.  I worked with all of them, man.  I worked with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis when they was partners on the boardwalk in Atlantic City [New Jersey].  I worked with all of them.
Story_ID: 13491
Speaker 1: So you're continually working up until Word War II?  I guess, 'cause at one point you're--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, well see, when I was called in the [U.S.] Army I had been booked already to, to open at the Paramount [Theater] on Broadway [New York, New York].  'Cause I had auditioned for it, my manager [Nat Nazarro], he had, he had all them big theaters and things.  He had access to booking people in.  And so he wanted to get us in the Paramount, see, because this was keeping in, in keeping with him getting some of his money back, see?  And, and I made it clear to him, "If you book us, and, and let us follow behind some of your name acts and get more money for us, we'll give you some money back," you know. And that's what we did.  And so he kept us busy.  So he booked us up in Poughkeepsie [New York] at the Paramount in Poughkeepsie as an audition for the Paramount on Broadway.  And we went over so good up there that we got the contract.  We supposed to open there at the Paramount on Broadway on the first of June, and I got called in the Army in April.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what happened.
Speaker 1: So.  What happened to Nat [childhood friend/entertainment partner, Nathaniel Reese]?  Did he--?  Was he drafted too?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh. What happened--I better tell you about this.  I was in Chicago [Illinois] when they said we had to, we had to be drafted, you know, sign up.  So when I signed up I gave my mother's [Leona Stiles's] address in Tampa [Florida].  'Cause see, otherwise I was traveling all the time.  And so when time for me to go, they must have sent me a notice, but my mama didn't know where I was 'cause I stopped writing, see.  And so nobody else around Tampa didn't know where I was 'cause I was traveling all the time.  So, anyway, the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation]  came to my house looking for me.  Well, my mama told them, said, "Well, sir", said, "I don't know where he is."  Said, "He's is show business, and they traveling all the time." She said, "But as soon as I find him, I'll deliver him to you."  So one night I was playing the Plantation Club in Nashville [Tennessee].  That night, man, I couldn't go to sleep.  And I got up and wrote my mama.  Something just bothered me, man.  I wrote home and the, as soon as she got that letter she sent me a wire back, said, "Come home at once.  The FBI is looking at--for you."  I got up the next morning and caught the train out of there.  And I didn't--my partner told me, say, "Man, don't wake me up," said, "because I don't believe I could stand to see you leave," you know.  So I got up the next morning man, I went straight on the train station, got on the train.  I didn't even wake him up to say goodbye or nothing.  I didn't see him no more.
Story_ID: 13492
Speaker 1: I haven't seen him [Nathaniel Reese, childhood friend/entertainment partner] since.  I was stationed out here in Baer Field [Fort Wayne, Indiana] and some people came down on the show, and these guys knew him, and they--I asked them, I say, "Man, you, when you last time you seen my partner?"  He say, "Man, your partner's dead."  I said, "What?"  He said, "Yeah, man."  Say when he came-he went to Europe right after I left him--'cause he was a hell of a entertainer.  And he made some money over there. When he was with me I kept the drug people away from him, see, 'cause I didn't deal in none of that stuff.  And I knew how to keep them away.  And so, Reese was real gullible, you know, he was a hell of a entertainer, but he the type of person, he want to live it all up in one day, you know.  Stay up all night and all that.  And so they found him in his apartment sitting on the toilet where he had done o.d.'ed [overdosed], man.  That was a hell of a story.  But wasn't nothin' I could do about it 'cause you know me and him had broke up one time in Chicago--well, it wasn't in Chicago [Illinois], but it was up in a, a Rock Island, Illinois.  We had a contract, we had about--it must have been--I forgot how many shows it was, but we was up there for about three weeks.  And man, he would, he would go out at night and he would go to the bars and get a I.O.U., you know.  And they'd let him have some money in advance.  And so I just got tired of him doing that because every time we got some good contracts man, I would have to go down and bail him out.  All of his clothes would be in the pawnshop, his rings, his, everything.  And in order for me to make a gig, I had to always bail him out.  So, then I had to make sure I saved money 'cause I couldn't work if I didn't bail him out, see.  And I couldn't do that by myself 'cause we'd done built up a reputation as 'The Tampa Boys'.  So it put me--it gave me a hell of task, so I just got pissed off.  And I told him when we got paid all he drawed was a handful of I.O.U.s.  Didn't draw no money, man.  And so it wasn't but two dollars and fifty cents to ride the train from Chicago, I mean from Rock Island, Illinois back to Chicago.  And he didn't even have that.  So I told him, I said, "Man, I'm gone and I'm through!"  "Aw, man, you can't do me like that.  I'm your partner."  I say, "You used to be my partner." (Laughs)  And man, I thought I had done left them, and so, I didn't want to do it but I had to make a decision somewhere.  And so, you know that dude, when the train was getting ready to pull off I heard somebody hollering.  He come running.  The guy was getting ready to put that thing back up in the train and he was running.  He had done conned somebody out of that money and got his ticket.  So we got back in Chicago, man, and our agent had five more contracts that he wanted us to sign.  And so, I told them, I said, "Man, I, I'm not signing them contracts."  He say, "Oh Al, you can't do that."  I say, "Yes, I can."  I say, "You don't have to work with him," I say, "but I do."  I say, "I'm through, man."  And so he came down there on my job.  No, I had some money saved up. So I say, well, I don't want to spend up all my little money saved 'cause I didn't know, by me doing a single, I didn't know how long it was gone take me to get myself established that way. So I went down and got me a job down at Stop & Shop in Chicago.  And the guys liked me down in there man so, anyway, Reese came down--my partner came down there one day, and me and him went in the locker room.  Boy, he begged.  "Al, you can't do this to me.  You know we been partners for ten years, man.  You can't--."  And, and you know he almost got to me, but I said, "Reese, look,"  I said, "I'm sorry but this has got to end cause I'm not getting nowhere like this," you know.  And so he begged me, man, and begged me.  And so, anyway, we broke up.  So my agent, Seymour Superior (ph.), he was begging me, "Al, come on.  Do these five gigs."  I said, "No, man.  Every time I make up my mind to cut out, y'all come up with this."  I said, "This is it."  And so I worked at Stop & Shop, and that made me didn't have to spend my little savings.  See I was making enough money there.  And so the, the guy at Stop & Shop, he liked me, man, he say--he was a German guy--he say, "Al," no, he said, "Albert, I've got a honorary job for you."  I said, "Like what?"  So he made me a runner, man.  I was running salads from upstairs, downstairs.
Story_ID: 13493
Speaker 1: You went back down to Tampa [Florida].  Now your mother [Leona Stiles] sent for you and you went back down (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well see, yeah.  When I got home, when, when--when my mama wired me and told me to come home at once, well, when I got home I walked in the house and my mama wouldn't let me, and put my, I was shy, man, I had on a sport coat that was out of sight.  I used to go down on 5th Ave [New York, New York] and buy them ends off the sport coat material and have pants and stuff made out of them.  So, I was making good--I was making seven fifty [$750] a week, man, so I could do this, you know.  And so, when I to the, when I went home, man, my wife--my mama wouldn't let me stop.  She said, "Albert, I promised them [the FBI, Federal Bureau of Investigations] I was gone bring you down there."  So she's scared that I was gonna get into trouble, see.  And so, she took me on down there and they wouldn't let me come back home.  They sent me right on off. And I went to, I went to--they sent me to Camp Blanding [Starke, Florida] first.  And then when they shipped me up from Camp Blanding, that's when they shipped me to a, to a Keesler Field [Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi], Mississippi.
Story_ID: 13494
Speaker 1: Well when I, when I got down there, man, I was on the base [Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi] and I used to know president of the Actors Guild Variety Artists Society.  I used to be a member of that.  And so he knew me.  His name was Private Silverstone.  And so--.
Speaker 2: Sit back a little bit.  No, just sit back a little bit.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.  So, anyway, (laughs) when he heard I was on the base he came over and asked me--over to my barracks and asked me if I'd do a show.  And I told him yeah. So the night that I did the show, the base commander was watching and he saw me.  So the next morning he summoned me to his office.  And when I went in he says, "Stiles, I got a proposition for you."  And I said, "What is that?" He said, "I need somebody to run the, the officers, not the officers but the servicemen's club."  And--it was either the servicemen or the officer, one of them two.  But anyway, he said, "If you take the job", he said, "I'll make you a staff sergeant right now."  And I laughed.  He said, "What you laughing about?"  I said, "Sir," I said, "I, I appreciate you having that much confidence in me." I said, "But I would rather be a buck private and be any--and be anywhere other than Mississippi." And he laughed.  He say, "I read your riff, soldier."  He said, "Tell you what," I said-he said, "I'll have you on the next shipment outta here."  And he did.  And that's how I got shipped here.  Okay, so when I came to Ft. Wayne [Indiana], man, and, and I was stationed out here at Baer Field [Fort Wayne, Indiana], well, I run into my wife [Maxine Stiles].  We got married.  And so I started having a family.
Speaker 2: How, how did you meet her?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: How did you meet her?
Speaker 1: At the servicemen's club.  I was up there one night, and me and her got to dancing and so, for some reason she liked me, and so we got to talking, and--but we never did, we never did make that, that connection where we had a lot in common.  Because she didn't particularly like show people.  And that's what made the difference, see.  And I was show, I was show business all the way, you know (laughs).  So anyway, I don't know all the things, but I know that me and her was not suitable for each other, but we lived together.  And one thing that I gave her credit for, we raised two young men [Reginald B. Stiles and Ronald B. Stiles] 'cause we was dedicated to them.  You know, we put them ahead of our own likes, and I put up with her and she put up with me.  And so we, we stayed together and we raised these two boys and both of them--I'm proud of both of them and they proud of me.
Story_ID: 13495
Speaker 1: While I was out there at Baer Field [Fort Wayne, Indiana, Stiles was in the military], I started having trouble with my foot. See that how I have to cut my shoes. See that?
Speaker 2: Right, right. It's a bunion or something?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But what happened was happening, man, my foot was sting, man.  And nobody believed nothing was wrong with me.  I would go on sick call every day.  And they done, they took x-rays, they put me in the whirlpool bath, they did everything.  They couldn't find nothing wrong.  So they thought I was just trying to get of the service because they knew what my background was.  So they figured, well, why wouldn't he be trying with the talent he's got and where he's been.  Why wouldn't he be trying to get out of the service, you know.  'Cause, hell, I was making seven [hundred and] fifty [dollars] a week, and I was young, man, I didn't--no family or nothing.  But seven hundred and fifty dollars a week is a lot of money for a guy with family, you know.  But anyway, they calculated it that one thing that I was trying to get out of the service.  But anyway, I had to go through that, and I'd go on sick call, and, and they'd tell me say," We can't find nothing wrong with you."  So one day I went down there, and they told me, say, "Well, we just had a meeting about you yesterday, all of the doctors," said, "and we came to the conclusion that a, that a ain't nothing wrong with you."  And I said, "Well, I don't care what kind of conclusion y'all came to, my foot hurts."  So anyway, man, it worked around that, that a, they, they a--let me see how this happened.  Anyway, they finally decided well, we gon' trick him.  We'll find out if he really trying to get out, because if we tell him we gonna do surgery on him, and he don't want us to do surgery, this will give us a good indication.  So I went down there that day and they said, "Stiles," said, "we had a meeting about you."  Said, "And all of the doctors agree that since we can't find nothing wrong, that we have to do exploratory surgery."  And I said, "Well, man, I don't care what you do, just fix my foot!"  And, boy, that throwed them 'cause they thought they had me.  And so they put me in the hospital and operated on me, and so while the doctor was--they didn't put me to sleep, they just numbed my foot.  And while they was operating on me, Dr Moore--I mean Captain Moore--he said to me, he said, "Stiles," he said, "I have to make an apology."  I said, "What do you mean?"  He said, "I can see why your foot is hurting you the way it is."  He said, "Because this bone is growing crossways, it's cutting off all you circulation to your toes.  And you ain't getting no blood going to your toes."  And at night the only way I could sleep was to prop my foot up in the air.  That kept that blood from running down, you know.  And so he, he admitted it then.  So they, they did the surgery on me, man, and when I came out of surgery they had a cast on my foot.  But they took it off too soon.  And so when they--after they took the cast off they were gonna give me a fourteen-day furlough to go home and recuperate.  So, they took this--the cast off too soon.  My foot hadn't healed up enough.  So, while--when I left the base [Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi] I was supposed to be going to Florida, but I didn't go.  I just went to Chicago [Illinois].  And so, somebody on the base put this lie out that I didn't--that I was in Chicago dancing, you know.  And so, (laughs) that spread all over the base, man.  So, finally, my commanding officer got a hold of it.  So, he had, he had tried to send me to cooking school, so, he saw me in the mess hall that day, and he said,  "Soldier, would you like to go to school to cook?"  And I said, "Well, sir, I'm crippled."  "Oh, you that man they call Stiles?"  And "Yeah, I'm Stiles."  He said, "Well--," then he started trying to sympathize with me.  So he said, "Well, I'm sorry soldier."  So he said, "I tell you what I'm gonna do."  Said, "I'm gone take you down and give you a job in my office."  I said, "Okay, thank you."  All I, all I was doing on the man was giving the, the, the pilots the laundry, you know.  I'm sitting up on the stool--but my foot would start hurting, and, man, I'd start crying, you know.  He'd come over there and, "Now soldier, now."  And my foot would really be hurting me, man.  Be burning and stinging.  And so he'd come over there, and he'd try to pacify me. So he'd say, "Okay, I'll fix this."  And I said--he said, "Well, why are you--."  I said, "Sir," I say, "you don't understand." I said, "I'm constipated."  I said, "Because by me being not able to walk good, by the time I get down to the mess hall everyday, all the food is gone and ain't nothing but cold cuts."  I said, "I done ate so much of that, that I'm constipated."  He said, "All right, I, golly, I'll fix that."  So he got on the phone and called the quartermaster and told him to send a bicycle over there.  (Laughs) So they send this bicycle over there, man.  He thinks this gon' solve the problem.  So, I go out there at twelve o'clock, getting ready to go down to the mess hall, you know.  That's quite a little ways, see.  And it dawned on me, said, "Man, you can't ride no damn bicycle with your foot hurting like that!"  And, and so I just took the bicycle, man, and, and I walked on down there like this, pushing the bicycle. When them soldiers, when they, the last of the line was going and they looked up and saw me come around the corner pushing this bicycle, man, and they fell out laughing. "Look at this so-and-so pushing that god damn bicycle!" You know, they was teasing me, man!  And so, I felt real bad, you know, 'cause they didn't know what was going on.  They thought I was pulling a, act, see.  And so, anyway, we went on, and so the next day he asked me how did things go.  I said, "Sir--." He said, "I heard that you didn't ride that bicycle."  I said, "No, I couldn't ride that bicycle."  I said, "'Cause my foot hurt so bad."  "Okay."  And he got on the phone and called quartermaster and told them to send a jeep over there.  So now he gone give me a jeep to drive, but then the thing was wrong with that the jeep had a clutch.  And so the clutch was--well I had to use my right foot and then I got out there and I said, "Man, you can't drive no damn jeep.  How you gonna--push the clutch, your foot is hurting too--."  And I let the Jeep sittin' there.  And I walked on down there. Man, when I got down there, by that time everybody knew that I was supposed to be driving a Jeep.  So when they saw me come walking this throwed them, you know.  The was looking to make fun of me, you know, because I got a Jeep.  But anyway, this is the way it worked out.  So, anyway, somebody told the commanding officer that they saw me in Chicago dancing when I went home on my furlough.  Supposed to went to Florida, but I went to Chicago.  And man he was pissed off.  He called everybody in the mess hall that day.  And so, I was sitting way in the back, you know.  I'm sitting back there like this looking, you know.  And so, he got up there and he said, "I, golly," he said, "you know you guys when y'all hear them train whistles blowing you want to go home."  He said, "And I know how you feel."  He said, "But we got a job to do, I golly, and we gone stay here and do it."  He said, "We got a man here that thinks he's smarter than Uncle Sam."  He said, "I gave that man a bicycle to ride, I golly, and he wouldn't ride. I gave that man a Jeep to drive, I golly, and he wouldn't drive it."  He said, "I'm gonna have his ass in the guardhouse before sundown."  And man, when he said that the people, the guys just jumped all up on the tables and they was laughing and goin' on.  I sat back there and waited 'til they quieted down.  And when they quieted down, I was walking crippled.  I made it up to the front, you know.  And I walked straight up to the commanding--to my company commander.  And I said, "Sir, you owe me an apology."  And I looked him straight in the face.  And he said, "What do you mean, soldier?"  I said, "I said you owe me a apology."  I said, "I said that my foot hurt.  God damn it, you prove that it don't!"  And man, when I said that everything got so quiet.  They thought it was gonna put me in the guardhouse, man.  I didn't care.  And boy, it was, you could hear a pin fall in there.  You know he apologized to me 'cause I was right.  You know, you tell me my foot don't hurt,  you prove it!  He couldn't do it.  That throwed it man.  His mouth jumped wide-open.  He didn't know what--he said, "I'm sorry soldier."  Yeah, but those are some of the things that I went through.  All right now.  We talking about the Flashfold box company all right.  Now when I came out of the [U.S.] Army, I went out to the harvester and I worked for seven years. And I started my own business.  All right.

Speaker 1: Now did you, did you stop performing all together because of your foot?
Speaker 2: No. I could perform at times, you know.  But I had to see--just like this.  If I wore a pair of shoes like this, if I didn't cut them my foot woulda hurt like hell.  That's why--see how bad that, I cut that?
Speaker 1: You got a, you got a--people can't see this--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I cut every pair of shoes, I don't--.
Speaker 1: You cut your shoes for the top of the right foot--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, I can't stand no pressure on that, see.  Okay, so.  What happened, I, I worked in the, at the harvester for seven years.  And, I had this idea about opening a record shop.  But I couldn't get my wife to cooperate with me no kind of way. So what I did, I used to have people come up here from Lima [Ohio], Kokomo [Indiana], and all around to buy records.  And so my shop would be closed.  I only opened it when I got off from work in the evening.  I worked, opening on the weekend.  So my wife, she just, she was determined she wasn't gonna help me.  And so one day I got after her about it.  I said, "Maxine, you ought to go down there and open that shop."  I said, "'Cause everybody's telling me the people comes up there--carloads of people come up here during the day to buy records and the shop is closed, and I'm trying to make a living for us."  "That's your business!  I ain't going down there!"  And I got mad, and I said, "Well, god damn it, if you don't go down there I'll close it!  I'll go down there, and I'll quit the harvester."  And I did it.  And man, that was the worst thing because, see, I hadn't been running the record shop long enough to get no surplus put aside.  And man, when Elvis Presley hit, if I had a been in good shape I'd been a rich man today.  Because, man, I had a system on records and everything was out of sight!  And so, I had this radio program and all this, man.  I coulda cleaned up.  I had just went to Lima--no, Marion [Indiana], and opened another store and was getting ready to put a program on the radio.  But when, when, when this slump came up I couldn't survive it because I had too much on me.  I had my bills at home and the shop and everything.  And then I was trying to run back and forth to Lima--to Marion to take care of this other shop.
Story_ID: 13497
Speaker 1: I went on and, and, and dealt with it for a while, but it was getting worse all the time.  So I knew I had to make a living because I had kids to feed, see.  And so I just went on and sold the record shop and got out of it.  And it, it worked out that way.  But then I was, after I sold the record shop I was out of work five months, and that took a toll.  And man, people was calling me like I--and I wasn't trying to duck nobody.  I would go around; I wasn't drawing but twenty-six dollars unemployment.  And I'd go around and give this guy a couple of dollars and that guy two dollars.  You know, I was trying.  And everybody, "Al, you ought to file bankruptcy."  I said, "Listen.  I made them bills, damn it, and I'm gonna pay them."  And I thank God because I don't have that against me, man.  I'm, I'm--I'm rated number one at, at, through Dun & Bradstreet.  And been that for years, man.  When people go to check my credit rating and they find out I got A number one credit.  And so, that's good.  So anyway, I went through that, and then finally I, I started going around to this neighborhood Methodist church and I started helping the pastor around there.  And I was working with the kids' choir and everything.  So one day he said to me, he says, "Stiles," he say, "you know what?"  He say, "Man, seem like you ought to be able to find a job."  He say, "I got to do something this."  He say, "'Cause you got a family, and you tried to do what's right."  He said, "Wait a minute.  I got an idea."  He got on the phone and called this guy, Mr. Gettle, owned the Flashfold Box [Corporation] and he owned the Gettle Building downtown.  And see, Mr. Gettle's mother started that church.  So he called Mr. Gettle and told him, say, "I got a man here, he's a good man and he got a family, and he needs a job."  Mr. Gettle said, "Send him down."  I went down there, and Mr. Gettle hired me just like that.  But the only thing was wrong with that, I got to thinking, I said, "Well, you know all these people that you owe--I owed about eight thousand dollars, but it was scattered around, you know, small bills you know. So, man, I had people calling me like I was trying to run away or something.  And it made me feel bad.  Guys would be calling my house at one o'clock in the morning like I was trying to run away or duck them or something.  That made me mad.  So, anyway, Mr. Gettle came to the shop one day about three or four days after he hired me, and I said, "Mr. Gettle," I said, "I need to talk to you."  I said, "I got something important to talk to you."  He said, "Come on up in the office, Al."  I went up there, and I told him.  I said," You know what bothers me?"  I said, "When you hired me, you hired me in good faith."  I said, "And I, I should told you what kind of shape I was in financially," I said, "because I don't think it was fair," I said, "I know you don't accept no garnishees, I know that."  I said, "And that's what bothers me, the fact that I didn't let you know you, so you would have the right to say you was gonna hire me or you wasn't."  He looked at me and say, "Al, I don't take garnishees but I'll take yours."  He said, "Because you are an honest person."  He said, "Don't worry about it."  And he said, "I'll tell you what I'm going to do."  He said, "How much you think you can pay?"  And I say, "Well, about five dollars a week."  He say, "You're sure you can handle that?"  I said, "Well, I'm gonna handle it."  So he said all right.  And you know what, man?  I paid off every damn one of them bills like that because I didn't know that once somebody file garnishee against you, the rest of the people got to stand in line.  I didn't know that.  And that took all that pressure up off me.

Speaker 1: Lionel Hampton [jazz musician] used to come through.  Every time he come through Fort Wayne [Indiana] he'd stop in to see me, 'cause me and him was good friends.  He'd pull over there at my record shop.  He'd park his bus down the avenue and come over.  And so he came in one time and I said, "Hamp!"  I said, "Man, I, I'm putting a new act together," I say, "You think you can give me some shows?"  He say, "Yeah, Gates, yeah.  Let me know, let me know!"  And he--right after that he went over to Israel.  So he came back--when he came back to the states he was doing a concert up in Lima [Ohio].  So I told, me and my partner, I had told my partner--he didn't know Hamp, you know.  He was a youngster, he didn't know.  So I told him all about Hampton.  So he said--we started getting ourselves together.  So I said, "Man, all we need to do now is get our act together, and get some pictures and some outfits that we gone wear on the stage, you know, and Hamp will look out for us."  So we did.  And so when Hamp came back to the states, man, he'd been to Israel.  We saw this poster where he was gonna be doing a concert in Lima, and I told my partner, I said, "Man, come on, let's go up and see Hamp now."  So we went up there at night, and, and we went in to the concert and saw about half of it, and I said, "Come on and let's go backstage."  So he said, "How we gon' get in?"  I say, "Don't worry about it."  So, we went backstage and I told the, the stage man, I said, "Look," I said, "we got appointment with Lionel Hampton."  He said, "Who's calling?"  And I said, "You just tell them that Al, that Albert Stiles, or just tell them 'Stiles.'"  And so, I knew if he mentioned my name to Hamp, he gonna say, "Oh, tell them to come on in," you know.  So anyway, we, we--the man let us in and we was standing in the wings, and Hamp looked out there and saw me.  And he waved, you know, letting me know he recognized me.  So my partner, he just lit all up 'cause he, he had heard of Hamp, but he had never met them.  And so, when Hamp came to the wings, his valet was wiping off, you know.  He'd--sweating, you know.  And so, Hamp say, "I be with you in a minute, man."  And I say, "Okay."  So as soon as he came off the stage, man, he came over to me, and he say, "You ready Gates, you ready?"  I say, "Yeah, man, we ready!"  He say, "Okay.  How'd you like to open up with me in the Blue Note?"  I say, "Oh, man, that'll be terrific!" So he told us, said, "All you got to do is come to Chicago [Illinois] and come to the Sherman Hotel, and tell them to send you up to my room."  That's all we had to do.  And so that's what we did.  And we got there man, and we worked, they sent us up to his room, and he called downstairs, said, "I want you to put these guys in a nice room now."  And the guy--we went back downstairs and the guy gave us the room and everything.  He said, "When you get your room, come back up."  We went back up and Gladys, his wife, was on the phone.  She was talking to somebody.  He was getting ready to go to Hollywood [California] to make 'The Benny Goodman Story' and she was talking with them.  In fact, she was arguing with them about the bus or something.  She was his manager.  And so, he said to me, he say, "Well, Gates, you ready?"  I say, "Yeah, man, we ready!"  He say, "All right, you come over to the club tomorrow and my director will take care of you."  We went over there, man, and that guy--just because of Hamp, you know--he say, "You got your music?"  I say, "Yeah."  He said, "Let me hear it."  He put it on the stand, and they ran through it one time, and he say, "Take it down."  He started calling some numbers out of the book, man.  And bam! When them guys got through messing with that music, man, shit!  We was jumpin' man.  We stayed in there with him two weeks.  And then, while we was working there his, his road manager was interested in managing us.  So he asked me about it. I said, "Well man, we just put this act together."  I said, "We're not ready for a manager yet."  So I said, "But I tell you what," I said, "if you can get us some shows maybe we can talk." He say, "Okay, that's fine."  So, we left and went back to, to Fort Wayne, and about three days after we got there, he called up and say, "Hey, man," he said, "now, just hold on this, but I think I got you booked in the Moulin Rouge [Hotel]."  That's that hotel that Joe Louis had out there.
Speaker 2: Out in Las Vegas [Nevada]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Vegas.  "I think I got you booked," said, "but now, just hold on 'til you hear from me."  So, about two or three days later he called back, he said, "That fell through," said, "but I got something better for you." He said, "How'd you like to open up with Josephine Baker?"  I said, "Aw, man!  You kidding!"  He said, "No, man."  And so he told me what to do and everything.  Man, we went on to Winnipeg [Manitoba, Canada] and we opened up with Josephine Baker, man.  That was the, the light of my life because, man, I, I felt so good.  The fact that we working with a big star like her, man.  And she was so fabulous, man.  And she had so much class, man, it really told me something.  That woman was something else.  I could see why she became the toast of Paris [France].  And she--we was--all we was a fill-in act for her 'cause she changed a lot.  And, man, some of them gowns that she wore out on that stage was out of sight.
Speaker 2: So, so what year is this?
Speaker 1: I think it was around in '60,  '63 [1963] or somewhere around there.  It's on that, that--.
Speaker 2: We'll see it later.  But I just thought I'd, yeah,  okay.  That's a good idea.  So how long did you perform with Josephine Baker?
Speaker 1: Just one week.  But we was fortunate because we went over so big, the guy that owned the club, he held us over.  We stayed in there a whole month, man.  A whole month.  And that was a fabulous club, man.  It was, it was, when you came in the club, man, all the, the, the tables was in a little booths like, and each booth had its own little--and it had lights in the booth, you know, on the table, and just barely and it came down like this.  You could sit anywhere in that club and see anything that was happening.
Story_ID: 13499
Speaker 1: When we came back home from Winnipeg [Manitoba, Canada], my agent--no, these guys booked us in the Gatineau Country Club.  That was in Ottawa, Canada.  And Alan Dale was--he was the star of the show.  Well, Duke [Ellington] had just closed the week before we opened up, and this was a real nice engagement because they, they put on some real productions in there, you know.  It was a nice thing.  And so we worked in there for about a month.  And, let me see what else did we do. Oh, well while we was up there, man.  I might as well to tell this 'cause this is (laughs)--when we was working with Josephine Baker, we went downtown one day.  And I was on the bus and I saw this--these furs, on sale.  And they had a closeout on them, real beautiful white fur, you know.  So, I, I thought about how good my wife [Maxine], my wife was a good-looking woman, man--I thought about how good she would look in them.  So I said, "Well, I believe I might buy her one," you know.  So, we rang the button and got off the, off the bus, me and my partner [James Johnson] was together.  And so, we was getting ready to close that Sunday night I think it was.  So we went in the furrier and I looked at the fur. And so I told the guy, I said, "Well, look, I tell you what," that was on sale, I said, "I want to buy one of these for my wife and I got the right size and everything."  'Cause my wife was about my size, you know.  So I didn't have no problem picking it out.  So I put twenty-five dollars on it, and I said, "Well, look, I'm gonna put this in the lay-away 'cause we gonna be leaving tomorrow night, and I'll be down tomorrow and pick it up."  "Okay."  Man, that night we was out there doing our show and these detectives came in.  And, man, they was embarrassing because as soon as we finished our act they marched us right on through the club, man.  You know, like we was criminals, man.  And you know how that felt.  And so, anyway, they took us down and searched us, and told us that we had stole some furs and all this shit.  And so, we went back to the club and the guy that we was working for, he didn't appreciate the guy bringing us through the club like that, you know.  So, he offered to, to get us his lawyer, see.  But I, I was stupid.  And so, instead of me waiting around, you know, I wanted to leave and come home, and get my lawyer, you know.  And so, anyway, that's what I did.  I came on to Fort Wayne [Indiana] and I went to talk to my lawyer.  He told me, he said, "Well, Al," he said, "I tell you what," he said, "I don't know about that case."  He said, "You got a good case," he said, "but I don't think you'd win it." He said, "Because, in the first place," he said, "their lawyer will do you just like I would do.  They'll keep continuing it, and keep you running up and keep you running back."  Said, "If you did win it, you wouldn't come out with nothing."  He said, "And I can't take the case up there unless I go through their lawyer, see, a lawyer up there."  And so I said, "Oh, shit."  He said, "You got a good case, now.  You could win it."  He said, "But you won't come out with nothing.  They'll wear you out."  And so I, I thought to myself well, I'll be damned.  But I learned something with that, you know.  So anyway, I went--no, I made a mistake, instead of--before this happened, I went down the next day to the, to the furrier.  And I told the guy, I said, "Man," I said, "I come down here." I thought I was doing something smart.  "I come down here to tell you that you better get your lawyer, 'cause I'm gonna sue you."  I shoulda never did that, see. (Laughs) He was begging me, man.  He say, "Aw, man, please don't!"  He said, "I got a family."  Said, "I'll get fired!"  This was a chain of companies that he was working for.  It was a chain of furriers, see.  And he is--boy, he was scared.  He followed me all the way out on the sidewalk, begging me, "What can I do, man?  Whatever you want me to do."  All I'd had to say was, "Give me two thousand dollars," or something, you know.  And he woulda did it.  No, I said, "No, you gotta, you got to see my lawyer", and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I didn't get a damn thing.  (Laughs)  I begin to think about what my lawyer told me.  It wasn't worth it.  He said, "Man," he said, "I wouldn't even take that case."  He said, "Because, the first place for me to take a case up in Canada I'd have to go to a Canadian lawyer."  I said, "Wow."  But anyway, I learned something from it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, now did, did you come back to Fort Wayne then or what?
Speaker 1: Well, I was already back in Fort Wayne, 'cause I came home, instead of me using my boss's lawyer.
Speaker 2: Okay, I heard you.  I understand.
Speaker 1: He was a Canadian lawyer.  I coulda put a--I could've got a case through, see.
Speaker 2: What, what, well, what did you do next? When you got back, what did you do?
Speaker 1: Let me see.  What did I do?
Speaker 2: Did you continue to, to--,
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --be involved in show business?
Speaker 1: It wasn't long before I opened the Talent Factory.  I opened the Talent Factory [Fort Wayne, Indiana, program teaching inner-city youth the theater arts] in 1983, and ran it for ten years.  And we were very successful.  But I did a lot of shows.  We did plays, and I made a movie during that period too.
Story_ID: 13500
Speaker 1: Now how did you get the idea for the Talent Factory [Fort Wayne, Indiana, program teaching inner-city youth the theater arts]?
Speaker 2: [Laughs]  Okay.  When I was traveling around, man--by me being young, all the young people used to come up and talk to me, see, 'cause they figured I was a outgoing person.  I would talk to them.  So all of them wanted to know.  The one answer [sic. question] was  how do you get into show business?  In other words, they know you have to have talent, but how do you make these connections like you, how did you get hooked up here, you know.  And that's what all of them wanted to know.  So, in my mind I kept thinking, I said, well, if you ever get able this would be a good thing for you to do.  Set up some kind of organization where you can get these kids together and develop them, and get them ready.  'Cause a lot of times people want to be into show business but they ain't ready yet, you know.  And they don't have no way of knowing when they're ready.  So this was my idea.  So, I started it, I started--no, I didn't start the Talent Factory yet.  The guy that wound up being my director, he was getting ready to--he had produced a, he had wrote a play and he was getting ready to produce it.  So, he had a part in there for a tap dancer. But so, he didn't know who he was gonna get, so a friend of mine told him, said, "Man, you ought to ask Al," said, "I bet you he could do that part."  And so, he came--he had heard so much about me, man, he--you know, if somebody keep telling you about a ball player, and hype them up, you know, like that, this and that and you get a chance to talk to them, you feel inferior, you know.  You feel like: "Aw, he gonna just push me off," you know.  So when James [Johnson] came over to talk to me, he told me and I looked at the script and everything.  So, I said to him, I said, "I'll do that part for you."  And, man, he looked like it wasn't, was unbelievable.  Like, he didn't say that.  I know he didn't say it!  And he said, "Man, did you really mean that?"  I said, "Yeah, I'll do the part for you.  I'll do the dance for you, man."  And so, I said--I started going to practice.  But I never would say nothing.  'Cause I saw a lot of things that I could help him with, but I didn't want him to feel like I come in to try to take over.  'Cause you gotta be careful about that.  So I learned a lot on Broadway [Avenue, New York, New York], from directors that--I had some hell of a good producers and directors that I worked under.  And so I learned a lot.  So, anyway, I would go to rehearsal, I wouldn't say nothing, I'd just sit there and when time for me to do my thing, I'd do it.  So, he would even ask me my opinion, but I didn't want to say too much, you know.  But anyway, the night of the play I didn't think he was gonna be able to pull it off because the way was--it was very unorganized, you know.  And I didn't like this but I said, "No, I'm going to give him a chance."  But man, what surprised me, he pulled it off, man.  The play went down so good it scared me, man.  I said, "Damn!"  And so, I told James--we was in the dressing room and I told them, I said, "James," and I said, I said, "Man, when you get a few days after the play" and I say, "when you get rested up a little bit, come over, and I want to talk with you."  I said, "I got some ideas," you know.  "Okay, I'll be over."  So when he did come over, I told him, I said, I told him about the Talent Factory.  And I said, "Man, I've had this idea since I was traveling around and I made a promise to myself that I was going to try to develop some younger people's talent," I said, "'cause the Lord has blessed me.  I done did all of this stuff and got experience, and know, I been backstage, I been in plays and all that.  I learned a lot of stuff."  I said, "I believe I can help a lot of these kids."  I said, "But I need somebody like you to work with me."  I said, "What about it?"  He said, "Al, I like your idea."  He said, "I got a lot of confidence in you."  He said, "I tell you what," he said, "I'll give it a year, see what happens."  I said, "You mean that?"  He said, "Yeah."  So, man, we set out and we start working together right then, but I didn't want no partner.
Story_ID: 13501
Speaker 1: So you get rolling with the Talent Factory [Fort Wayne, Indiana, program teaching inner-city youth the theater arts]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so anyway--.
Speaker 1: What, what's his name?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: James Johnson.  I was hoping that he would of, he said he was gonna try to come over here 'cause I wanted him to be on it 'cause he's a very exciting man.  He's got a lot of history behind him, you know.  But anyway, he worked with me for ten years, man.  I never worked with nobody that I was more satisfied with than him because he was smart, but he--we had that respect for each other, you know.  That made a lot of difference, 'cause--and, see, I didn't want no partners.  So what I did, I--you see that magazine I gave you there?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I, I--I went on and, and cooperated the thing, you know.  And, that, I gave him the job of being director of the Talent Factory.  And so he worked with me real good.  And so I didn't have no problem because I had learned--one thing that I had learned about black people, and I have served on all kinds of boards--see I'm serving on a community development board now. I been on that board nine years.  I've learned a whole lot, man, you know. I've had--and I didn't finish high school but I've got an education, you know, by doing things, you know.  And so, one thing that I found out.  I'm glad that I didn't make it a partnership because I saw his shortcomings, see, and I didn't think that me and him could work as partners because, see, I had so much of a jump on him and so much experience.  But he was the type of guy, that he didn't have all that experience but he was knowledgeable.  He had read books.  He knew all about the Apollo Theater [New York, New York], and it made it easy for me and him to communicate because when I be talking to him we was about on the same level, you know.  And so, I realized that. So, I knew then that if I had a made him a partner he could never equalize what he had experienced with what I had experienced.  And it was going to make a difference.  And I'm glad that I had thought about it that way because he understood it.  See, and he respected me because of my wisdom and my understanding and my knowledge.  I used it in the appropriate time and place.  And so I gave him the advantage of doing--he wrote a lot of plays.  He wrote three plays, and I allowed him to produce them plays.  Well, I allowed him to direct them.  I produced them.  'Cause they would have never hit the stage if I hadn't --you understand me?  But I gave him that chance, you know.
Story_ID: 13502
Speaker 1: Now you've a been responsible for helping a number of different young people develop their talent.  Can you name some of them for us?  Talk about some of the people that you have--.
Speaker 2: Well, there's a girl that came here [to the Talent Factory, Fort Wayne, Indiana, program teaching inner-city youth the theater arts] from Detroit [Michigan], and she, she could already sing when she got here.  But she needed a lot of work. And most young people--to be a pro, man, see--what helped me most of all, I worked for people like Nat King Cole.  I worked for Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Billie [Holiday], all of them.  Billie Holliday wrote a, a song in my apartment right there in Chicago [Illinois], called 'Trav'lin' Light'.  And, see, what I usually did, I worked with Ella Fitzgerald at the World's Fair for six months.  I found out--.
Speaker 1: This was 1939? Right?
Speaker 2: Around there. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Where was it?
Speaker 2: At the--in New York City [New York].  New York City World's Fair.  I was there.  Okay. So, what I was able to do--I was able to find out what made these people superstars.  That's what I was looking for.  So, I'm a, I'm a good director, and I'm also a good teacher of what is right and what is wrong to do to be a good performer or pro, see.  And so I learned--one of the things that I learned about black singers, is that they got a lazy dialect.  And if you got to--if you can't get around that--they don't never make good singers.  They get to certain--but they ain't gonna be no superstars.  You know, what made Dinah Washington--I'd worked with Dinah when I, the first time I played the, the Rum Boogie in Chicago.  She was in the show.  Nobody did know who she was.  And then she left there and went with, with Lionel Hampton and that's when she came in home because Lionel had a big band and somehow the way her style of singing fit right in with the band.  See?  And I also studied music.  I, I took a course in music for four years, see, because to know what you're doing and what you're dealing with and to be educated in it is a very big asset.  Because, see, when I'm talking to musicians, he can dig me because I know what I'm talking about.  I'm not--man, I say, "You're flat, man."  And I could tell him ways--what--you know, why he's flat and I can give him some advice.  So people respect you if you know what you're talking about.  But if you jump up and say something to somebody and they, they are  advanced over you in knowledge they don't pay you no attention because it don't take long before they know that you are not equalizing with them.  So, my knowledge and wisdom of all these people that I worked with, I learned from them.  I used to stand in the wings and watch Billie Holliday at the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York] every show.  Every song that she sang I heard it.  And I found out why all the musicians wanted to work for Billie Holliday.  Billie Holliday was a friend of mine, see.  Sarah Vaughan.  And I looked at all the innovations that she did to the music business.  See, and so right now, I'm a musician within my rights.  I don't, I don't stand out as no individual musician, but I covered it all, see.  And so, when I tell a musician or anybody, if I bring somebody in here and start working with them, and if I tell them something that they doing wrong--if they got a bad attitude I don't fool with them no more.

Speaker 1: Who are some of the people that you--who have come to you [to the Talent Factory, Fort Wayne, Indiana, program teaching inner-city youth the theater arts]?
Speaker 2: Well, this one girl, her name was Natalie Edmunds and she started out over here.  And she came back--well she came back here with a Broadway show called 'One More Time'.  And there's another girl named Michelle Reynolds.  She started out over here, and she, she came back here and brought--you know the group called 'Take 6', the boys that sing a cappella?  Well she married one of them boys.  She brought one of them back, her husband back here to meet me.  Now, that's what she thought about me. And, there's some girls in, in Indianapolis [Indiana] that started out here.  And they're doing fine.  There's another boy that started out--I trained him.  And man, that boy is good.  He done played the Kennedy Theater in Washington [John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.].  His mother come in here, about a month ago, and told me he just signed a contract to do a movie.  And she said, "Mr. Stiles, I don't where DeMarr is playing.  The next time he's doin' an appearance somewhere other than in the movies, I'm going to buy you a plane ticket, so you can go and see him," said, "because you were responsible for him being there."  Now that's something, ain't it?
Speaker 1: It is.  It is.
Speaker 2: All right.  And she means that too.  So, a lady come up to me the other night, over there at my party and gave me a envelope.  And it had twenty-five dollars in it.  She said, "Mr. Stiles," she said, "I hope you don't misunderstand me," she said, " but this twenty-five dollars is to let you know how I appreciate what you did for my grandson.  He's in New York now doing real good."  See, you know, things like that.  And so, I, I feel like, you know, I did what I did.  I didn't do it for money because I didn't charge nobody to come to the Talent Factory.  The Talent Factory was free.
Speaker 1: What about the Checkmates [music group]?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What about the 'Checkmates'?
Speaker 2: Oh! (Laughs)  Man, I went out there to see them guys, man, and it made me feel good because I was coming down--I was on my way to the club that night in a cab.  And the only reason I was in a cab because they had to go in early.  They did a early show.  And so I didn't want to go for the early show, so they told me, said, "Al, just get a cab and come on out.  We'll take care of it."  I was riding in the cab and when I got about half a mile from the club, man, I looked up there and they had them guys' pictures flashing, "Checkmates".  And man, that made me feel good. I said now there's something there that I could feel good about.  'Cause them guys been out there almost thirty years, man, going big.  They're one of the only--I don't know of no other acts that can stay in Las Vegas [Nevada] year in, year out.  But they been doing it.
Story_ID: 13504
Speaker 1: Now you had a, you won a settlement in a case--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, man! That's what I wanted to tell you.  All right.  Okay.
Speaker 1: So what happened?
Speaker 2: All right.  I hired in at the Flashfold Box Company [Fort Wayne, Indiana].  I was the first black to hire in.
Speaker 1: This was after your record store closed down, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This goes back and connects with the guy [Mr. Gettle] that got me the job from the church.  But anyway, when I hired in over there, man, they had never had no blacks working there before.  And so, it was a hell of a, it was a hell of a atmosphere to go into a place where it was all white and, and their opinion of blacks wasn't very big, good, see.  But when I went in there I made myself clear.  I told everybody, I said, "Listen, don't y'all play with me.  I didn't come over here to play, now.  And so don't start no playing with me."
Speaker 1: (Off-camera discussion)
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you were working in the box company, and you were surrounded by white people.
Speaker 1: Am I to take back up where I started?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: So I knew good and well that I didn't go--I didn't plan to stay on it too long.  But I wasn't gone take no shit while I was, I wasn't gone take no foolishness while, excuse me, while I was over there.  So I made myself clear to everybody.  I told everybody, I said, "Listen, don't y'all play with me, 'cause I don't play."  I said, "I don't want to hear none of them Uncle Tom stories, I'm not gonna listen to them.  And don't be messing around goosing me and all that 'cause you can't goose me, see, I'll hurt you."  You understand, I told them that.  So, some of them thought I was kidding, but they tried me.  As soon as--I said, "Hold it!  Wait a minute! You remember what I told you?  Don't you play with me, now, 'cause I ain't gonna play with you."  And so, I kept on reacting that way so they, they got--I made myself believable, you know.  'Cause every time I thought--and one of them would start telling me one of them Uncle Tom, I'd say, "Man, I don't want hear that."  And so, I had a super--a foreman--that he was always trying to put me down, you know. And every time a new guy would come in, he would put him to work with me.  And so I had to train him.  But I would train the guy to keep him from working me to death, you understand what I mean?  And so, any way, they got, they got real down, man.  And so, anyway, this one guy--I went to bend over that day to pick up a skid and when looked back, he was getting' ready to put his foot in my behind.  I looked, I said, "Man, if you put your foot in my behind you won't know what happened to it."  And I went straight over to the supervisor and I told him, I said, "Man, you better tell them to leave me alone," I said, "'Cause I'll kill them."  (Laughs) And he, he went over there and he said, "Listen," said, "you let Al Stiles alone."  He said, "I don't want to work with that nigger anyhow."  And so he said, "Well, goddamn it.  You hit that door," said, "'Cause Al was here when you got here." And so, he left that day.  So anyway, man, I got to thinking and I said--and then, another thing that I noticed, man.  All the guys in the Union, all them was white.  So, anyway, any time a grievance would come up or something, they would always be against me, you know.  And so, I said well, the way to do this--I started going to all the Union meetings.  I wouldn't miss.  And I said I'm going to defeat this.  So every time the president would have a, for somebody to volunteer, (raises his arm) I'd be ready.  Hey, I--they want somebody to go to council meeting, anything.  I was always there (raises arm), you know.  So, but see, they didn't know nothing about my background.  They just thought I was another guy, you know.  Another nigger, I guess (laughs).  So anyway, they didn't know about all these powerful agents I'd done dealt with in New York, and--you know, everything.  And so, but that's all right.  They kept on and I would go to the meetings.  I'd go--so one day the, the president, he, he took a liking to me because I was, I was helping him, you know.  But he didn't realize that I was as smart as I was.  But he just thought I was one of them niggers that, that thought he was buying his way into something, you know. But that wasn't what it was.  And so anyway, it was getting close to election, he said, "Al, why don't you run for vice president?"
Story_ID: 13505
Speaker 1: You were going to Union [International Printing Pressmen Union, Local 19, later the International Printing Pressmen's and Assistants' Union of North America] meetings, and volunteering, and then somebody suggested you run for vice president--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  When he, when he mention, "Al, you oughta run for vice president--."  Well, I knew I could be a vice president, cause I done been a vice president in all kind of organizations, but I told him, I say, "Man, I don't know if I could handle that."  He said, "I'll teach you."  (Laughs)  "I said, "Okay, alright."  But you know what, man, I ran, I ran. I was vice president for four years, and nobody ever ran against me.  Now what does that say?  I was doing a hell of a job, but, (laughs).  So, anyway, this guy was one of them guys that he was of them a, a--what you call it? A, what kind of climbers you call them--social climbers.  He wanted, you know, keep raising up.  So he would do anything to get an advancement, you know.  So anyway, I--I noticed that the way that the president of the company treated him, see.  And I could, I could visualize what a guy like him could do--the damage he could do, see, by being the type of guy that he was.  Because he was the type of guy that, he would spend the union's money unnecessarily, and all these kind of things.  I watched all that.  And so, we was negotiating our contracts, so the, the president of the company told us--for some reason he had a, a dislike for me because he didn't want to go up against me for some reason.  He decided, he detected something about me that made him a little inferior, you know.  Because I was the type of guy, I was straightforward.  I'd tell him what I thought, you know.  And then, I wasn't afraid of him.  He knew that.  And so (laughs) anyway, when we, we, we was negotiating the contract so he started the negotiation off by telling us that we had lost our biggest job.  No, first he, he started off by telling it that we, that wasn't making no money.  I said, "Well, I don't believe that," I said, "You got to show me your books."  "Oh, no, I can't do that!"  I said, "Why can't you?"  I said, "Don't you want me to believe you?"  "Yeah!"  I said, "Well, show me some proof, then.  Why you think I should believe anything you say?"  I fired at him, man.  And he didn't like that.  So anyway (laughs), while he was negotiating the contract I was watching everything because I had a suspicion about the guy who was already our president.  And so I was watching him, so, they started meeting.  Him and our president started meeting privately, but they didn't know that I knew that they was meeting.  I didn't say nothing to nobody.  But anyway, he told me that we--that we had lost our biggest job, and I knew that was a lie, but I didn't say nothing.  I knew that he had done taken them plates out of the--the plant and took them home and put them in his garage.  I knew where they was, but he didn't know that I knew that.  And I didn't say.  So when I told him I didn't believe him, you know, I meant that.  And so, anyway, I--we negotiated and he couldn't understand why he couldn't break me down after he had done told me some bad news like this.  I kept driving hard, man, driving hard.  So, that night I told him, I said, "Mr. Bruce," I said, "if we don't have a contract signed by tomorrow at ten o'clock, we will be out on the street."  Man, he went home that night and he--he took it serious, because he didn't know that I knew that we hadn't lost our biggest job.  But if we'd a went out, we woulda lost it.  'Cause we had a contract.  He didn't know that I knew this.  We had a contract where we had to produce so many boxes a year!  And they had to be ready, so when they needed 'em they could send their trucks in here and get 'em.  And so (laughs), anyway, he said he went home that night and he couldn't sleep.  'Cause he knew, he knew there was something about me that I meant what I said.  And that I would do it.  And so he was tempted--now, he told us this hisself--he was tempted to try to get a meeting two o'clock in the morning.  Get us back in there, cause he had done got to the point he was getting' scared.  So, that's how he got the job--or whatever--because he brought that job to us.  That's how they made him president.  That was our biggest job, Monroe.  So, anyway, he had us back in there at seven o'clock the next morning; and at ten o'clock we had a contract signed.  So he took me serious.  And so, after we signed the contract I said to him, I said, "Mr. Bruce," I said, "You can go get them plates out of your garage."  Boy, you should've seen the look on his face!  Man, I bet he thought to my--hisself, "How in the hell did they all have that much information and wouldn't never say nothing!"
Story_ID: 13506
Speaker 1: But, I'm a diplomat, man.  You know what I mean?  I'm not bragging, but I am a diplomat.  I know how to deal with people.  I been doing it all my life.  Even when I was a kid.  I had kids around me and psyching them out, and telling them what's gonna happen and what wasn't.  You know, I been doing this all my life.  It wasn't nothing new to me.  So then, while we was negotiating, he was negotiating--the president of our union [International Printing Pressmen Union, Local 19] was negotiating a job for hisself.  You know what?  He done told them, and I wasn't there, but I just know that this was what he told them.  They was always asking questions.  They couldn't figure out why Al Stiles could do the things and get things done the way he did.  They was puzzled, you know.  And so, they-they probably said to him, say, well--or he probably said to them, say, "Well, I can handle Al Stiles if you give me that plant manager's job," you know.  And I know this is what happened, but I wasn't there and heard the words, but I know it happened!  And so, I was watching him.  But I never said nothing.  I never let on that I knew what he was doing.  And so when I--I knew that when he got that job I was gone become president.  See what I mean (laughs)?  And I had my gun loaded, you know what I mean?  'Cause I was watching but I never talked--told everybody what I knew or what I thought.  And so it happened.  He came down in the shop one day and to me, said, "Al, how do you feel 'about me being your boss?"  I said, "What you mean?" And I said, "I don't feel nothing about it."  I said, "All I'd like to tell you is you better do your job, because I'm damn sure gonna do mine."  That's all I said to him.  He didn't know how to take me, man.  But anyway, as soon after I got to be president of the union I lit out after him.  Well, I was wrong in a way because my business agents set me up wrong.  I asked him for some advice, and he gave me the wrong advice.  He told me that when I shoulda went after Dick Snyder instead of me going after him, I went after him and the company--which--he was under my jurisdiction when he was president of the union.  And when all of this was happening he was still under the union jurisdiction.  And there where I had--I went wrong, because I went on after both of them.  Both of them was guilty, but I shouldn't have attacked the company because I gave them a right to file a suit if we was wrong.  See what I mean? But anyway, I overcame it, because I, I was just that clever enough to overcome it.  So what happened when--when they--when he got that, that message that the president of the company, he lit out after me.  So he sits down and write a letter to the president of the International [Printing and Pressman Union], trying to scare them, like he was gone sue 'em.  And so, he thought that they would grab a hold of me and shut me up, see.  But he didn't know they couldn't do that because, see, what he didn't know--I was scheduled to go to a council meeting the following week in Pittsburgh, see.  And they couldn't scare me, because I wasn't afraid of my job.  See, if I'd have been afraid of my job, then they'd had a hammer over my head.  But I wasn't.  I could care less about that damn job, because I'm a professional entertainer.  And I coulda went back into show business if I needed to.  You know what I mean?  And so, I had all this security around me.  And so I was-that's why I was able to handle them.  So, anyway, when--when I'm--I went home and I showed--they wrote me a letter, see, and it was supposed to be the same type letter that they wrote the president of the International; and I was supposed to read that letter and get scared.  So when I got the letter, I figured it out, I said, "Shit!  He ain't doing nothing but bullshitting 'cause he ain't gone send this letter to our president because it'll open a can of worms. He's guilty!"
Story_ID: 13507
Speaker 1: Conflict of interest.  You know.  He's guilty.  And I said, "No, he ain't gone do that."  So my wife [Maxine Stiles] said to me, she said--she knew we was going' to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]--she said, "Albert, what're going to do?"  I said, "I ain't gonna do nothing!"  I said, "You mark my words," I said, "if he wrote this letter to our International [Printing and Pressman Union] President, Al Rohan will be at the council meeting, and he knows that I'll be there 'cause I'm a delegate."  I was a officer of the union [International Printing Pressmen Union, Local 19].  And he knew I was gone be there.  I said, "You watch.  When we walk in that door at that hotel--William Penn Hotel--you watch and see, and if he wrote that letter, there will be a note waiting for me, saying that he wanted to see me.  Anything that serious."  And she said, "Well, that makes sense."  I said, "You just watch it."  We went, we went to the--to the council meeting, and the next day that we was there the International president, William Rohan, came and sent to me and my wife's table and talked to us for twenty-five minutes.  He never mentioned nothing.  And my wife said, "I see what you talking about, now."  I said, "Maxine," I said, "I know what I'm doing."  I said, "These people ain't got no stuff for me."  I said, "Because I had a education that they didn't never get a chance to get, even in school.  I got educated by doing, and using this."  My daddy taught me, "Use your head and your hands and you'll be alright," you know.  But anyway, it worked out because, see, when I had this case they [Flashfold Carton, Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana] decided that they had to get rid of me.  So you know how they did?  They come up with this.  They said, "All right," they was always trying to get me to work overtime, but I knew what the law said.  The law said 'a reasonable amount,' so I worked one hour, and that was a 'reasonable amount' as far as I was concerned.  They couldn't contradict that, and I held them to that.  So anyway, they thought, "We need to get rid of Al Stiles.  He's too much trouble."  So they set out to get--to destroy me.
Story_ID: 13508
Speaker 1: So they [management at Flashfold Carton, Inc., Fort Wayne, Indiana] called me in the office one day and told me that I was gonna have to go on 2nd trick [shift].  Either I go on 2nd trick, or it's my job.  I said, "Well, I'm not going on 2nd trick, and I'm not gonna argue with you about it."  I walked out of the damn office.  And so, then this was where everything started, see.  I had to--since they threatened me.  So what they did, the next week they--they took me off of my press and--I'm a pressman now.  And I'm a officer of the union [International Printing Pressmen Union, Local 19] and I got super seniority in the contract, you understand what I mean?  But they--they going' to tell me that don't mean nothing!  But I wouldn't buy it.  So the, the first of the week the, the--the superintendent came and got me and took me out in the warehouse, see.  Now this was supposed to kill my spirit, see.  Had me out there lifting boxes and doing all this crap.  I didn't say nothing.  The next day they come and got me, and took me back, put me back in the folding department.  Had me sealing boxes, you know.  All of this is to degrade me, see.  I'm a pressman now, and pressman is as high as you could go over there, see.  And then I'm president of the Union, too.  So, all this I'm supposed to--this is supposed to kill my spirit, see.  I go back there the second day. The third day, when he came and got me I said, "Man, look, if you ain't got nothing to run on my press, you let me know.  I'll be back when you're ready to run my press."  I said, "I'm a pressman.  I'm not no goddamned flunky.  And y'all ain't gonna make no flunky out of me."  And so, (laughs).  Anyway, he--well, hold it one minute!  He ran upstairs and got a order.  Come back and said, "All right, you can start your press up."  Now there's a job sitting in back of my press that shoulda been gone out in a--a whole week ago.  But, now they gonna hold that job up messing around with me, see.  And think that they gonna scare me.  But they didn't scare me.  So I went over there and started my press up.  All right.  So then that--that Friday they called me in the office and said, "Al, you have been assigned to 2nd trick."  And so I said, "Is that so?"  "Yeah."  All right.  I said, "Well, I'm not going on 2nd trick."  He said, "Well, all right.  Either you go, or it's your job."  I said, "Well, we'll see."  And so, anyway, I went--this was on a Friday--I went and called my--my International [Printing Pressman Union] rep [representative] was in town.  They didn't know it.  And he had a strike sanction in his pocket.  I had got all this together.  I'd done did my homework and everything.  I was ready for them.  They didn't know this though.  And so, he came (unclear)--I called him--and he said, "Al, we'll be in there tomorrow and talk to them," said, "'cause we don't believe that."  So I'm-okay.  So they came in that Saturday.  I had promised that I was gonna work half a day, and I--when I tell people something I be--I do it.  So I came in to work Saturday, and my union--the guy from the International and my business agent--they came in to talk to the company.  So they told me, said, "Al, we're gonna go up here and," said, "we don't think it'd be a good idea for you to go up here," said, "Because they might do something to make you mad and give you--give them a reason to fire you, see."  I said, "Go on, y'all go on and take care of the business," see?  And so, they went up there and was up there two hours, so they come back down and told me, said, "Al," say, "They don't want to give at all.  They won't change."  Said, "But we think that they jiving".  I said, "Well, look," I said, "don't worry about it."  So, so, so they said to me, they said, "Tell you what you do."  Say, "You come in Monday morning on your regular shift.  If they don't let you work, you punch out and go home, and call us.  And we'll take it there."  I said, "Okay."  I came in Monday morning and my foreman--the guy that used to be president of the Union--he was waiting on me.  I went over to my press, checked everything out and got it ready to start up.  He walked over there, and he--walked up in back of me, said, "Al Stiles, you have been assigned to 2nd trick, and I will not pay you for working 1st!"  And I looked around and I said, "Okay."  And I went over and hit the clock, and went on home.  But when I went home I filed about five grievances.  I filed with the Economic Opportunity Commission, with the Human Relations, with the [Nationa] Urban League.  I filed with everybody.  And then I called--.
Speaker 2: But just to try to, you know.  What happened then?  What was the upshot of all this filing?
Speaker 1: Oh, it--it wound up in arbitration.  And I won--I won my case.  The--the judge, the arbitrator, he had thirty days to rule, after he heard the case.  He came back and made me whole for all contractual agreements.
Speaker 2: Okay. So how much--did you get a lot of back pay and stuff--?
Speaker 1: I just had about thirty-eight hundred dollars coming.  'Cause I just--I didn't make a lot of money over there.  But I stayed on that job because it was--it was steady work.  I draw--I worked over there twenty-two years, and I drawed a check every week (claps) for twenty-two years.  Well that meant a whole lot.
Speaker 2: Is there benefits, then?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I had a few benefits, but I was working on trying' to get some better ones, you know.  But I couldn't get them people over there to go along, you know, they was lot of guys from Kentucky and stuff, and they had-they was set in their ways, you know.
Speaker 2: So, when was this?  This was, what-what-what year was this?
Speaker 1: This was in '71 [1971].
Story_ID: 13509
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you this, what do you plan to do in future?  I know you, I think you want to revitalize the Talent Factory [program teaching inner-city youth the theater arts], right?  That's what--that's one of the things.  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't want to, I don't want to say too much about this because I learned one thing. Sometime when you let your plans out too soon, somebody'll usually take them and do them before you or something, but I'm just gonna say point blank that I plan on revitalizing the Talent Factory.  But how I'm gonna to do it I'm not gonna tell nobody.  I'm just gonna go on and do--I got a sponsor.  That's what--that's good.  And I ain't got to worry about the money and all that.  I can set it up the way I want it.  Okay?
Story_ID: 13510
Speaker 1: Tell me, in light of everything you've done--so many things; an entertainer, and into labor, too.  What do you consider is your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy (laughs)?  Well, man, it--it's such a wide scope.  I got so many things that I--I try to take a claim to because of my ability to--to help people and to give people an education, and let 'em share in on some of the things that I've been educated to.  That's my--one of my legacies.  I--I would just like to see people raise their kids a lot better.  That's one thing that bothers me.  We got so many kids that haven't been raised.  It's gonna make a big difference in the future.  I know that.  And see, the reason why I know this is because it made--it broke down a lot of barriers for me because of the way I was raised.  I could---I could--.  I weathered a lot of storms, man.  Just the things that I've told you I came out of 'em real good.  But it was because I had that kind of background.  See, I read a piece--the other day I was in Nat's Ice Cream, and it said something about the flowers withering or something or other.  I don't--I don't have the, the terminology, but it said 'God's word will never fail', you know.  And so, I don't profess to be no big Christian, but I tell you one thing: I try to live right.  Understand what I mean?  I don't have no claim to no Christianity or nothing.  'Cause I understand it all, man, you know.  I don't fool myself.  I know one thing: there's certain things that's in the Bible and it's true.  You gotta reap what you sow.  Don't sow things that you don't want to reap, you know.  And that's what I've been living by.  I try to do what's right by everybody.  And so, it does a lot for me.  It makes me-and I--I would say, I'd be willing to say--I've been pretty good help because of my attitude towards myself.  You gotta like yourself first.  You gotta think well of yourself, and when you do, you won't do a lot of bad things.  When I went to New York, man, I watched junkies and people doing all kinds of--I seen people pour urine out of the window on peoples' heads and all.  Man, I seen so many things with these eyes, and I know that my raising and my belief and everything has helped me to survive a whole--man, I done been through--there's a lot of things that I've been through that I ain't never told you about.  Or couldn't tell you.  It would take a long time.  But, I been through it and so I thank God (pause) that I was able--man, I done served on boards, I done served on damn every board downtown.  I served on the Human Relations Board, I served on the Credit Union Board, I served on the Hands Board, I served on that for thirteen years.  I helped a lot of people get their homes remodeled.  And when the streetlights, and the curbs and things--I was in on all of that, man.  A lot of people don't even know that.

Speaker 1: In light of all that, and I know that, that you're only eighty, you got a lot of energy.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Man, it's hard for me to say.  I'm being remembered now in so many ways that I don't hardly think about it.  Man, every day I experience something that makes me feel good about the way I lived my life.  Every day something happens that brings me back home.  I heard my daddy [Daniel Stiles] tell my mama [Leona Stiles] when I came back home.  She--he said, "Leona, I believe Albert can go anywhere, and do anything that he wants to do.  Any time a eleven year-old [referring to Stiles's childhood journey] go to New York City [New York] and take a nine year-old [childhood friend and entertainment partner, Nathaniel Reese], and come back home the same way he left something going on good," you know.  That's right.
Speaker 1: That's the way to do it, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah!  And if I can, if I can inspire just one person (pause) to do good, I've done something.
