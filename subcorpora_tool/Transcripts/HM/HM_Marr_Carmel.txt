Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Carmel Carrington Marr.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you spell that for us? Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's C-A-R-M-E-L, C-A-R-R-I-N-G-T-O-N, M-A-R-R.
Speaker 1: All right, and do you have a--is Carrington your maiden name?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a middle name otherwise?
Speaker 2: Delores.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the Carmel I did not like when I was a child because the other children that lived on the block used to call me "Carmel Candy Six for a Cent."
Speaker 1: So was that your nickname on the block when you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: I know it's not gentlemanly.
Speaker 2: I have to tell the truth?
Speaker 1: It's for history.
Speaker 2: I was born June 23rd [1921], 19, 19--goodness, have I lost my head already?  That's terrible.  I, I can't--that's--I was born--I was born, goodness.  Wait a minute, I, I, I guess I just don't talk about my age and give the truth often enough to, to preserve my memory on it.  But I, I must have been born around '23 [1923] [sic.], 1923.  Does that sound right?  I, I think it's around 20--1923.
Speaker 1: Okay, are you eighty now?  Are you eighty years old yet?
Speaker 2: I guess so.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah that would be, yeah that would be about right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah I must be.
Speaker 1: Eighty, eighty-one.  Okay.  And where were you born?
Speaker 2: In Brooklyn [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Brooklyn, okay.
Speaker 2: Brooklyn, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and ma'am what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well I'm a member of the [New York State] Bar [Association], and I have been invited by the law school that I attended to go back to the law school and, and teach.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what school is that?
Speaker 2: Columbia [Law School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Columbia, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Columbia, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now so you're an attorney and you were also, you were the first black woman--
Speaker 2: Regulator.
Speaker 1: Regulator for the City of New, of New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't just the City of New York.  And I was also a member of the UN [United Nations], and I wrote a, a book for the UN itself.  And did some other paperwork for the, for the UN, but I was actually part of the U.S. mission to the UN [U.S. Mission to the United Nations].  So it was two different functions that I performed.
Story_ID: 228067
Speaker 1: Ma'am what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Oh goodness, well.  I sort of lost track of the dates since I've been here.  I don't need the glasses.  People used to come to me to get names of people and remember a lot of things that they didn't remember.  This is, this date--
Speaker 1: Does September 13th, 2004 sound all right, sound accurate?
Speaker 2: Well it's, it sounds plausible, I put it that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I lie about my age so much that it's hard for me to be sure that I'm giving you the proper information.
Speaker 1: But today's date is September 13th, 2004.  Would you agree that's, that's true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, could be.
Speaker 1: Well the reason why I--we ask you is so that you can confirm what date it is that we're doing this.  This is on a Monday and we're in--and where are we at the present time?  What's the location of our interview here?
Speaker 2: We are in New City, New York, at an assisted living place, and we live not very far from here.  And--
Speaker 1: In Long Island [New York], right?  You all live in Long Island, not too far.  I mean where is it?
Speaker 2: No, well now we're living here in this enterprise.  Our home is not very far from here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we are planning to move back to our house and make some repairs to it.  We, we're very comfortable with that house and our sons [Charles Marr and Warren Marr, III] are not far away from us.  And we are fortunate in having very good neighbors next to us.  So we've decided to, to go back.
Story_ID: 228068
Speaker 1: Ma'am before we go into depth, before we ask in-depth questions, there are five lightweight questions we always ask.  They just require a short answer.  The first one is, ma'am what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well I do cook quite a bit.  And I guess I would say that my favorite foods are--well I, I have done a lot of cooking and I enjoy making things that may be a little on the sweet side, such as apple pie or I make a, a dish that's really a West Indian dish.  It has quite a bit of fruit in it.  It's dark, a dark cake.  And it's a dish that's made in Barbados and some of the other western parts of the West Indies.
Speaker 1: Okay, what's it called?  What is it called?
Speaker 2: It's called fruitcake, it is called fruitcake.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No, not really, except for the colors of the flowers that we grow.  I guess the--well yellow flowers I like.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I guess that would be the--
Speaker 1: Now, now ma'am do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Not really.  The very cold weather doesn't bother me too much.  I can manage quite well with that.  I don't manage as well with very hot weather, but we traveled quite a bit.  So we have a choice of, of different weathers and temperatures and that sort of thing.  Most of the traveling that I've done have been related to my work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me ask you do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I, I like traveling.  I like seeing other places and I like seeing other people and how they live.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.  I might tell [HistoryMaker] Warren [Marr, II] to behave himself (laughter).  No I don't, I can't think of a, a particular saying that, that I have.  But I do like travel.
Story_ID: 228069
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you about your family history.  Now I wanna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [William Preston Carrington] side of the family.  And I wanna start with your mother's side.  Ma'am, how far back can you trace your ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: I can trace them back quite far.  And well my--both my parents on both sides came to the United States early in their, in their ages.  And I have still living members of my parents' families and we're close.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm sorry, I didn't ask you to give us your mother's name.  But can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?  And then you can tell us what you know about that.
Speaker 2: Gertrude Clementine Carrington.  Well her maiden name was Lewis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth, do you know?
Speaker 2: Her place of birth was Barbados.  I'm not sure I can remember her--
Speaker 1: Do you know what town in Barbados?
Speaker 2: She was, she was born in--I should--I, I have forgotten it because one of the things about Barbados and some of the other West Indies is that they have much better records of birth than the, than exists in the United States.  And very often people would come to me to ask me about their birth date because they were seeking to get Social Security.  And the records in Barbados, and I'm sure it's true in Jamaica and Trinidad, they--you go there and you get the records and it gives you everything you need to know in order to get Social Security.  You don't have that in the United States.  You might not realize it, but that's, that's the story that their records are far better, or at least they were.  I assume that they're still far better in the West Indies than they have been in the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you--do you have a guess as to when your mother was born?  What year?
Speaker 2: I should remember that.  I certainly remember the day she died.
Speaker 1: When did she die?
Speaker 2: She died, gosh I should remember it very well because I had just arrived at the office up in Albany [New York] and I was told that my mother had died.  I, I don't remember the exact date.  I just got so up--
Speaker 1: Well the year.  If you can give us the year.  Do you remember the year?  Was it in the '60s [1960s], '70s [1970s], '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Probably the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Sixties [1960s], okay.
Story_ID: 228070
Speaker 1: Now you, you said you knew quite a bit about her [Marr's mother, Gertrude Lewis Carrington] ancestors are from--in Barbados?  What can you tell us about, about them, about the ancestors in Barbados?
Speaker 2: Well my mother's, my mother had a brother who, whose wife died when she was twenty-something.  And he was one of the people that built the canal.
Speaker 1: The Panama Canal [Panama]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he was left alone to take care of their children.  And he did that.  He, he ironed their clothes, he, he, he raised those children by himself.  And he didn't come to the United States, but there were other members of the family that did go to the United States.  And he ironed the child--the children's clothes.  He nev--he didn't get married again or anything like that.  He raised the children on his own.  And, and they came here to the United States and they made good records.  The oldest child went to one of the southern colleges, and I can't remember the name of it at the moment.  But she established quite a record for herself.  And--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: That's on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Barbados?  Now how far back can you trace that side?  Did they--I mean can you trace 'em back any further than your mother's brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because they were all raised together.  And they went to, they went to southern colleges that, that branch of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was asking how, how far back can you trace the family?  I mean the--your mother's side of the family.  I mean can you go back to a grandmother, a great-grandmother, a great-great-grandmother?  Can you go back like that?
Speaker 2: Certainly to a grandmother, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And incidentally, the records in Barbados are far superior to the records in the United States.  And you know when I think of it, I'm, I'm impressed with the information that you can get from their records that you can't get in the United States.  People used to come to me to find out how old somebody was or when somebody passed away.  And I could get that information very easily in Barbados.  They would come to get information in the United States that just wasn't available.  And when they were getting, trying to get Social Security, they would come in the United States to get the information they needed in order to get Social Security.  But in Barbados you just went to the office, sat down, went through the records and you had all that you needed.
Story_ID: 228071
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Gertrude Lewis Carrington] talk about growing up?  Did she grow up in Barbados basically?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did she have any stories about growing up, or do you know how she--if she had a chance to--
Speaker 2: Well, you knew how she expected people to behave themselves.  Yes, yeah she taught--and some of it was, was--some of the things were simple things.  Strong belief in having your clothes clean.  You didn't go out walking around with the clothes, clothes that weren't neat and clean.  And didn't make any difference whether you were poor or not as to whether or not you could go out in the, you know, walk out in the street with clothes that needed to be ironed or things of that sort.  They were quite strict about things like that.  But what impressed me the first time I went to Barbados to visit family members, was the accuracy of the records they had about birth and age and things of that sort that people that wanted to get Social Security in the United States sometimes had a difficult time getting that kind of information.  But in Barbados you went to the office and you opened the books and, and you had it.
Speaker 1: Now how long did your mother live in Barbados?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, although I have the records at home.
Speaker 1: Did she come to Barbados when she was still in high school or, or was she in grade school or--
Speaker 2: No, she was, she was in high school when she came.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was trained as a--she sewed.  She was quite a, a good sewer.  And she used to make most all of my clothes.  My father [William Preston Carrington] was trained as a tailor and he made a number of his clothes.  He didn't do it as a business, but he did--and he helped [HistoryMaker] Warren [Marr, II] to learn how to do some tailoring.
Speaker 1: Now did your, did your grandfather bring his family up, you know, all intact?  Is that what happened or what?
Speaker 2: No, the man that I refer to was not my grandfather really.  He was, well he was an uncle.  But that was you know--he worked on the Panama Canal [Panama].  Did I say that before?
Speaker 1: Yes, but you didn't--I wasn't clear.  I thought that he was your, your mother's brother or something.  Was that your mother's brother?  Okay, all right.  So your, your uncle brought the family up to, or brought your mother to the United States.  Did she come right to New York [New York], directly to New York?
Speaker 2: To Brooklyn [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: To Brooklyn, okay.  About what year was that, do you, you think?
Speaker 2: You know I have all of those forms at the, at my house.  I don't really remember.
Speaker 1: Well can you give us an approximation of when it might have been?
Speaker 2: Well I, I went--I started going to school, elementary school when I was five.  And I guess the thing that I remember that sticks to me is that you knew the--we knew the ages of the different family members and people used to come into my office to see about getting Social Security.  And it was not difficult for them to get Social Security because they had the records of when they were born in Barbados.  But those that were not from Barbados, you know, but wanted to get their Social Security, it wasn't as easy for them to get proof of their ages.  Whereas in Barbados, you just went into the office and you went through the, the papers and you knew your age and you could prove it.
Story_ID: 228072
Speaker 1: We've talked about that, but tell me did your mother [Gertrude Lewis Carrington] have any stories to relate about her first experiences here in, in Brooklyn [New York, New York]?  Or how it was different from Barbados?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  She always said that you couldn't go outdoors in clothes that weren't clean and properly ironed.  That's about as much of--
Speaker 1: Did she like Brooklyn better than Barbados?
Speaker 2: No I wouldn't say so.  They had good lives in Brooklyn before Brooklyn began to change.  Brooklyn has changed quite a bit.  And we went back to Barbados from time to time and I took that opportunity to see their records and I was really quite impressed by the accuracy and the, you know the--
Speaker 1: Well let's see.  Can you give us your--now I'm sorry, what did your mother do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well-
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Keep, keep going, I think we can keep going.  But what did your mother do for a living?
Speaker 1: Well she, she didn't work for a living, really.  She was a very good seamstress, but she didn't do that for a living.  My father [William Preston Carrington] became a realtor and he also invested in the market as I did.  And this past year was rather difficult for me because the company with which I dealt really mislead me.  So we've switched to another company.
Story_ID: 228073
Speaker 1: Ma'am, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: [William] Preston Carrington.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth, do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't remember now.
Speaker 1: Were your parents born around the turn of the century, 1900, 1901?  Around that time or was it earlier than that, or--
Speaker 2: Maybe I have lost my ability to remember anything.  I don't remember off the top of my head.
Speaker 1: Was your mother [Gertrude Lewis Carrington] in her twenties when she had you or was she younger or older?
Speaker 2: Well she would have been younger.  She would have been younger.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she wasn't quite twenty when she had you and so she would be, what, 18, 19?  Yeah, maybe she was born in 1903, 1904, something like that.
Speaker 2: Something, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen o' five [1905].  All right and same for your father, or, or was he older than her, or was he about the same age?
Speaker 2: He was older than she was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Considerably older or just a little older?
Speaker 2: Just a little older.
Speaker 1: Just a little older, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So maybe put him 1900, 1895, 1900, something like that.  Okay.  Well so your father, your father was born in Barbados too.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did, did--was he--how old was he when he left?  Do you know, have any idea how old he was when he--
Speaker 2: I don't remember, I have--
Speaker 1: Was he grown or was he still a child?
Speaker 2: No, he was grown, yeah.  And he and his brother formed a business.  They were realtors.  And he did not get along very well with his father.  I never met my grandparents, my paternal grandparents.  And he was, he was--my father was very successful with his real estate business.
Speaker 1: Now did he have a chance to go to school when he was a young man?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes he did, yeah.  But--
Speaker 1: Where did he go to school, do you know?
Speaker 2: In Barbados.  And he was one of five children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he wanted his father to send him to law school in England.  And his father didn't do that.  He did not get along well with his father.  I never met my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay so he was, he was in real estate, your father was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  And--
Speaker 2: And he was the first grand juror in New York City [New York, New York].  And--
Speaker 1: First black grand juror?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 228074
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about growing up?  What's your first childhood memory that you--
Speaker 2: Well for one thing I, I loved to dance and I took dancing lessons.  I was given, you know, my mother [Gertrude Lewis Carrington] sent me to dancing school.  And I enjoyed that very much.  Still enjoy dancing.  And she was very strict with me in a, in a soft, understanding way.  And when the other children on the block went to the store to get penny candy, I was told definitely I was not allowed to go to the store to buy penny candy, and if I wanted candy, she had candy in the house, period.  But we did a lot of things together.  And she would go to school and get me and take me home.  She didn't allow me to just walk along the street as some of the other children on the block did.  But it was a--she made her regulations and rules.  But it was always with a warmth and an understanding, and they were, they were good parents.
Story_ID: 228075
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well we did some traveling every summer.  Go out on Long Island [New York] and stay with some friends of my parents [Gertrude Lewis Carrington and William Preston Carrington] out there.  We went to some of the black resorts and spent some time there.
Speaker 1: What were some of the names of some of the black resorts, can you remember?
Speaker 2: Kings Lodge [Otisville, New York].
Speaker 1: Yeah now that one, now that one I, I believe was owned by the famous tap dancer, [Clayton] "Peg Leg" Bates.  Did he own Kings Lodge?
Speaker 2: No, he had a place but not, not that one.  Yeah, yes he did.  And I think there was one other place, black place that--now I really have forgotten what I should know.  Father--the religious, the minister.
Speaker 1: Father Divine [Reverend M.J. Divine]?
Speaker 2: Yes, he had a place also upstate New York.  And my father, my uncle went there and stayed.  I remember some time ago.  I didn't, I never did get to, to go there.  But when spring came, it was time to, to go to the country someplace.  And I became a lawyer really because my father had wanted very much to be a lawyer.  And he felt that his, his father could well afford to prepare him for that.  I, I never met my grandparents because my father was alienated from his father, not from his mother, but from his father.
Story_ID: 228076
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about school now?  Did you like school and what school did you attend first?  What was your first elementary?
Speaker 2: Well the, of course the first was elementary school.  And I did well in school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Well the--that was a public school that I went to.
Speaker 1: Did it have a number or something, like P.S. something?
Speaker 2: Thirty five, P.S. 35 [Brooklyn, New York, New York], yeah.  And my mother [Gertrude Lewis Carrington] would walk to the school and get me at the end of the day.  She didn't allow me to go roaming around, even if it was to the library.  She would, she would go and get me.
Speaker 1: Were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did well.
Speaker 1: What were your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: Well elementary level it was just about anything that taught.  They--you know we--in those days we had music appreciation.  Of course we had math and, you know the basics.  And I guess was about two years ago that I took my grandchildren and helped them because I wasn't satisfied with the education they were getting.  So I took it upon myself to take them.  And I was really shocked to see how the schools had changed, the public schools.  I couldn't believe what I saw, really.  I went--I have one of my grandsons was born with a hole in his heart.  And I took him especially because I didn't feel he was getting proper attention.  Maybe it's not diplomatic for me to say that, but that's the way I felt.  When I went to school, we had music appreciation, we had a wide variety of subjects that we were taught.  I took this boy to school one day to talk with his teachers and see what was going on.  I went into the school, went up the steps, went to the door of the classroom, and I looked through the window and the children in the class were jumping around and I couldn't see what in the world they were learning from what I could see through the window.  And I took my grandson and pulled him away from the door 'cause there seemed to be so much confusion going on.  I'm calling it confusion as a polite name.  And suddenly he pushed me up against the wall and the door opened and the children came running out, almost knocked me down.  And I went in and I spoke with the teacher and what she told me they had for the classwork, seemed to me to be nothing but nonsense.  It was just--I have never seen a school experience similar to that.
Story_ID: 228077
Speaker 1: When you were in school, you said you were a pretty good student, right.  Did you have some favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Well I had, yes I did, yeah.  And--
Speaker 1: Can, can you name some of them for us?
Speaker 2: Well I can think of one experience that I thought was terrible.  The teacher--we had more than one teacher, you know over, say an hour or something like that.  And one day the teacher came into the classroom and she said something.  I know she said that the--that it was so cold in the classroom.  And one of the children said, "Well you should get some of that whiskey that you drink."  And she went over and she slapped him in his face.  I think I'll always remember that.  It was just unbelievable that a teacher certainly in, in those days would expose herself to such a situation.  She went out and she got a male teacher who came back and slapped this boy who had said go get, you know, "Why don't you go get your whiskey."  And we had a wide assortment of subjects.  We had music appreciation, cooking, a wide variety of subjects.  The school that my grandson went to didn't have that assortment.  And I went to the principal and I didn't get anywhere with him either.  So--
Speaker 1: But your school experience was a lot different from what today's experience is.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah, music appreciation, cooking, which I didn't care too much for.  But you know we had a wide range of, of things.  And it was at that period that children began to--parents began to send their children to the Catholic schools.
Speaker 1: Now did you--let's see now I asked you about teachers.  You couldn't remember the names of some of the teachers, right, right offhand, so--but now--
Speaker 2: Some of my teachers I could remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I was ask--yeah I was asking you for those.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well yes we had one teacher who was quite old and I should remember her name.  She was there forever.  At the elementary level [P.S. 35, Brooklyn, New York, New York] I guess the few that I remember were Mrs. Miss Johnson [ph.] who was rather elderly.  And the teacher that taught cooking, and I didn't like the things we had to cook.  So I, I don't know that there's anything really significant about the--
Speaker 1: About those people.
Speaker 2: About the individual, yeah.
Story_ID: 228078
Speaker 1: When you went on to high school, where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to--well I went first to--
Speaker 1: A middle school, or--
Speaker 2: No.  It was--what do they call it?  It was--you, you went there if you had good grades, they sent you to rapid--
Speaker 1: Sort of accelerated--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I went to that.  And yeah I, and I skipped, I skipped two terms at that school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Good, what was the name, the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Well it was, it was--that's terrible.  Maybe I have lost my memory.  Maybe the woman that came and tapped my head knew what she was talking about.
Speaker 1: If it comes to you, let us know.  Did you go to high school in Brooklyn [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was, it was the high school that skipped terms and that was in Brooklyn, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about high school.  How did you like it and what did you do?  Were you active in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes I was.  At lunch time I was called on to entertain, really, the younger children.  I would do little imitations of ZaSu Pitts or something like that during the lunch hour.
Speaker 1: ZaSu Pitts.  I haven't heard her name in a long time.
Speaker 2: But you understand that that's, that's a mistake because I was really very, very young.
Speaker 1: She, she was a costar with Gale Storm on a TV show ['The Gale Storm Show'] in the six, in the '50s [1950s] or '60s [1960s].  I remember that.  She's in a couple of (unclear) '40s [1940s] movies.  Can you still do her?
Speaker 2: Well haven't even thought about, about her.  Anyway, I didn't do Mae West.
Speaker 1: Didn't do that one.
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: Did you go to the movies a lot when you were young?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My, my mother [Gertrude Lewis Carrington] would go to the school and pick me up, take me home, and she would check my homework to see that I had done my work.  And then we would leave the house and maybe go to the movies or I might go to the ice cream parlor near us.  And also I would always stop at the library, which was right near the school.  We were always on the move.
Speaker 1: Now was music a big part of growing up?  Did you, did you play an instrument or sing?
Speaker 2: No, wanted to play the, learn to play the piano, but my father [William Preston Carrington] never, he never bought a piano for me.  And I used to go out to East New York [Brooklyn, New York, New York] to my uncle's house and they had a player piano.  And I would you know, go and play the player piano.  But I never persuaded my father to get a piano for me.  I liked, you know I liked music and I did take dancing lessons, toe dancing and what was the other, two different--
Speaker 1: Modern dance like?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Modern dance like [HistoryMaker Katherine] Dunham technique type dance.
Speaker 2: A bit, yes.
Story_ID: 228079
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well yes and no because the church was right around the corner from our house.  And in fact I had a letter a week ago from friends that lived two doors from us, letting us know that they were now in the same type of living that we have here.  And talked about the things that we used to do when we're kids.  But my mother [Gertrude Lewis Carrington] would, you know, would go to school, get me, take me home and after we finished doing my homework, then we would go out and maybe go to the movies, especially if it was the summer time.  We might go to an outdoor movie.  We were always active.
Speaker 1: So the drive-in movies?
Speaker 2: Well no, not when I was--
Speaker 1: Outdoor.  They just showed the movies outside, outdoors?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the black movies?  I heard now we interviewed [HistoryMaker] William Greaves and he said that when he was a, a child he said that Oscar Micheaux would come to Harlem [New York, New York], the shows, to show his movies.  He would come himself, you know and show, I guess talk about.  Do you remember anything like that, or--
Speaker 2: No, except that we had tenants upstairs in our house when, you know when I was going to elementary school [P.S. 35, Brooklyn, New York, New York].  And they would call me when 'Amos 'n' Andy' came on.  "[HistoryMaker] Carmel [Marr], 'Amos 'n' Andy'."  And I would go upstairs and, and watch that movie.
Story_ID: 228080
Speaker 1: I didn't get up to Harlem [New York, New York] very much either.
Speaker 2: So you were from Brooklyn [New York, New York], you lived in Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  And we had, had friends and relatives that lived in Harlem, but--and whenever people came from Barbados, there was always long discussion about politics and such that I would sit and listen to.  But--
Speaker 2: Now do you know if your parents [Gertrude Lewis Carrington and William Preston Carrington] were active in Marcus Garvey's movement back in those days?
Speaker 1: No, they knew about Marcus Garvey.  But they weren't active in that.  One other thing, when people came from the West Indies to our house, there was always a great debate about politics, which I, I never really paid any attention to as a, you know as a youngster.  But they would come and there would be long debates about what should be done or shouldn't be done, or how somebody functioned, whether he functioned well or not.
Speaker 2: Were they mainly New York politics or the politics on the island?
Speaker 1: Well it was a little bit of both.  There was always a, you know a lot of discussion about the efficiency or lack of efficiency of some, some officeholder.
Story_ID: 228081
Speaker 1: Now when you were in grad--in high school, did you--were you real active?  Did you run for class office or anything, or did you graduate with honors or anything that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: From junior high [P.S. 35, Brooklyn, New York, New York] I graduated with honors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, you know well junior high, you do skip some classes and you know and I went to junior high.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, did you have any idea what you wanted to be in, in high school?
Speaker 2: Well I certainly did because my father [William Preston Carrington] wanted me to be a lawyer, and he made no bones about it.  So, you know.  He had wanted to be a lawyer in Barbados, but he and his father did not get along.  And his father had what was recognized as a good position in Barbados.  So I, I never saw, never met my grandparents.  But I did get to Barbados.  We went several times.
Story_ID: 228082
Speaker 1: So ma'am, you wanted to go to law school, right.  You knew you wanted to be a lawyer when you were in high, in high school, so what, what college were you planning to attend at that point in time?
Speaker 2: I went to Hunter College [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's the City College of New York [sic. City University of New York], right, Hunter.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well so, so you went right out of high school to Hunter College, and this is about 1941 I guess.  Or is it, is it earlier?  'Cause you got skipped in school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what do you think, 1939, 1940?
Speaker 2: Probably '39 [1939].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay well tell us about Hunter College.  What, what was Hunter College like and what did you major in?
Speaker 2: What did I major in?  Having a good time.
Speaker 1: A lot of people do that now.
Speaker 2: No, I, I did well in it.  You know in terms of my grades, and also I enjoyed it because I enjoyed the other students that went to Hunter.
Story_ID: 228083
Speaker 1: Now we were talking about Hunter College [New York, New York] and what was your major in Hunter College, at Hunter?  Did you--a lot of lawyers I know major in political science.  Did you do that, or did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, political science, poli sci is what we called, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And so you enjoyed it, you said.  Are there any specific professors that you remember at Hunter College that really had an impact on you?
Speaker 2: No, why not though?  I guess I remember the, the students more than I think of individual professors.
Speaker 1: Now who were some of the students that--
Speaker 2: Carlotta Certane [ph.].  I don't know whether you--
Speaker 1: How do you spell her name?  How, how is her name spelled? Carlotta Certane?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Who else?
Speaker 2: Goodness.  A friend that lived a couple of doors from me and became a, a superintendent of schools in--not far away, around, about--in [New] Jersey.  She became the superintendent of schools, and that's a friend that I just got a letter from too.  Maybe I can't remember anymore.  That's a nurse that came and sat on my bed and told me I wouldn't be able to accept the invitation from the law school [Columbia Law School, New York, New York] that I had graduated from.
Speaker 1: Well it'll come to you sooner or later.  Keep that thinking about.  But tell me now you were a political science major, and is there any outstanding incident or anything at, at Hunter that, that--a story from your days in college that you can tell us?
Speaker 2: No.  The--there was a group of us, and--
Speaker 1: A group of black students?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And at the end of the day, we would go into the library and start working on our homework.  And there's one girl, and I'm not remembering her name, but she would come into the library and she would start talking and just keep on talking while the rest of us were trying to read some of the books.  And she was really fantastic.  She finished reading, reading quickly.  And the next thing we knew, while we were still going through the books, she was getting herself up out of her chair and, and leaving.  She did very well.  She was really a bright student.  And, and then it was a time also when several of the students got married and some of them moved to other parts of the city or to other, other areas totally.  Although we've all kept in touch with each other, there's some down in north Jersey and some in some other part of, you know, the country.  But we've moved into different fields.  I, I moved into too many different posts, really.  And although it--
Speaker 1: Now, well before we get you there, let's, let's--now you, you graduated from Hunter College in--
Speaker 2: I, I, well I don't know--
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-three [1943]?  Did, did, did you graduate in '43 [1943] or from Hunter College?  Forty-three [1943] or '44 [1944].
Speaker 2: Or '45 [1945].
Story_ID: 228084
Speaker 1: Well what happened was I, I went right to the UN [United Nations].
Speaker 2: Right out of undergraduate school [Hunter College, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Mm-hm, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you didn't go to law school first.  You went, went to, to, to the UN first?
Speaker 1: I went to the UN.  Well I went to--I did go to Dyer & Stevens [Esquires, New York, New York].  Do you know of that law firm?
Speaker 2: Okay, now, now I don't have you out of law school yet.  See, so we're still trying to get you in law--your--you went to Columbia Law School [New York, New York], right?
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: So did you go right from Hunter College to Columbia Law School and then, then to the Dyer & Stevens?
Speaker 1: Dyer & Stevens, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, okay.  All right well, well if you, if you--is there anything about law school you wanna tell us?
Speaker 1: Well there were very few women in law school.  And there were eleven of us in the whole law school.  And the dean of the law school would see me coming along the hall and there weren't that many of us that he would really not know who we were.  And somehow I became the head of one of the moot courts.  And the dean would come along the hall and see me, and even though he may have seen me only five minutes before he passed me, and he would call me by the wrong name, which irritated me a bit.  And I had become the dean of the Bramwell Moot Court.  And he is the one that gave me that post.  And we were called on every day, you know, challenged with some response to some (unclear).  And he never knew my name.  You know he'd see me in the hall.  He was on his way to Bramwell Moot Court.  He had appointed me as the head of Bramwell Moot Court.  And well I really didn't have any, any likings for, for that dean.  And the first time that I went to head the meeting of the moot court, I--a student came in, sat down, looked up at me and said, "What is she doing here?"  He was a southerner.  And the person sitting next to him told him that I was the head of the moot court.  And he picked up his books and walked out.  Didn't bother me because if it meant, if it didn't mean anything to him, there was no reason why he should sit there.  And besides, I didn't think he was bright enough to be there, which sounds egotistical, but I'm really serious about that.  And the, the dean was not--I didn't feel that I had respect from him, even though he had appointed me as the dean of this moot court.  And the, the fellow that picked up his books, went out and he left the law school.  He did not return.  There was some other incidents of--well maybe I should just call it stupidity, but whatever it was, I, I thought it, I thought it was really rather--I thought it was something that should have been handled by the dean in an appropriate way.  He appointed me and this man got up and left immediately and made it clear why he was leaving, which was because I was there and I was not white.  I felt that the dean had a, a responsibility to handle that in some way.
Story_ID: 228085
Speaker 1: Another one of the students and I teamed up and we took a course, took a--we became--we were students who--well we, we acted together in a--
Speaker 2: In terms of the [Bramwell] Moot Court?  I mean the--what did you d--
Speaker 1: Of, of the moot court, we teamed up together.  And we, we did very well.  We succeeded very well and the--those that were judging us, were members of the faculty.  And they responded very well to our arguments and so we both assumed that we would be going on to what they call the Stone [Moot Court] Competition [Harlan Fiske Stone Moot Court Competition].  It didn't happen because the dean scratched it out.  They didn't have it, the Stone Competition.  And I guess part of the reason that I thought there was some substance in the invitation that had come to me just recently to come back to the law school [Columbia Law School, New York, New York] and teach, was that the teachers there that listened to the case and commented on what we had to say, were so enthusiastic in their comments about how we handled ourselves.  And so I was surprised when the dean announced that the Stone Competition was not going to be held.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's what we were arguing for.  And also--
Speaker 2: Did they ever--
Speaker 1: Several of the teachers asked me to come in and talk with them, which I did.  And they were very complimentary in their comments.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they weren't the deans, you know.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So well did you all just kind of drop it there or what?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well we had no authority to do anything about the Stone Competition.
Speaker 2: Now this is in the, the '40s [1940s], right in '45 [1945], '46 [1946] I guess?  I'm trying to think of what--this is near the end of the war [World War II, WWII], right?
Speaker 1: Mm-hm, yes.
Speaker 2: Or was the war over with?  This is near, near the end.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Of World War II.
Story_ID: 228086
Speaker 1: So you got your law degree and started work--working for that--the firm you mentioned a while ago, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dyer & Stevens [Esquires, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Dyer & Stevens.  And what kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  There was also a firm Dyett & Stevens [New York, New York].  Yeah, but Dyer & Stevens is the one that I linked with.
Speaker 1: Now what was your area of concentration in law school [Columbia Law School, New York, New York] and what kind of law did you, did you really study?
Speaker 2: Whatever came up, really.  It was a, a broad, broad field in the law school, and I felt that that made it all the worse, that they would cancel the Stone [Moot Court] Competition [Harlan Fiske Stone Moot Court Competition].  And obviously the school did feel that I had some ability and that I had performed fairly well.  I, I went several times to some members of the faculty to talk about things that I thought were not, were wrong and should be corrected.  And they, they listened to me and then reacted well.  But when I got to the point where the Stone Competition, which was the big thing, it was the dean that you know, did nothing to support, certainly nothing to support me or, or for that matter my partner.  And--
Speaker 1: So you didn't have a, did you have an idea in law school that you were going to be a, a corporate lawyer or a civil rights lawyer, or a tort lawyer.  What kind of a lawyer did you think you were gonna--did you wanna practice as when you--after law school?  And what did you pursue?
Speaker 2: I really pursued just about everything.  I, I had a rather general feeling about what I would be doing.  And the law firm that I joined with was general in its practice.  I did have an invitation from another law firm, a good law firm, but I didn't--I, I never did really get to--I did--I wasn't ready to jump out of the one and go to another at that, at that stage.  So I wound up doing a whole lot of things.  Did--maybe took on too much (laughter).
Story_ID: 228087
Speaker 1: Now how did you get involved with the United Nations [UN]?
Speaker 2: How did I get there?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh. Oh goodness.  The--now I'm trying to remember which--that was the year that [Ambassador Henry] Cabot Lodge [Jr.] was the head of the U.S. mission to the UN [U.S. Mission to the United Nations].  And he is--he hired me.
Speaker 1: Henry Cabot Lodge, right?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Henry Cabot Lodge.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you meet, or did you have a chance to meet Ralph Bunche.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what was he like and how did you meet him?
Speaker 2: Well he was, he was part of the UN.
Speaker 1: He wrote the charter I think, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And some of the work that I did was done with, with him.  And then I also--
Speaker 1: What was he like?  So many people haven't met, you know, they'll never have a chance to meet Ralph Bunche, you know so tell us what your impression of Ralph Bunche was.
Speaker 2: A very positive impression with him.  He--and there were some things that I did not like with the way that he was treated.
Speaker 1: For instance?  For instance?
Speaker 2: Well this has to do with his view of what the UN should do, should accomplish as compared with the views of some others.  And I, I felt strongly that they should have given him--well maybe it's not right to say more importance, 'cause he did have--he, he had an important role.  But there were things that I felt didn't really, didn't really measure up to the role that, that he should have had.  I mean they--I didn't think he was always allowed to do the things that needed to be done, and that he was capable of doing.
Story_ID: 228088
Speaker 1: I wound up at one point leaving the U.S. mission to the UN [U.S. Mission to the United Nations].
Speaker 2: Now what year was that?
Speaker 1: That was because--gee, I don't remember right now.  But what happened was that [Ambassador Henry] Cabot Lodge [Jr.] was giving me authority to do a number of things and I took them seriously.  But he had a man on the staff that was a bigot, and there's no other way of describing him, except that he was a bigot.  And one day Lodge came into my office and wanted to know where the newspapers were that dealt with some things that I had been working on.  And I, I didn't quite know how to handle that either because he wanted to know what publicity I had had.  And he seemed to be a bit peeved because I hadn't given him press clippings.  I didn't know that I was supposed to give him press clippings because when I went to the person who was his primary assistant, he kept you know, putting me out of the way.  He didn't want me to be speaking with Cabot Lodge.  And he was a southerner.  And a true southerner.  And I, you know I wasn't--I guess it wasn't really any of my business, but I made it my business, which may not have been the best thing for me to have done as far as I was concerned.  But Lodge apparently had enough up here to see what was going on, and he, he gave me some things to do that he wanted me to do.  And I think, I think more of that could have been done if the bigot he had on his staff had been moved out a bit.  But I, I enjoyed the UN and I did have responsibilities given to me that I liked.  And I took it upon myself to move into the [United Nations] Secretariat instead of just working for the US mission.  And from that point on, I was very heavily involved in the UN.  And I, I also wrote a book for regulations that should be viewed and considered seriously by the Secretariat.  So I, you know I went from one side of the street to the other.  And when I left to go to the Secretariat, there was a sit-down strike.  And the guards in the secre--the US mission, picked me up and took me across the street to the, to the UN.
Story_ID: 228089
Speaker 1: Another person from that period of time in the UN [United Nations] was Dr. Channing [H.] Tobias--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Who I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, was a director of the Harlem Y[MCA, New York, New York] at one time and a big Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association] executive before he got involved with the United Nations.  Did you meet him in the United Nations too?  I mean when you worked, while you worked there?
Speaker 2: I may have, but I was pretty much bound to pulling together various issues and I did a book kind of thing on things that needed to be addressed in the [United Nations] Secretariat.  And as a--well there was one that I would have liked to have dealt with, but I didn't, 'cause I was taken over to the--across the street to the UN by one of the people who was--had a high position in, in the U.S. Mission [to the United Nations].  And when I got over there and I was sitting next to this man on the staff, I was so embarrassed I didn't know what to do and I wound up doing nothing.  He was telling them how to keep their places clean and--
Speaker 1: Now who was he telling this to?  The--
Speaker 2: To the re--I was gonna say Republicans.  To the people at this meeting that he had called.
Speaker 1: These are representatives from other countries or what?  What are they?
Speaker 2: Yes, from other coun--from other countries with black members.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And there I was, the only black person.  And I'm sitting next to this man who's telling them how to keep their places clean, clean the kitchens and to clean this and do that.  I have never gotten over that.  And it, you know it's a--I probably would have been the same if, if he had even been more intelligent.  I didn't have the rank to tell him that he was not being intelligent.  But I'll never forget that.  To be sitting up someplace telling Democrat--not Democrats, but telling people from other countries how to keep their places clean.
Speaker 1: Insulting, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well but life I guess is very interesting because you don't know what's coming next.
Story_ID: 228090
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other personalities around the UN [United Nations] that you, that you grew to know?  Did you, did you--
Speaker 2: Well I knew--
Speaker 1: And what was your, what was your title?  What was your official title at the UN?
Speaker 2: Well I was--as far as the [United Nations] Secretariat was concerned, I was on, I was a member of the Secretariat.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did go over for one year to the Secretariat and that's when I wrote a book on procedures for the UN.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of procedures were you writing about?
Speaker 2: Well I for example, used to write parts of the speeches for representatives from other countries.  That's not something that you would spread, so you know you wouldn't find that.  But I, I wrote a number of the speeches that other--delegates from other countries you know, they delivered those speeches.  And I did a--well I don't know whether to say book because it wasn't that big, but I did a report on procedures for those in, in the Secretariat who were lawyers.  And maybe I don't have the memory anymore.
Speaker 1: Well, okay well did you--some of the--I know--just ask you about some names I read about and you can tell me if you, what you can tell me about 'em.  But did--you were there in, in the early stages of the, of the development of the UN.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How long were you there altogether?  How many years were you at the UN?
Speaker 2: Because I--when did I leave?  All the time that I was there, I was working, you know, as a member of the Secretariat.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So how many years were you there?  You say from about forty, '47 [1947], '46 [1946], '47 [1947] I guess to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Until when?  Were you there during the [President Dwight David "Ike"] Eisenhower administration too?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you go all the way through the Eisenhower administration at the UN?
Speaker 2: Yes, come to think of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that takes us to 19--
Speaker 2: I used to go down to Washington [D.C.] once a week.  And we had meetings and with the president and his staff.  I'm not sure I remember individual issues anymore.
Story_ID: 228091
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet--well what did you think of [Secretary-General] Dag Hammarskjold?
Speaker 2: I thought he was--I, I, I liked him, I did.  And he, he was very good in terms of his manner of dealing with the--well with the staff and people who were involved there.  I--I don't normally say this, but I did some of the writing of the speeches that were given by other delegates and that I did quietly in one of the back seats while the meetings were going on.  And I, I, I spent one year writing a book about procedures.  I spent that year in the [United Nations] Secretariat.  Technically I was a member of the U.S. Mission [to the United Nations], not really of the Secretariat.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I did some, I, I stuck some legal stuff in there I thought ought to be included.
Speaker 1: Now you worked for the--now is this all the same--how did you end up working--did you work for the state department [U.S. Department of State] separately from the UN [United Nations], or were you always attached to the UN?
Speaker 2: Well I always felt it was state department 'cause that's where I went to the meetings.  And the, you know and the president would be present there.  And I did a book.  I don't know that I have a copy of that one either.  But I did a book on some legal issues for the Secretariat.  But I, I worked on too many things at the same time 'cause I was a regulator.  I also was a human rights person and I was doing that alone.  I did a book, that I don't think I have, maybe I have it and just haven't pulled it out from the books and things that I have left.  But I thought Dag Hammarskjold was a more diplomatic person than his predecessors.
Speaker 1: Did you hear--what were your--I know he died in Congo [sic. Northern Rhodesia; Zambia] I guess.  Were you still working for the UN when he died in, you know, in Congo?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  And there was a--
Speaker 1: What was the discussion about that?  I know I've heard a lot of different stories about, about, about that.
Speaker 2: Well I, I don't really know exactly what, you know what happened.  All I know is it was something, should I say fishy?  I mean that there was something--I, I never found out.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he died in a plane crash over, over Congo, and it was--it has always been speculation that it wasn't an accident.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was putting--in those days, it was the Cold War and the United States and the Soviet Union were vying for the allegiance of the emerging nations in Africa and Asia.
Story_ID: 228092
Speaker 1: Did, did you have many friends in the diplomatic corps from other countries, from some of these African countries and Asian countries?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah, yeah.  One friend is from--goodness, or maybe I really lost my mind, my memory.  From Monrovia [Liberia], from--she--
Speaker 1: The, you talking about the ambassador from--Angie [Elizabeth] Brooks?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And I don't know what's happened to her because we kept in touch regularly.  And I have her telephone number, her son's telephone numbers, and I'm not able to get in touch.  I don't know; something's happened and I don't know what it is.  Life is should I say interesting?
Speaker 1: Were you in the UN [United Nations] when the Cuban missile crisis took place?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And the chicken, picking the chickens.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did, did you play a role in writing any speeches or anything in those days for that, or about that crisis?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't about that, but yeah I used to write some speeches for delegates on either side of my seat.
Story_ID: 228093
Speaker 1: You were saying off camera that there was a period of time that you were meeting with the president and his staff once a week.
Speaker 2: I would go down once a week, yes.
Speaker 1: This was during the [President Dwight David "Ike"] Eisenhower administration.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And well I, you know, I was also in New Orleans [Louisiana] quite frequently because I headed an organization there that--goodness.  Thought it'd be something on one of these (unclear).
Speaker 1: About the Amistad [Research Center, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana]?  Is this about Amistad or--
Speaker 2: Well, there was a relationship to Amistad.  I regulated that because--we're going to picking these, we're going to be picking these up and taking them home, these, you know, paintings and appointment things.  One up there has to do with an appointment that [HistoryMaker] Warren [Marr, II] had in New York City [New York, New York] where he was part of an organization that set the regulations for things that appeared on the streets.  Newspaper places had--
Speaker 1: Conform.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And that, that kind of thing I have someplace in the house.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now you were, okay.  You were an officer with the U.S. mission to the UN [U.S. Mission to the United Nations] until I don't know when because I don't have a date here.  But I, I see you were a founding member of the New York State Human Rights Appeal Board, right, okay.  Can you tell us about that?  Now that was after the UN [United Nations], or was it during--
Speaker 2: Didn't, didn't do very much with the, with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were a commissioner with the New York State Public Service Commission [New York State Department of Public Service].  This is when you were, this is a regulator position, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Where you were helping to regulate--
Speaker 2: Set your rates for your gasoline or set rates for, for gas which is, you know, set rates for a lot of things that one needs to have.  And now there are many more women in that field than there were years ago.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think I read at one time in terms of just women and men, in terms of black people or African Americans there were only two of you all in the state department [U.S. Department of State] at one time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A guy named Frank [C.] Montero, yeah, and you.  This was in 1964.  And then they, I think they made somebody a, you know they appointed somebody else, but it was a long time it was only just a couple of you there.

Speaker 1: When you look back on all the things that you've done, what do you think is the most outstanding thing, or the most outstanding thing that you were involved in, or the thing that, that made the most impact on people?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure that I know.  Or that I've properly rated, rated it in my own mind.  I did a variety of things and I said yes every time somebody asked me to do something, I said yes.  And I also wound up doing somebody else's job.  And I'm serious about that.  I--well your gas bill, your electric bill, all of those--that kind of thing, I was a part of.  And I also was the head of an institution for girls [New York State Training School for Girls, Hudson, New York].  And that I could write a book about, that I should never have let myself get onto that because the, the males that were on that body, they were asking personal questions of these youngsters that should never have been permitted.  I left, I left that one.  I, I just couldn't deal with it because the people on that board were not qualified to deal with the problems that these young girls had.  And I don't know how I let myself get onto that 'cause there were things that were much more important to me than asking girls personal questions, really personal questions.  A lot of nonsense.  But I suppose I learned some things during those years.  You know I, I--and it was a, a man who was a head of a committee having to do with regulation, and he was a bigot.  He was a pain in the neck.  And I was put on the gas committee.  And this man never really planned--drew up a plan for what we were going to do at any given meeting.  And he had no respect for any of the women regulators.  And he never prepared the--he, he was never prepared for the--what we were going to deal with at any given meeting, and he was the one in charge.  And you know if you raised your hand to try to get an answer to some question, what you got from him was the--a, a statement that was given to him by the company he was regulating.  And we were down in New Orleans [Louisiana], [HistoryMaker] Warren [Marr, II] and I, when this man showed up, went running after Warren and wanted him to get Warren to get the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] to reappoint him, which of course Warren did not do.  And I think it was like perhaps two weeks later when the man wound up in jail for seeking money from the NAACP in Warren's name, which of course Warren hadn't--he didn't participate in that fortunately for him because the man was in jail almost immediately after he tried to get Warren to get the NAACP to vote him back into his post.  So there, you know, a lot of crazy things had happened and you need to be careful.

Speaker 1: You volunteered too--in the arts too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know you've got a let--there's a letter here we got offline that you wrote to Eubie Blake concerning something in arts.  What was that about?  And tell us about Eubie Blake.  Did you get a chance to meet him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he, he came to our house and played music.  We had invited people from the UN [United Nations] to come for dinner and--well he's a, you know he's a fabulous musician.  We were delighted to have him.  And--
Speaker 1: Now you--we didn't--you didn't tell us how you met [HistoryMaker] Warren [Marr, II] either.  So your husband Warren Marr the third-- the second.  Now how, how did you two meet and when did you meet?
Speaker 2: Well we met really through one of his sisters who was a nurse and known nationally.  Very active in public relations or in human relations I should say.  She was just a fantastic person.  And we both belonged to the same sorority and we became good friends.  But she came to the house one even--to our house one evening and she brought Warren with her.  And he went and picked some books out of the--off the shelves and sat down and started reading and I thought to myself who is this fella?  He's not participating in the conversation or anything, he's sitting and reading a book.  And shortly after that, he had a birthday and I told him he had to go home because it was late.  And so he and his sister left.  I walked over to his house, which was in a park.  And the lights in the house were all put out.  He came across the street and into the house, and he saw me there.  And he was really angry.  What was I doing there that I hadn't let him know and he was surprised you know because it was his birthday and I hadn't said anything to him about being at his birthday party.  And that's how we met.  And--but he, he did so many things.  He's a good painter and, and he has a, an interest in history.  When he became familiar with the Amistad history, he really went into it.  Out on Long Island [New York], back to the West Coast, he went all over and he, he still sticking with it.  He--you know it meant a lot to him.
Speaker 1: And you're a part of that as well, right?  You're a part of that effort too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Run an establishment of the Amistad Research Center [Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana] and the, the--now the construction and the, the traveling museum, the boat that Amistad--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had thought that we would be able to go to Puerto Rico when the captain got married.  But we weren't able to make it.  He has to have oxygen and although he got a ticket to, you know to fly there, it just wasn't easy for us to arrange at that time 'cause he still had his problems.
Speaker 1: That's Captain Pickens, right, is it Pickens?
Speaker 2: Off-Camera Voice: [HistoryMaker Captain William "Bill"] Pinkney.
Speaker 1: Pinkney, Pinkney, all right, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 228096
Speaker 1: Ma'am, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well you know I, I see progress in people like Oprah [Winfrey].  She is topnotch, Oprah Winfrey.  And it's really a sizable step for her away from the kinds of shows we've had for a good many years.  Shows that don't, that don't really contribute.  I'm not speaking just about music.  That's of its own accord and it, it works.  But Oprah Winfrey, I think she is absolutely fantastic.  I don't know whether you ever watch her?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah I do.  So you think--I mean you're saying that this is like a ray of hope you say for, for--
Speaker 2: Well yes.
Speaker 1: For the community.
Speaker 2: It's, it has an outstanding quality.  It gets away from 'Amos 'n' Andy.'  I think--well she, I think she's just so outstanding that, that she can't be put into a, a single niche and then perhaps dropped down or forgotten or something like that.  I think she's very, very special.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Any other hopes and concerns for the community?
Speaker 2: Well I would hope so.  I don't know whether I'm--
Speaker 1: Or what's your biggest concern for the black community I guess today?
Speaker 2: Well what I see I guess is, is very gradual.  I hope that we're able to move ahead at a better rate of, of speed than, you know than I have seen for such a long time.  I think, I think I see signs of meaningful progress and I, I don't think that that's based on over--well I, I think that Oprah's progress is encouraging and I think it's going to last.  I think she's encouraging other people to make progress at strides similar to the progress that she has been making--
Story_ID: 228097
Speaker 1: In that regard, maybe this is a good time to ask this question.  When you look back on, on your life and all the things that you've done, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well I don't know how much of a legacy it's been, but I was the first woman regulator [on New York State Public Service Commission] and I didn't have an easy time of it.  The first time I went--I was put on a panel, at lunchtime a panel had been set up and the talks began.  And obviously my knowledge of what a panel is, is not accurate because immediately the other participants, all of whom were males, started questioning statements that I had made.  Statements that now are recognized as being very sensible.  Not only were they not sensible at that first experience I had, but all of the participants began to ask me questions and to attack the comments I had made as being, well they didn't say stupid, but the questions they gave I thought were quite stupid.  And as soon as I had finished, they--these men all went out in the hall and they kept turning their heads, putting their heads together and then turning them and looking at me.  And, and then they went off to get lunch or something.  I, I think I have said maybe several times that I was an only child.  And being alone in there did not bother me.  I had not been to that part of the West Coast and I went outside and I walked around to see what it looked like.  And I had a good time.  I don't know what kind of time the men had that went after me, and were making fun of me.
Story_ID: 228098
Speaker 1: The time did come when there were more women involved in regulation and somehow I became--I was appointed to head the whole--
Speaker 2: Region?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And I really had not asked for it, didn't particularly want it.  And got kind of tired of the head of the thing who would give me my papers when I arrived and the papers were always for the wives.  Not for the participants.  And he would say to me, "Oh, Commissioner I didn't know you were here.  I didn't know it.  I'm sorry.  I'll get your papers in just a little while."  I suppose it was funny, but it was time consuming and I didn't appreciate the amusement.  I, I have the feeling that--or maybe it's just a hope, that this nation which I think is an outstanding nation, is going to wake up one day and realize what assets they have for the development of understanding, for recognition of the great qualities that we have to order.  And by we, I mean Americans.  I, I'm not necessarily picking one or two or three people who should be better treated.  But I think that, I think we have so much to offer if we allow it to be offered.  And I--emotionally I'm really not ready to quit working.  I wanna, I wanna be involved.  And that's--it may not sound like much, but I'm really not ready to just quit and stop working.  Our present situation financially is not what I would have liked, or what I anticipated.  But we got hard hit by the stock market.  I shouldn't say the stock market, by the people that we had representing us on the stock market (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Stock, stock brokers--
Story_ID: 228099
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would do differently?  I mean major that you would do differently than you did?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think, I think I was pretty lucky in the things that had the opportunity to do and, and was able to get good, strong people to join me in those efforts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there--
Speaker 2: And [HistoryMaker] Warren [Marr, II], you know he does have health problems.  And he has enough interest in the things that he's been doing to continue to try to you know, push them along.  He was up in Connecticut night before last for the Amistad.  I didn't get to go.  I didn't realize until the last minute that they had something going for the Amistad.  But it's also, it's also been very good for him to have something that meant so much, means so much to him as the Amistad story.
Story_ID: 228100
Speaker 1: Ma'am, is there anything that I haven't asked you that you want to mention or talk about?
Speaker 2: Well, I am a Republican and at the time that I became a Republican, we had more opportunity to be involved in the Republican politics.
Speaker 1: Now what, about what time is this?
Speaker 2: Well how old was I then?  As soon as I turned old enough to vote.
Speaker 1: So in the '40s [1940s] for instance, were you, were you--you didn't, I take it you didn't vote for [President] Harry [S.] Truman.
Speaker 2: No I didn't.  And I used to go down to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Is that [Alf] Landon that ran against--was that Landon that ran against Truman?
Speaker 2: No, no that wasn't.
Speaker 1: Thomas Dewey or-
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Dewey.
Speaker 1: Dewey, yeah Thomas Dewey.
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I was out of college [Hunter College, New York, New York] by that time.
Speaker 1: [President Dwight David "Ike"] Eisenhower, you know, administration followed Truman, so, so you've been a Republican ever since the Eisenhower administration at least, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was a--
Speaker 2: There was a Republican friend of mine bawled me out recently.  She said that I wasn't helpful to the Republican Party, though I don't know what I didn't do.  But whatever I didn't do, that was her view of, of me.  And--
Speaker 1: Has it been tough being a black Republican in, in the latter part of the 20th century?
Speaker 2: No because we had, we did have opportunity from the Republican Party in those days.  Soon as I was eligible to vote, I registered as a Republican and, and that was not a unique experience.  I remember the woman who told me that I wasn't a good Republican.  She was about my age also.  And I still haven't found out from her what it is I didn't do.  But in those days it was easier for people of color to get into the Republican Party.  Now you wanted also not just to get into the party, but to be able to influence their decisions on the basis of your party beliefs.  Things have changed from time to time and I've been involved in so many smaller issues that I'm not, I'm not making the same level of impact on the party that I used to make.  'Cause I was down there every week, down in Washington.
Story_ID: 228101
Speaker 1: I was rather amused when I came here and the table at which I was placed for, you know to eat downstairs, there was a woman there and I thought that she was white.  And then one day she said something about the Republicans that let me know really immediately that she was a Republican.  And at that point she was going down to Washington [D.C.] one day a week.  I knew not only that then that she was a Republican, but also that she was not white.  I never let her know that I was aware of that 'cause if she wanted me to know she would have told me.  But at the time that I became a Republican, it was easier for us to join the Republican Party.  Now as to what benefits you got as a result of that, I guess that would take a bit of thinking and pulling out information of what influence you had on the party.  And I can't say that I regret having joined the Republican Party.
Speaker 2: Well what do you think of today's Republican Party in terms of its impact on the black community?
Speaker 1: I haven't really been very active with the party.  And maybe I have done too many smaller things or lesser things than I did in the period when I became a, an active Republican.  But I do know that I had some influence on some of the decisions, some of the things that we discussed in Washington when we went down there.  But I do see some progress on people.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I hope that time does come when that won't be a, a big issue anymore.
Story_ID: 228102
Speaker 1: Our last question is similar to legacy but different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well I can't say leadership because I don't feel that I'm responsible for the progress that's been made with respect to the needs of black people.  I've done what I could whenever I could, and I was quite taken aback when the woman that was a neighbor said to me that I wasn't helping the Republican Party.  I don't know, I never did find out from her what it was that she thought I wasn't doing that I should be doing.  I, I do feel that whatever I did for the Republican Party, I believe it was helpful.  And I didn't let myself get into too many things for decorative purposes.  I did what I did because I thought that it was helpful to us.
