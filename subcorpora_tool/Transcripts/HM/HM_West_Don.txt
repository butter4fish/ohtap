Story_ID: 664141
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Sushi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's--I've got a lot of them (laughter).  St. Kitts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase?  Do it now.
Story_ID: 664142
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm going to ask about your family history, your mother's side of the family and your father's [Claude West] side.  We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 1: The whole thing would be Elise Woodley Thurston West--Thurston being her maiden name.  I'll start with Elise.  It's E-L-I-S-E, and Woodley, W-O-O-D-L-E-Y, Thurston, T-H-U-R-S-T-O-N, and West, W-E-S-T [Elise Thurston West].
Speaker 2: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: That's a good question.  I believe she was born in Richmond.  And as we talk, you'll find that I don't know much about my mother's side of the family.  So, that's why I'm a little vague here.  But Richmond, Virginia I believe is where she was born.  I don't know the date, probably around 1900 somewhere.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  I know you say you didn't know much, but (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I can't tell you very much, actually.  I only knew her father, who lived with us as I was a boy growing up, and that was for about five years.  He passed away when I was probably about six or seven years old.  And he was from Toledo, Ohio prior to coming to live with us, I believe.  And he worked on the--I guess you would call them tourist ships that ran from Maine to Nova Scotia [Canada].  He was a waiter on one of those boats back in the 1900s.  But that's all I know.  Actually for years I've been trying to locate information about my mother.  I've had my daughters [Elyssa West and Erica West] and others look after that, but we've never been able to really nail it down.  So, she's a mystery to me on that side.  I grew up around my father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Now what about your mother's mother?  Do you know much about her?
Speaker 1: She, she passed away the year I was born, so I never knew her.  Her name was Ida, I-D-A, Thurston [Ida Thurston].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my grandfather, her father, was named Robert Garnet, G-A-R-N-E-T, Thurston [Robert Thurston].
Speaker 2: Robert--
Speaker 1: Garnet Thurston.
Speaker 2: G-A-R-N-E-T (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) N-E-T.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Any relation to the famous Garnets--Reverend Henry Highland Garnet, or any of that?
Speaker 1: Not that I know of.
Speaker 2: There's a Garnet high school [sic. Garnet-Patterson Junior High School] in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  Named it for Garnet's sister [sic.], I think--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --who was a big educator.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Any rate, so, your--did your mother grow up in Richmond?
Speaker 1: I believe so.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I don't know.
Speaker 2: So, she didn't talk about going to school or anything about growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.  Yeah it's--as we talk along about my early years--well, relative to her it was very vague.  I--you know, you think you would remember something.  You know, we're talking about, you know, fifty years ago now, so my own memory is changing a little bit.  But not having any side of her family present other than her father for a short five years in my life, other, after that there was nobody.  Nobody came from here or there to visit or anything.  It was just like there was nothing there.  There was all my father's side of the family that I knew, and knew about to some degree.  So, I can't give you much.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I have some more thoughts around my mother, which we'll share as we go along.
Story_ID: 664143
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Claude, C-L-A-U-D-E, Belvin, B-E-L-V-I-N, West [Claude West].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I would say his date of birth was approximately 1893 in Danville, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so again, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your father's side, and what they were doing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On that side--well, his father [Charles West] was a businessman in Danville, a man of color obviously.  So, that was something of significance in those days, the late 1800s, the mid-1800s.  He was a prominent businessman there; had a store, and functioned at that level.  That's the most I know about that.  He passed away around the turn of the 20th century, and slowly but surely the family migrated from there to Boston [Massachusetts].  And my father had brothers and sisters--there was I think about seven or eight of them--I'd have to count them off on my fingers here--siblings.  Maybe three or four brothers and three sis- four brothers and three--there was four brother- four sons and three sisters I believe it was.  And so they all gradually migrated to Boston, following the mother, my grandmother [Lucy West], who was a very dynamic kind of personality and woman.  She was a church woman.  She knew H.L. Mencken back in those days, and used to hang out with him a little bit in Connecticut--I think is where Mencken lived at the time.  But she was, she was a very strong, interesting woman who died in her nineties.  But they all kind of landed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is adjacent to Boston.  And they all kind of came through a central house, so to speak, that the grand- my grandmother had there; and then they all kind of moved out from there to get their own space--a house or apartment, or whatever it was during those early 1900s.
Story_ID: 664144
Speaker 1: When my father [Claude West] came, he was a, he had, he worked on the railroads as a Pullman porter, and had some adventures there.  And then he moved on to the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  And those two jobs, as you probably know, were significant for black men in those days.  Those were the jobs to get, those were good jobs.  And I think there was a sense of initiative in the family to progress and to grow.  And so, you know, he went into the post office as a clerk, but as we go through this history here, he spent some thirty something years in the post office and grew to be a supervisor in Boston [Massachusetts] in the post office, which was something of significance for black men at that time--running a floor of white folks, white men.  You know the- so, so he grew in that job, and that's roughly the beginning history there.
Story_ID: 664145
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, if you want to know anything about the others, one of his brothers became a lawyer, a criminal lawyer.  His name was William S. West [William West], he was very well known here in Boston [Massachusetts].  Started a, he was one of the founders of the professional businessmen's club here in Boston [Professional and Businessmen's Club of Boston], which was a club for African American men, professional men of--you know, lawyers, judges, doctors, et cetera et cetera.  And it was running for quite a few years.  I think its demise was around in the '80s [1980s].  It lasted a while, from the '40s [1940s] on, so to speak.  The other brothers didn't rise as high professionally.  One of the brothers was, had his own construction--not construction, but handyman business.  Another worked for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Like an independent contractor.
Speaker 1: Independent contractor, yeah.  The other worked for the T here--the MBTA [Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority] in Boston.  And (mumbles) Charlie--Charlie, my uncle Charlie [Charles West] was a photographer, actually, for a while.  So it creeps--you know, it all kind of filters through here.  But he--
Speaker 2: Did he have a studio?
Speaker 1: He had it, he had it for a while.  But it wasn't something that he could be successful at, I guess.  So he also had kind of a contracting business like my other uncle, Percy [Percy West].  Just to know the names, it was Charlie, Percy, Tracy [Tracy West], and William whose wa- nickname was Sinclair [ph.]--Saint [ph.].  They used to call him Saint.  And then there were the three sisters who--lovely ladies.  But they married, except for one of--two of them married and one never married.  And she was the one I was closest to, my aunt Lillian [Lillian West].  And the sisters were Lillian, Margaret [Margaret West], and Louise [Louise West].  So, that's that side of the family.  So--and I grew up with them.  I knew them, I saw them, as opposed to my mother's [Elise Thurston West] side, whom I never saw anybody--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --other than my grandfather [Robert Thurston].
Story_ID: 664146
Speaker 1: And the other part of that growing up, the mystery around my mother [Elise Thurston West] is, part of it is her racial background.  You know, in the black experience, we know that we have a spectrum of very dark skin to very white skin, depending on how the mixtures have happened over time.  So, my mother was very--not really white, but swarthy sort of; maybe European, of certain parts of the Mediterranean.  But she obviously could be a white person very easily.  And you'll see in the pictures--I have some pictures of her.  My father [Claude West] was about my complexion, but there was mixture there, too, because my aunt Lillian [Lillian West] was very dark skinned.  And my uncle Tracy [Tracy West] was very light skinned, not white, but very light skinned.  So, we--so the spectrum.  So then, so all those years went by and I never thought about the racial background of my mother until I was probably in my twenties or so, when I started to come to the world more and see the juxtaposition of cultures and race, and wondered, well, was my mother white or was she just a mixture?  And that's why I tried to find some history on her, but I've never been able to.  It's funny.  We went to ancestry.com and did things like that.  Put in my grandfather's name, Thurston [Robert Thurston], and all this--nothing, nothing comes up.
Story_ID: 664147
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's an interesting question that's being raised now more and more about white people actually passing for black--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --because they're in an interracial marriage.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, it's easier if they just say they're black.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A light-skinned black person.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And this is something I started hearing about in the last ten years.  There was a, there's been, you know, quite a bit written about it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: People of uncertain race, you know, and what they--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Well, my uncle Percy [Percy West]--see, then the other thing too, is that my uncles married white women.  My lawyer uncle, William S. West [William West], married a white woman.  My uncle Percy married a white woman.  Tracy [Tracy West] I think married a light skinned woman, I don't know if she was white or not.  And Charlie [Charles West] married an Indian [Native American] woman.  So I mean, there was--so there was--so again, with this--you know, as a young kid growing up and you see this variety of skin colors in your family, you just kind of take certain things for granted, and say this is what's real.  I mean just, you don't really question people's background.  You just accept them for who they are and what their skin color is.  And all that's--(unclear) you know, I wasn't questioning any of that.  That's who they were.  But later I began to analyze that a little bit, and wondered, you know.  Because one of my cousins, my uncle Percy's daughter--he had one daughter.  And being of an interracial marriage, white and black, she was very white looking.  She married a white guy, moved to--down south and passed for white, and I never saw her again (laughter).  So, that was just an example.  I mean, then I have other cousins--not that I know any others have passed for white, or left, or gone over, so to speak--but there is that variety in my family, and which is not unusual.
Speaker 1: No, it's not really super unusual, but you probably suspect that maybe the reason why you didn't know much about your mother's [Elise Thurston West] family is because she was estranged from the Richmond [Virginia] family that she came from?
Speaker 2: This is true.  I mean, let's say she was white.  They might have disowned her when she married my father [Claude West].  And so let's say she, they never connected again, just like my cousin, m- Percy's daughter, passes for white and goes down--and she never connects back to the family at all.  So, whatever role she had down there was very similar probably to the, my experience with my mother.  If she had kids--I don't even know if she had kids.  But if they did, they never saw her, the mother's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's funny.  There was an article in The New York Times about five years ago about the descendants of Dr. James McCune Smith, who was the first black M.D. you know in the 1840s he comes over (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and he--but, his descendants are standing at his grave, and they had no idea he was black.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Because they're Italian now (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: They have Italian names; they're Italian white women and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the New York area.  They're looking at the grave and wondering what is?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know what's interesting here in Boston [Massachusetts] is, Prince Hall is buried in a cemetery in the North End of Boston.  And as we know, Italians never had much comfort with black folks.  But yet he was there all these years, they probably didn't even know that this fellow was black in their own cemetery.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So I mean, there's all--there's so many interesting dichotomies and stories.  But that was kind of, you know, a general look at the--the content of my family at that time that I came along.
Story_ID: 664148
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' personalities--their, their dispositions, their sense of humor, what they look like, what they walk and talk like, what their talents were, interests--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, probably my father [Claude West], in the sense that when I knew my father, he was--now I was born late in life, in their life.  My father had been married twice before, and lost both of his wives--died.  Had one, she died; he had another, she died.  And then he married my mother [Elise Thurston West].  And I remember seeing pictures of him when he was a young man in his twenties.  And he was a very vibrant looking fellow, and he was taking airplane lessons, and he had this wonderful Model T Ford [Ford Model T] with a rumble seat.  I mean, he was just a very vibrant man, smiling and so forth.  When I came along, what I knew of him was a very somber, very emotionless man.  And I think--and never knew really quite why, but I kind of thought, well, you know, when you have a relationship with your wife or with a significant person in your life, you invest emotions into that.  And when you lose that, and lose it twice, you might pull back a little bit on your emotions, generally.  And I think that's what happened with him.  He didn't show any emotion.  He rarely smiled with me or around in our immediate family--my mother, he and I.  Although when we had guests come into the house or other family members and he would interact with them he did become animated.  But generally in my experience, he was very somber.  But you asked me--because I can pick up--I'm a little bit of that.  And pessimistic, he was kind of pessimistic--saw that side of things, sort of the problem side of things.  Rather than enjoy the happy side, he would see the problem side.  And I tend to be like that.  I tend to see the problem side of things rather than just be happy about some things.  So, that's a piece of I think what I picked up from him.
Story_ID: 664149
Speaker 1: My mother [Elise Thurston West] was a schoolteacher, and she could play the piano.  And we had a piano in the house, but she never played it though (laughter).  And she taught kindergarten, so that was her lot in life.
Speaker 2: I would guess as a kindergarten teacher that played the piano, she'd have like an upbeat personality on some level.  Is that true or not?
Speaker 1: Had a what?
Speaker 2: Upbeat personality (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, upbeat?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I would say she was a warm person.  I--it's funny when you--you know, when I think back to my childhood, I think mostly of my father [Claude West] more than my mother.  Somehow my mother has faded, although she was--she was the pleasing, pleasant, warm person in the dynamic there.  Whereas my father was kind of cold and cool, and he never really connected to me.  I don't think he wanted to share emotion with me, or he couldn't.  So, we had a very--kind of a cool, distant experience.  I mean, he wasn't the kind of guy that would take me out to the ballgame, so to speak.  He used to love fishing, but he would always take me with one of my uncles; I was a tag along.  So wasn't--he never--so I--you know, my experience with my father was lacking a lot in connection, and I've always felt that to be a loss in my life.  In recent years as a photographer, some of my clients--as we talked, you and I, a little earlier about an organization here called The Partnership [The Partnership, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts].  The Partnership is basically an organization that mentors young professionals of color.  (Gesture) Mentor is the big word there.  I never had any mentoring when I grew up.  I mean, usually your father is your biggest mentor; guide, he guides you to this--my father really didn't do that.  And so, I missed that.  So, when I--so when I saw these groups, as the photographer I said, "Gee, I really wish I had that experience."  And I really appreciated what they were doing for these folks.  Of course, these were all grown folks that they're working with.  They're in their twenties and thirties and so forth.  So, it's a different kind of level and time of mentoring, but nonetheless it's mentoring, and somebody is taking an interest in what your future is--what your present and future is.  And I missed that growing up.  And my mother really wasn't the one to give me that.  Suppo- I mean, I think I looked to my father for that.  And so in memories of looking back on my life, I always think of him because of what I missed maybe, and wondered why.  And my mother seems to fade in that memory.  You know, she was warm.  She, she gave me the love and the warmth, but I didn't have really the father figure that I had wanted.
Speaker 2: Now, did either of them live a long time?
Speaker 1: Well, my mother succumbed to cancer when she was in her mid-sixties, kind of really--had a bad experience.  And my father died when he was seventy-two, a few years later.  I think he--I think it was only like three or four years later he died, something like that.  And so.
Speaker 2: Now, do you have siblings?
Speaker 1: No, only child (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 664150
Speaker 1: So, if we, if we want to go a little f- step forward into where I grew up--you know, we said that I was born in Boston [Massachusetts], but I actually grew up in a suburb adjacent to Boston called Brookline.  And why my parents [Elise Thurston West and Claude West] moved there, I only can think that they wanted maybe for me to get a better education, or they wanted to live in a more comfortable place.  Brookline is considered to be--I wouldn't say a wealthy town, but parts of it certainly are.  But it's a very progressive town and had a very good school system there; and still does.  And they bought a house in Brookline in a certain section.  We lived in the Jewish section 'cause Brookline is mainly Jewish and Irish, and--but there's a large Jewish section there, and that's where I grew up.  But it wasn't until years later that I probably understood that the level of my father's salary and his income because we had people living in the house--it was a big house.  It was a three story--probably originally it probably might have been a one family house.  But at this point it was turned into--we lived in a certain--first, second floor, but we rented out the top floor to a small family.  And there was another room over here for another older woman.  So, that obviously was augmenting his income, which means he couldn't really fully on his own salary afford to be living there.
Speaker 2: Now, this is--you were born in '37 [1937]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: This is in the middle of the Depression [Great Depression], you know, and a lot of people--
Speaker 1: A little after it, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, the '30s [1930s] through--it lasted a while, until about the war [World War II, WWII] starts.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And so people are--you know, not that they didn't do it before, but they're really you know trying to make all the income they can.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: And trying--so roomers in your house, that was a regular thing then, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  But it also, too, I think has to do with the economics of the time.  I mean, there were probably people who could afford to have a house, because other--we were in a neighborhood where there were other houses of this size, and one family would be living in it.  So, we were kind of a little different in that sense that we had these roomers, R-O-O-M-E-R-S, in the house.  So, in that sense--I'm just saying in that environment in that neighborhood, there wasn't the roomers kind of situation (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh that was- that kind of culture wasn't there.  Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And these people were able to afford the whole--I mean, these were big houses.  It was in the Coolidge Corner area of--of Brookline.
Story_ID: 664151
Speaker 1: And the other interesting thing is how they got the house.  Because again, in those days, and even in these days, a black family moving into a white neighborhood isn't usually something that's easy to do.  And so when it came time to do the--to look at the property I guess, and to do the closings and all that, it was my mother [Elise Thurston West] and her father [Robert Thurston], who looked white, who did all of the, all of the dealing.  My father [Claude West] never was part of that, because he was brown skinned.  And then when they finished the deal to close it up, then he came (laughter).  So--and we were one of about two or three black families in all of Brookline [Massachusetts].  Because when I went to school, there was nobody of color that I saw the--when I went to, particularly to grammar school [Edward Devotion School, Brookline, Massachusetts].  And then when I got to high school [Brookline High School, Brookline, Massachusetts], the other family of color who lived in a different area, he went to a different grammar school--I then saw him in high school, but he was like a year or so older than me.  And so, you know, at that age you don't really pa- socialize with those who are older or younger; you kind of stay within your grade level.  So, I never really was friends with the other fellow.  But it just showed that we were isolated, you know, in a certain sense racially.  Now, I had friends as a young boy in my neighborhood, but they were all white friends.  So, I basically grew up in a white culture.  Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] and Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts], which is the African American part of this city, I had relatives there, but I never spent any time there.  And we'd go there, we'd go there on a Sunday or Saturday, whatever and visit.  But I never spent time, so I never really--so, African American people were strange to me, as a white person relating to that community would feel because my environment was totally white.
Story_ID: 664152
Speaker 1: How were you treated in grade school?  Well, first of all, what was the name of your school in Brookline [Massachusetts] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Edward Devotion grammar school [Edward Devotion School].
Speaker 1: Edward--
Speaker 2: Edward Devotion--
Speaker 1: --Devotion--now is this a public school?
Speaker 2: It's a public school in Brookline.  It wasn't very far from where I lived.  And, it actually was a very historic site, because there was an old house sort of placed in the middle of where the school was built around.  And this house was historic, go- dating back to the 1700s.  And--
Speaker 1: What happened there?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the most historic things that happened there was the night that Paul Revere rode. William Dawes, who also rode that night--they both rode in different directions.  William Dawes rode through Brookline and stopped at that house.  So, every year on Patriots' Day, you know, they reenact that ride.  Paul Revere goes out one way, and William Dawes comes through Brookline and stops at that house and then moves on.  And they both ended up in Lexington [Massachusetts] at the end of their ride, but that was a--.   So every Patriots' Day, as a kid, I used to go by there and see William Dawes ride by on his horse.  And the Boston Marathon used to ride--run right through Coolidge Corner [Brookline, Massachusetts], part of--which was right near where I lived.
Speaker 1: Now Coolidge Corner, does it have to do with Calvin Coolidge [President John Calvin Coolidge, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, I mean it may have been named after him.  I don't know that.  I just know that it's just--
Speaker 1: Yeah 'cause he's a Massachusetts--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --guy and--yeah a political figure at the turn--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the--
Speaker 2: Could have been, yeah.
Speaker 1: --teens [1910s] and '20s [1920s], so.
Speaker 2: I didn't know he had a Brookline connection.  He did?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: But I know he was a Massachusetts--
Speaker 2: Oh, he was in Massachusetts?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: He was the governor of Massachusetts I think at first, before he became president.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Calvin Coolidge, Cool Cal.
Speaker 2: Cool Cal.  So, so, yeah, Edward Devotion grammar school.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now who is Edward--is Edward Devotion an actual name--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of a person?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And the school is still there.  The house is still there.
Story_ID: 664153
Speaker 1: And the grammar school [Edward Devotion School, Brookline, Massachusetts]--coming back to the racial realities of the time, I was the only student of color in, in the school.
Speaker 2: And the--yeah, the initial question I was trying to get at--now how were you treated there?  You're the only person of color in the entire school; and the school is populated by--you have Jewish people you said?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Irish?
Speaker 1: Some, yeah.  But it was mostly a Jewish community then.
Speaker 2: Mostly Jewish, so?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was treated fine.  You know, in the early--you know, before I got to high school let's say, your world is really your neighborhood at that age.  And so I had friends within my immediate neighborhood, so I never really felt a racial reality, for the most part.  I do remember there were a couple of incidents where I remember--and I must have been maybe nine years old or ten years old, something like that.  And I was walking up the street from my house, and a fellow came up behind me, tapped me on the shoulder and said something, "Don't mess with my sister," and he punched me, knocked me down--white fellow.  And it surprised me.  And I wasn't--I've never been a fighter or a belligerent type of person, and--never had the need to, really.  And so, I just took it.  And he walked off and left.  Now it turns out that he was the brother of a young girl whose father was a janitor in the building next--nearby us.  And I think I knew her and I may have spoken to her, but you know, I never did nothing more than that.  So he got some weird thing in his head that, you know, thought I was--again, it was probably the color thing.  You know, "You're brown skinned, you know, don't talk to my white sister."  But, see, all that didn't really click with me at that time, because I really didn't think--I had no reason to think that at that time, because there was no really racial slurs or racial things happening in that community at that time.  And it wasn't until I got to high school, Brookline High School [Brookline, Massachusetts], where I was in a broader group of younger people, that I found that I was not socially acceptable at that point, at that level.  Now again, it was not something that--there wasn't any great racial overtones or issues going on at the time, but I did notice that I only saw the people that I knew when I went to school during the day, and I was never invited anywhere else afterwards.
Speaker 2: Well, that's--now this is--I mean, I take it you took this in stride.  But this is not normal, where you don't have--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, it wouldn't be normal in a normal circumstance.  I mean if I had been white, I probably would have had more chance to be interactive socially with those folks.  But, I also was not a person who joined clubs and, you know, looked for a lot of sociality so much.  But I did have friends at school, but I didn't see many of them after school.
Speaker 2: But you didn't really think about the reason why?  Or did you have a sense it was because you were----
Speaker 1: I had a sense--
Speaker 2: --African American?
Speaker 1: --a sense--yeah, I had a sense of it.  But I--
Speaker 2: Were you identified as African American, or colored, or Negro in school?
Speaker 1: I guess so, I guess so.  I don't even remember that, really, I mean, as being part--I don't think race was even discussed much at all in school or in the newspapers, or.
Speaker 2: People never asked you who were you, or what you were?
Speaker 1: Probably so.  But I don't, I don't clearly remember.  I don't have a clear remem- experience where I remember that.  And if they did ask me, I probably would have said African--I don't even know if African American was the term then.  It was Negro at the time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah it was Negro, yeah, or colored or something.
Speaker 1: Yeah, colored, yeah.  I probably answered to that affirmative.  But I just don't remember any real significant racial issue of the time.  I just know that I was kind of a social outcast.
Story_ID: 664154
Speaker 1: At that stage in life when you're a teenager and--your- all teenagers feel alienated on some level, because they're changing and then they're--you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and all that, but it had to be diff- I mean the whole social thing is hard to negotiate already (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I guess I was kind of a loner anyway all through--because one of the--one of the experiences within my immediate family was my father [Claude West] and mother [Elise Thurston West] would vacation in the summertime in Mashpee, Massachusetts, which is in--on Cape Cod.  And Mashpee was an Indian [Native American] town--then and now; very much so then.  This was in the '40s [1940s], 1940s.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you spell Mashpee?
Speaker 2: M-A-S-H-P double E--Mashpee, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's the home of the Wampanoag Indian tribe.  And that's Wampanoag, W-O-M-P-A-N-O-A-G [sic.], something along that--Wampanoag.
Speaker 1: Now, is this the tribe--there's a group I know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is the tribe that's trying to do a casino business.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.  They were on '60 Minutes' and I'm telling you, when I saw them on '60 Minutes' they looked like light skinned black people; they had big Afros, and they were--(laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, you know, what's really even more--which is ridicu- I won't say--is the Wampanoags, the (pronunciation) Wampanoags greeted the Pilgrims at Plymouth [Massachusetts].  They have been hassled by the U.S. government as to whether they are a legitimate Indian tribe (laughter).  I mean when they were trying to get the casino for instance and move in that direction, that's when all this came up: "Well, are you really an Indian tribe?"  Well, for crying out loud, you know, we've been here since the Pilgrim--before the Pilgrims, and we greeted them here.  Yet, they had to prove themselves to be an Indian tribe.  And they finally did that, they started moving on the casino.  And just here recently some judge [William G. Young] negated that and threw them back--the whole deal.  I mean, they've been going through a whole lot of trial and tribulation trying to get a casino here in Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: There's a lot of money tied to that.
Speaker 2: Of course, yeah.  I mean, there's a lot of angles to it.  I mean, even the head of the tribe or the head of the group that was--of the tribe that was trying to do this negotiating got in some kind of hot water, some scandal of some sort happened, bubbled up around him; and he was thrown out and another guy comes forward.  But, you know, it's all a lot of politics, and racial aspects to it I think, too.  But anyway--
Story_ID: 664155
Speaker 1: Mashpee [Massachusetts] was a place that they used to vacation in the summertime.  My father [Claude West] would have two or three weeks' vacation.
Speaker 2: Okay and thi- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And it was a place where they could buy land and buy property, and so he bought property down there, and that was his getaway.  He fixed up, you know, an old house that was there, and I used to help him do that.  I learned a lot from my father though, in the sense of carpentry, bricklaying--I mean all kinds of--he could do it all, you know.  He graduated from Hampton Uni- Hampton Institute when it was a vocational school [Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] around the turn of the 20th century.  So, he graduated as a brick mason.  And what he was good at was building chimneys.  So, when my uncle, the lawyer, they both--the two of them were the ones who were really interested in Mashpee.  And they built a house for my uncle, my--William [William West], and my father built the chimney.  So, I learned how to--I was--I could brick lay, I could do carpentry, I could do electrical work.  I could do--because he could do all that stuff.  So I learned a lot from him on that side of the--we worked together on--I mean he shared that with me.  So, you know, to go to back to what I said before about how we were distant; well, he did connect, we did connect in that area.  So he had a house down there, and we would go down there.  And I think I was coming to that around the kind of isolation that I experienced.  Even though I had the friends around, there was still--I was different.  I still had--you know, I knew what color my skin was and what color their skin was, but I didn't pay it a lot of attention.  But I knew it was different--that's about, probably the extent of that.  So, that made me some degree--you know, because my whole environment is white and I'm brown, I had a natural outlaw feeling, so to speak, if you--?  But then going to the Cape [Cape Cod, Massachusetts] and my being an only child, there was nothing, there was nobody for me to really relate to in those two or three weeks, other than I'd helping my father do whatever he was doing.  And so that was--so I had a general isolation in growing up, which made me do for myself--you know, create projects on my own and create my own world often.  One of the things I did, probably I was nine or ten, eleven years old, I was interested in radio, because TV was just coming along in those days.  But radio--and I created a radio station in my room, and I hooked it up by wire to the kitchen, and I used to do radio programs for my mother [Elise Thurston West] while she was cooking dinner.  I would do--and the radio show I would do would be kind of a disc jockey show.  I would have music and then a little banter.  So, I had a record player and I had the microphone.  I had a whole little setup in my room.
Speaker 2: So, did you like a Heathkit thing, or what was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, it wasn't a--no, it wasn't a Heathkit.  But it was just an amplifier, you know, that I bought.  And the microphone, set that up to that and hooked the record player into the amplifier and ran the wires downstairs.  So, that was sort of the beginning of my interest in media.  I also used to draw a lot in my years of, let's say six to twelve years, thirteen years old.  Because when I went into high school [Brookline High School, Brookline, Massachusetts], I thought I was going to be an illustrator.  I wanted to a cartoonist or something like that, so I had a graphic sense, which I think then served me well as, when I finally became a photographer.  I always had that sense of vision and applying it in some way.
Story_ID: 664156
Speaker 1: Now did you go to the movies a lot when you were growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did, and that's another kind of an interesting story of those times.  There was a movie theater called the Coolidge Corner Theatre [Brookline, Massachusetts], which was not far from me.  And at the age of about eight--if you ever saw the Italian film--and if I can remember the name of it now.  Oh, geez, the name is escaping me.  Maybe it'll come to me as I talk.  But the Italian film was about this little boy who lived in an Italian town and loved movies.  And there was this one house, movie house.  Is this coming to mind, (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Right, I can't think of the name of it either, but I don't know if it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You can't think of the name?  But you know what I'm talking about?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know the one you're talking about, yeah.
Speaker 2: And he would go up--what is it?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  'Cinema Paradiso.'
Speaker 2: 'Cinema Paradiso.'
Speaker 1: 'Cinema Paradiso'--yes.  And he would go up to the projectionist space, and the projectionist just taught him about the--opened up the--you know how they used to have the arc (gesture) lamp thing in there.  Well, I did the same thing.  And the way I did it was--you know, they used to have cartoons and double features and all like that on Saturday.  So, somehow or other, I got myself hooked in there.  On Thursday night I would come there and take the films in the big boxes up the fire escape, which was around the back of the building, up to the projectionist room, because that was the only way you could get to the projectionist room.  And I'd sit there with the projectionist, and he used to show me how the projector worked.  And we'd have conversation and I'd be there while he was showing movies, and things like that.  So, then all those years later when I saw 'Cinema Paradiso,' I said, that's me (laughter).  And so that was my first job so to speak, at eight years old--eight or ni- .  So, by doing that I got in free on Saturdays to see the movie.  That was the exchange there--I worked that out (laughter).  And that was back in the days of double features and cartoons.  And, you know, you really got--because there was no TV or, in those days.
Speaker 2: You spent all day in, at the movies.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could s- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Story_ID: 664157
Speaker 1: But to show you another aspect of that time, my parents would go down every weekend to the Cape [Cape Cod, Massachusetts].  And I had no say over that; I had to go.  And I think when I was about eight or nine years old, one Saturday I ran away.  I did- you know, when it was ready for them to go to the Cape, I was nowhere to be found.  Because what I did was I went up and I went to the movies [at Coolidge Corner Theatre, Brookline, Massachusetts], but I didn't tell them.  And so I did that, and that was in the late morning, and I came back--I was finished around four o'clock, and I just knew that coming back home my father [Claude West] was going to switch me, you know.  And I was really afraid, and I hid in the bushes when I came back home for a while.  And then I got up the courage and I went in the house, and it turned out--and my father greeted me first, but he wasn't really angry.  He took me immediately upstairs to my mother [Elise Thurston West], who was very upset.  And, you know, they were--she was crying and wanted to know what--because they didn't know what happened to me.  And so, it was her that--and he never did anything to me.  I mean, usually when I was, did the wrong thing I would get a little whack, you know, a little spanking.  But on this occasion, it didn't happen.  But after all the emotion settled, we got in the car and we went to the Cape (laughter).  But that was my first rebellion.  I was rebelling against their not considering my needs and my desires, because I didn't want to go up to the Cape every weekend.  But I was eight years old.  I mean, I was in a dictatorship, (laughter) what could I say?  So--
Speaker 2: Now was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) so, that was--that was--you know, an initial experience there.
Story_ID: 664158
Speaker 1: When we came in, we were--off camera you were talking about Mashpee [Massachusetts] and some of the other African Americans you met there--
Speaker 2: Yes, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) from around the country?
Speaker 2: --yeah--Mashpee at that time in the 1940s and '50s [1950s] was a place where African Americans could go to vacation in the summertime, a part of the cape that they could go to, because it was an Indian [Native American] town and they were welcome there.  But they were not welcome in other parts.  Because even though, you know, as I spoke, how race didn't really play too much into my consciousness in those days, it was happening.  You know, just as I mentioned about how my parents [Elise Thurston West and Claude West] bought the house, obviously there was a race reality there, for them to get that house.  So, it certainly was going on, it just didn't play a lot into my direct experience of growing up at that age.  But anyway, Mashpee was a place--and that's why we happened to go there, because we were welcome to go there, whereas other parts of Cape Cod [Massachusetts] which were white were not so welcoming.  I mean certainly you could come and be there.  There was no prejudice about eating in restaurants or anything like that.  It just was buying property or, you know, getting more serious (laughter) about your stay there.  So, I think those were the days where all races and ethnicities knew their place; and as long as everybody stayed in their place, everybody got along.  So, black folks lived over here, Irish lived over here, Jews lived over here.  And as long as you stayed where you were supposed to be, there was a ba- there was a proper balance.  But when anybody upset that balance, then there'd be a problem.  For instance, I didn't know that in those earlier years there was--yeah, I did have a little inclination that there was--in the Irish area that brown skin was not welcome.  And so, I never would go down to the Irish section of the city by myself.  I'd pass through there on a bus or in my parents' car, but I never walked down there because I knew I'd get beat up.  So, and that was in a larger scale too for black people who lived in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts].  They didn't go to South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], which was an Irish community there; and vice versa, Irish didn't go into Roxbury.  So, it was only when you crossed the borders that there'd be conflict.  But generally, everybody was in this sort of balanced way.  So, there wasn't the notice of it all until the Civil Rights Movement came along, I think, where things really started to get shook up and people were really saying, "Look, we don't want it this way anymore.  We want it this way, and we're going to do something about it."  And that's when, you know, that's when we had the busing crisis here in Boston [Massachusetts] in the mid-'70s [1970s] when they were busing young African Americans into different schools, but in particular South Boston.  And that was really a crisis time there.  So, that's when it really came to a head.  I think it was probably--it wasn't underneath, but it played on the surface in sort of a balanced way.  But it changed you know in the '70s [1970s] or so (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 664159
Speaker 1: So in high school you say you kind of just stayed to yourself, and?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I mean, there was no invitation to me outside of our inter- my interaction with the young folks in high school.  There was no invitation to this or that, or whatever.  And there was certainly pleasantry when I interacted in the school, but that was it, you know.  So I never went to the prom, for instance.  So I just went through it--so there was, there was kind of a general isolation for me growing up.  And if we want to move on a little bit, when I was seventeen and I graduated from Brookline High School [Brookline, Massachusetts], there was the opportunity to go to Morgan State College [Morgan College; Morgan State University], which is an all-black college [HBCU] in Baltimore, Maryland.  And that was an eye opener for me. Beca- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now I don't want to get you there yet.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: But I'm--let's see, before we leave Brookline, were there any teachers or, you know, who were special or took a special interest in you, you know, in high school?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: None, okay.
Speaker 2: There are teachers I remember, but I wouldn't say anybody took a special interest in me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I said, as I went into high school, my focus was art.  I wanted to--because I was a prolific drawer and sketcher, and watercolors and so forth.  And so I--art was sort of my major.
Speaker 1: Were you encouraged by any of the teachers at?
Speaker 2: Not really, not significantly so.  You know, maybe, "Oh, that's nice," you know, or something.  I mean, nothing significant that I can remember.  Remember, I'm trying to remember fifty years ago.  So I don't have a lot of outstanding memories that would say that, although I remember the teachers, the art teachers that I had.  And particularly I remember there were two--a young man and a girl who were good at their art, and they were the favorites of my art teacher.  So I remember that--that she had two favorites.  And they were good, but I wasn't so bad myself.  But she didn't really recognize me much at all.  And I was just, you know, I just went through the course and I finished the course okay.  And, but I do remember those two.  And interestingly enough, I saw within--recent, last ten years or fifteen years, one of them who lives in Cambridge [Massachusetts] now.  And she was showing art, and she teaches art somewhere in Cambridge.  So after all those years of coming--because I've lived in a lot of different places over the years.  And to come back here and then to see her name and say (gesture), "Oh, I remember; you were--," and she's still, you know, doing her art.  So, that was good.  But, it's just interesting.
Story_ID: 664160
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would be helpful if someone had taken an interest, perhaps you would've--?
Speaker 2: Well, see, again, that whole--the concept of mentoring and support and advice just never was there in any way for me.  Even--I often, in remember- in memory or thinking back, I often wondered why my uncle, the lawyer, didn't take any interest in sharing his experience, because he was a trailblazer.  He was--there was a number of black men through the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] who were going into professional life--lawyers, judges, businessmen, contract- you know, they were doing interesting things and significant things in the community in general, and blazing the trail.  There's a family here called the Owens family who were say, in the moving business--there'd be these big moving--Owens Moving [Henry F. Owens, Inc.], you know.  So, there was big stuff going on.  And my father [Claude West] came out of his father [Charles West] being a very significant businessperson in Danville, Virginia.  So, it was in the blood.  It was in the tra- you know, how things were going.  So I often thought, well, why didn't my uncle William [William West]--Bill, as he was known, or Sinclair [ph.]--he had a lot of different names.  And he was, he was a significant lawyer at that time.  I think back, oh, that would have--what a wonderful thing that would have been for him to share that with me, take me to trial, let me see how he worked and what he did.  But I never had that experience.
Speaker 1: Did he have children of his own?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  He was married to a white woman also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, see, that thing of being white, with my different uncles and my father, it all--they all had this sort of same paradigm.  They were with white women.  So I never knew what my mother [Elise Thurston West] was, really, and I didn't think too much about it.  It was just, it was just real--that's how it was.  And so, so maybe my mother was white, I don't know (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: I'm still trying to find out.
Story_ID: 664161
Speaker 1: You graduated from high school [Brookline High School, Brookline, Massachusetts] in what year was it?
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 1: Fifty-five [1955], okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 1: Now this is--'55 [1955] is when rock and roll is emerging on the airwaves and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Somewhat, yeah.  I mean, rhythm and blues, Clyde McPhatter and The Drifters and all that--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, Drifters, yeah.
Speaker 2: --was going on at that time.
Speaker 1: Is that the kind of music you listened to at home, or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it mostly records, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 45s [45 rpm record], because that was my little radio station?  It was a 45 record player, the good old 45s.  But there was another interesting story in there, relative to our living there in Brookline [Massachusetts], again around the racial piece.  Braves Field, which is a ballpark in Boston [Massachusetts] was just maybe seven to ten blocks from our house.
Speaker 1: So this is, was this the home of the Braves when they were in Boston?
Speaker 2: Exactly, the Boston Braves [Atlanta Braves].  That's where they started, Boston Braves.  So, we had the Boston Braves and the Boston Red Sox.  Well, the Braves' stadium was not far from where we lived.  And the Red Sox, as you probably know, took a long time before they brought any men of color onto the team.
Speaker 1: It was the last team in the Major Leagues [Major League Baseball] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Pumpsie Green was the first (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, the Braves, was Sam Jethroe was one of the first, if you remember him.  Well, when he came to town, he, you know, the idea was to live near the ballpark.  Well, it was all white, and there was no place he could stay.  So, my father--see, again, my uncle [William West] and all--we're in that circle of black folks, professionals and non-profess- because everybody--see, at that time, as you probably know, the space between a higher level professional and greater money earner and a lower postal worker or a Pullman por- everybody was sort of equal to some degree.  They all--I mean, there's a hotel in Harlem [New York, New York] where they--judges and street workers, and everybody lived in the same space, shared the same space, shared their lives together.  Well, in a similar way here, there was a circle of folks that all connected here, (gesture) regardless of what their profession was.  Anyway, my father was hooked into that.  And so when Pumpsie--not Pumpsie--but Sam Jethroe came, they reached into that network of folks to say, "Well, where can we get Sam to stay?"  "Oh, Claude West lives over there near Braves Field.  Let's see if we can get him in there."  Well, Sam Jethroe came and stayed with us for probably about six months before he--so before he could get, you know, something else.  So, when he initially came to Boston he stayed with us.  And that was an interesting moment in time.  But it also showed the racial realities too, still of that time, too.
Speaker 1: Now, did--now just two weeks ago we interviewed [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron, and he was talking about his early days with the Boston Braves.  He was with Boston first before they moved to Milwaukee [Milwaukee Braves].
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think--yeah, 'cause they were still, in '55 [1955] they were still in Boston.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: They didn't move to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] 'til '56 [1956] or '57 [1957], right [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because they won the--in the World Series in '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah
Speaker 1: And that was his second year, I think or his first year.
Speaker 2: Well, I think this occurred--and again, I'm hazy on the dates of all of this.  But I must have been eight or nine, ten years old.  So, that must have been in 1950 or so when the Braves--.  And that whole field now belongs to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  It's no longer Braves Field.  I mean, it's long gone, Braves Field, and they've built dormitories there.  And actually the New England Patriots used to use that field when they first started out, before or just around the time when BU was building dormitories around the field.  But the field was still there; they were building dormitories around it.
Story_ID: 664162
Speaker 1: We're talking about the Boston Braves, and I mentioned that [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron you know started here in Boston [Massachusetts] when he joined the Braves as a rookie.  Then they moved to Milwaukee [Milwaukee Braves], but--then they moved to Atlanta [Atlanta Braves] (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So they've been all around.  But you were talking about the starting lineup.  Did you go see a lot of (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The starting--yeah, the lineup of the Braves. Actually my father--my mother's father [Robert Thurston], my grandfather, when he was living with us there, would take me to the Braves, to see the Braves.  (Background noise) And--oh, that was me--and so, remembering Warren Spahn for instance, was the pitcher, a very well known pitcher.  I think Earl Torgeson was the first base.  Eddie Stanky was second--was shortstop.  Sam Elliott, or something Elliott [sic. Bob Elliott] was third base.
Speaker 1: That was before Eddie Mathews I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm trying to remember the outfield.  And Sam pla- I don't remember--I think Sam played outfield.  That's about best I can remember right at the moment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you went to see the games when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: I was about nine years old, ten years old--something like that.
Speaker 1: You were born in '37 [1937], let's see you would have been ten when Jackie Robinson broke into the Major Leagues [Major League Baseball], right--
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in '47 [1947]?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean I remember that, but, you know, I didn't have any real connection to it, but.
Speaker 1: So, Jethroe came in--was that the second year after Jackie Robinson was in, was he like?
Speaker 2: He--I, I--
Speaker 1: Probably in the early--
Speaker 2: --I can't remember the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when--who came when, and what.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would have been in that same period--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would have been in that--
Speaker 1: --from '47 [1947] to '50 [1950].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Because again, that's when black players were first beginning to be recognized and valued, and moving in that direction, you know.
Speaker 1: So you were like twelve, eleven or twelve, or thirteen?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, di- are there any stories about Sam Jethroe that you remember?
Speaker 2: That was it, well, in terms of what--you know, yeah, stories about him being at the house or something.  I don't--I just remember he was there.  I don't remember anything more in terms of partic- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember where he was from?
Speaker 2: I don't, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.

Speaker 1: In high school [Brookline High School, Brookline, Massachusetts], we were talking about--now did you--so, you took a college prep course in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, not really.  I think I just took the average courses.  And my grades were not great, and I think it was a little family connection that got me into Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  I mean I wasn't really fit for college, so to speak, grade wise.  But somehow I got into Morgan Stage.
Speaker 1: So, were your grades okay, or what?
Speaker 2: They were okay, they were passing.  But at that point when I went--you know, as I said, I had, I was starting to move away from the art a little bit, and getting interested into media, as I had talked a little bit about this radio station I created.  And I thought that maybe I wanted to be a technician, because I think television was coming along at that time, and the idea of working in radio maybe as a technician of some sort.  So when I went to Morgan, I was thinking, well, in order to do that I had to take math, and be--and then the ultimate idea was to go to Morgan maybe for a couple of years and then come back to Boston [Massachusetts] and go to Northeastern University, which was more of a technical school at that time.  And so when I got to Morgan, if you want me to tell you that experience--that opened my eyes to the African American community, and acceptance.  And it was, I was just, in a sense, blown away.  Because here was an experience I had never had up until that point, of people liking me and wanting me to be around, and inviting me to a party, or this thing and that.  So, I really got very much socially involved at Morgan State and in the town.  Because--and I don't know if it goes on today, but in Baltimore [Maryland] and in Washington [D.C.], in those townhouses, or the houses that folks had, they always had these fancy basements that they fixed up, and that was their party room; and everybody had one.  And so, when you went to a party at somebody's house, you'd go down in the basement and there'd be all the music stuff was fixed up.  And there was all--just a great basement.  So, the social piece was wonderful, and I had an African American girlfriend right away.  You know, was something I never had before--girlfriends, you know.  So, and I was majoring in math, and I was not good in math.  And so, I just got so socially involved and I didn't really follow my studies really well, and I flunked out of the school.  I mean, I didn't do well.  But I got a great education in socializing and understanding the culture that I'm, was from, and now was participating in.  And so since I didn't do well academically, I didn't go back.  And I just went out, you know, I was seventeen, eighteen [years old], I mean and I went out into life at that point getting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In--in Baltimore, or back here?
Speaker 2: No, no, back in Boston.  I came back to Boston.
Speaker 1: Back in Boston.  Okay.
Story_ID: 664164
Speaker 1: And I think my father [Claude West] got me into the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  You see, my father, having the work experience he had, you know, he thought that the post office--given my academic abilities and skills or whatever I had to earn a living with, he felt that the post office was the best way for me to go.  And he got me in; and so I worked in the post office a couple of years.  But--
Speaker 2: So what did you do at the post office?
Speaker 1: In the post office?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Driving a postal truck picking up mail, which was a good job for me.  Because I've always been, again, kind of an independent person through my (gesture)--because of the isolation a little bit, I always had to do for myself and think for--(gesture).  So, it was better for me to be out on a truck driving around picking up mail than sitting as a clerk, you know, constrained, although I think I did do some clerking.  But I ended up being out on the truck, and I really liked that because there was a freedom to that.  And I've always needed a sense of freedom in my experience.  And, but I also realized that the post office was not something I wanted to do the rest of my life.  And so, I went in and out of that.  I quit it, I went off to do something else for a while, and then I came back to the post office.  So, that's really what happened after the, the college experience, I--
Story_ID: 664165
Speaker 1: But I had gained a lot of self confidence and self worth out of that experience of being at Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], and being within really my own culture--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for the first time.  My nickname was Boston (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: And I had a Boston [Massachusetts]--thick Boston accent at that time, which I learned (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you'd say, you'd say (pronunciation) Boston.
Speaker 1: Boston, you know, car--all my A's were ah, you know--art.  I've--it's still--some people still think it sneaks in there a little bit still (laughter).  But I think I've lost most of it over the years, because I've lived in other places where people don't speak that way (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Did you become like self conscious when you'd go someplace else and you speak with a hard Boston accent?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.  I mean, if you did--I mean, there I did, because I certainly did have that accent then.  That's why they called me Boston.  But over the years, that accent has faded, I think.  I don't think anybody would think I have a Boston accent now.  I don't know, maybe you--
Speaker 2: It doesn't sound--it's not a real--you know, it's not--
Speaker 1: You don't really notice it in any dramatic way now.
Speaker 2: I would guess it's East Coast, but I wouldn't guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --necessarily it was Boston, necessarily.
Speaker 1: Boston, yeah.  But Boston, there are--real Bostonians really have a very specific accent.  And even there's the Brahmin section of Boston [Boston Brahmin], part of the culture here, which has another way--like Ted Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy].  The Kennedys, if you listen to them, they don't speak with necessarily the car, bar, but they have another little twist in tone to the way they speak, which is different than the common folk (laughter).  Listen to Ted or one of those--the Kennedys, and you'll see that there's a certain tone, piece to their accent.
Story_ID: 664166
Speaker 1: But I did have a wonderful time at Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], and, and good friends there, even that lasted some years.  There was one fellow there that I had a good friendship with, and I didn't see him for years.  I lived in Detroit [Michigan] for a while in the '70s [1970s], and he became an actor.  And he came through in a play called 'The River Niger' [Joseph A. Walker], if you remember that play.  And when I saw the play being advertised and I saw his name, I said, wow, from, you know, from back in the day at Morgan.  So, I go and see him, see the play, and I go backstage (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well who was it?  Who was it?
Speaker 1: I can't--Gilbert was the--he's passed on now, I think.  I think his first name or his last name was Gilbert.
Speaker 2: Not Gilbert Moses, not--it wouldn't be him?
Speaker 1: It might be.  His last name might be Gilbert.  I can't remember which was which, but Gilbert I do remember.  And he was kind of, he had a mus- big mustache--interesting guy.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know Gilbert Moses from Cleveland [Ohio] was a well known black director involved in plays and stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's passed away, like tragic kind of way, but.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, we touched base, you know I went backstage and said hello and all that.  But then he moved on, because he--the play was moving on.  And so, we just kind of passed in the night there after all those years back at Morgan.
Story_ID: 664167
Speaker 1: So you worked for the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] for a couple years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Then you moved to Detroit [Michigan], was that--was that what happened (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.  I was in Boston [Massachusetts] and just, you know, kind of bouncing around, we'll put it that way.  And I met my first wife--I've been married twice.  I met my first wife, and she became my wife because she got pregnant and I wanted to do the right thing, and we got married.  And around that time, we're talking now about the early, beginning of the '60s [1960s].  And that was a time when so much was transitioning in our society--politically, socially, musically.  And I was living in Boston, but was connected to Cambridge [Massachusetts].  And in Cambridge, in the early '60s [1960s]--late '50s [1950s], '59 [1959] to '60 [1960]--the folk music phenomenon was emerging.  There was a club there called the Club 47 [Club Passim, Cambridge, Massachusetts], which is a place where Joan Baez and Bob Dylan and Jim Kweskin, and all these--Eric Von Schmidt, and Muddy Waters, Jesse Fuller, all of these black musicians, Reverend Gary Davis, all of this, it was just gelling.  All of this stuff was going on.  And the club actually had started out as a jazz club with Sam Rivers and some other local musicians, but it evolved into this folk music club.  And a friend of mine and I started a store just up the street called the Folklore Center [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  It was a string instrument store, and we were the first ones in that area to put all these string instruments up on a wall.  Most stores didn't sell their instruments that way.  So, it was a funky little store, and all the musicians of the day used to come through there and hang out and we'd play.  And I started playing guitar in those days, and I got pretty good at it and played with different musicians.  And so, music was my piece for about four or five years in the mid-'60s [1960s].
Story_ID: 664168
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you--we have a note here, you became like known as a bass player primarily (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not a bass player.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A guitar player.
Speaker 1: Just the guitar?
Speaker 2: Guitar player, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you play like folk guitar?
Speaker 2: Folk guitar, rhythm guitar, fingerpicking, Elizabeth Cotten style stuff, Reverend Gary Davis.  Gary Davis is my idol.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you know his music.  If you don't know it, go find out about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I've heard his name, and I don't know if--I'm trying to think if I've heard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well he was called the Harlem Street Singer.  He was blind, and he used to play a big old Gibson.  And he had a fingerpicking style that was just unique and wonderful, and I can copy it fairly well (laughter).  I love it.  And he was a religious singer largely, but blues, blues and religious tunes: 'Twelve Gates to the City,' 'Hallelujah' ['I Belong to the Band (Hallelujah)'], you know, stuff like that.  But he played it so beautifully, up and down--
Speaker 1: So like Mississippi John Hurt, or?
Speaker 2: Well, John Hurt was different in his style.  John Hurt had this Delta picking style, a certain kind--but it was very akin to him, though.  He really developed a certain kind of style, which is called the Mississippi John Hurt style of playing.  It was, a more--it was different.  It's hard for me to try to describe it.  It was just a different use of picking.
Speaker 1: More like Elizabeth Cotten you think?
Speaker 2: More like Elizabeth Cotten, whereas Gary Davis was more bluesy and more up and down the neck.  See, John Hurt was mostly down on the lower part of the neck.  He didn't play up the neck that much.  But he had a fingerpicking style like Elizabeth Cotten had that was unique--just that style of the fingers.  The fingers didn't have to go way up here or do any--it just was down here on the lower part of the neck.  It was all in the finger style.  And that's what Mississippi John was; whereas Gary Davis had a finger style, but he was all over the neck with it, and he moved around.  He was like--to listen to Gary Davis was like listening to the piano on a guitar, because he had a way with the bass and the treble, just like you're playing the piano, like a stride bass of Fats Waller or something like that.  He had a way of integrating those two very definite parts, upper and lower; whereas the other two styles just were kind of like melded always.  It was no real difference, so to speak.  It was kind of all--it was smooth, whereas this was a very strident kind of playing.
Story_ID: 664169
Speaker 1: So this is a time, as I remember watching a show called 'Hootenanny' on television.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Pete Seeger was very popular (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean folk music--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was starting to really rise in the early '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --along with the feeling that something new was going on amongst the youth of the country.  Had--John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was the president.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He was young.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He had hair, and--you know.
Speaker 2: Right, right (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And so, he's somebody that--he was witty, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He seemed to be, you know, very alert, you know, as opposed to our past presidents, who were very--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know--
Speaker 2: Staid.
Speaker 1: --staid fellows, like Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] and Truman [President Harry S. Truman] was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, we have this young president--
Speaker 2: So you had a--the '60s [1960s] was like a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) New Frontier.
Speaker 2: --elastic time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You could almost say it was elastic, because everything was changing.  Culture was upheaving; and then finally when Dylan went from folk music into electric, that was a big change for that hero.  He was the folk hero, and then when he got electrified--you know, the night that he electrified at the Newport Folk Festival, there was a story about Pete Seeger being backstage and was going to unplug him.  He tried to unplug him actually, and people stopped him.  (Laughter) He was going to pull the plug.  But, and you're hearing a lot about Dylan now because he got the Puli- the--
Speaker 1: Nobel Prize [Nobel Prize in Literature].
Speaker 2: --Nobel Prize.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they can't find him to give it to him (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, now, so did you, you knew Bob--did you know Bob Dylan, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I passed through.  We all--you know--
Speaker 1: --Joan Baez?
Speaker 2: --I didn't know them p- I knew Baez, and Eric Von Schmidt, and Gary Davis [Reverend Gary Davis] I saw and hung out--and Jesse Fuller, if you remember 'San Francisco Blues' that--Jesse wrote that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: "I got the blues by my--my baby down, sitting down by the Frisco Bay"--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --"wondering (mumbles) gone so far away."  Anyway, he used to--Jesse Fuller was quite an amazing guy.  From San Francisco [California], played a twelve string guitar; and he made something called a fotdella, and it was a bass that he played with his foot.  And he had a set up in front of him, and his foot would play this bass as he's doing this (gesture), and he had a harmonica.  So he was a one man band, basically is what he was.  And he, his most famous song was 'San Francisco Bay Blues,' which I was just trying to do a little bit of (laughter).
Story_ID: 664170
Speaker 1: Now, what about, is it Taj Mahal?  Now he's from--?
Speaker 2: Taj, Taj was--grew up in Springfield [Massachusetts].  And Taj is his stage name.  His real name is Fredericks--Leroy Fredericks, something like that [sic. Henry Saint Clair Fredericks].  And I knew Taj at that time, and of course Taj is an amazing guy.  And I've known him over the years, and I even have a little story about him in my transcendental meditation phase, going to San Quentin prison [San Quentin State Prison, San Quentin, California].  But I'll tell you that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --later in the story (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, when we get to that.  Okay.  All right.  All right.
Speaker 2: But he, Taj was just, he really has been a master at bringing African music--bringing enlightenment to African music as it has come from Africa into the South, and into the--and it evolves into the blues of the South.  He made a, he did a tune where he--the African instrument, I think it's called a koto?
Speaker 1: A kora I think?
Speaker 2: A kora--that's right.  Koto is the Japanese thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's right.
Speaker 2: Kora, you know that instrument (gesture)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: And it's a wonderful sounding instrument.  So he, he gets this guy who plays the kora, and he plays a steel guitar.  You know what those sound like--kind of funky sound, tinny sound to it.  And he does this Mississippi blues tune, which I can't remember the name of.  But he fit the two of the instruments perfectly together.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So, here was this African--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I know he performs this at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York], and there's a DVD--I mean a CD of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I know--the one song I remember is 'Honey Bee' [sic. 'Queen Bee'].  They do 'Honey Bee'--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(singing), "Sweeter than a honey bee," and it's a lady singing in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That might have been the one I think, 'Honey'--I think you're right.
Speaker 1: --singing in Mandi or something, she's singing like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, and she--and the chorus is playing.
Speaker 1: --yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And he's playing guitar.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's, that's the combination, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Yeah he's--
Speaker 2: Wonderful.  But that was his desire, has been to bring all this music together and to educate people around how the African music has influenced American black music and (unclear) music in general.
Speaker 1: Yeah, musicologists (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --pretty much agree that the West African string playing is the roots of the blues--here, really.
Speaker 2: Right, right, yeah.  So, he's done a wonderful job of that, and he's evolved tremendously over the years.  He was just through Boston [Massachusetts] just recently.  And I haven't seen him to talk to him in years, it's been a long time.  But I lived in Berkeley, California for a while, and we hooked up a bit there, because he was living in Berkeley back in the '70s [1970s] I think it was.
Story_ID: 664171
Speaker 1: But the '60s [1960s] was an amazing time on all levels of our society.  Everything was just upheaving.  And then the Civil Rights Movement was beginning and functioning.  But music was--music and spirituality is really what I moved into in the '60s [1960s].  Because as part of all of that, if you remember, the culture of India was weaving into the Western culture.  And Ravi Shankar in the music, and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who was a spiritual leader that I followed with transcendental meditation--because I started TM I think about 1967; and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Now did you still have the guitar shop [Folklore Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts] at this point?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no.  Now?  No.
Speaker 2: No, not now--then?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, then.  No, the guitar shop lasted about three years (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was about '61 [1961] to '64 [1964], roughly speaking.  It was about two or three years.  And then both myself and the other fellow, we just moved on to other things.
Speaker 2: So, what did you move on to after the guitar shop?
Speaker 1: What did I do?  I don't know (laughter).  Nothing specific (laughter) that I could really talk about.  I think I was--I know I was moving towards spirituality.  And--
Speaker 2: Okay.  But you were still performing music in?
Speaker 1: A little bit, yeah.
Speaker 2: And had you thought at all about visual arts that much at that stage?
Speaker 1: Not at--not so much as a specific--I think photography came into my life actually when I was about sixteen years old.  My father [Claude West] was a fan of photography.  He was, he was an amateur photographer of sorts.  So, he had some box cameras, the old Brownie camera around the house and he had--because my uncle Charlie [Charles West], his brother, actually was a professional photographer for a while.  And so, that's where I first picked up on the camera thing.  And was interested in it, because again I think my graphic sense connected there.  So, photography and a camera has always been a part of my life since I was sixteen years old, but in the background just sort of as a hobby--something that I didn't really do professionally or really connect to in a really active way.  But it was there, I was always taking pictures.  Yeah.  But the music thing in the '60s [1960s] really was a strong part of my existence, because I was on the road with groups.  I used to be a, I used to play rhythm guitar with different--.  If you remember how folk music was evolving from kind of the pure folk scenario into the popular folk of popular music--and there were groups at that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mamas and Papas [The Mamas and the Papas].
Speaker 1: The Mamas and the--well, the Mamas and Papas came out of folk musicians.  Those guys were all--but I'm thinking more of the bigger vocal--like when The Kingston Trio started out, they were sort of like an introduction to the masses of people about folk music.  That's really how I learned about folk music, was The Kingston Trio and others like that.  And there were a number of those groups, kind of transition groups that were taking people from pure folk into the more popularized folk music.  And so, I was playing with a group through those years that--a black group of guys; and we were kind of doing spirituals and some folk music, and popular- popularizing it a little bit.  I mean, we were real pure folklorists, so to speak.  But we were doing pop- and we toured around colleges and that sort of thing, and different clubs, and.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the group?
Speaker 1: The Mandrell Singers.
Speaker 2: Mandrell?
Speaker 1: Yeah, M-A-N-D-R-E-L-L, Singers.  Yeah, we played in a number of different interesting places.  We played with Phyllis Diller on her first TV show ['The Phyllis Diller Show'] in New York [New York].  So, we had some interesting gigs here and there.  I met [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory on that, around that time.  We played with him on a college campus one time.  And I played rhythm guitar, and we had another guy that played lead guitar.  And there were four guys--it was four fellows, four guys singing.  And we did some good stuff.  We never made a record though, but.  So, but as I'm saying, the transition there was--my spiritual side--I was more interested in that, you know.  Because during that time, you know, that's when the Civil Rights Movement was growing, and--but I wasn't really connected to all that.
Story_ID: 664172
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  I didn't ask you this earlier, and I feel really bad that I didn't.  But I usually ask people about church when they were growing up--did they, their family attend church, or did they get their--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --their moral grounding from church or from--more from home, or what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: What was your story in terms of that?
Speaker 2: Well, on the church side growing up we were Methodists, and I went to a Methodist church in Brookline [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Was this a white Methodist church?  I guess it would have to be, right?
Speaker 2: There was nothing color there.  (Laughter) No, it was white, yes.  And I became a Boy Scout there, and I went to Sunday school.  What I really got out of all that, I couldn't really tell you whether I was morally balanced there or something.  I--you know, I enjoyed going there, but I think my moral compass came more from my immediate family.  That was just part of my growing up, you know, going to the church.  The church is now a condo (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, did you think about the--about religion much when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: In terms of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --did you--you know--okay.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: I mean--just didn't think about--okay.
Speaker 2: And it wasn't a big thing in my family, per se.  Others in the family, I don't recall.  I don't recall the church being any significant reality to our family--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in terms of others going to church.  I'm sure they went to church, perhaps, but I can't really remember specifically.  Nor--but I do remember that there was no great talk of Jesus and this religion, or--I mean my family, you know, when they got together they certainly had significant talks about the goings on of the day--politics and church.  I mean and religion and all that stuff wa- you know, played into any real conversation.
Story_ID: 664173
Speaker 1: But in my early younger years, I was never part of that, really.  I mean, I was just a single kid with all these grownups all the time.  This was, mostly my life was me at my young age with a lot of grownups, other than when we were actually in our house in Brookline [Massachusetts] where I then had a couple of friends around in the neighborhood.  But when we went off to the Cape [Cape Cod, Massachusetts], you know, that whole three weeks away, there was no--it was just me.  And on some of the summers--I think I mentioned to you before how I knew the owners of the Afro-American newspaper [Afro-American Newspapers], the Murphys.  Once--and once in a while they'd bring their daughter, and so I would interact with her when she came, you know, so I had somebody my own age to talk to.  But most of the time for many years, it was just me on those vacations, and in general.  Because when I was with the family--see, I was--I don't think I mentioned--well, I did mention that my father [Claude West] had previous two wives to my mother [Elise Thurston West], which means that I was born when my mother was about almost forty years old.  And my growing up was with older people, so to speak.  And in those days, older people were more staid kind of people.  They were not like--I think the difference between--let's say today, parents and children are very closer together because the culture has changed.  Communication has changed, music interests have changed; so there's not a big separation between parent and child in terms of interests.  They--I mean, here's parents now that love The Beatles, and their kids can love The Beatles too.  In my time, what they liked and I liked was like, you know, years apart--a big gap.  So that also isolated me a little bit because we didn't, we didn't connect on the same kind of levels.
Story_ID: 664174
Speaker 1: Now, just to expand that a little bit more, whe- so I where was born sort of between my cousins.  Now there were--you know, I did have some cousins, and they were all ten years older than me.  And then they had children who were like ten years younger than me.  So, in the relationship within the family, again I'm isolated.  I was not, I didn't connect to either side, you know, directly.  So, that was another part of the dynamic of coming along at a late age in my parents' [Elise Thurston West and Claude West] life.

Speaker 1: We were talking about the mid-'60s [1960s] I guess.  You said at, about around '67 [1967] you were exposed to transcendental meditation?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, right.  Well, let me say that through the '60s [1960s], there was this spiritual thread coming from India.  And these different gurus--Paramahansa [Paramahansa Yogananda]--there were a number of them.  And the music, I mean The Beatles came along in the early '60s [1960s].  And George Harrison became interested also in the Eastern experience, and started playing the sitar and bringing that music into The Beatles' music.  And they brought Maharishi in because they went from--Maharishi Yogi [Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]--who was the, a very popular Indian guru at the time of the early '60s [1960s].  He had been around starting his movement before the--he was in the late '50s [1950s] when he started.  But it kind of caught on popularly in the early '60s [1960s], and I heard about it later in the '60s [1960s], and started meditation--I think that's when I started, it was in '67 [1967].  And I saw that the opportunity to be a teacher of TM was possible, and I was looking for--because something I haven't mentioned is in the '60s [1960s] I had two children [Elyssa West and Erica West].  So, I was a father trying to support, you know, a family.  And so, we were all--this--my two--I have two girls and a wife and me.  And we--but my wife and I, after seven years, I guess it was the seven year itch; I don't know what it was.  We started to move apart, you know.  And I started moving more towards TM and trying to become a teacher of TM.  And I thought that that was a way to broaden my own spiritual experience, but to do something meaningful.  Because the musician and the music part had kind of faded in my life as the late '60s [1960s] came along.  And so, I was looking to go in another direction, and this meditation was something that I was interested very much in.  So, I found a way to earn the money and become--go and take the course, which was in Colorado at the time.  And became a teacher, and taught in 1970 for about half a year or so here in Cambridge [Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 664176
Speaker 1: What's the process to become a teacher, and how long did it take?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, the, the movement was evolving very quickly in different ways.  And Maharishi [Maharishi Mahesh Yogi] was just beginning to teach teachers around 1967.  And he came to Squaw Valley [California] in '68 [1968] I think it was to introduce people more to the TM [transcendental meditation] technique and to the possibility of becoming teachers.  And I tried to go to that course, but it didn't quite work out, although I did go to California was- and stayed out there for a summer.  But then he taught his first course I think in Rishikesh in India and then he wanted to bring it to the United States.  And he brought it to Boulder, Colorado up in--Estes Park [Colorado] up in the mountains at a resort, at a formal resort there.  And that's--and what it took was just applying, and you have, would have had to have been meditating for like, you know, a couple of years or so, so that you have the experience.  And you paid for the course; it cost something.  And the course was two months long, so I spent two months up in the mountains in this space with about, I don't know how many people were there--thirty, forty, fifty people; I can't even remember now.  But it was a wonderful course.  You know, every night we would go down and hear Maharishi speaking.  He would give us knowledge of the human experience, and what was possible.  And we had meals, and we would meditate for long periods of time, which was called rounding.  And what that meant was you would meditate for about twenty minutes and then you would do ten minutes of yoga postures called asanas--just some stretching, nothing too difficult.  And then you would go back and meditate again.  So, that was a round: meditation, some asanas, meditation; that's--and you do that for seven hours or so.  Come out for lunch, go back.  So, we spent many--a month, month and a half doing that.  And the purpose of that is to deepen your awareness of your internal experience by--just by becoming quiet and letting the whole mind and nervous system settle down.  The result of that is greater awareness coming to the mind and physicality of the body.  Because you're just using the body's own mechanism of rest and rejuvenation, because it's built in.  That's why we sleep every night: to rejuvenate from the day's activity, to regenerate and be ready for the next day.  And we go through that cycle throughout our life.  Well, that mechanism of rejuvenation is just enhanced by the TM technique to get you even deeper and release more stresses and allow more energy to come into the whole physiology.  And it does great things.  It heals in various ways on many different levels--psychological and physiological.  And so by doing it in a very intense way over a period of time, you enhance that process so that you come out of it a lot broader than you went into it.  So, that's--and that's part of the process of becoming a teacher, because becoming a teacher, you want to have the greatest abilities--psychologically and physiologically--to impart the teaching and to go through the process.  Because as a teacher you're also, you're out there with stressed people, and you're absorbing some of that stress in the process of teaching.  And so, you need to do the proper things to maintain your own balance and continue to deepen your own experience.
Story_ID: 664177
Speaker 1: So, that's the si- that's, that's the value of the teacher within the teacher.  And the greater value is outside of what the teacher does for the individuals that they instruct, because they're now giving other folks the ability to do the same thing, which makes them better.  And that's how I went to Detroit [Michigan]--in '70 [1970], you know, I became the teacher.  And I learned that on the West Coast in Los Angeles [California] there was a group of African American teachers of TM.  And we're talking now--you know, the early '70s [1970s], and we're talking about a time when racial issues was bubbling up, and circumstances in cities were difficult.  I mean there were--African Americans were not having a good time in most cities in this country for various economic, social, health wise.  You know, there was a whole scene that was very difficult and problematical and debilitating, and the reasons for it had come out of slavery.  I mean, there's a whole reasoning for that process and how it evolved into that.  But in any event, the desire was to teach and bring transcendental meditation into the inner cities of this country.  And white teachers couldn't really do that; they were not welcomed into the black community.  And so a number of African American folk who started TM, felt they started TM not only for their own benefit, but to bring it to the community.  And I became aware of them.  They were based in Los Angeles at the time, and the only place in the country where there was really a group of them.  So, I decided to go there.  So I went to L.A. and I hooked up with these folks, and taught on the West Coast for a while in L.A. and in Berkeley [California] in San Francisco [San Francisco Bay Area, California].  And had the oppor- then was going home for Christmas, and I--and the leader up there was going to Detroit to give a course.  And I said, "Well, I'll go with you, because I'm going back to Boston [Massachusetts]."  So we went together to Detroit, we did a course there.  I went back to Boston, Christmas, but the experience in Detroit, they wanted more.  So I didn't--I had no real direction.  I mean, I was just choosing my directions at that point.  So I said, well, let me go back to Detroit and see what I can do.
Story_ID: 664178
Speaker 1: Now, where in Detroit [Michigan] did you teach?
Speaker 2: In the inner city on Woodward Avenue right by the history museum [International Afro American Museum; Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, Detroit, Michigan], across from the library [Detroit Public Library] right there on Woodward (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Over in the Cultural Center [Cultural Center Historic District] they call it in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Right.  Right there, Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] was a block away.   And, but, I mean I initially started staying in somebody's house.  And we would have a course in people's houses, you know, different--like that.  And that's how it grew from that into the point where we could get a center, an office space, which we did in that area that I just mentioned.  And I was there for seven or eight years teaching.  And I hooked up with a woman, Shirley McNeil.  And Shirley was a school administrator in reading.  She was a head of the reading program in the Detroit schools [Detroit Public Schools; Detroit Public Schools Community District].  And her family that she came from, her father was a very well known pastor, a preacher in Detroit, along with Aretha Franklin's father [C.L. Franklin], if you know that history there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, the McNeils had a similar history--he was a very dynamic person in that sense.  But at the time that I arrived in Detroit, he had passed on.  But the family was still there, and she had a number of siblings that--they welcomed me into their family.  And her, one of her sisters already was doing TM [transcendental meditation].  And so when I came along, I talked to Shirley, she became interested.  And I taught Shirley and we became partners, because she had the connection into all of the people of Detroit.  She knew the mayor.  What's the--?
Speaker 1: Coleman Young.
Speaker 2: Coleman Young came into office around that time.  We never got to Coleman, though, in terms of TM (laughter).  But we got into Motown [Motown Records], you know, folks there.  And at that time, Motown was moving to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I couldn't catch up to Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson], but I got his wife [HistoryMaker Claudette Robinson] and I got the Four Tops folks; so we connected into Motown a bit.  So, we had a very dynamic thing going on there.  People very well welcomed TM, and saw the results, the positive results of it.  And Shirley was really a dynamo in that.  She was a very vibrant, very--.  And I was trying to find--Ebony did a four page story on us back in that time.  And I was trying to find it to bring it to have it part of this, but you may be able to research it.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: It was probably in the mid-'70s [1970s]--maybe '74 [1974] or so [sic. 1976].  It has on the cover the baseball story of one of the Negro League baseball teams.  It was a movie back in that time.
Speaker 1: Oh, 'Bingo Long'--
Speaker 2: 'Bingo.'
Speaker 1: --'and the Traveling All-Stars' [sic. 'The Bingo Long Traveling All Stars and Motor Kings']?
Speaker 2: I think so.  Between them--they did a cover story on them.  So it's in that particular issue.  And there's a big full page picture of Shirley and I meditating and leading a group of folks in our center, in meditation.  They did a very good story on it.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so that was a great enjoyment for me in many ways, because it was bringing me back to my culture again.  After Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], you see, all those years--again, it was kind of a filter of white and black through the music experience--not specifically black, but in a white environment still all those years.  Now, I'm in Detroit--Detroit, you know.  I'm back at Morgan, Morgan State; you know, I'm in a black culture again.  And it was a great experience, you know.  We did TV shows, radio-that was great.  And we created a radio show called 'Take 20' [ph.] and it was it was on one of the local jazz stations, WJZZ [WJZZ Radio; WDMK Radio, Detroit, Michigan], on Saturday morning.  And so I was the engineer sort of, of the show.  Shirley did the interviews, and I--back in the day, you know, with the tapes--the cutting of the tapes and all that business (gesture) you know.  So I cut the tape and made the tape, and we gave it to the station, they played it every Saturday morning--'Take 20.'  The opening music was Stevie Wonder, transcendental meditation ['Jesus Children of America'].  Do you remember that?
Speaker 1: Oh, right, right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do you remember Stevie singing that?  (Singing), "Transcendental--," it--(snaps fingers) just start out, you know.  It was a great show.  So that--that was, that was some good days.
Story_ID: 664179
Speaker 1: So then, you know, we progressed on--I progressed on from there.  Because it--you know, at one point things changed a bit, and, and I decided to leave Detroit [Michigan].  And then I'm thinking about what is my next step?  And I had the opportunity to get a job in San Francisco [California] with the sickle cell anemia folks out there.
Speaker 2: Now, what happened?  What happened in Detroit?  Now, transcendental meditation is rolling along, and what?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it goes--
Speaker 2: What was the?
Speaker 1: --well, well, the thing is by '78 [1978], 1978, the fortune, so to speak, of the TM movement there was--the popularity was changing.  It was changing, you know.  Because what happened with TM, it was very popular through the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], but there came a point where its general popularity sort of waned.  But it, itself was not waning.  It was just in the popular market that it was waning.  People were not as interested, you know.  Their whole thing about spirituality and meditation kind of shifted into some other interest.  And so--but the TM movement was still moving in the scientific and into the business communities, and try- in a sense institutionalizing TM, showing that in the corporations that their workers would be better functioning by doing TM.  And that could be in corporations, it could be in businesses, it could be at schools.  So, it shifted into a different level of appre- of expansion, which it has done up until now.  I mean, there's a university in Iowa [Maharishi International University; Maharishi University of Management, Fairfield, Iowa] that has grown tremendously.  The techniques have become more sophisticated.  Their desire to influence the environments around the country and the world has grown.  But it's more specific, it's not in the popular market any- because the whole thing of spirituality and Eastern--and all of that--that's kind of waned after the '60s [1960s], and Ravi Shankar and all that business is not around in the same way.  And that thing about meditation has taken a different turn in terms of the physicality of running and exercising and all these exercise groups--(gesture) you pull this and you do that.  It's a whole different style of expressing self development or physiological development that is not the same as it was in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: I know that yoga is still really popular, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It is, but not in the same way.
Speaker 2: --not in--okay.
Speaker 1: Not in that spiritual way.  It's a more physical approach.  It's not a deep, spiritual approach.  It's just getting your body together--getting your abs this way, or--or stretching.  You know, it's not the sa- at least my perception, it's not the same as it was in those years.
Story_ID: 664180
Speaker 1: You all just started getting less, less clientele and (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it--yeah, it was slowing down a little bit.  And Shirley [Shirley McNeil] and I didn't have, were not on the same page as to what to do next.  And so, we split apart.  And she continued there [Detroit, Michigan], and I was looking for my next step.  And I was offered this job in San Francisco [California].  And I haven't mentioned too much about my kids [Elyssa West and Erica West].  You know, I didn't see them a whole lot through those years.
Speaker 1: Where were they at this point?
Speaker 2: They were in California at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: They had moved to California with their mother, living in Berkeley [California].  And so I only saw them occasionally, and I really wanted to be closer to them.  And so this was an opportunity, getting a job in San Francisco, to be close to them because they were in Berkeley.  And that's what I did.  And--but I didn't stop TM [transcendental meditation] either.  Because--and I was out there for two years doing that sickle cell--and as part of that I got involved with a fellow who was doing programs of TM in San Quentin [San Quentin State Prison, San Quentin, California].  And that comes to what I mentioned earlier about Taj Mahal (laughter).  I got Taj to come in and play for the inmates.  And the way that all went down was, when you go into San Quentin, you go through sort of like this lock.  You know how--well, you come in one door and it's locked behind you.  And there's another door that's locked, and you're in this little space.  And you're told in that space that if you go in the prison now, California does not have a hostage rule.  If you're taken--if anything happens and you're taken hostage, we will not negotiate for you.  So this is your moment to go in or go out (laughter).  Because if you go in and something happens, we ain't going to do anything.  So, of course, nobody can say, "Oh, I'm not going to--," you know, they don't want to chicken out.  But the point was, what happened was that when I asked Taj to come, he wore denims.  And I didn't know at the time that he shouldn't wear--nobody should wear denims going in, because all the inmates are dressed in denims.  And so they don't want anybody to come in dressed in denims, because if anything goes down, they're looking for what the--who's wearing denims to be the inmates, and you're liable to get in a bad place if you're wearing--.  So, he got to put on an orange jumpsuit in order to go in.
Speaker 1: Now, that's really--so he had to put on an orange jumpsuit that most prisoners wear now, to go into a prison where they mostly (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, most prisoners, I think inside don't wear orange jumpsuits.  It's only when they pass through critical situations, I think--the orange jumpsuits.
Speaker 1: Really?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think it's--it's not a norm that everybody wears--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --once you're inside.  But because he had denims on, he had to put this orange jumpsuit on to identify something--that he was okay, or whatever.  It pissed him off, which I can understand.  But anyway we went in and he performed.  He did a wonderful job.  And he had to put the thing on again and go back out.  But he gave me a few words about that (laughter).  So, that's my story of Taj and San Quentin.
Story_ID: 664181
Speaker 1: But I was doing the sickle cell anemia there as a, as a job.  I was working at a job doing that.  I was doing public education and testing for sickle cell, and I was doing TM [transcendental meditation] on the side in San Quentin [San Quentin State Prison, San Quentin, California].  So, that lasted about two years, and--.
Speaker 2: Any photography at all?
Speaker 1: No.  Well, all these years I've been shooting, you know.
Speaker 2: Did you have--I mean, were you shooting SLR [single lens reflex camera]?  Were you really shooting--I mean, you know?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Well, it--well, no, it wasn't an SLR that I had in those days.  It was just more a range finder.  I think the camera that I usually had was a range finder.  The sadness of the photography experience, particularly with Detroit [Michigan], all the pictures I took in Detroit got lost.  So, you know, when I was looking for pictures for this process here, you know, that would have--I couldn't find--I don't have any pictures from Detroit.  For seven years in Detroit I lost all of that, and that would have been so wonderful to be able to share that in this HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] experience.  But somebody along the way probably took some pictures, and if--and someday I'm going to try to pull something out of that, because I really want to have some record of that.  Because we did wonderful work in Detroit, and I'm proud of that.  And glad to have been involved in that, and glad to have been able to extend it in San Francisco [California] in San Quentin, because we did some good work there too.  And now, TM is used in many prisons around this country and in Africa.  And it's being used now for PSTD [sic. posttraumatic stress disorder], the stress syndrome for soldiers coming back to kind of settle them and get them back functioning properly again, so--
Speaker 2: Okay, so--all right.  So, you worked for the sickle cell foundation for two years you said?
Speaker 1: Two years out there, yeah.
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: Well, what happened there was the funding ran out (laughter), and I was released because they couldn't pay for my position anymore.  So, I just did some odd jobs for a little bit, and I just landed a job as a cardiograph- cardiographic draftsman with a computer, and this is when computers were just beginning to, in '78 [1978], beginning to come to the fore.  And I thought it was a great job, you know, I was going to be doing this draftsman stuff.  And what it was, was a way to input information into computerized maps and so forth.  But just at the time that that job came up, and I hadn't even started it--I was about to start it, and my aunt, my aunt Lillian [Lillian West] got sick here in Boston [Massachusetts] and nobody was here to take care of her.  So, I decided to come back to take care of her.  And so, I gave up the job, came back to Boston; got a job here with the Boston City Hospital sickle cell anemia group [Boston Sickle Cell Center].  And I helped my aunt, but the sickness took her life after a couple of years.  And, and I worked for sickle cell here for a couple of years, but then the photography thing kind of came to the fore in my life.  I said--because again--because it seemed like in my life I'm evolving a lot.  You know, what's next?  I go through a certain period and that ends and then I'm wondering, what's the next step?  So I'm looking there after the sickle cell--maybe photography.  And that kind of came at the same time I was working with sickle cell.  Because in the background, I used to use the photography to--part of my presentations, I used photography as part--so it was being used in that way.  And I did that with the sickle cell folks here.  We, we, I created a slideshow and things like that around sickle cell anemia to enhance the public presentations that I was giving.
Story_ID: 664182
Speaker 1: I was starting--I started doing freelance--well, no, part time work at the Bay State Banner here in Boston [Massachusetts], which is Boston's black newspaper.  And I was doing layout and paste up with them, so that's how my relationship with them started.  And at one point I submitted a photograph, and they printed it on the front page of the paper.  Well, it was very encouraging that they did that.  And--
Speaker 2: What was it a photograph of?
Speaker 1: It was a--there's a--Fort Hill [Boston, Massachusetts] is an area here, and there's a tower on the top of Fort Hill which is very interesting graphically.  And it was in the wintertime, and I--the picture was of a person--it was kind of a silhouette of a person in the snow and then the tower behind them.  Something nice graphically, I guess.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But anyway, so in that relationship I had with them, I started submitting pictures with them and they started using them.  And I started getting assignments and--
Speaker 2: Now, did you know Mel Miller [HistoryMaker Melvin Miller] before, or?
Speaker 1: Not before.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I met him as--being a layout and paste up artist, I, you know, I knew him, I got to know him through that.  And I started getting assignments, and those assignments connected me to a lot of businesses and local folk, and so forth.  And I figured, well, maybe I could do this freelance.  And so, I jumped off and left the sickle cell [Boston Sickle Cell Center, Boston, Massachusetts] and started doing photography.  And so it was a combination of doing assignments for the Banner, which took me all over town; and I also was working for UPI, United Press International wire service at the time, and they were in competition with Associated Press.  And you know, there were a lot of wire services then.  So, I was working for the two of them, also doing these different, you know, non-profits and profits, and so forth.  So I built a business, you know.  And after about five or six, seven or eight years--
Speaker 2: How did you get a connection with UPI as a photographer?
Speaker 1: Well, the story, this is how that story went.  I went to AP first and I brought my portfolio.  And I was kind of given the cold shoulder there; they weren't very warm to me.  And so I go over to UPI, and they were very friendly and they welcomed me in.  And you'll see in some of the pictures that I brought you, some of my buddies from UPI. Because there was a lot of us around Boston and members of the Boston Press Photographers Association, which I'm a member.  So, anyway, UPI welcomed me and they gave me assignments, and I learned a lot with UPI.  One of the key things I learned was being able to tell a story in one picture.  Because in those days you'd go out on an assignment or cover a news story or a demonstration or something, and they wouldn't publish that many pictures, print--send; maybe they'd send one or two pictures.  So, you really had to capture as best you could the whole story in one picture.  And that was really a great learning experience just to--how to do that.  Because that's really what photography is--and still what photography is about, is being able to tell a story.
Story_ID: 664183
Speaker 1: I take it, this is a process that just doesn't happen overnight--that you kind of gradually got into photography (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  I mean, the, the change from amateur photographer to professional photographer is quite a jump because the responsibility of what you do is now in question, or is important.  I mean, you got to deliver now.  It's not just playing around or if you make a mistake, it's okay.  Now, your clients are depending on what you do.  So, and I hadn't really done a lot of developing of film and all that.  So, I just--you know, there's a--you asked me earlier about a phrase that would, that I liked.  And I can't remember now this particular phrase, but it was something along the lines of--
Speaker 1: The phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Just do it, you know.  I mean, this guy Braniff [sic. Richard Branson], with the airlines, I think it's Virgin America or something, he aligns to that phrase of, if you don't know it, just find out and go do it--just do it.  And that sort of what I, what the beginning of my professional photography life was.  It was--jobs--if somebody asked me to do a job and I didn't know how to do it, I'd say, "I can do it," and then I'd go and learn how to do it (laughter), and do it.  And so they would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is from I guess the realization that you knew you had a capacity to learn that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --whatever it was--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --it wasn't that far beyond what you could learn?
Speaker 2: It wasn't beyond my ability to grasp.  It's just that I didn't have the knowledge at that moment.  But, in also being freelance, you don't want to give up any jobs that are coming along; you know, you take anything.  Whatever--, "Yeah, I can do it, yes."  Question: "Can you do this?"  "Yes."  And then if you don't know how to do it, you find out how to do it.  So that's, that was in the beginning years, first four or five years.
Speaker 1: There're quite a few photographers that we've interviewed that have got into it as a profession in the same way.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They saw something needed to be done, and they--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --they thought, well, I can do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then they--so?
Speaker 2: But I never had any profe- formal schooling.  You know, I just read a lot, I observed a lot.  I observed professional news photographers--what kind of cameras they carried, what lenses they used.  I just learned on the, you know, street university.  And I picked it up quick, and I loved it.  I loved the photography.  And my philosophy was a couple of things.  One was I loved shooting real people in real time, as opposed to commercial photography where you're working in studios with still lifes, and products and all that.  That didn't interest me.  What interested me was people doing what they do.  And one of the observations that I had at that time was that people of color were not given--were given short shrift in terms of the images that were being put out about them, and I wanted to make more positive images.  And I use an analogy often that--I used to attend a lot of press conferences.  And often in these press conferences they would be discussing issues that were broad issues of all ethnicities of the community.  And there'd be a number of different ethnicities there at the press conference--white, black, so forth.  But the next day in the white newspapers you'd see the white person at the podium giving the view.  Well, I waited until the black person came to the microphone, and that's the picture I put forward to UPI [United Press International] or to the Banner [Bay State Banner].  And so, there was that kind of perception.  You know, reporting, and history, and all is not always objective.  It's very subjective in some way or other.  Even though we say it's objective, we put our little piece in there.  So that was, so that was my piece that I was putting in that I wanted to make black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well there was a famous book that came out in the late '60s [1960s], the media--'The Medium is the Message' [sic. 'The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects'] by Marshall McLuhan, about you know about the control of image.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  And that's so true today, especially.  I mean, communication today is--I mean, perception is truth now, you know.  And so you have to be very careful of what you put out there, in terms of being honest about it.
Story_ID: 664184
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is--now this is like the Wizard of Oz--the man behind the curtain.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So many people just see the Wizard, but they don't know what's going on behind the curtain.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: When you're a photographer, you kind of do know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on some level, all the images you could have shot--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about a--
Speaker 2: Or which ones you choose of what you did shoot.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And the way it went down, how you make that choice.  So, those are all the elements, you know, in there.  And so, it's been a very fascinating trip.  I've been doing this for thirty-four years now, and, you know, it's the best job I've--(laughter) I got in all these years.  You know, coming into life not a skilled person, you see, that's sort of what has always been kind of the--I don't know to say whether it's a downside.  But it's, you know, when you come in, if you have a college education or you have some training or something--you have a skill, you're marketable.  I mean, everybody has to earn a living.
Speaker 1: It's not so much skill is it, but credentials, right?
Speaker 2: Well, well--
Speaker 1: You--because you certainly are a skilled photographer, but you?
Speaker 2: Right, true.  But I had to, I had to gain that skill myself.  I had to grab it--hold of it myself.  I wasn't, I didn't step into a space that gave me the ability--that nurtured my abilities and gave me a lot of information.  I had to gather that over years of experience, the same when I was playing the guitar.  Nobody taught me how to play the guitar.  I played it out of observation and natural talent, and same with the photography, out of observation and natural talent.  But when you go to school, or you have mentors that help, you see.  Even through all those processes we just discussed, there were never really any mentors in there for me--nobody that I could just, you know, was giving me specialized information.  You know, I did it by observation, observation--a lot of watching what the professionals did, how it worked, how the systems worked, and then put it together.
Speaker 1: Do you think it would have been more--you would have been more successful--or some of these were--?
Speaker 2: More successful sooner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And may have taken directions more--more thoughtfully because of what I had, what I felt I had.  I mean in my twenties, it was like I was thrown into the den of life with no--when I say skills, ability to go this way or that way.  I mean, you know, I just kind of grabbed my choices as they (gesture)--it's like what these people are doing with 'Pokemon' ['Pokemon Go'] now (laughter)?  (Gesture) Things pop up, and you go this way or that way.  I mean that, my twenties were sort of like that.  It was just, you know, what's going on?  I mean, I read voraciously in my twenties, because I never really got the information in school, and particularly the directions of culture and spirituality and all that.  So, I read a lot to learn about life, and so it was a lot of self teaching.
Story_ID: 664185
Speaker 1: Said you liked being on the scene shooting activities as they--?
Speaker 2: Right, right, being--yeah, being around life, real life.  You know, I've covered demonstrations, movements, social issues.  And, you know, I published a book called 'Portraits of Purpose: A Tribute to Leadership' [Don West and Kenneth J. Cooper], and that came out of my experience as a photographer.  It began in 1997.  The Museum of African American History in Boston [Massachusetts] knew of my work.  I had been around about fifteen years, and they made an offer to me to have an exhibit at that museum.  And in thinking about, well, what should I do; what kind of exhibit should I do?  I just knew that I had experienced many individuals in this town that were trying to make a difference in the value of life here--make it better in housing and health and so forth.  So, I chose--I looked into my archives and I said, "Well, this one, this one, this one."  And a lot who--people didn't know about even; the unsung heroes.  So, I put together about twenty-five individuals.  We had an exhibit at the museum; and we also decided to have a forum where we brought together many of the people who were in the exhibit to talk about their experiences, and to share with people, you know.  And you never had all these people in the same space at the same time before, so it's a very interesting conversation.  It was a standing room only audience we had on a rainy night at the museum, and it made all the newspapers the next day.  It was very successful.  The exhibit was up for a couple of months, and then they said, "Well, let's do it again next year."  I said, "Okay."  I found--looked in the archives again, found twenty-five more folks--did it again.  We did the exhibit, had the forum, and so the exhibit was born, 'Portraits of Purpose'--the exhibit.  And the exhibit was shown in many different places over the years in around--in and around Boston in universities, banks, public spaces.  And in 2011, the Urban League of Boston [Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts] was going to be hosting the national convention for the Urban League [National Urban League]. And it was the first time in thirty years that the Urban League was coming to Boston, mostly because of the reputation of the city being not a very welcoming one for African American folks.  But things had changed to the degree that they felt, "Well, let's have our national convention here in 2011."  And I spoke to the fellow who runs the Urban League here, and I said, "You know, it would be great if we could have 'Portraits of Purpose,' the exhibit there."  We had about sixty, seventy pieces at that point.  I said, "Wouldn't it be great to put a face to the people who--well, to why the change is--how the change came about that you're now here with your convention.  Here were the people that have helped to make that environment of Boston a better place and a more welcoming place."  I said, "Here are the faces."  And so he said, "Yeah, great idea."  And so, we did it.  You know, some ten thousand or more people came here from all over the country.
Story_ID: 664186
Speaker 1: And interestingly enough, on their board here in Boston [Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts, Boston, Massachusetts] was a woman from Eastern Bank [Nancy Huntington Stager].  And she saw the exhibit ['Portraits of Purpose'] and was very impressed by it, and invited me to have that exhibit at their headquarters in Lynn, Massachusetts, which is north of Boston [Massachusetts], and have an internal exhibit because they wanted just their employees to see--because Eastern Bank has been around for over a hundred years or so, but their--and their focus is in the diversity of our communities, and wishing to make the life of people with less opportunity more fortunate.  So, our mission was very connected, because that's what this exhibit is basically about, social justice of--and that's a big term that can cover a lot of different aspects of our societal reality.  So, we have the exhibit, and in that process we talked about--well, you know, this might be nice to have as a book.  They said, "Yeah," and they said, "let's underwrite it and we'll make a book."  And we took two years to do that, and published in 2014.  And now we have the book, 'Portraits of Purpose: A Tribute to Leadership' [Don West and Kenneth J. Cooper].  And I was fortunate enough to get a writer who could embellish the historical background of each of these individuals.  His name is Kenneth J. Cooper, and he's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, African American--the youngest African American, twenty-eight years old, to get a Pulitzer Prize.  He got it as part of a team with The Boston Globe on issues of race in Boston.  So, so, we teamed up and we did that.  And we've been working around Boston, you know, telling people about the book, and doing TV, radio, and community presentations and so forth.
Speaker 2: Is the book, it's a big coffee table book, and?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a nine by twelve [inches] hardcover coffee table type book, black and white photographs, large photographs--I mean they're very strong.  And some background information on all these individuals; and how they interrelated to each other also because many of them worked together here in the city.  So, it's a really interesting insight into how the average person can see something wrong and feel to step up and make a difference.  And that's what a lot of these people are.  We talked about Gloria Fox earlier.  She was just someone living in the projects and saw some problems and stepped up and said let's do something about it.  And she grew in that and became a state representative for a number of years here in Massachusetts; as well as [HistoryMaker] Doris Bunte who was another person, in housing.  She saw something and she became a state rep.  So many--[HistoryMaker] Byron Rushing, others.  Mel King [HistoryMaker Melvin King] is probably the one who's known most as a community activist here in Boston, but he's just, was an average guy saying, you know, let's do something about this.  And so, that's part of what--the book we hope is an inspiration to individuals to know that just because you're the average citizen doesn't mean you can't make a difference, because you can.  And so that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know at one time you were like the official photographer for Mel King's Rainbow Coalition [Rainbow Coalition Party].
Speaker 1: I was.
Speaker 2: And that put you in a position to shoot a lot of other--
Speaker 1: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 2: --people making change in the city.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] came through in that time; [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory.  And I had the greatest, probably the greatest opportunity, was to be Nelson Mandela's photographer--when he was released from prison in South Africa, he went on a world tour, as we all know.  And he came through Boston for a couple of days, and I had that opportunity to be his photographer.  And so, that was a wonderful experience.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He's in the book (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right.
Story_ID: 664187
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite subject of all the subjects you've shot?
Speaker 2: Meaning individuals?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean in terms of the experience, it was probably Mandela [Nelson Mandela].  I mean that was the most dynamic, meaningful experience, to be around that fellow and to shake his hand and to speak to him briefly.  That was probably a high point of my photography career.
Speaker 1: Because when you're around somebody like Mel King [HistoryMaker Melvin King] and Mandela, you're around them for a while, you get a chance to see them interact.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: It's not just the still pictures, of what the public might see, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you get a chance to see how they--
Speaker 2: Right, I see them moving through a whole process of experience.  Particularly the day when Mandela--he started off with a rally at the airport [General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport, Boston, Massachusetts].  I mean--there was a whole great welcoming him there.  The governor was there, the mayor and various elected officials, obviously the black elected officials.  And then we took a tour into Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] and we went to Madison Park High School [Madison Park Technical Vocational High School, Boston, Massachusetts], which was the black high school in Roxbury.  He stopped and talked there.  So, that's--he was connecting to community.  And then from there we went to the Kennedy library [John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Boston, Massachusetts] for this big luncheon with all the movers and shakers in Boston [Massachusetts]--and the Kennedys and so forth.  Stevie Wonder sang that day there.  And probably the interesting part of that was before he actually came down and spoke, we were in sort of a green room, or a holding area, which was part of the museum.  So, there were a lot of interesting artifacts in this room around the Kennedy history.  And all the Kennedys were there--everybody.  I mean, Jackie [Jacquelyn Kennedy Onassis] was alive at that time.  Ted [Edward M. Kennedy], Joe [Joseph P. Kennedy II]--I mean and all of, all of them were there.  And so there were only two photographers in the room: myself and the Kennedy photographer.  So, that was very unique for me, to be able to get--I mean I got pictures with Jackie and Mandela and family, and so forth.  So, that was a very unique moment for me there.  And then we downstairs to the luncheon, and then there was the whole hoop dee doo with that.  And then from there we went to the esplanade [Charles River Esplanade, Boston, Massachusetts], where there's something--thirty thousand people there in this big--what they call the Hatch Memorial Shell, where they do the July 4th big event there.  Well, that's what they had--that's where Mandela went that day.  And that was spectacular, you know, so.  And then it ended up with a fundraiser at a local hotel.  He was pretty pooped by that point, and Winnie [Winnie Mandela] kind of did the evening piece.  But it was a hell of a day.  You know, it was, I mean, he just touched all levels of the city in that day.  And to see his connection and his ability to speak to everybody, and to inspire--and he's a big man.  He's 6'1", and he has big hands, because he used to be a prize fighter.  Well, I don't think he was a prize--but he fought.  He was a fighter.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He was a boxer.
Speaker 2: Boxer, yeah.  And so he--I shook hands with him, and his big hand just dwarfed my hand you know (laughter).  But he was very personable; I mean he could talk to anybody and anybody could talk to him.  And so, he was a great person.  And I had the opportunity in another year to go to South Africa and go to the prison, visit Robben Island [South Africa] and all that.  And so, so I--it was quite a 360.
Story_ID: 664188
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Has travel been a big part of the job?
Speaker 2: To some degree, not of the job, per se.  As a photographer, I've been--I've traveled personally and part of delegations.  My wife has been an arts administrator for a number of years, and she was the president and CEO of the Boston Center for the Arts, which is a major arts organization here in Boston [Massachusetts].  Her name is Libbie Shufro.  And she also, before that job, worked for Accion International, which is a micro lending organization in Latin America.  And she used to take, she was the what, development director there, and she used to take delegations throughout Latin America at different times; and I went along as the photographer.  So, we got to see a lot of Latin America.  And that was part of our travel, but we travel, we loved to travel ourselves.  And so, we've been to various places.  We went on a delegation to Jerusalem.  We've been to China, South Africa, and other parts of Africa.  And so, we've had a good travel experience.  And I've created exhibits from all those trips.  So, if anybody went to my website they would see I have about seven or eight exhibits, including 'Portraits of Purpose.'
Story_ID: 664189
Speaker 1: One of the most famous photographs, or the one that, that I--when I was reading about you and people talked about the most, was the picture of Deval Patrick [HistoryMaker Deval L. Patrick] when--with the hands on him.  You know, describe that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Well, that was the night before his inauguration to be the first African American governor in Massachusetts.  And he went to a local church [Old South Meeting House, Boston, Massachusetts] for a very traditional ceremony, where many different pastors from around the community come together in a moment and place their hands on him to bless him and to give him spiritual powers and support going forward into the job that he's about to do.  And there were many, hundreds of people in this big church that night.  And this was up on a stage, and he was standing there.  And all of these ministers up--eight or nine or ten of them were around him.  And so all of the photographers--I mean there were seven, eight, nine, ten photographers there, and we were all jostling for position and so forth.  And there are pictures from that moment where some photographer just got this broad shot.  But I felt to get right in tight.  And this picture of Deval is a tight shot, right up in his face, and you can see a hand on his shoulder and you can see a cross on the garment of one of the ministers right next to him, and another minister behind--so, it's a very intimate shot.  And his eyes were closed, feeling the spirit.  So, it was the hands on spirit piece that that picture was about.  He then, in his inauguration the next day another unique picture that I don't know how many might have.  But he did his inauguration al fresco, outside the front of the state house [Massachusetts State House] in Boston [Massachusetts], which nobody had ever done before.  And they had this huge stage set up in front of the--and all the elected officials, everybody you can imagine, you know, in the political life was up on that stage.  And I was on a press riser across the street, and I got this wide angle picture that has the state house up (gesture).  And the interesting thing is when he was called to speak, it had been rainy--not rainy, but gray and overcast the whole morning, and a little chilly.  When he came up to speak the sun came out--literally.  I mean, it was just amazing (laughter).  And I got that shot, you know.  You can see the clouds kind of breaking, and the blue of the sky a little bit, and the light, you know, off the dome, the golden dome, and all of this wide stretch of stage and him speaking.  So, that was my wide shot, and then I got a lot of close ups, you know, with the swearing in and all of that.  But it was a very unique experience.  And that's what I really cherished about being a photographer, is to be at events like that, to be where history is being made, and it's been good.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it places you right in the center of it.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, and being around those history makers.
Story_ID: 664190
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you some technical questions here, because photographers will be angry if I don't ask these questions.  And I'm curious, too.  What did you start off shooting with when you decided to become a professional?
Speaker 2: Camera wise?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: An SLR [single lens reflex camera]--Nikon.  Went through a lot of cameras, you know, as newer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was it an F2 back then, or what was it?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, and that was, I have an F2 [Nikon F2].  And I can't even--there was a 20-20 or a 50--I don't know.  There was a lot of different cameras that I've--D90 [Nikon D90] was in there, and.  You know, I would always kind of buy a camera that was going to last me three or four years before the next big wonderful thing comes along, you know.  So I, you know, I always tried to be as up to date as I could be, financially and otherwise.  I mean, initially the cameras I bought--F2 wasn't one of the first cameras I bought.  But it was something--I can't--It was an FM, I think was the first--I think I had an Olympus first, and then I went to the Nikon and I had a FM and an FM2 [Nikon FM2] and an FE [Nikon FE].  But I used to buy lenses in init- early on in pawnshops, because you could get good lenses cheap, you know.  You know, you look at them and you make sure they worked okay.  And look (gesture), you know, to make sure that they're not scratched and so forth.  But I got a lot of lenses in pawnshops.
Speaker 1: Now this--I've heard a lot of people say this.  Now, this is--you know what baffles me?  I'm not a professional photographer.  When I go to buy a lens, I say, well, I'd better go to a pawnshop, because you know I guess all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The real price is expensive.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I figure only the professionals can afford the--
Speaker 2: The big ones, yeah.
Speaker 1: --new lenses; and if the professional's not buying them, who's buying them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but--you're a professional, but you're a poor professional.  You know, I mean freelance, you know, nobody's giving you anything.  You got to go out and get it.  And early on, in the first year or two, that's when I'm talking about, the first year to two, two, three years of starting out.  You know, I had limited money, and so I had to buy what works, certainly.  But I couldn't always afford these thousand dollar lenses and that sort of thing.  So, I looked around, and pawnshops was one of the places I looked, and I found lenses there.  So, that's how I started out.  And as I got more lucrative in my business, I could then buy maybe used lenses rather than pawnshop. But at a regular camera store, I might buy a used lens.  And I've done that often over the years, but I've bought new ones, too--preferably new, because then you know you got the--everything's working okay.
Story_ID: 664191
Speaker 1: And so it's been a combination of used lenses, new lenses, as time went on.  And as more money, I was making more money--I had all of the community health agencies at one point.  I had four or five banks.  You know, the banking industry here in Boston [Massachusetts] at one time, they just kept eating each other up.  So, I mean, there were about like eight banks, but then after a while there was three, because they got--they were eating each other.  And so it was a great--you know, it's been a great business.  It's been an attrition rate, though, over the last four or five years, because digital has changed things quite a bit from film.  Because once digital came in, or got really kind of established, a lot of--particularly community agencies, nonprofits, saw that they could get these point and shoot cameras and do just about as well as they thought the professionals were doing.
Speaker 2: But were they really?
Speaker 1: Well, no, they weren't really, but it was good enough for their newsletters, you see.  But when they had their big galas or something like that, then they'd bring the professional in, because they really wanted, you know, the best quality for that.  But all that incidental stuff they did, they started doing themselves.  And that means we--I and others like me were losing work as a result of that, because we were doing all of that stuff.  So, now instead of doing twenty jobs for an agency in a year, we're doing ten.  And that's happening across the board, you know, in all of the different areas, because everybody is thinking they're a photographer.  And it's getting even worse in that sense, and everybody thinks they're a photographer now.  It's a common statement now: everybody thinks they're a photographer.  But there's--but they're not, and there's a lot that goes into photography, being a photographer.  You know, you got to know how your equipment works, and you've got to know how to see.  And a lot of people just don't know how to see photographs.  They don't--graphically, they don't know what's important to see in a given situation.  They don't know how to see it; what's the angle.  There's a lot of pieces to being a professional that amateurs don't have.
Story_ID: 664192
Speaker 1: You mentioned about three different factors I guess that affect photography.  And I, you know, I mentally gathered them up and I just want to--.  Now, what's more important to you, you think, from your perspective: the equipment you use?  The knowledge of that equipment (laughter)?  Or, the knowledge of how to shoot a picture?  What makes a better photographer?
Speaker 2: In your words: the knowledge of how to shoot a picture--having what we call an eye for a photograph.  What's important, what's interesting?  In other words, you have to see photographs.  And oftentimes when you're doing work on a job of some sort, you kind of, you get the knowledge of what the job is about and what the client wants you to do, but you pre-see what you want to get.  For instance, let's say you're shooting a gala or some--a fun- big fundraiser, and there are certain individuals there, famous individuals, the president of the company--whatever it is.  You've got to pre-think, what is the important pictures?  Because a lot of time, the communications persons in these organizations have no idea of how pictures should be taken.  Once in a while, you come by somebody that's knowledgeable.  Most of the time, there's no instruction to you--I mean, somebody coming to tell you what's important and not important.  You have to ask it yourself to make sure you know, because the end result of the job is you have got to capture the essence of that event.  And the essence often is whoever the celebrity speaker is, with the president of the organization.  You know, there are in- there are kinds of--there are individuals there that are incedent- important to the event, and you've got to get them together and you've got to make it happen.  Because oftentimes you get those pictures in the cocktail reception beforehand.  Because after the whole thing is going and the thing gets over, everybody's--you know, they go like flies, they're gone, or people jump all over them.  If [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte was the speaker, you can't even get next to him afterwards, unless he exits the room real quick.  So, you can't move him and get--so anyway you do all that in the reception.  But oftentimes this one's over here, this one's over here.  You got to make it--you s- you know what you want and you got to make it happen.  And that's a big part of the professional's ability.  And some folks are afraid of big name people.  They're afraid to walk up to them and say, "Come with me," you know.  But you got to be that way.  You've got to know how to do that.  And so, that's all part of that process.  And that's why you're a professional, because you know how to do these things.  You know how to make pictures happen.  You make pictures, you don't take pictures.  You make them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's, that's, that's one of my favorite sayings, is: photographers--professional photographers make pictures.  Amateurs take pictures.  Meaning that the professional envisions--has a vision of what's to happen.  The amateur just takes whatever's in front of them.  They're not thinking, they're just taking.  The professional is envisioning--
Story_ID: 664193
Speaker 1: For instance, if you're, if you're a professional photographer at a baseball game and you have the choice of being in the visitor dugout or the home team dugout, well, where's the home team dugout?  It's on the first base line.  The visitor's on the third base line.  Which one would you pick to take pictures if you had the choice?
Speaker 2: Third base line (laughter).
Speaker 1: Why the third base line?
Speaker 2: Because people are going to score runs, and going to be coming right past you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's, that's--how many times do they get to third base?
Speaker 2: Not very often.
Speaker 1: So, that's--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I don't get (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 1: --there's nothing happening on third base, really.  What's happening is first base and second base.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: So, you want to be on the first base line, because you can get these great shots of them going past you onto--you know, stepping onto the base, or the guy tagging him, or something like that.  Or, the throw down to second when the guy goes to second.  So, it's a better shot there, as well as you've got the outfield.  You've got centerfield and right field a little better angle, because over here on the third base line, you've basically only got left field.  You can't really get center field too good, and right field's out of the question for the most part.  So, it's the first base line.  So, I'm saying that to say when you come into a situation, where's the best place to shoot and get what you want?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That would be the best place to shoot most of the batters, too.  Because they're right handed, and they'd be facing you if you look down the line.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  I unders- okay.
Speaker 1: So--but the point is, where is the best place to shoot?  What is the angle?  What is the best place to shoot to get the shot that you want?  Because that's making--you're thinking about making the shot.  You already envision what the shot is, so where, how do I get it?  I walk in a room.  What's the best shot here?  Oh, it's that over there.  Okay, how do I do that?  How do I make that happen?  It's not like you sit back and, oh, geez, it's not there, and you walk away.  You know, you don't think to make it happen.  You need this guy over--[HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte over here with the president.  And the president--so you get them--you make them come together as best you can.  I'm not saying that that always is perfect, because it doesn't always happen the way you want it to happen.  But you certainly need to know that it needs to happen (laughter).
Speaker 2: Have you ever been in a situation where you just couldn't get the people (mumbles)--
Speaker 1: It's happened.
Speaker 2: --together?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But I'm pretty aggressive.  And having been in this town for so long, most people know me at all of these different levels.  So, when I go over to Deval Patrick [HistoryMaker Deval L. Patrick] and I say, "Come over here," he'll come over here with me, the governor.  Or if, you know, even with Nelson Mandela--I don't think Nelson Mandela, I told him to go anywhere (laughter).  But I would tell people to go where he is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's an interesting scenario that happened this week where Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] and Donald Trump [Donald John Trump] debated and they never--
Speaker 1: Shook hands.
Speaker 2: --you know, shook hands.  But the next night--
Speaker 1: They shook hands.  Isn't that?
Speaker 2: --they shook hands; and so, whoever was shooting there--
Speaker 1: Was right on the mark.
Speaker 2: got--yeah, was--
Speaker 1: You see, that's the other part, is that you really have to be totally alert all the time when you're in those kind of circumstances as a photographer.  There's no looking away or--you know.  You know where the action is, you've got to be--it's like tunnel vision.  You got to be right on it, because you know anything can happen.  And you--and get that right picture, you know.  There's a picture we--the Boston Press Photographers [Boston Press Photographers Association] have an exhibit up right now at the Boston Center for Adult Education [Boston, Massachusetts].  And there's one picture there (laughter) that is shot--there's a podium like this (gesture), and it's shot up like this.  And above the podium it says Trump.  And the way he's standing behind the podium, you can't see his head.  All you can see is hands out on both sides of the podium.  And to me it says, empty suit (laughter) because it says Trump right at the top, (gesture) podium--so, so, but that's angle, you see.  That's thinking about it.  What can be exciting about this, you see?  And you're waiting for somebody to--oftentimes you're waiting for them to do something.  You're right there, and sometimes you're getting--oh, do something.  Do something, you know (laughter).  And they finally do it.  A hand will go up, or they'll do this (gesture).  And that's what that guy did with--catching them shaking hands.  He probably thought, are they going to shake hands?  That was a natural thought for a photographer to have.  Here they were sitting on both sides of that--cardinal [Timothy Dolan], or whoever he was--the religious leader there.  They were on both sides of him.  And so the whole time when they're in the room and sitting there, you're going to think, are they going to shake hands?  And then they did (gesture), and you got it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, that's thinking.  That's making a picture.

Speaker 1: Now, what were you shooting with back in the days?  Were you shooting with a Tri-X [Kodak Tri-X] mainly--
Speaker 2: Tri-X, yeah.
Speaker 1: --back in the film days?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Tri-X.  And I forgot what the color film--and chrome.  But I didn't shoot chrome that much, because the nature of my work and where it was going in the newspapers and so forth didn't--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --didn't need chrome.  They--black and white or color.  And then as color started to creep in more, you know, papers were using color more, then I'm using Fuji.  I think I was shooting a lot of Fuji, Fuji color.  And then when digital came along, it was kind of crappy at first, you know, but it got, was getting better and better.  And about the year 2000 is when I switched totally, because my clients were asking more for digital images than they were for print images.  Because everything was now traveling through emails and FTPs [File Transfer Protocol] and so forth, and so I was scanning the negatives.  And the quality of the scan of the negatives was not then equaling the quality I would get out of a digital camera.  So I said, nope, later for this.  I can't scan, I got to get this camera.  And so that's when I sold my Mamiya and a couple of others and started to get the digital camera.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you shoot with now?
Speaker 2: Well, digital, Nikons, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And there's certainly plenty to choose from.  I mean, it's expanded so much.  I mean, one of the great things about digital is its ability to shoot at different ASAs at the same time, I mean right within a circumstance.  Whereas before, you'd have to have different films for different ASAs.  If you were outside, you maybe wanted a 200 ASA or a 400.  But then when you get inside, you'd want 1600, and--because you need more speed in the film to get the lower light.  And it didn't go much above 1600, because quality after that--and there wasn't much available I don't think over 1600.  But now, you can go up to 3200, fifty, 6400 ASA, you know; and the ability to do it right there in the same--you don't have switch anything.  You just switch the ASA and the camera, and the digital takes care of it for you.  And the cameras now, you know, you can shoot 3200 ASA, it's like shooting 200 in film, you know.  I mean, there's no gradation.  There's no pixilation or anything.  It's perf- it's great.  So, and for portrait photographers, digital is wonderful, because what you see--what you shoot, you see it right away, so you can make adjustments very easily.  In the old days with film, you made sure your, you had your light meter, and you did all of the things, but you never knew whether you got the shot or not until it came back from the lab.  And there was a lot of praying sometimes (laughter) that you got the shot.  In terms of portraits, yeah, you know, you'd bracket--two--I mean you do all the things to make sure you got the shot as a professional.  And if you were shooting news stuff, (snaps fingers) that's happening like that, then you just pray that you got the shot.  Because, you know, sometime you don't have all the time to make the right adjustment or the right aperture.  I mean, light changes, people change, move around, so--and you got to be quick.  Imagine the days, the sports photographers before automatic focus came in.  It was called follow focus, and you'd have to manually follow a player coming down the field, and keep him in focus manually.  Now, automatic focus (snaps fingers) does it automatically, and you ge- so you get shots now that you had difficulty with before.  But I used to admire these guys who could do follow focus flawlessly.  There weren't many that could do that.  It was a real skill--to be able to keep in focus something that was moving.  So, that's the interesting change from manual photography to more automatic photography.  And also, when you get to frames per second--that also allows you to get stuff that you couldn't get when you could only do one frame a second, two frames a second.  Now you can do fifteen frames a second, or something like that.  So in sports photography (makes sounds) (gesture)--so, one of those is going to be a good shot (laughter).  So, it's a different way of--a different approach.  And it's helpful, it's helpful to the photographer, because you can do more now.
Story_ID: 664195
Speaker 1: Now, is there, is there something new in photography that you're--that you want to try at this point that you haven't tried yet?
Speaker 2: Well, I think video, actually I'm thinking about.  Video is something that I've--and video and filmmaking was never something that I was interested in.  I liked still images and the ability to capture moments.  I still like that, but I'm experimenting now with the idea of video.  And partially I think I'm thinking of that because clients are looking for that now.  Because with the Internet, it's--still images are kind of waning in value.  It's more the video, the moving image now that is more desired by clients and by people who watch, who look.  Still images are fading a little bit.  So, I'm thinking that way in terms of, you know, what's my next step in my business?  Because I'm kind of moving away from the business I've been doing for all these years, which is still images and clients and all that sort of thing.  And so I'm trying to think about, well, what is my next step?  You know, I like traveling, I like capturing people in their environments and their struggle and so forth.  And I'm not a conflict photographer; I don't want to get myself shot, you know, and I know a lot of guys like that.  But, and that's where the money is often.  By being a conflict--you make money that way, because you're doing something nobody else wants to do, and you're putting your life in danger.  And I don't feel to put my life in danger for a photograph.  So, I'm not that committed to photography that I would die for it.
Story_ID: 664196
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite photographer?
Speaker 2: Sebastiao Salgado.  Do you know who he is?  He is a Brazilian photographer who, he's about my age now.  And he's done really the whole range of photography, commercial work.  But his real heart of his work is the human experience.  And he's published a number of books.  Name is spelled S-E-B-A-S-T-I-A-O, Sebastiao Salgado, S-A-L-G-A-D-O.  He just put out a film ['The Salt of the Earth'] about a year or so ago that his son [Juliano Ribeiro Salgado] and another fellow [Wim Wenders] put together about his life, about Sebastiao's life, and how he is coming to a decision point about what he's going to do next.  Because he's covering--he's been a conflict photographer, he's been in all the nasty places in the world.  But he's also documented workers throughout the--he has a book called 'Workers' ['Workers: An Archaeology of the Industrial Age,' Sebastiao Salgado], and it's workers throughout the world.  And one of the interesting pieces is what he did in, I think it's the Brazilian gold mines, coal mines.  Okay, I'm not remembering.  But it's pictures of--it's this deep pit that these guys are going down into and pulling up these packets over their shoulder of--it's either gold or coal.  I don't think it's coal, I think it's gold.  But it's a very dirty job, and they're all covered in mud and so forth and they're ri- they're climbing these long ladders; and visually it's a fantastic vision.  So he's, but he's been in all kinds of countries and he's shown workers of all different kinds--how they work with their hands and so forth.  So, he's been a documenter of the human experience at all levels.  But now he's been in conflict.  He was in Rwanda, and he just saw the devastation physically of people there--the murder of all those folks and so forth.  And he just couldn't take it anymore, and he says--and then he's putting his attention towards global warming and the climate and the environment.  And he's taking pictures around that now.  And he's a person who's worked with Leicas a lot through his career--those good old M6s [Leica M6] and so forth.  And so I admire him a lot for what he's done, and his ability to--the kind of pictures he takes.  He's still working in black and white, and a lot of these books that I'm mentioning are black and white.  And black and white really has a tendency to really be very specific, you know, in the image, because you're not, you're not distracted by color.  And so, your graphic sense is very important, because that's how you really learn photography.  Usually you learn by shooting black and white, not color.  And what that does is allow you to understand what lines are, and how they intersect--what, how the graphic view is--what it is that you look at, and how to place it and how to construct it.  Whereas, color can, has another whole world to it; I mean, the way of using it.  But you need the fundamentals of what black and white can teach you about revision and about composition, and so forth.  And he's pretty much stuck with that black and white throughout, because he--there's a starkness about his approach to the subjects that he photographs.  And black and white has a, has a certain strength in that way.  So, he's one that stands out.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a--I was reminded when you mentioned his name--I don't know if there's any relationship to this, but there's a movie called 'City of God' about a Brazilian kid who grows up to become a photographer in the favela.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know that--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's--so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's--I wish I could remember the name.  If you Google him, you'll see this film that just came out in the last couple of years.  Because it--it goes the breadth of his experience and his insights, and what--how he, why he does what he does.
Story_ID: 664197
Speaker 1: I've debated this with people before.  Some people think that--I mean why--I mean, I've been at an event with a camera.  And I've got a friend in Dayton [Ohio], she's from South Africa, she's been here for years.  She--they call her mama paparazzi; she shoots everything.  And people ask, "Well, why?  Why do you shoot everything?"  You know, she's really good, but she does it for just the community.  But people say, "Well, why shoot a picture of an event?  Why can't you just experience it?"  Well, why shoot?  Have you ever been asked that?  I mean now, you're a professional, that's why you're shooting.  But would you shoot if you weren't?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm thinking that way now.  I mean, I've been called in Boston [Massachusetts] the community chronicler.  I kind of like to think of myself as a visual griot, because I've been documenting people's lives all these years, one way or the other--whoever hires me, you know.  But, and I still kind of feel the desire to make vis- make visible that which is not visible.  I mean, there's a lot of events and things that are going on in the community that people never hear about and never see.  And I do have access to publications, particularly the Bay State Banner.  And so I--when I see events happening in Boston that I know is not going to be in the Banner, but yet would be interested--that the people who read the Banner would be interested in a particular event or situation, I go out and I shoot it; and I don't do it for money.  I just do it because I want to do it, and I--and because I like to be there myself and hear what's being said or seen, or whatever.  I--so, that's part of my own development, my own experience.  But I like to then take it to the next level of letting a lot of other people see it.  So, I'm--I feel like I'm a window for people to see parts of their world that they don't necessarily see, because I think that's what photographers are.  They're windows.  They--they construct windows that allow other people to see things that they wouldn't ordinarily see.
Story_ID: 664198
Speaker 1: Now, have you been included in anthologies with other black photographers, or any other photographers?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I might be, but I'm, I don't know.  If you Google me, you won't see me in any anthologies (laughter), so.  My friend here that you met this morning, Hakin, he's been around for thirty years doing this stuff.
Speaker 1: What's his last name?
Speaker 2: Raquib, R-A-Q-U-I-B.
Speaker 1: Hakin Raquib [Hakin Raquib].
Speaker 2: He pronounces it (pronunciation) Raquib.  I pronounce it Raquib.  But he was a commercial photographer for many years, and he was a master in the darkroom, and--toning prints and so forth.  And I introduced him to digital printing and Photoshop and all that.  And initially he thought it was nice, but he wasn't really interested.  He liked to go in the darkroom and do--with the chemicals and all that stuff.  But when I started showing him how quickly you could do different things with Photoshop, it interested him.  And finally he's gone head and shoulders into digital photography.  And he's the kind of guy that he goes head and shoulders into whatever he does; he goes deep with it.  And so, you saw some of his work here.
Speaker 1: Yeah he has beautiful work, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he does beautiful work.  And he's become more of a painter, so to speak.  He's taken the photography--but he, it's the eye, it's all about the eye.  It's not the medium necessarily, it's the ability to see something and reproduce it.  And so, he's reproducing now his vision, his inner vision more so now.  Because with Photoshop, you can do anything.  If you can envision it, you can do it, which in the old days you couldn't necessarily do that.  And it was very hard to do that because you're going through chemical process.  You know, you make a print and you look at it at the end of the--oh, that's not quite right.  Imagine what Ansel Adams used to go through to make those prints that he's--I'm sure he went through the trays quite a few time before he got the right one that he wanted.  So, it's a much more difficult process.  And it's a much easier process now, which really allows more creativity to come up, bubble up and, and be realized.  So, I think that's the really great side of the digital revolution.
Story_ID: 664199
Speaker 1: Tell us something about the space that we're in now.  Your studio is here, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, we're in a building now that's owned by Northeastern University in Boston [Massachusetts].  And some thirty years ago, in collaboration with an African American artist, they started an organization called the African American Master Artists in Residence Program at Northeastern.  And what it--its value was to bring professional black artists together, of all different stripes of artists, to support them in their work by giving them studio space.  And in return for that they would be available to the university for various--connections with students and the public and so forth as educators and supporters of the arts.  And so, this has been going on for, as I say, about thirty years, almo- no, I'm sorry, it's almost forty years.  I've lost track of time.  I've been a member probably twenty years or so myself.  And we've been in different places.  We were on the campus for a while, but now we're in--we're not on campus, we're off campus in a part of Jamaica Plain [Boston, Massachusetts], and we have two floors of studio and gallery space.  And we're--we have exhibits here.  We do community work here.  We have young students come in and do artwork, and we work with them.
Story_ID: 664200
Speaker 1: This is a question we always ask: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, equity (laughter) would be the first word.  Justice, opportunity, peace--those are some of the words I would choose to work towards those things.  And that's what I've tried to do with photography: to illuminate all of those abili- those possibilities just by the way I shoot.  You mentioned that you had seen the Frederick Douglass exhibit ['Picturing Frederick Douglass: The Most Photographed American of the 19th Century'] at the Museum of African American History in Boston [Massachusetts].  And it's a very interesting exhibit in the sense that he, I guess next to [President] Abraham Lincoln, was the most photographed individual in the 1800s.  And he had a very, he made a very conscious choice to be photographed, and in a certain way.  Because what he was trying to do was to give a new sense of who the black person, or African American was after slavery and around those times.  Because a race of people had been so denigrated and made to feel worthless that they needed--something needed to change there.  Because those individuals found--I think slaves found themselves the victim of circumstance that they couldn't get out of.  And finally with emancipation, they had some opportunity to move into a better direction.  And so, Douglass saw that as an opportunity.  He saw photography, which was also evolv- emerging and birthing at that time, as a tool to change the perception of who black people are through images.  And that grew over the years.  You may know of the film, 'Through a Lens Darkly' ['Through a Lens Darkly: Black Photographers and the Emergence of a People'].  That was a wonderful film which really showed the desire of African American folk to change their image and make--and let them be what they really felt inside, by dressing up and coming into a studio and looking wonderful.  I mean this is how any individual would feel, want to feel, about themselves.  And so, photography offered that opportunity to change image from being to growing into the light, you might say.  And that film of 'Through a Lens Darkly' went through after slavery up to the present time.  And a lot of photographers emerged out of that process, as James Van Der Zee in New York [New York], and [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks, and a number of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) P.H. Polk.
Speaker 2: --yeah, a number of photographers.  And they documented their communities, you know.  And they, they showed the good and the bad, but they showed that these are people just like everybody else.  And that's the mantle I kind of adopted as I went into photography too.  I think I feel to be in that pantheon of photographers who have tried to make the community feel and look better, and be perceived in a much more positive light.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I think that's [HistoryMaker] Deborah Willis--
Speaker 2: Deborah Willis, yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, the 'Through a Lens Darkly.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: She's a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --historian of black photography basically (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Story_ID: 664201
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your children.  You've got two--you still have two daughters (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have two daughters [Elyssa West and Erica West].  They're quite grown now.  They're both slightly over fifty [years old] (laughter).  And the oldest has a son, so I have a grandson [Royce West].  And he's been very--children prolific.  He's got four children himself, so I'm a great-grandfather, I believe, yeah, as well.  And they live, he lives in California in Oakland.  And both of my daughters live here in Boston [Massachusetts] and work, and are here.  So, it's nice.  You know, as I mentioned earlier when I--about 1978 or so when I went out to California to work to be next to them, you know, to get closer to them; and then they came back here in about 1982.  And so, we've been around each other for quite a few years now.  So, it's been a good experience, and they're doing well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any artists in the family?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really--other than my grandson, my daughter's son, has a penchant towards music and hip hop, and writing beats and all that sort of thing.  He started out doing that a little bit, but it's a little hard to make any kind of living at that because he has children.  So, he's, he has a job and works and so forth.  So, his art side of his life is a little, you know, not so opportune for him right now.
Story_ID: 664202
Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to cover before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No.  We've pretty well covered most everything.  I think we've done a pretty good job.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, the last--there's two.  It's a kind of combined last question.  What today would you consider to be your legacy?  And sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the most concrete legacy that I have is the book that I just published, 'Portraits of Purpose' ['Portraits of Purpose: A Tribute to Leadership,' Don West and Kenneth J. Cooper] because that really speaks to my intention of all these years of photography.  I mean that's of value, and it's of concrete value; and it pays tribute to people who have been concerned and committed to a better life for themselves and their community.  And that's my commitment as well, in the way that I can do it.  And so I think somebody said, I just would like to be known as I tried to help somebody (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well thank you very much.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: --of Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], shot from the Lincoln Memorial towards the Capitol building [U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.].  And we can see all the people there at the Washington Monument [Washington, D.C.], and we can see the jumbotron showing Obama taking the oath of office.
Speaker 2: This is a poster for an exhibit on Cuba ['Cuba Caribe'] that I did recently.  This is the group of people who were in that exhib- artists who showed in that exhibit of Cuba.  All these individuals, including myself, had been to Cuba at some point.  And so, it was potpourri of photographers.  And was very interesting, because it was black and white and color, and it had been shot at different times.
Speaker 1: Can you name them from left to right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is my mother and father: Claude West on the left and Elise West [Elise Thurston West] on the right.
Speaker 1: This is a shot of me just taking a shot of something--of a picture of some sort.
Speaker 2: This is my grandson.  His name is Royce, R-O-Y-C-E--Royce West.  This was taken in California.
Speaker 1: This was taken at the Bay State Banner's fortieth anniversary of the newspaper.  And I had in the lobby of the hotel an exhibit in black and white of various news pictures I had taken over the years.  So, I chose to stand in front of Mandela [Nelson Mandela] to have my picture taken.  That's the picture I took of Mandela.
Speaker 2: This is my wife Libbie [Libbie Shufro] at that same event.
Speaker 1: This is me and my two daughters, who I have my arms around.  And this was with a friend on the left hand side, with the reddish hair.  To my right is my daughter Erica [Erica West], or her nickname is Tavi, T-A-V-I.  And the daughter on my left side is Elyssa, E-L-Y-S-S-A [Elyssa West].
Speaker 2: And that's happy me, working (laughter)--glad to be working at an event.  And you can see it was a Nikon (laughter).
Speaker 1: And this is my daughter Tavi at the reception for the release of my book, 'Portraits of Purpose' ['Portraits of Purpose: A Tribute to Leadership,' Don West and Kenneth J. Cooper].  The woman in the background on the photographic left is Jill Jackson [ph.], who was the public relations person for me on that.  And the person behind my shoulder is my cousin, Akoula Wheaton [ph.].
Speaker 2: And this is my wife and my two girls at that same event.
Speaker 1: And my two girls at that same event.
Speaker 2: And this is my wife's family.  I won't identify everybody in the family, but my two daughters are there in the front.  And her brother--she has two brothers who are behind her, and her mother which is in front of her.  And the gentleman sitting there is the father of the woman standing to the right of him, who is the wife of one of her brothers.
Speaker 1: And that's me back in the '60s [1960s] (laughter).
Speaker 2: And that's me back in the earlier '60s [1960s].  And that was when we had the Folklore Center [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And that's where I was standing, in front of the window.  We did a three day hootenanny in benefit of Children's Hospital [Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts].  So, we went twenty-four hours a day for three days.  And that was me, just playing on one of those days.
Speaker 1: And that's--we've seen that.  And it kind of explains now.  Underneath, there's a caption underneath there on this one.
Speaker 2: This is me with Mo Cowan [HistoryMaker William "Mo" Cowan], who is the gentleman who replaced Ted Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy] temporarily as senator.  That's his wife [Stacy Cowan] standing next to him.  And to my left is Deborah Jackson, the president of Cambridge College here in the Boston [Massachusetts] area.  We had an exhibit at the Cambridge College, and I gave this picture to Mo as a present, and he's now in my--part of my 'Portraits of Purpose' although he didn't make the book.  He--see, the exhibit is ongoing, so we're still moving that forward.  And the book is just a benchmark, really.
Speaker 1: And this is me and my two daughters.
Speaker 2: This was President Obama's birthday a number of years ago in his first term.  He was here in Boston celebrating it, and just a little quick blowing out of the candle there.  I was his photographer for his campaign during the first time around.
Speaker 1: I don't know why this picture got in here three times.
Speaker 2: This is the--for the national campaign?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah. It was the first time around.
Speaker 2: This is me at University of Massachusetts [University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, Massachusetts] speaking on my exhibit, 'Portraits of Purpose,' which you can see two of the images behind me there.
Speaker 1: This is at Northeastern [Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts] speaking to a group of students.  And I had my exhibit up in this, which is called the 360 gallery [Gallery 360].
Speaker 2: This is a picture of the cover, both front and back of the 'Portraits of Purpose' book.
Speaker 1: This is the exhibit up at the Museum of African American History [Boston, Massachusetts], very interesting gallery there in terms of how you--the visuals of how you see things.
Speaker 2: This is my--journalist, writer, Ken Cooper [Kenneth J. Cooper], to my right, at the community launch of the book.  We did two launches.  We did one for the bank at the Boston Public Library [Boston, Massachusetts]; and then we did a second one in no- the first one was October 29th, and then we did a second one in the community at Hibernian Hall [Boston, Massachusetts] on about, I think it was November 8th of 2014.  So, we were signing books here.
Speaker 1: And this was probably a wonderful moment for me; I was being introduced to speak.  This is Nancy Stager [Nancy Huntington Stager], the woman at the bank, Eastern Bank, who was really responsible for the book happening.
Speaker 2: And that's me and she, Nancy Stager.
Speaker 1: This is again back at University of Massachusetts.  And this is--the big fellow there is Chancellor Keith Motley [J. Keith Motley].  And this was at a presentation of the exhibit there, and these are various staff members here.  I don't know all their names.
Speaker 2: This is a typical card that I use as a business promotion.  The picture was taken in Argentina in Buenos Aires on a Sunday afternoon in the bohemian section where everyone comes out and--painters and artists, dancers and musicians, you know, and just have a--like Washington Square [Washington Square Park] in New York [New York], you know, that sort of thing, on a Sunday afternoon.  Or what used to be (laughter) back in the '60s [1960s] anyway.  And I just kind of played with the photograph a little bit and made it a black and white, but kept the red of the sweater.
Speaker 1: These are my UPI, United Press International buddies.  I won't name them all, but they're all photographers.  And you'll notice that they're all different ages here, too.  All have done some great work in one way or another.
Speaker 2: And these are the same guys in a different picture.
Speaker 1: And nice one with one of my daughters, Elyssa.
