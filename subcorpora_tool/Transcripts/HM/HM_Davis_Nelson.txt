Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Nelson Davis, Jr. N-E-L-S-O-N, D-A-V-I-S [HistoryMaker Nelson Davis] and Jr. is always the same.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a middle name?
Speaker 2: Interestingly enough, I do.  Lee-Earnest, sort of a hyphenated middle name.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: L-E, the way I spell it is L-E-E, hyphen, E-A-R-N-E-S-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story behind Lee-Earnest?
Speaker 2: I wish I knew.  That one I don't know.  My father was Nelson, Sr. [Nelson Davis, Sr.], but the Lee-Earnest part was in his name, wound up in my name on the birth certificate.  I probably asked at some point because it's an unusual middle name and I'm not sure of the story I was given at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth.
Speaker 2: Born in Watley's Quarter [ph.] of Andalusia, Alabama, October 6th, 1942.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was back there for a family reunion two years ago and this gives a sense of thinking of then and now as to how the South has evolved.  I say Watley's Quarter because in those days a town like Andalusia, which was about oh, at the--eleven thousand people, parts with unpaved roads.  We lived in, I was born in what was called the shotgun shack.  You know, a shotgun shack defined by a place where you could shoot a shotgun in the front door and the pellets would go out the back door and not touch anything.  And it had no plumbing, no indoor plumbing, icebox, outhouse, et cetera, as did my uncle's house right across the road.  That was 1942.  I was brought into this world by a midwife as is listed on my birth certificate and my mother [Lorean Spears Davis] didn't give birth in a hospital.  And to youngsters today, that's quite a radical thought, but some are back to using midwives, of course thinking that's a better idea.  But the changes in the progress demonstrated by what I just outlined as the 1942 scene in Watley's Quarter in Andalusia.  Going back there two years ago, that would make it 2006, the shack or the house is torn down.  It's, that property is now the front yard of a school that was built in Watley's Quarter.  The road is paved now.  My uncle's house, what was Uncle Frank's [ph.] house across the street, which now has indoor plumbing, (unclear) with electricity, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and the, the cherry on the cake is that when my father died, we sold the property around there, but they had the good sense in that little southern town to name it after my father.  It's now Davis Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a businessman.  I happen to be in the television, production and marketing business, but, so I call myself a businessman since I've been in--two parallel lines in my life.  I've been in electronic media since I was probably nineteen years old, and always in electronic media, but I've always had other business, most of the time, had other business interests as a parallel line.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Today's date?
Speaker 2: Oh, today's date is the 18th of September, two, double o, eight [2008], twenty 'o eight [2008].
Speaker 1: Where are we at this present time?
Speaker 2: We're sitting in an interesting place.  We're in Los Angeles, California at 5800 Sunset Boulevard, and we're sitting on about a five acre piece of land that is the site of the very first Warner Brothers movie studio [Old Warner Brothers Studio].  And, in fact, we're sitting in a building that goes back to the 1930s.  And the building behind us here was the birth place of the Road Runner and those cartoons from Chuck Jackson [sic. Chuck Jones], the Warner Bros. cartoons [Warner Bros. Cartoons, Inc.] that people still watch today and feel are classics.  The late Chuck Jones was here one day and told me that they had a nickname for the building right behind us called Termite Towers [sic. Termite Terrace] because that's where the animators worked.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  That's good history.  I'm glad you--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: We were in the Charlie Chaplin Studio [Jim Henson Company Lot, Los Angeles, California] earlier this week.
Speaker 2: Oh, down on La Brea [Avenue], sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 441575
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --there are five lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions that I am compelled to ask--
Speaker 2: Fine.
Speaker 1: --you by management, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Makes sound), I'll name two.  My favorite dessert is sweet potato pie, and the favorite food that I can eat day after day after day is anything green.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, autumn, fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes, Napa Valley [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) One that I speak in my self-talk, and sometimes share with other people, and that is, enough talking, let's get it done.
Story_ID: 441576
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) an- and your father's [Nelson Davis, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Lorean, L-O-R-E-A-N, Spears, S-P-E-A-R-S [Lorean Spears Davis].  My mom was born in the panhandle of Florida [Florida Panhandle].  As a child, came to the area around Andalusia, Alabama.  There's a bunch of small towns there, Opp [Alabama], and so forth and so on.  Born in the early 1900s.  I should have looked it up, 1907 I think.  She passed away in 1994, in July at the age of eighty-six.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace that, that line?
Speaker 2: The--my mother's side, comes from a line of marriage between her mom--no that's on my dad's side.  My mother's side I don't know as much about her line as I do my father's side.  But, so her sisters and then there were my uncles and so forth I met many of over the years and spent time with.  A couple of them were early mentors.  Her mother, Pauline [Pauline Spears (ph.)], my--is my grandmother whom I knew.  She lived in Montgomery, Alabama.  I used to--at the age of five I would go to her house in the summer from Niagara Falls [New York] and she had stamps, old stamps I remember in the--on envelopes in the attic, and that gave me an interest in stamp collecting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories from the family of the days of slavery or Reconstruction or, or--?
Speaker 2: A couple of things that I keep as reminders of where we came from, and this is inclusive of both sides, my father's side, Camille [Camille Davis], his mother, was really mostly Seminole Indian [Native American], and my father came from her, Camille, and King Davis, who, who, as a child, lived on a plantation.
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask you about your father's side--first but I wanted to ask out about your mother side (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Back on mother's side still?
Speaker 1: Yeah, before we--
Speaker 2: So my mother's side, a total of seven children: three girls, four boys.  She was the last survivor in the Spears family.  My grandmother, who I mentioned, Pauline, her--she died in the--1952 in Montgomery, Alabama, and the antecedents, their folks I don't know a great deal about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did your mother's parents own their land or did they sharecrop or what did they, what did they do?
Speaker 2: On my--my grandmother Pauline was a domestic, and that took her from Andalusia to Montgomery, Alabama, and that's where she died, that's where she bought a house and worked as a domestic and then retired.
Story_ID: 441577
Speaker 1: So are there any, any stories from your [maternal] grandparents that are passed down about what life was like in Montgomery [Alabama] in those days?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And it would soon be the scene of a lot, one of the fir- the first great struggle in the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: That's so true.  As I went back t- a couple of years ago looking at addresses and driving around and so forth and so on, my grandmother [Pauline Spears (ph.)] lived not far from the bus line.  That was the subject of the bus boycott that came a little later in that decade.  As I said, she left in 1952 and that was around 1955, '6 [1956], yeah, for the bus boycott.  But there's so much history in Montgomery that has to do with the Confederacy and so forth and so on, so Montgomery has this confluence of historic things.  It was the county seat, Covington County [Alabama], and so though I was born in Andalusia, Alabama, my birth was really registered to the county seat in Montgomery.  There are a variety of churches, but I don't have any unusual stories except I have memories of the train station [Montgomery Union Station and Train Shed] in Montgomery.  Some of the monuments to Jefferson Davis, always, you know, paid attention to anything with the Davis name on it, and eventually I did meet Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] when he was a reverend and not doctor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you attended, did you attend the church, the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church [Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I didn't attend.  I visited Dexter.  It was not--because I was living in Niagara Falls [New York].  I was born in Andalusia, grew up in Niagara Falls, but would go back a couple of times in the summer to visit.  And so Martin Luther King and our pastor in Niagara Falls at the New Hope Baptist Church were friends.  So Martin Luther King was starting to raise money for what would grow into a movement so he came to visit our church in Niagara Falls when I was about--
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: --ten or eleven years old.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's when they were forming the Montgomery Improvement Association and that sor- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  All right.  You know, it's curious the way that those churches face the state capitol [Alabama State Capitol, Montgomery, Alabama] and the justice department--the Department of Justice of the State of Alabama.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I never knew that until I went there to see it.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: That they're right, they're facing the, you know, the, the seat of government for the state.
Speaker 2: Montgomery is kind of a small city as you know, but the way the streets and so forth got laid out and the history of the place is fascinating.
Story_ID: 441578
Speaker 1: Did your mother talk about grow- now did she grow up in Montgomery [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Andalusia [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Andalusia, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Which is a town of about eleven thousand.  She worked as a domestic, and in the common parlance of the time, the phrase was, what you doing.  My mother had a nickname.  Her name is Sweet Lorean [Lorean Spears Davis], but they called her sweet because of her disposition.  And she worked as a domestic also and the common term at the time was worked in the white folks' houses.  And, but she was, she learned a great deal from the people she worked for.  She, in formal schooling, had around seven years of formal schooling, but she liked books, she was excellent with people and she always learned from people.  One of the lessons of growing up for me was my mother saying, "Watch what the smart people do. Watch what other people do. There's lessons to be learned there."  And that's how she got a lot of her education.  She loved nice things.  When growing up in Niagara Falls [New York], we lived in a public housing project [Center Court], but my mother always knew good from bad as to the sort of grades of things.  When it was decided that we were gonna get a television set, she said, "Stromberg Carlson."  That's the one she wanted.  When it got time to get a washing machine, she said, "Maytag, that's the one I want," et cetera, et cetera. So--
Speaker 1: You're speaking to something that's largely unspoken about in the black community, but it's a cultural transference from, you know, working for white pe- people that can afford to hire help--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and observing everything that they do and transferring it back to the black community.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Oh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In matter of taste and everything--
Speaker 2: --my mother was great at that.
Speaker 1: --(unclear).
Speaker 2: She mentioned it often because as a person of limited formal education, travel, what, travel was the Florida Panhandle, Alabama and then being moved after the war [World War II, WWII] to Niagara Falls.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that kind of job afforded you a window onto another, a larger world.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She learned to cook, learned to cook to other people's tastes, learned about clothing and nice things and music and books, yeah, very much so.  I'm delighted by the fact that she, (laughter) you know when you come from a small town and, and some people in the family had been sharecroppers and out working the land, picked cotton, others that moved a little further north worked tobacco, and so forth, you learned what my father [Nelson Davis, Sr.] used to call, you learned to hustle, you know.  You make something out of nothing some days.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did she have any stories that she shared with you about those days in Andalusia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I mean--if I had--
Speaker 1: --or, or did you get the general sense of how she felt about life there in Andalusia?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In the family, and it was common our family on that side, a number of them died from tuberculosis.  TB was--probably took two or three of the folks on both sides of the family as a matter of fact.  Large families you know seven or eight kids and they died of various and sundry things, not died in childbirth but they, some died fairly young.  So my mother defined a great deal of her young life there by A, thinking of perhaps going to, moving to another place, taking the lesson she'd learned, and because they had lost, she lost a couple of her siblings fairly early on to TB, she wanted to get away from Andalusia.
Story_ID: 441579
Speaker 1: Let me move on to your father now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Ca- your father's name is the same as yours, right?
Speaker 2: Nelson Lee-Earnest Davis [Nelson Davis, Sr.], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when was he born?
Speaker 2: Nineteen 'o four [1904].
Speaker 1: And where?
Speaker 2: Born also in Andalusia [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now once again what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace it?
Speaker 2: Oh, the--people before his mother, Camille [Camille Davis], and his father King [King Davis], don't know much about.  I mean, we have traced a family tree.  It's on paper, back a generation before, just from public records, but those are not people that I knew and they're not people about whom a bunch of meaningful stories were told.  But my grandfather, King, left the family pretty early on.  He was a classic southern player to some degree, but the stories about him are so crystal clear in my mind because he, he had a corner store, and he was a confident man, probably even arrogant, and he was one of the first people, black people, in the county there [Covington County, Alabama] to have a car, Model T Ford [Ford Model T], and he dressed nicely, he wanted what he wanted, he knew his way around, and one of the great stories in the family out of my father was the fact that some people who didn't like his ways had threatened him with violence so he carried a rifle, an old Winchester rifle in the Model T Ford that he used to drive around, and I now own that.  Rifle was given to me by my father and it comes from his father, King Davis.  I mentioned earlier the fact that my father's mother, my grandmother, Camille, I don't have any pictures of her with me, but she, very fair-skinned woman because her parents had been Seminole Indian [Native American] on her mother's side and freed slave on my great-grandfather's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were, they were freed before slavery was over then--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: And is it--were they related to their master?  Is there a story about that?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --not in that case.  On my mother's [Lorean Spears Davis] side, yes.  Their--one of my--my grandmother's [Pauline Spears (ph.)] sister was the daughter of the master.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So Seminole.  Now did your father tell any stories about growing up there that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father was short in stature, and broke his leg fairly early on and walked with a limp, so therefore Nelson was in the family as the short kid who walked with a limp.  Many of his stories is about people not giving him credibility and respect.  Also my father was functionally illiterate.  So he left school very early on and worked the fields.  He worked all the harvests, he worked cotton.  He moved from cotton to working at the saw mill.  Around Andalusia, one of the big industries was cutting wood, forestry, hacking trees and making lumber.  So my father started working in the saw mill very early in his life.  He didn't see his father after his father left.  That was King.  His mother and his brothers and sisters, they all grew up in the area and then spread to some of the smaller towns around Andalusia.
Speaker 1: Now, so he didn't, he never really went to school.  He worked, basically (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Shakes head) No.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Is--oh, go ahead.
Speaker 2: No I'm saying that that's one of the reasons that education is a lifelong pursuit for me.
Story_ID: 441580
Speaker 1: Is there a story that's passed down about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.  My father [Nelson Davis, Sr.] worked at the saw mill.  I've forgotten the name of the saw mill, but the saw mill in Andalusia [Alabama].  My mother worked for a family, whose name I don't recall, at the time.  My father used to walk from where he was living to the saw mill past the house where my mother worked. And this went on for several years until he, the short guy who walked with a limp, stopped to talk to her when she was hanging up clothing out by the house.  And he talked to her for some period of time.  I think that probably went on for a number of months until he began to confess his affection for Lorean Spears [Lorean Spears Davis], and they--for the South it was, at the time, it was unusual.  My mother at the time was twenty-four years old.  Usually people at that time had married, eighteen, nineteen, or even younger in some instances, and so the two of them had never married. And my father was taking care of his mother [Camille Davis] and my mother was working for a family, and that was how they met, because my father was a walker, until the end of his life.  He would walk across town, he would walk even in Niagara Falls [New York], and when I was in Andalusia I retraced some of his walking trips from Watley's Quarter [ph.] to where he worked, and it was several miles.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So he didn't let the limp stop him from--
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) walking around.
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe that was the reason he walked so much (laughter).
Story_ID: 441581
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' [Lorean Spears Davis and Nelson Davis, Sr.] talents, their dispositions, their personalities--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My mother.  My mother always had, as I mentioned earlier, a taste for interesting things in life, and she was super resourceful.  I speak often to small business gatherings and to students and the story I tell about my mother that is definitive about her attitude.  We lived in Niagara Falls [New York] in a public housing project.  I can remember, and this was in the beginning in the 19- mid-1940s and early '50s [1950s], and I can remember the rent (laughter) that we paid.  It was like thirty-five dollars a month, subsidized housing.  And nearby where we lived in this public housing project called Center Court [Niagara Falls, New York] was the auto light battery company, auto light car batteries, and this is now post--World War II [WWII].  And at that auto light factory, they discarded batteries that for some reason were defective.  They simply threw them out back into a field.  And my mother somehow, I don't know whether it was somebody else's suggestion, her watching how other people do things, smart people.  She discovered that there were these discarded batteries, and she recruited me because in my family there were two older sisters [Eva Nell Davis Hamilton and Lettie Davis Ray] who are ten years older than me, myself and a younger sister [Helen Davis Barnes], so there's this gap in the middle, so I'm the one who is five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten years of age at that time.  And so she recruited me and we figured out that if we took a sledgehammer, broke open those battery cases, there were lead plates inside.  We put on gloves and take sacks and take those plates out.  We knew there acid in the batteries, therefore the gloves, (unclear) gloves, and put them in burlap sacks and bring them home, put water over them to get the acid off, take a fire, an open flame, an old unused skillet, put the lead plates into the skillet, melt them down into ingots, put the ingots in the sack, put 'em in my wagon and take them to the junk dealer and sell them as scrap.  So we were in the lead ingot business when I was eight years old.
Speaker 1: That's incredible. So--yeah, that's--
Speaker 2: That's the spirit of entrepreneurship that animates and infuses my life today, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was that inspired somewhat by the, I know during the war effort they urged people to turn in like metal--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --pots and things like that to be melted down and turned into weapons and that sort of thing.  Was that, that (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That may have been the genesis for her being aware, but I became aware when she recruited me as part of the team.  My mother and me (laughter) you know) getting these lead plates out of those discarded batteries behind the auto light factory.
Speaker 1: They just melt 'em down in an iron skillet, and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  Lead has a very low melting point.  All we needed was an open fire, heat the skillet up, put those plates in there after we'd washed the acid off and it would melt into pools, take the gloves, take it off, let it cook for a bit, (makes sound) turn that sucker over and knock out the lead plate, the lead ingots (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they were all shaped like a frying pan, or basically (laughter)--
Speaker 2: They were all, every one we put in the sack was round like the frying pan (laughter).
Story_ID: 441582
Speaker 1: I know you told me but I for- how many brothers and sisters do you have in your--
Speaker 2: Three sisters--
Speaker 1: Three sisters (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) two older, one younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Two older and one--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you're right in the middle then, sort of--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was number three.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  You--wanna give us their names?
Speaker 2: Sure, sure, oldest, Eva, Eva Nell, coming from the South, Eva Nell Davis [Eva Nell Davis Hamilton], followed by Lettie Victoria.  We called her Lettie V. Davis [Lettie Davis Ray], then myself, and then younger sister, Helen Marie [Helen Davis Barnes].  Two of those sisters are deceased at this time, this being 2008, but interesting characters, all of them.
Story_ID: 441583
Speaker 1: Now what's your earliest childhood memory in the family?
Speaker 2: My younger sister [Helen Davis Barnes] coming home from the hospital when I was three.  That--I started remembering things from the age of three.  I remember getting on a horse for the first time at three.  I remember relatives coming to visit and one uncle.  His name Arto [ph.], my mother's [Lorean Spears Davis] brother, who started to encourage me because they, they started to encourage me thinking that maybe I was a bright and aware child.  That was the first time I had a sense of, of I guess the intellectual nurturing that became important to me in other parts of my life.  But living in a housing project [Center Court, Niagara Falls, New York], the, some of my memories have to do with not only my family, my mother being a social woman that the neighbors came to talk to and get advice from and confess whatever their difficulties were.  My mother was good at giving advice.  My--the--having a younger sister, the older sisters [Eva Nell Davis Hamilton and Lettie Davis Ray] because of the age gap, they were living different lives than I was when I was, say five years old and going to kindergarten. I had sisters then who were fifteen years of age, teenagers, interested in boys and music and dancing and so forth, so there was that kind of separation.  So within our family, and I'm five, six, seven years of age, things I remember were the tensions between my mother and two teenage daughters and two teenage daughters who will be rambunctious as they will and growing into that phase and my mother being kind of a strict, disciplinarian around the house.  I remember because I was the only boy in the family, of course the usual joke about him being the little prince, and that usually came from my older sisters (laughter) and the younger sister eventually.  So those are some of the first memories, the relatives, cooking.  We were certifiably poor so there was no telephone in the house, television came, in I think 1953 because of a cousin, so it was the kind of family where we shared dinner around the little cheap dinette, you know, Formica top dinette set in the apartment, and we would eat dinner together, all of us, four kids and two parents.  My mother would cook, but she got us all involved in cleaning the dishes, or chopping food or helping prepare.  And the place we lived in did not have gas or electric heat.  The heat came from shoveling coal into a furnace.
Story_ID: 441584
Speaker 1: You were talking about memories of home, and you were talking about the, the delivery of the coal, I think, or something, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh yeah.  We--coal was delivered by the ton.  Blue coal it was called.  So my memories were a mixture of the southern roots that my parents [Lorean Spears Davis and Nelson Davis, Sr.] had brought up, and from where we were born.  Now we're in a new place that has winter and coal and those kinds of things and the necessity for the family to really pull together because we didn't have a bunch of money and southerners sort of thought of the family as team work, and so, I'm thrilled that I had that kind of upbringing, I mean, from a mother who was pretty bright and resourceful.  Father, as I mentioned before, functionally illiterate, but solid provider and who stayed together with my mother until he died, fifty-three years they were married.  And the older sisters [Eva Nell Davis Hamilton and Lettie Davis Ray] who really having so many women in the house, I, to this day, grew up as a man with a comfort zone with women and I've had mentors who were women and bosses who were women and so, there was never an issue in my life because of that kind of upbringing.  The things that went on because we were poor, of course, the small things in the house, but we had a piano in the house.  We were poor people, but we had a piano in the house, we had a garden nearby where we grew vegetables in the summertime and I helped dig the holes and plant the tomatoes and water the tomatoes and so forth and so on, which is the kind of foundation I think for a family, though poor, we didn't know we were poor.  We knew we couldn't afford some things, but life was a rich experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now let's just kind of clarify where you were at certain ages--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause you moved at a certain point to Niagara Falls [New York].
Speaker 2: To Niagara Falls from Andalusia [Alabama]--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --I was--
Speaker 1: --how long did you stay in Andalusia?
Speaker 2: --two and a half years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So your memories really start in Niagara Falls?  The things that you were just telling us were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, the cognitive memories.  The memories of Andalusia was going back in the summertime.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So most of what you described about the family was, was Niagara Falls (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was Niagara Falls, Apartment 7C and then Apartment 22D at Center Court, Niagara Falls.

Speaker 1: Yes, the--oh the story I was telling, how my father [Nelson Davis, Sr.] and family wound up in Niagara Falls [New York].  My father is in Andalusia [Alabama], and this is now the end of World War II [WWII].  He has a brother, Wesley [Wesley Davis], who has moved north.  Wesley was the, the uptown, hustling, playing uncle of mine, and my father wanted to go north, and so first he went up to Newark, New Jersey.  We had family there, Shannon [ph.] family, and he looked for a job there.  Not so great, came back to Andalusia with my mom [Lorean Spears Davis] to be with my mom and family.  His brother Wesley, you know in those days you know you sent telegrams, quite often, and poor black people didn't have phones, you get a telegram about this and that, so brother, his uncle--his brother, my Uncle Wesley, was in Niagara Falls, and in Niagara Falls there were the petrochemical companies; there were Carborundum [Carborundum Company], there was Vanadium [Vanadium Corporation of America], there was Dow Chemical [Dow Chemical Company], there was DuPont [E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company].  All of the businesses that needed cheap electricity and--were there because of the war effort, Union Carbide [Union Carbide Corporation], lots going on.  So Wesley said to my father, "Come to Niagara Falls, you can--you know it's like you can walk down the street and money is running down the street to meet you."  (Laughter) So, my father did, left us behind in Andalusia and went to Niagara Falls, got a job working for the Vanadium Corp. and in the classic sense, he sent for us about a year later.  He got, rented an apartment and bought some furniture and we moved up to Niagara Falls to live in Center Court, Apartment 7C, in 19- that would be nineteen forty- 1945.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now how was Niagara Falls situated then?  Was there a black side of town or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Evolving because of the war.  The, when we first moved there and in the early years of my life, the neighborhoods were mixed in the North End of town it's called--Highland Avenue.  But over time, by the time I was in high school [Niagara Falls High School, Niagara Falls, New York], the area was predominately black where I moved.  But growing up in the projects then, in the late '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s], still very mixed, you know, the people who lived in the project was a mixed group of people, all people of limited means, but white people of limited means and other people of limited means, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so, so did black people at some point become associated with a side of town, east side, west side (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) North End.
Speaker 2: North End--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 441586
Speaker 1: We always ask this question--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and we ask it in this way because somebody says it's the smartest way to do it.  But, what are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing up, wow, that's a good question too by the way.  Oh boy. Because we had a garden and because there was a lot of southern cooking, the smells were of smothered pork chops, cakes, pancakes.  My favorite story about the smells growing up is that my father [Nelson Davis, Sr.] worked industrially.  He was a laborer for the Vanadium Corporation [Vanadium Corporation of America], and my mother [Lorean Spears Davis] got up like a good housewife and made him breakfast every morning.  I'm still in bed because he worked an early shift and he would leave home at about 6, 6:30 A.M.  He would walk to the factory, and so bacon and eggs classically, and coffee, brewed coffee.  So that's a pretty potent group of fragrances early in the morning when you're laying there and you're going to be going to the third grade (sniffs) and you get these fragrances of eggs, bacon and coffee.  And I couldn't wait to taste coffee.  And it got to be when I was twelve, thirteen, somewhere in there, they would allow me to have some coffee, somewhere in there, but I found the taste, once I tasted it, was an acquired taste so I wound up putting so much cream and sugar in the thing, I was making a latte, though I didn't know it, and, to this day, I'm not a coffee drinker, after that fabulous fragrance of coffee brewing in the morning, today I'm not a coffee drinker.  So those were some of the fragrances.  The sounds, because in a public housing project [Center Court, Niagara Falls, New York] everybody's close together, there was sounds that remain with me to this day of the lawns being mowed.  There's lots and lots of green.  It was not a concrete jungle by any means, big green spaces and the smell of fresh, freshly cut grass is one that stays with me to this day and whenever I drive by a place where they've used one of those power mowers to cut grass, it takes me right back to being a kid there.  Inside my house, the sound in the early days was radio.  My father was a lover of radio.  We had shortwave radios upstairs and downstairs, so that the sounds of the comedy shows, Jack Benny, Rochester [Eddie "Rochester" Anderson], Buster Brown, 'Superman' ['The Adventures of Superman'], 'The Shadow,' the sounds of the radio serials of the late '40s [1940s].  They were a dying breed, though I didn't know it at the time, those were one of the big sounds.  Another sound was the music because I had these teenage sisters [Eva Nell Davis Hamilton and Lettie Davis Ray] and we had a record player, so there is the sounds of Bill Doggett and Louis Jordan and so forth.  An interesting sound for a black family was that my parents loved country music, and so I heard Hank Williams, Hawkshaw Hawkins, Kitty Wells and people like that along with the people that I just mentioned, this, this confluence of southern, not really blues, blues, R and B and country music and we had a piano in the house that we used to bang away at, it was out of tune, but we'd bang away at it and I would try and, you know, play chords and things of that nature.  So those are some of the sounds from my childhood.
Story_ID: 441587
Speaker 1: Do you remember the--were the falls important growing up, themselves, as impressive as those things are, I just wondered if they were, you know?
Speaker 2: It's a very good question again.  Being named after Niagara Falls, it was exactly three miles from where we lived and so I could walk there and eventually ride by bicycle there because we eventually had bicycles.  And so the falls dominated because the town is small and quiet so sometimes if the wind was right at night you could hear the falls, you know late at night.  And you got close to the falls, or walking down Main Street, you'd look up and see the mist rising from the falls.  And then there were so many legends associated with the falls, people who had gone over the falls, the daredevils.  I remember when I was a kid, my father [Nelson Davis, Sr.], this would be about 1952 so I was ten years old, walking to the falls to see a daredevil go over the falls in a barrel, a rubber contraption of inner tubes.  He died, sadly, but that was one of my first memories of that part of the falls, and so the falls played a dominant role in--I remember part of the precipice at the end of the falls collapsing.  I remember a variety of things that the news in Niagara [Niagara Falls, New York] was driven by a couple of things, the falls and the tourists, the millions of people that came there per year, and the changes in the industrial economy, those factories and companies that I mentioned earlier.  Nabisco Shredded Wheat was made there, all kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yep (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I remember a picture of the falls was on the box.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And, yeah, what about, did your family recreate around those museums and amusements there associated with the falls?
Speaker 2: No--we were not cultural.  I was a library geek.  I was into science fiction as a kid and had a bicycle and joined the library at a pretty young age and would go there.  One of my sisters, Lettie [Lettie Davis Ray], one of my older sisters, took me to the plays that they put on at the high school [Niagara Falls High School, Niagara Falls, New York] in her class.  My parents were not cultural people in the sense of mother, father and kids holding hands, getting on the bus and going to an event.  Eventually when they (unclear)--the school, Center Avenue School [Niagara Falls, New York] where I went, we would do field trips to museums and the fort down at Fort Niagara [Youngstown, New York] and so forth, so those were my exposures.  I tell the story to my wife that I never ate in a restaurant until I was twenty-one--oh, sorry, never ate Chinese food until I was twenty-one, never ate in a restaurant until I went on a field trip as a newspaper boy down to Syracuse [New York], so I was--what was I, where was I--fifteen years of age before I ate at a restaurant.
Speaker 1: I think what you're describing is a common experience in those days--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for a lot of black youth growing up--
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.
Speaker 1: --in a lot of towns, yeah.  Going to restaurants was something that just didn't happen that much.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Somebody else did.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: I knew there were restaurants.
Speaker 1: Chinese, I--
Speaker 2: One of my sisters was a dishwasher in a restaurant on the night shift but I'd never eaten in a restaurant.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Chinese food I didn't have until I was grown, you know, and I'm younger than you are, but, it's, yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) it's--that's, that's one of the facts, yeah, you're right.
Story_ID: 441588
Speaker 1: Well tell us about school.  Now you went to Center Avenue School [Niagara Falls, New York].
Speaker 2: Center Avenue, it's torn down now.  School was built in the 1800s.  Classic red brick schoolhouse with a playground and bell that Mr. McIntyre [ph.], the janitor rang each morning to signify that, signal that we had to get off the playground and go into class.  Ms. Rosatone [ph.], kindergarten teacher.  I remember her well.  That environment I fell right into and it was very comfortable, though one of the stories that I tell in kindergarten we lived close enough to walk.  My mother [Lorean Spears Davis] took me to school the first year, 1947, kindergarten, and the first day of school, September 1947, I went to school on my mother's hand, and I sat there in kindergarten and looked around and Ms. Rosatone, the teacher, and my--some of the playmates were kids I already knew from the project [Center Court, Niagara Falls, New York] and so forth and we had a little break at, you know put your head down at lunch time, I think it was, and then one o'clock, thereabouts, says I've seen this, I'm gonna leave.  So I just simply got up and walked out (laughter), kindergarten day one, and walked back home, which was a, you know, what was it, just over a quarter of a mile or thereabouts.  And my mother had to take me by my hand and take me back to school and make a stop at the principal's office, but, so it was a mixed class.  I don't have a picture with me.  I have a picture of me somewhere--in that class, but it was a class of mixed kids.  Let me see, the Spurdutis [ph.], there was a lot of Italian kids, black kids, Frank Zielinski [ph.], one of my playmates, Polish, Terry Goldstein [ph.], Jewish kid, the Patronis [ph.], that makes them Arabs, and so forth.  That was the kind of atmosphere it was in this schoolhouse that was built in the 1800s--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --(laughter) being used in 1947.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite subject in school, favorite activity?
Speaker 2: It evolved over the years.  I was just so thrilled to be able to learn things.  We had new books and kids today say they don't have books, but we had new books for everything, whether it was ABCs or learning how to write long hand and math and there was, you know, 'Dick and Jane' and all of the books were so new, and the teachers were enthused.  It was by the time I got to the fifth grade that I began to have a special relationship with a teacher, Mr. Henry Kalfas, who became a bit of a mentor, and he told me that I was a bright young man who could accomplish things in this life, and that was an acceleration of my interest in lifelong learning.  Favorite subjects for me became social studies because it let me know about other aspects of the world.  You know when you grow up in a housing project and those four walls, you don't necessarily get a larger view of the world around you, and so that was a key piece for me.  Science became a real passion of mine, how things worked.  So social studies and sciences.
Story_ID: 441589
Speaker 1: Now when did you develop an in- interest in science fiction, you mentioned that just a few minutes ago and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was always there.  You know as a kid the, watching 'Buzz Corbett, Space Cadet' [sic. 'Tom Corbett, Space Cadet'], I think it was, early television, black and white.  And 'Flash Gordon,' those 'Flash Gordon' serials that were taken from the old movie serials.
Speaker 1: I think there was one called 'Captain Video' ['Captain Video and His Video Rangers'] (unclear).
Speaker 2: 'Captain Video,' I didn't see 'Captain Video'--
Speaker 1: You didn't see (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but 'Flash Gordon' and 'Buzz Corbett, Space Cadet.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was fascinated--pardon me--fascinated by that stuff, so that was the beginning of science fiction.  I began to read what they now call speculative fiction, Heinlein [Robert A. Heinlein] and others who wrote those books about going to the moon, rocket travel and so forth.
Speaker 1: 'Stranger in a Strange Land' [Robert A. Heinlein]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 441590
Speaker 1: Did you go to middle school?  Did they have a middle school (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They called it then, the way they laid it out then in Niagara Falls [New York] was grade school, junior high and high.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What is now we call middle school was junior high.
Speaker 1: And was junior high a separate building or different school?
Speaker 2: Different school, yeah, Niagara Falls Junior High--or North, they called it North, the schools were North Junior High [North Junior High School, Niagara Falls, New York].  It was the North End of town.
Speaker 1: Okay. And tell us about (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they had South Junior High [South Junior High School, Niagara Falls, New York] too on the other side of town (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: That was grade seven.  They started that in grade seven.  And I was class president in, I don't know how that happened.  I don't know, still to this day don't understand it.  Somehow I was in a class and somehow they decided to have an election and the next thing I knew, "Nelson [HistoryMaker Nelson Davis], you're elected class president" (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was this in seventh grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah, seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's, that was good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a revelation for me.  I'd still--I didn't know how to run a campaign.  (Laughter) Maybe I was the last person in the room, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, seventh grade, so you're fourteen.  This is like 1956, or--?
Speaker 2: That would be, let me see, I was born in '42 [1942], that was in--yeah, yeah, it'd be about '50s [1950s], about fifteen years old in '56 [1956], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 441591
Speaker 1: Now this is when the Civil Rights Movement starts cranking up--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and like TV becomes a big deal.  Now you've been involved in television all your life.
Speaker 2: No, radio and then television.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I really got into television in a serious way in 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But when you were coming along--as television became more, you know, popular--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and everybody had 'em, did you, did you watch a lot of television?
Speaker 2: A limited amount, but it was, television, I'll just talk about it specifically.  We were poor and I had a cousin who was like a big brother to me, Eddie Palmore, also from Andalusia [Alabama], and he worked for a used furniture dealer, and so he brought a television to our house once and let us use it for a while, and I thought, wow, we watched 'Howdy Doody' ['The Howdy Doody Show'], some of those programs I mentioned earlier, the old dusters, you know, 'Sagebrush Trail,' Hopalong Cassidy, 'Cisco Kid' ['The Cisco Kid'], all of that and it was an interesting amusement.  I remember helping my father [Nelson Davis, Sr.] put rabbit ears up in the attic.  We weren't allowed to put rabbit ears on top of the roof, but we could put them in the attic, so I remember doing that and running the cable down, running the wire down, the 500 (unclear) lead down to the TV set.  But radio intrigued me. Television amused me at the time.  Radio was so intimate and I felt a relationship with it.  Television was that black and white thing, you know, with snowy pictures, 'Howdy Doody' amusement.
Speaker 1: So you came along in age of the radio.  Really then, I mean, your--I guess your focus is more on radio (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because my father loved radio.  As I said, we had radios all over the house, you know, the little tube suckers, yeah.
Story_ID: 441592
Speaker 1: And you're coming along now in the age of rock and roll too.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is what we used--what we used to call, well rhythm and blues rock and roll--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when, when the music starts to change from big band music and--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --sh- Broadway show music to more--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Music was important to me growing up there [Niagara Falls, New York].  See media in general, electronic media in particular, was a window on the world for me.  I hear those radio programs, CBS, ABC, the DuMont network, whatever they were, and those people seemed to be intelligent, bright and having a good times telling those raconteurial stories about this or that or Broadway and so forth and I thought, wow, I'd like to know those people, or maybe even better yet, be one of those people from a young age.  And then when the local radio stations did broadcasts, remote broadcasts, I would walk or get my bicycle and go to wherever they set up their trailer and look through the glass at the guy who was spinning records and talking into a microphone.  It became an obsession with me so that by the time I was fourteen, I knew that I wanted to be on the radio.  Television didn't play the same role for me at the time.  It was still an amusement.  The shows I watched, 'Ed Sullivan' ['The Ed Sullivan Show'], 'Jackie Gleason' ['The Jackie Gleason Show'], et cetera, was a window though because those were the first times remembering at that age and that time the shows that my father [Nelson Davis, Sr.] saw in New Jersey, or my sister [Lettie Davis Ray] saw in Buffalo [New York], be they vaudeville and the variations.  That was all changing.  Dick Clark's 'American Bandstand' was on television.  In the afternoon, the package rock and roll shows were out there.  I'd hear these names like Illinois Jacquet, or Louis Jordan, Sugar Chile Robinson played piano.  The Step Brothers [The Four Step Brothers] danced.  I'd hear these names and see them in Ebony and Jet magazine, but it wasn't yet my world.  And so it was an interesting transference of the '40s [1940s] America into the '50s [1950s] America and I remember for my newspaper route earnings, getting my first transistor radio so that I could A, listen to the Brooklyn Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers] and Yankees [New York Yankees] games, but also listen to music on the high powered clear channel stations and the disc jockeys in the era of Alan Freed and there was a man named George "Hound Dog" Lorenz out of WKBW [WKBW Radio] in Buffalo, and these were the people I began to idolize because they played all of this music.
Story_ID: 441593
Speaker 1: The first time, a quick story, it was one of the first times I saw some of these performers live that I had seen on television, et cetera, and about five years ago now, I was in San Diego [California] for a board meeting on something at the General Grant Hotel [U.S. Grant Hotel, San Diego, California] and I was walking in and James Brown was standing there.  And I said--introduced myself and I didn't expect him to remember me, but I had met him as one of the very first live performers I had ever seen, when I was fifteen years of age.  And I reminded him of the venue, and he started telling me stories about what that venue meant to him back there in the '50s [1950s].  Performers who had been on the Chitlin' Circuits were now beginning to play in bigger halls, so within a short time there, as I started to go to these live performances, loving music, Dinah Washington and the jazz festival, Chubby Checker because he was on 'American Bandstand' in the first time around before 'The Twist' came in there.  Chuck Berry was w- the very first one I'd seen followed by James Brown and The Flames [James Brown and The Famous Flames] at the Memorial Auditorium [Buffalo Memorial Auditorium] there in Buffalo [New York].  So these, this transfer of--and I played, I started playing trombone and then I started playing tenor saxophone because I wanted to be a rock and roller.  I saw a movie, 'The Girl Can't Help It' with Little Richard and those big old shiny saxophones, I said that's me.  I'm going to be there. (Laughter) You know, and so that was all going on, transistor radio, being able to listen to the radio wherever you were, people appearing on 'American Bandstand,' some, goodness me, some of the acts that were, had been on the Chitlin' Circuit were now like having hit records, pop records, and the package shows, with Illinois Jacquet being the house orchestra for a whole bunch of acts, LaVern Baker and others.  The birth of Motown [Motown Records] was going on at the same time off of West Grand Boulevard there in Detroit [Michigan]. Smokey Ro- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, The Coasters, The Platters.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson.  All of this was, a fair explosion, and I was besotted by so much of this, the music, I wanted to be a musician, I wanted to be on the radio, and the two things kind of went together.
Story_ID: 441594
Speaker 1: Now in, in high school [Niagara Falls High School, Niagara Falls, New York] was there any sort of outlet, did they have high school radio station or anything like that that you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Didn't have a radio station.  Because I was eventually in what the, I don't know, they called an accelerated class, we had some resources and we had people come in to talk to us from outside, not just our regular high school teachers for social class.  I mean we had nuclear physicists come and talk to us, people who worked in the (laughter) atomic energy program.  We had pilots of air- you know, airlines and others come into school to give us a point of view.  We had astronomers come and talk to us in school.  It was, once again, a rich experience.  I learned how to use a slide rule, I mean I'm not so good at mathematics, but here learned how to use a slide rule and do these calculations in algebra and a little bit of trigonometry and things like that, so high school was that kind of an experience for me.  There was no radio station but they, they had various clubs.  They had a book club, a chess club.  I was not a chess player, those kinds of things.  It was just overall--
Speaker 1: Yeah I think in '57 [1957], the Mercury astronauts were chosen and they start doing the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Preparation for exploration.
Speaker 1: --preliminary exploration in space, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah. And I was always into airplanes.  They, we would get-- class go out to the National Guard air base [Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, New York] and have a chance to sit in the simulator, link trainer, and you know, wave the stick around and meet pilots of the F-86 Sabre [North American F-86 Sabre] jets, et cetera.
Story_ID: 439644
Speaker 1: Beginning in high school we were talking off camera about your sister taking you to certain venues and clubs (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium [Buffalo, New York] into the me- the stadium for a jazz concert.  I love music, as I mentioned before, so the chance to go and see some of these people live meant a lot to me, and an interesting phenomena, a deejay used to do Sunday night dances because the acts were getting big money on a Saturday, their big money, comparatively big money, but on Sundays they had open.  So he had the power of radio behind him, George "Hound Dog" Lorenz, and so he put on these dances at the Memorial Auditorium on Sunday nights.  Now because I had to go to school on Monday morning, it took a lot of coercing to get my parents [Lorean Spears Davis and Nelson Davis, Sr.] to let me go to this auditorium, but my sister Lettie [Lettie Davis Ray], who was nine and a half years older, we would go with some of her friends, some musician friends.  So the first time I'm there, the first two times I remember so distinctly, Chuck Berry, and I remember meeting James Brown.  I didn't meet Chuck Berry.  But, it was the, these Chitlin' Circuit acts were now beginning to play other venues. But the jazz concert, the very first time I saw any of the vaunted famous names live, my sister had some musician friends who had taken me backstage at this jazz concert.  And backstage really mean it was a stadium, so therefore down toward the locker rooms and concrete halls and, you know, so forth and so on.  And so I'm just so excited about fifteen years of age and going down the hall and thinking that showbiz was glamorous and so forth, I heard a voice, a female voice use an obscenity asking about where her money was.  And a little more walking with my sister, I looked in the room that the voice came out from and sitting there with a little fur stole, even in the summer, (laughter) of course the late summer, was Dinah Washington.  So it was revelatory for me.  Hey I'm getting to see some of my heroes.  I remember meeting Chico Hamilton.  It was in that particular group and it let me know that the glamorous showbiz was more show and biz than it was glamour.  And the same thing applied later with some of the other people that I had a chance to meet, but it was also seminal in that one of the later drummers for Ray Charles is a friend of mine here in Los Angeles [California], and I said, you know, the first time, it was a watershed for Ray Charles in that he appeared in Buffalo [New York] at the Kleinhans Music Hall, a graduating step up from the circuit that he had been on because this was after, or close to the time of 'What'd I Say,' and he was graduating from the, the Graystone Ballroom in Detroit [Michigan], or whatever he was playing before to playing a real concert hall, and I remember to this day him with his ruffled shirt being led out to the piano and so forth and it is exactly like the depiction in the movie 'Ray,' yeah.
Speaker 1: That's something.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a moment in the movie that really connected with people I think (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, I was there.  Kleinhans Music Hall, here comes Ray and this is at that time in his real time life.
Story_ID: 439645
Speaker 1: Music and radio were super important to me.  There's some--there's a, there's a, there's a thread throughout my entire life up until now.  I don't know it's like zelig almost.  I found myself in places and situations to meet historic figures from the arts, from politics and from business.  I saw a picture when I was--started part-time at a radio station, of myself shaking John F. Kennedy's [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] hand in 1961.
Speaker 2: Okay, now this is after high school [Niagara Falls High School, Niagara Falls, New York], right?
Speaker 1: Yes, after high school.  So, at, as I tell stories with my life and things that have shaped to inform me or helped me or inspired me, there are some famous names along the way, and to this date I don't know how we wound in the same room in the same places, same patch of sidewalk, but.
Speaker 2: How did you meet John Kennedy?  How did that happen?
Speaker 1: I'll get to that, but let me fill in that little piece.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: So I wanna be in radio and that hustling spirit of my mother [Lorean Spears Davis].  People ask me, how'd you get into radio, what did you do?  Did you go to school?  Did you learn it in college?  No.  That cousin of mine in the used furniture business, Eddie Palmore, gave me a wire recorder so that I could record my voice.  Wire recorders is a really a machine for stenographers, but I'd record my voice--
Speaker 2: That's pre-tape recorder.
Speaker 1: Pre-tape recorder.  So I'd record my voice and I would pretend I was a radio announcer or disc jockey.  For my newspaper route earnings carrying the Niagara Falls Gazette [Niagara Gazette], I saved the money and I bought from the pawn shop a real tape recorder, for I think it was, big money for--at the time, I think it cost me eighteen dollars.
Speaker 2: Now this is in what year?  This like 1959 or something (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That would be 1957, '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: From the pawn shop and I also got from Eddie a turntable so that in my bedroom I could set up a little, my own version of a radio station, having a turn table and a microphone and tape recorder to pretend that I was working at a radio station. And I would endlessly (unclear) I'd get advertisement copy from just taking stuff from the newspaper.  The wire copy I'd sit there and read it, I'd look at commercials in the newspaper and read that copy because I wanted to be on the radio.  That was where I was headed.  That was a clear and singular vision of mine.

Speaker 1: In my senior year at high school one of the local stations, WJJL [WJJL Radio, Niagara Falls, New York], had an internship program and a woman named Dorothy Shanks [sic. Dorothy Shank] chose three or four students from Niagara Falls High School [Niagara Falls, New York] now to participate in the internship program and somehow I was one of the four.  We had a project to do a radio show and learn about radio and then do a show on Broadway musicals.  'Bye Bye Birdie' [Michael Stewart] was the one, the team I was on, and I got a ti- a chance then to go to a radio station and see and actual equipment and talk to the engineers and the announcers and Dorothy Shanks did a regular program on the radio.  And so here I was now at the age of seventeen or thereabouts, actually at a radio station.  I graduated high school and by this time with that equipment that I had I could make tapes of my voice with music and sort of like a radio, like a deejay.  And so I began to send these tapes out to radio stations asking for a job.
Speaker 2: So you had a demo (laughter).
Speaker 1: I had a demo.  Kind of rinky dink, but it was listenable.  I was awful by the way, I was truly awful, but, you know, radio in a small town so I sent them in New York State down to Syracuse [New York] and so forth and the program director of the radio station in Little Falls, New York, had invited me down because they wanted to offer me a job.  Here I was seventeen and a-half, going on eighteen years of age, I guess, and I could get a job in radio.  Was I happy.  I took the Samsonite case, hard case that my mother [Lorean Spears Davis] had given me for graduating high school, got on the Greyhound bus, off to Little Falls, New York.  Get there, the program director was probably thirty seconds older than me (laughter) and the station was owned by a man named Big Jim something or other, I think it was McManus [ph.] and he met me, and his words to me were, "I'm not sure that a young black man would be happy in this town" and so forth.  So this was the first time I'd come up against what I viewed as racial discrimination in my pursuit in being in and on the radio.  Next day I, with my Samsonite case, back on the bus head home, told my mother the story, you know, that this, whatever the station was, Big Jim said, you know, dah, dah, dah, dah.  So I toddle on back home, continue to work on the tapes and I got myself a part-time job at a station in Niagara Falls on the Canadian side [Niagara Falls, Canada], CHVC [CHVC Radio].  Their slogan was CHVC, let me see, 1600, in the Rainbow Bridge.

Speaker 1: When you came out of high school [Niagara Falls High School, Niagara Falls, New York], had you, had you any plans for college?
Speaker 2: Here were my thoughts at the time.  Poor family.  I had, as I look back, I had the intellect to have gotten some scholarship help.  Here were, here's exactly my thought patterns.  My brother-in-law took me to Carborundum [Carborundum Company] where he worked to look around there.  There we know you could get a job with a high school diploma, and I had good grades, and they took me into an area where they had computers.  Big room full of stuff with those big noisy impact printers.  I said I don't know if I want to do that.  I wanted to learn to fly.  My brother-in-law had been in the [U.S.] Air Force and I figured I would go into the service and continue my education during and after the service.  I would learn a skill and I wanted to fly airplanes.  So I went to the recruiter for the Air Force and said I wanted to fly, be a fighter pilot and because I had started to wear glasses by that time, he said, "Well you can't be that because you need 20/20 vision uncorrected, but you could be a navigator."  And I sat there and I went home and I thought I don't want to be a navigator, I want to be a fighter pilot, so I took that off the table. But then I got this opportunity at CHVC [CHVC Radio, Niagara Falls, Canada] as a part-time job operating the controls for some of their radio programs and because I wanted to be in radio and it was clear to me then because I had already done the Air Force recruiter thing.  In my yearbook, I said I was going to go into the Air Force as a matter of fact.  And I, it perhaps was a mistake but life doesn't have, really, mistakes and error, that I did have the intellectual prowess to probably have gotten some scholarship aid, but I was just heading for the stuff that I wanted to do.  I was passionate about flying.  It was not a possibility in the Air Force the way I wanted it, radio since the age of fourteen.  There I am at a radio station, part-time and I'm figuring now I've got this part-time gig, I can go to school part-time.  Niagara University [Niagara University, New York] was right there up the road; in Toronto [Canada] was Ryerson [Ryerson University], which had a great course in radio and television arts, and so forth.  Within a minute and a half they were offering me a full-time job, and then they started letting me do late night deejay work.  So I took that path to the left, or to the right, whichever you prefer, and here I was starting to work in my chosen profession before I got to go to college.  Now, over the years I've taken courses in business management (laughter) on a part-time basis.  I have no college degree.  I have raised money for colleges, scholarship money and other things.  I've sat on the board of the trustees for college, but I've never been a full-time student or have a college degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's, that's I mean it's remarkable you've been able to, you know, to get through that without having--was there a time when somebody really raised it as a big issue?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I've been a network executive for the NBC network.  That was my time in Corporate America.  People sometimes just as a social interest, will say, "Where did you go to school?" and that sort of thing, or "You're well spoken, where did you go to school?" or "What did you get a degree in?" and I don't have a degree (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're at--
Speaker 2: I, I'm a supporter of education by the way, lifelong learning.  As I said, my father [Nelson Davis, Sr.] was illiterate and education, lifelong learning, is as important as anything in the world to me.
Speaker 1: Now that's not, I mean you're not the only story.  I mean we, we talked to [HistoryMaker] Doug Banks, he had a similar story.  There are other people in radio and TV with a similar story.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They get, once they get into it they know they wanna be in it and once they get in it, they're in it, they're in it, they stay in it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, (laughter) and all, you know--the, the business has allowed me a nice life in many ways.
Story_ID: 439648
Speaker 1: Tell us about what happened in Canada.  Now you're in Canada, and I think you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, interesting chapter.  I'm in Ottawa [Canada]--I mean I'm in Niagara Falls [Canada] and I want to go to a bigger market and I'm sending out tapes again, I'm better now, not great but better.  And this is 1963.  I'm about to turn twenty-one years of age, and I sent the tape up to Ottawa, to a station that's well known there, CKOY [CKOY Radio; CIWW Radio, Ottawa, Canada], and they give me a job to work late nights and I get my Sunbeam Alpine with a little trailer behind it and drive to Ottawa, the 11th December, 1963, Dinah Washington died that day.  I start to work on the 13th of December, 1963, and I've become accustomed to it in my life.  I arrived at the station, Johnny Murphy [John Murphy], the program director, a nice, nice man and is it a surprise that they've hired the black kid?  Yes it is.  Are they very graceful and terrific about it?  Yes they are.  The owner of the station, Jack Daley, who I know to this day, they sort of took me in and, "Glad to have you here" versus the previous experience I had down in Little Falls, New York. And so I was there working for a decade.  I became their, their top rock and roll deejay eventually, and eventually did the morning show for them.  I started to do some television work there for the, a local station and also for the Canadian Broadcast Corp. [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation], I hosted a travel show for them, so it was the maturity for me as a broadcaster, and because it was the capital, and because I learn from people, I had a chance to interface with diplomats, scientists, leading lights in entertainment, et cetera.  We visited that city to appear there.  It was just a fabulous life.  I became twenty-one years old there, and I built my dream house there, just a life that was so rich in experiences. And education, I went to, took courses at Carleton University [Ottawa, Canada], school there, and became a part of the civic fabric.  It was great.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there a distinct difference that you can tell us about between the United States and Canada in those days (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At that time? Certainly.  In Ottawa, what black population there was, was from the Caribbean more so than from the U.S.  During that time there, this was a piece of my life, as I look back on it, it's kind of interesting.  I had not gone, I'd gone there for a job opportunity.  That was 1963, December.  Sometime later in the '60s [1960s], you know, born in the U.S., I got a draft notice, 1967, '8 [1968], somewhere in there.  I guess that was ramp up to the Vietnam War, and I had a choice to make, go in the [U.S.] Army or the services, or remain and follow my professional pursuits.  I chose that one.  That was, you know, one of those things.  I had never thought of, you know, once I rejected the idea of going into the [U.S.] Air Force, (laughter) I thought, that's the end of that.  And so now Uncle Sam comes knocking and I'm on the path that I want, I'm living a life that I'm enjoying and opportunities and people and so forth.  So I elected not to go into the service.
Speaker 1: Now does that make you like a fugitive from the draft, or--?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know what it was at the time.  I really don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, because a lot of people actually left, you know--
Speaker 2: I'm in this country legally, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, a lot of people left the U.S. to go to Canada--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to avoid a draft.  You were already there.
Speaker 2: Five years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so did you have any legal issues around (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Here's how that got resolved. A, I became a Canadian citizen.  At that time you couldn't have both citizenships.  Now, I have dual citizenship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you're already accepted as a citizen there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in a lot of ways--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so you didn't have to worry about that, okay.
Story_ID: 439649
Speaker 1: But then the next maturity step for me was the, I'd done radio, and television came into my mind.  I wanted to be a game show host, and I started to visit Los Angeles [California] and I eventually moved here without a job, just wa- having the energy going back to that spirit of my mother [Lorean Spears Davis] (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now what inspired you to become a game show host?  There weren't any other black game hosts in those days (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I always loved game shows since I was a kid.  My mother used to watch 'Truth or Consequences' around the house--that old black and white TV set.  There was something about it and when I became an executive at NBC, Bob Barker was in my office one day talking about a show idea.  And I, I had to confess to him that I used to watch him doing 'Truth or Consequences' when I was a kid, you know, and watching my mother iron.  She's ironing and I'm looking at that TV set with Bob Barker.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So do you remember back in the '50s [1950s], I believe there was a black girl [Gloria Lockerman] on '$64,000 Question' ['The $64,000 Question'] that was a Bible expert or something, or she had, she won like one of the highest prizes.  Do you remember that?  There was (unclear)--yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, '$64,000 Question' I used to watch it, you know, Dr. Joyce Brothers and the other folks who became stars because of that show.  Eventually living here, I met the people that worked on that show.
Speaker 2: I think it was, 'cause it was a big deal when anybody in those days who was colored was on it, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I, eventually I worked with Leslie Uggams here.  Leslie was the first you know black woman that I truly remember having a role on television.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Right, right, right.  So any rate so, but I mean that's like, so you're, things are going so well in Canada, but you, you decide to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I gave it up--
Speaker 2: --come here--
Speaker 1: --gave it up, came here.
Speaker 2: Was there a call from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] about, about, or--
Speaker 1: No, no.  One my mentors from New York had moved out here.  A man named Howard Felsher who produced some of the most successful game shows, 'Password' and so forth.  He worked for Goodson-Todman [Goodson-Todman Productions].  Just invited me out to visit and he introduced me to--oh, I had done the pilot for a guy in New York and at the same time, that was 1974, [HistoryMaker] Adam Wade did a pilot of a game show and I hosted one also.  He hosted 'Musical Chairs' and I hosted a show called 'Double Cross.' And I thought, ah, I'll take this opportunity to go to California.  My domestic situation was breaking up and so I just, the calling, I was always curious about California because my oldest sister [Eva Nell Davis Hamilton] had lived here for several years because her husband [Thomas Hamilton] was in the [U.S.] Air Force, and I'd hear these names and the music in California.  And I said, I got to try that, so I picked up and moved here, sold my house actually and moved here in October 1976.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Did not have a job, so I just bought a car, rented a small apartment and said, I'm gonna give myself four months to enjoy the time off and drive around and learn about California, see if I can make some friends and see if I can make something happen.
Story_ID: 439650
Speaker 1: So how long did it take you to really find something (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let's see, I came October, November, December, January, February, March I started doing business here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: March of '77 [1977].  I got freelance assignments at a TV station.  Remember I said I'm going to make this transfer from radio to TV, and a woman name Marilyn Solomon at KCOP television Channel 13 [KCOP-TV, Los Angeles, California], I'd gone to a meeting with her and presented my credentials and my eagerness and so forth and said I'm going to do something with you and she gave me an opportunity to host a public affairs show and to, what was important for me, learn to produce television programing, so that was how it started for me in California.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is at KCOP.
Speaker 2: Yes, KCOP, Channel 13 (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.  Okay.  Now, now who are they affiliate with, with ABC?
Speaker 2: In those days they were an independent station.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now they are owned by FOX.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now '76 [1976], were they UHF [ultra high frequency] or--
Speaker 2: No, Channel 13, VHF [very high frequency].
Speaker 1: Oh, 13--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --okay, all right.  So what did you do there?
Speaker 2: I hosted a show called 'Vox Populi,' a weekend public affairs show, you know, in that early morning (unclear), where public affairs shows tend to be booked.  And they let me produce.  I think the first thing I produced was a public affairs documentary look at the issue of busing school kids and then I went on to do others there, movies in black--the history of blacks in film.
Speaker 1: That was a hot button topic in those days, huh, busing?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And people were up in arms.  I know there was a--yeah--
Speaker 2: And I came from an environment the previous ten years, I didn't know anything about busing because it didn't exist where I was [in Ottawa, Canada].  The bus was simply because the school was far away.  It had nothing to do with balance and equilibrium and equal representation, you know.
Speaker 1: You know there was, we interview Diane Watson [HistoryMaker Diane E. Watson] in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and she was telling us about the struggle.
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: She was on the school board [Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education] at the time--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I think and she had a struggle with one of the major white busing, anti-busing advocates.
Speaker 2: I remember it well, Diane (unclear).
Speaker 1: I can think of the lady's name now, but the lady that she was opposed to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Diane was here.
Speaker 1: --yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, I arrived in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] without a job, and I was looking to be a game show host and that interesting episode in my life.  I failed at becoming a game show host of something on the air.  I was able to meet people.  Monty Hall became a supporter of mine.  At the ABC network a man named Michael [ph.], (makes sound) forgotten Michael's last name, and one of his lieutenants, they all thought I had ability potentially to become a game show host.  It was a radical idea.  That show ['Musical Chairs'] had gone on the air on CBS that, with [HistoryMaker] Adam Wade and it was on thirteen weeks and gone.  We work in a failure business.  Most ideas don't work out for a long time, so that was, I tried mightily and at the same time I became freelancer doing a variety of things, produced a series over at the PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] station here [KOCE-TV, Los Angeles, California].  In '79 [1979], a mutual friend with Ronald Reagan [Ronald Wilson Reagan], brought me in to direct a bunch of spots as he was preparing to run for the presidency.  Did just a variety of things.  I went to Africa, directed a film because the visual side, you know.  I went from radio to a visual life and I did not succeed at that goal of becoming a game show host.
Story_ID: 439651
Speaker 1: Now what kind of ads did you produce for Ronald Reagan [Ronald Wilson Reagan]?  First of all I just wanted to hear (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  It wasn't because of my politics, it was simply that a mutual friend, a guy who is dead now.  His name was Ed Shaw.  Well I had two mutual friends, a producer who was one of my mentors named Frank McCarthy, who produced 'Patton,' won an Academy Award [Oscar] for 'Patton.'  He and Mr. Reagan were friends.  And another (unclear), another friend who had this contract.  The reason that the spots were being done was he was preparing to run for the presidency, the twenty-four spots of him endorsing a group of various candidates, and so I was selected to put those spots together with, spent two days with the about to be President Reagan.
Speaker 1: So he, he was governor at this time, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --or had been--
Speaker 2: Had been governor.
Speaker 1: --had been governor, right.  So he was giving his endorsement, which carried a lot of weight around here, to various candidates--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and so these were spots where--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I just wondered if it was any real creative or anything real, you know, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Very straight forward stuff.  He was an ideal performer, knew his lines, knew the marks because he'd been an actor.  "Mr. Reagan, like you over here and you turn here for this and you" (makes sounds).  Bam, bam, bam.  We did twenty-four spots in two days; that's twelve spots a day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I remember the old 'GE Playhouse' [sic. 'General Electric Theater'] (unclear) you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he was a delight, I, I--wonderful storyteller, wonderful, wonderful storyteller.  A delight to be with.  On the other side of things in talking what was political talk, because we were together for two days, we, our common ground was, interestingly enough, welfare reform.  We agreed on welfare reform.  Not a bunch of other stuff we agreed on, but I agreed and I told him, I said, you know, "Mr. Reagan, the welfare system that came out of the New Deal, I think, was one of the most detrimental things to the black communities of American of anything."  And I said, "Therefore I feel that welfare needs to be reformed in ways that incentivize people to work and do for themselves and not rely upon the mailbox."
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And that was one of his pla- pieces in his platform, eventually as president.
Story_ID: 439652
Speaker 1: You mentioned some, some other things.  You did a piece on black film, or (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, called 'Movies in Black' [ph.].
Speaker 1: 'Movies in Black'--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --okay.  And this was done around the same period of time?
Speaker 2: That was done, I can tell you when.  That was '78 [1978], 1978.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was doing about one or two documentaries a year.
Speaker 1: Okay so you were like trying to put together a history of blacks in films in the United States in those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was that the first one that was ever done?
Speaker 2: I don't know if that was the first one done and I don't even have a copy of it.  I don't even know if a copy exists, it was on video tape, and that before I was even conscious enough to keep the work that I had done, but that's what brought me in touch with some of the living legends of the time, Sammy Davis [Sammy Davis, Jr.] at one end, and Lincoln Perry, who played Stepin Fetchit at the other end of the spectrum.  Lincoln Perry died shortly after that.  He had already suffered a stroke.  And Sammy and Fred Williamson and the, the new breed, Ivan Dixon and some of those folks were around at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you try to go back to Oscar Micheaux and people like that or did you--
Speaker 2: I mentioned Micheaux and people going back in history.  Of course that was the first time I learned anything about Oscar Micheaux was doing the research for that project.
Story_ID: 440310
Speaker 1: --We were at 1978, 'Movies in Black' [ph.] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, that was part of my educational learning and I had not produced television documentaries before.  They, and they got better over time, with my next one which was on the crime of arson, 'A Hot Time in the Old Town' [ph.], that was the first time I got an Emmy nomination--L.A. Area Emmy [Los Angeles Area Emmy Award] nomination in doing that one.  So my production credentials were increasing.  Nineteen eighty [1980], a friend of mine, a woman from Mississippi actually, Mary Ann Henderson, I'll always remember.  I was doing a variety of things.  I was a freelancer.  I didn't work for anybody, I worked for a variety of people, and I was working on the 'College Bowl' ['The General Electric College Bowl'], revival of 'College Bowl,' CBS radio doing voiceover announce and she said she worked at NBC and she had known about my game show ambitions and so forth and she called me one day to say, "You know there's an opening over here in the mini-series department, and there's interesting woman who runs that department, Ethel Winant, so was that something you'd be interested in interviewing for?"  Okay, I was, so I got an interview with HR [human resources] department, this was in 1980, February, March, something like that, and I said, after that interview, I said, "I'd like to meet the vice president who is--runs this area," and the person was a little surprised maybe, but I was just, I hope pleasantly aggressive, not annoyingly aggressive, and we wound up having a couple of meetings, and she wound up hiring me as a trainee in the mini-series area, so I'd gone from all those other things to working at, as a network executive.  But my true goal there was to get to daytime programming because that took me to the area of game shows and soap operas that were the meat of the programming schedules for daytime in the early 1980s.  And for NBC during my four years there, that was where I did my final service was as the director of daytime programming with the NBC network.  So that I went from that disappointment of not being able to be a game show host to being the guy who hired game show hosts and helped them develop.
Story_ID: 440311
Speaker 1: I have a note here that you were once the censor for 'The Tonight Show' ['The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'].
Speaker 2: Great, great experience, 1982, yep, 1982.  One piece of that, I mentioned this zelig kind of thing that seems to be part of my life, JFK [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and others that I could name.  So, 1982, I've moved from mini-series, they shrunk the staff in mini-series, so I took a job in broadcast standards at NBC.  And one day a person who was covering 'The Tonight Show' was the broadcast standards person, sometimes known as censor, declared she was pregnant and needed to go on maternity leave, and so the boss said, "Nelson [HistoryMaker Nelson Davis] would you like to cover 'The Tonight Show'?"  I said, "Cool, I'll do that."  Bam, I have to get up out of the chair and I walk over through 'The Tonight Show' offices and I meet Freddy de Cordova [Fred de Cordova], the executive director--producer and dah, dah, dah, "I'm the new" dah, dah, dah, "Oh" dah, dah, dah, he's a very gracious, old Hollywood guy, produced many movies (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he's well-known, Freddy de Cordova, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he says in that accent, that drawl of his, he says, "Ah, let's go and meet John [Johnny Carson]."  Off we go to another office and lighting almost like this, as a matter of fact, low-key lighting, and introduces me to Johnny Carson as the new broadcast standards person, and we have a couple of words and then Freddy excuses himself to go back, and so now there's John and me, and I've got this big grin on my face, and I said, "Mr. Carson, I just have to tell you that in 1962 I was living in Niagara Falls, New York in a basement studio apartment.  I'd just moved out of my parents' [Lorean Spears Davis and Nelson Davis, Sr.] place," which was the housing project [Center Court, Niagara Falls New York], "and I used to watch 'The Tonight Show' with Jack Paar ['Tonight Starring Jack Paar'] and then with you when you took over," and I can remember some specific things that he did.  I said, "I'm in Niagara Falls, 1962, is there any concept in my head that I'm going to be in Burbank, California working on 'The Tonight Show' sitting in the office with Johnny Carson?  No concept."  I said, "That's why I'm wearing this big grin."  We had a laugh.  He turned out to be a delightful man, very shy man, but on that show I learned so much about how shows were put together day after day after day because it was a daily show.  And even though it was a taped show, 5:30 every afternoon I had to be over there in my little booth under the stage as the broadcast standards slash censor and every day at 5:30 (snaps fingers) that downbeat happened and you know, (makes sounds), et cetera, et cetera, and I would, all of the rehearsals except for Johnny's monologue I had to attend, comedians, and I became the heavy as a censor for the show.  The talent bookers, the segment producers would rely upon me to be the bad cop.
Story_ID: 440312
Speaker 1: And one day I got a call in the office, "Nelson [HistoryMaker Nelson Davis], we got this comedian from 'Saturday Night Live' coming on the show, Eddie Murphy, and he wants to do a routine that I think you need to know about.  Can you get over here?"  "Okay."  I go over and the talent booker says to me, "See, Eddie wants to do this routine where it's an audience involved thing, and he wants the audience to say the word nigger.  And I don't think that's a good idea," but I've got to be a bad cop.  So now I'm saying, what do I say to Eddie Murphy?  He was about twenty-one, twenty-two years of age at the time.  And I'm thinking, oh m- oh lordy, what am I going to do with this one.  Now another hot potato.  I walk over to the dressing room area, (makes sounds), "Eddie Murphy, I'm Nelson Davis, I'm the broadcast standards person, and welcome to the show.  I've seen your work on 'Saturday Night Live.'  I think you're fabulous.  They tell me you want to do this routine that has blah, blah in it."  He says, "Yeah."  I said, "Well let me explain," and I was thinking on my feet.  I said, "Mr. Carson [Johnny Carson], John has a long relationship with the audience, they will allow him to do many things without them being offended."  I said, "But this is your first appearance on 'The Tonight Show' ['The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'] and you don't have that relationship with his audience, with him.  This is the first time here for you, and you may want to come back, do this more than once, so therefore, I think that it would serve your interests if you did something else."  And he just looked at me and said, "You're right," problem went away.  I thought it was going to be big issue with the headstrong, cocky, young comedian, fresh off 'SNL,' blah, blah, blah, so I had a good time and I learned so much working 'The Tonight Show.'  By the way, the only time I got into trouble with something that was said on the show was those were the days of guest host Joan Rivers.  She referred to flight attendants as high altitude hookers.  I let it go.  That got me into trouble (laughter).
Speaker 2: Really?  So people really complained, did they complain about the flight attendants (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well the Association of Flight Attendants [Association of Flight Attendants-CWA] did and threatened a lawsuit, yeah.
Speaker 2: I can imagine, right.
Speaker 1: But that was, that was a delightful period of growth and because of the show, of course, I had a chance to meet, met Lena Horne.  Not very many people I would sit, go to their dressing room to say anything.  I spent so much time with Cosby [Bill Cosby] who was a frequent guest host in those days.  Carmen McRae, met Lena Horne and the legends who are now dead, George Burns.  Who else--
Speaker 2: George Kirby even, you know, he was on the show (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah, and these people were legends who I had a chance to spend at least a little time with, and now I'm so glad I did because they are gone.  I love, I love books, and I have a library at home, and there's an upper left-hand corner, what I call the dead shelf unfortunately.  People who signed books for me who are no longer here, Jack Lemmon, Sammy Davis [Sammy Davis, Jr.], George Burns, Shelley Winters and it goes on.
Story_ID: 440313
Speaker 1: Where do we go next after the censor (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh goodness, I was at the network for a total of four years.  My mother [Lorean Spears Davis]--
Speaker 1: Oh you were the head of daytime programming.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You were telling us about that.  You started to tell us about it and what a change.  Here you were trying to become a game show host--
Speaker 2: Become a game show host.
Speaker 1: --and now you're in charge of--
Speaker 2: And now I'm the guy who deals with game show hosts and develops--and in the back of my mind were two things.  I wanted to de- I had--was given the charge of developing new programming for daytime.  I did ten pilots in one year.  But still that thing, a black game show host was in the back of my mind.  And a quick story, a man named Bob Stewart, legend in the game show business as a producer, '$25,000 Pyramid' ['The $25,000 Pyramid'] among others.  He was doing--the process is called running through, you'd run through game show hosts and see if they can do this.  Bob Stewart in an office in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] at Highland [Avenue] and I'm over there because I'm in charge of this stuff and I'm talking to Bob and Bob says, "You know, how about a black host."  I said, "I support that, Bob."  Well, you know, we haven't gotten one on the air successfully before and what quite often happens is, like when I was doing the auditions for shows and they were run- giving me run-throughs for ABC or whatever the case may be, once at CBS.  And it would get down to that questionable time when the producer and the network executive would say, "Black host has never happened before.  I don't know if this is the time, I don't know if we can."  And the producer would see, their future fortunes flash before their eyes and quickly cave in.  To say, "Okay, move on, next."  But Bob Stewart said to me, said, "Nelson [HistoryMaker Nelson Davis], if I find the hosts that I want, I'm already rich, so therefore I'm going to go, I'm going to push hard for it." And I thought that's a lesson, that's a lesson.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you finally get a black game show host (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did not.  Did not, in the time that I was there.  But at the end of my tenure at NBC, I'd gotten a new boss, won't name, who had, rode into town and said he was a genius and he was not and so that was when Merv Griffin wanted to bring 'Jeopardy!' out of mothballs.  It had been off the air for some time.  I'd been recommended by a prior producer of 'Jeopardy!' as a person who could possibly do it, and so I went to meet Merv Griffin for the first time, and we liked each other and his right-hand man, Bob Murphy, they hired me to, to work up the current version of 'Jeopardy!' and back in the NBC days, a guy who had lunch with occasionally, because he had no job, was Alex Trebek.  I'd know of Alex from his days in Toronto [Canada] as a bright, bright, bright guy who could actually play 'Jeopardy!' and so that was the beginning of a new life for me and I exec produced the pilot of 'Jeopardy!'--produced it and got it on its way.  I needed a job, and by then I got a reputation as a guy who could help rescue game shows and so I was hired to rescue and resuscitate 'Name That Tune' for a man named Sandy Frank, which I did and we put it on the air in syndication.  That was 1984 and '85 [1985].
Story_ID: 440314
Speaker 1: And then I went back to the freelance world to, I liked doing such a variety of things, but by--and I produced a documentary, one--some children's programming, children's storytelling for syndication.  I did a project in '85 [1985] called 'The Making of 'Black Mayors.''  And then in '86 [1986] I helped put The Fashion Channel on the air. What else did I do?  I produced a new series for Richard Simmons, the exercise guru.
Speaker 2: 'G.E. College Bowl' ['The General Electric College Bowl'] you mentioned that.
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was really an important show in the '60s [1960s].  I watched it as a kid and--
Speaker 1: Yes.  One of the proudest things in my professional life and it brings everything together.  This is, this is how my life goes and how my mind works.  'G.E. College Bowl' was created by a man Don Reid.  Don Reid and his sons, one of his sons, Allen [Allen Reid], who became one of my best friends, produced the game show pilot that I talked about earlier, called 'Double Cross.'  Don was a guy from Montreal [Canada] who was a member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], an older Jewish man from Europe, and he loved the idea of breaking the color line by having a black host of a show.  And he had created 'College Bowl.'  So when they looked to revive 'College Bowl,' I wasn't producing anything then, they asked me if I would be the voiceover announcer.  Now I did for its syndication on CBS.  And Allen Reid, one of the sons who directed that, became a close friend of mine.  Here's the payoff.  When I started my own business [Nelson Davis Television Productions; Nelson Davis Productions, Santa Monica, California], a show that I put together called 'Campus All-Star Challenge' really is 'College Bowl.'  I did it in partnership with the College Bowl Company, Inc.  It was for the students of historically black colleges [HBCUs].  I found a sponsor, that being Honda [Honda Motor Company], and what that did was several things.  A, it was good for my business.  It was handled by an ethnic advertising agency.  And through that program [Honda Campus All-Star Challenge], Honda has contributed close to $5 million to historically black colleges, remembering my interest in supporting education.  So that sort of, that was one of the things I'm so proud of.  I have nothing to do with it anymore because it has no television piece anymore, but the program still goes one as each March in Orlando, Florida, for the students of historically black colleges.
Speaker 2: Is there a relationship between that program and, say, the high school program ['Know Your Heritage'] that Don Jackson [HistoryMaker Donald J. Jackson] does in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: No, they're in the same category, but they have no relationship.  I think I introduced Don Jackson to Allen Reid for a whole other set of reasons, but that, Don was already doing his shows--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in Chicago.
Speaker 2: All right.  That's interesting 'cause all these things seem to be, you know, (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  There're several shows around that are high school quiz shows.
Speaker 2: Okay, in different locales and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 440315
Speaker 1: We're in the late '80s [1980s] now I guess, and we should be--
Speaker 2: Yeah, nineteen eighty- I'm up to nineteen eighty- let me see I did--
Speaker 1: In '85 [1985] you started Nelson Davis Television Productions [Nelson Davis Productions, Santa Monica, California], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah actually I started, you know, I opened a bank account I can tell you, I was producing a series called 'Star's Table' working for somebody else and what turned things was by this time I'm thinking I'd like to be in business for myself, and I went to a job interview for the small production company.  The interview went so bad that I foolishly said, or smartly, or instinctively, or whatever, said, I'm never gonna go to a job interview again, so that meant I had to do something right (laughter)?  And so I opened a bank account for Nelson Davis Television Productions in August of 1988 actually, and that was the beginning, and by 1989, I'd put a show on the air called 'Making It! Minority Success Stories' and 'Campus All-Star Challenge.'
Speaker 1: Okay.  Those two, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah (unclear).
Speaker 1: But 'Making it! Minority Business Success' [sic.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Success Stories,' yeah.  It's about small business (unclear), about the entrepreneurial spirit, the same spirit that my [paternal] grandfather, King Davis, had.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's, that's been on ever since, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I want to do it for a lot longer.  Such good fortune to have accumulated four Emmy Awards [Los Angeles Area Emmy Awards] as best public affairs series and a lot of other awards from all levels of business and government, the [U.S.] Department of Commerce, the [U.S.] Small Business Administration, and so forth.  I can take great pride in it.  Just to give you an example, just before, we're sitting down together today, yesterday a group of people from Sweden were here talking to me about that show because that want to do something to encourage entrepreneurship in Stockholm [Sweden], that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Do they want to encourage entrepreneurship amongst a--
Speaker 2: Amongst immigrants--
Speaker 1: --specific minority in Stockholm?
Speaker 2: Immigrants, which includes the minority population.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, has there been any particular episode of that show or person or company on that show that's really surprised you in terms of what they're able to do entrepreneurial (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I love the ones where we do something with them when they were small and then they became bigger, and I'll just off the top of my head choose a couple.  There was an Asian couple, brother-sister team, Helen and Marty Xi [ph.] in the flower business.  They were so naive, they froze all the flowers because they thought you put them in a fridge rather than a flower cooler, and they got into the marketing business, flash forward to 2008, and they're international marketing for some of the world's blue chip companies to Asian speakers and they have business in, they have a building in, multistory building just outside L.A. [Los Angeles, California] plus a branch in China.  They probably do $500 million a year in business, and when we met them they were scuffling with the flower shop.  Billy Blanks, the exercise guy, we did Billy Blanks story way back when Bill was, you know, thinking I'm gonna do something here with this exercise program.  And he's gone on to greater fame.  There's lots of stories.  The kind of story that does my heart good is to quick ones.  This just ten days ago.  A guy called me, Louis [ph.], who's in the security business in Beverly Hills [California] in the west side, specializing in the Persian population.  He said, "I got--when I was in Los Angeles and I watched your show in 1989, I didn't know what I was gonna do, I was working part-time, working two jobs, scuffling.  I was a concierge, I was this, I was that," and he said, "I watched your show, and that helped nourish me." So today he has a major security firm with a hundred employees and he said it was the show that got him focused.  Those were the ones that are satisfying to me.  I think in my heart of hearts, I love the idea of using media to help people and to do good to help channel thinking to show them that there may be another way if they feel they're suffering.  Underneath it all, though it says 'Making It! Minority Success Stories,' I don't believe that race has anything to do with it, or gender has anything to do with it.
Speaker 1: With the success itself?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You're either good at it or not.  Business is good or bad, and if you have the desire and the drive you can get from here to there.
Story_ID: 440316
Speaker 1: So do you have a philosophy of production in a sense?  I mean you seem to be involved in a lot of projects that have a dual purpose, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I love that.  It's my Libra nature, I think.  Everybody at the table has to come away with something.  I never sit down at a table to negotiate or propose a deal where it's all about me, or all about you.  It's got to be benefit to everybody in the room, at some level.  And that's what I'm always searching for.  So it's programs, on the nose.  For instance, 'Jeopardy!'--classic example.  People say, but you, you did game shows.  I said 'Jeopardy!' was one of the most educational experiences I've ever had.  We would play fifty to sixty-four pieces of material during a half an hour.  And the research and things that you went through was phenomenal as to what you could learn.  'Name That Tune,' I loved music.  And so those meetings to vet the various tunes we were going to use and have the arrangements done for the orchestra, that's fabulous for me.  It's educational.  And for people at home, 'Jeopardy!' I mean, I talked to people who are probably genius level who loved watching 'Jeopardy!'  I learned something, so my belief, and I was going through pictures for this, I looked at pictures I was on, I was a broadcast standards person for 'Diff'rent Strokes' so I spent a lot of time with Gary [Gary Coleman] and those folks and they all signed a loving picture to me and all of that, and I said sitcoms, as I look back, it was like junk food.  When the laughs calm down, that's all I took away from it, along with some friendships.  But I said with the other stuff, the stuff that stretches a long period of time and I can harvest the human good from that, so electronic media for human good is the philosophy that I carry around as to the things that I endeavor to do. Because at my age, I'm only gonna do this for a few more years.  I don't believe in retirement but I'll do something differently.  I'm starting a 501(c)(3) for the education of entrepreneurs, and like that.  This is--all of this has enabled me to live a truly interesting life.
Story_ID: 440317
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community at large?
Speaker 2: An excellent question.  I want my community to know that in the end it's not about what happens in Washington [D.C.], though that's meaningful, it's not about necessarily where you went to school, though that's meaningful.  It's about you and your striving and your belief that you can have what you want to have, go where you want to go and be what you want to be.  I want five year-old kids to know that.  I was so privileged that by the fifth grade [at Center Avenue School, Niagara Falls, New York], I had teachers telling me that, and a mother [Lorean Spears Davis] who told me that.  I had a cousin [Eddie Palmore] who told me that, and so therefore I grew up simply believing that there were barriers but there were not impossibilities in that regard.  So if there's something in our community and it echoes what Bill Cosby says, parental responsibility is important, but the kids have to know that there's a world of possibilities and it can be their individual desires, dreams and possibilities.  You go and you talk to a [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy or today it may be P. Diddy [Sean Combs] that you're talking to, and the conversation is always about the possibilities.  It's always about doing it.  It's not about, oh, you know, they won't let me.  When they say that to me I always say, exactly who is they that won't let you?  I'm a person who goes around knocking out crutches.  When people lean on a crutch as an excuse for not doing something, not achieving something, I'm the person who comes along like a meanie and kicks the crutch to say, yes you can.
Story_ID: 440318
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything that you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure.  I would have gone to college, probably studied science, maybe international relations, I would have done that.  I would have concentrated more and focused myself and worked a bit harder on some of the things, like being that game show host.  I would have enjoyed that.  I would have enjoyed doing that for a certain period of time, I'm sure.  Those are the, are two of the big things in my life that I would have done differently.
Story_ID: 440319
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back on what you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy? I mean at this moment.
Speaker 2: This small business thing, this entrepreneurial thinking and economic empowerment took over my life and became a mission for me.  I thought I'd do it for three years and here it is nineteen years later.  And so the stories that I told you earlier, the things that I know that I brought tangibly to people's lives and with the support of business communities and politicians and other people, that to me is a proud achievement, along with enabling millions of dollars to be given to historically black schools [HBCUs] through the Campus All-Star Challenge program that we created with Honda [Honda Campus All-Star Challenge].  Those two things are some of my proudest achievements and to have reached this age in good health and having things in my life that I wanted as that fourteen year-old or that seventeen year-old.  You know, the things that my mother [Lorean Spears Davis] and father [Norman Davis, Sr.] would not necessarily have imagined even though they were encouraging.  Those are the things.
Speaker 1: What did they think about your success?  I mean did they ever think that you would make it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'll give you some quickies.  A, they were proud when they could turn on the radio and hear their son, or eventually turn on the television, see their son.  I used to own an airplane years ago and I learned to fly, remember I wanted to fly, so here's how I do things.  I bought an airplane before I had a pilot's license.  I learned to fly, I learned to fly pretty well, twins and so forth, and I flew home once to, and to Niagara Falls [New York], and I said, "Come to the airport, see my airplane." And my father did, my mother didn't.  My sister did, you know, those kinds of things.  I wanted to say, you know those dreams that I used to make you grumpy about sometimes because I wouldn't let go, I said that's what I think life is meant to do is to live your dreams, and here's one of mine right here.
Story_ID: 441595
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your family, you know, today.
Speaker 2: You mean my, my--not my mother [Lorean Spears Davis] and father [Nelson Davis, Sr.], but the family today (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, your immediate family, yeah.
Speaker 2: Married, same woman, twenty-two years.  I was single for a long time because I like traveling and as that kid, you know, with, the the ideas of--you know, the simply things and the goals, you measure your life sometimes in simply goals, and so as a kid I wanted to gamble in the casino at Monte Carlo [Monaco]. I wanted to travel; I wanted to go to Africa, I wanted to go to South America.  So, I combined business and pleasure and I did a travel show for some years for the Canadian Broadcasting Corp [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation].  It took me to many of those places.  I took an assignment to direct a film in Africa that would take me there for some period of time, all of those things, so for whatever reason--here, we're gonna step back a step, as a youngster I thought I wanted to go into politics for a while because I had a cousin who ran for city council in Niagara Falls [New York], and I thought that would be my way of influencing people's lives.  I abandoned that.  I knew too many politicians eventually, and the media became my way of influencing people's lives. And I say that to say, at some instinctive level I knew that I probably would not have children in this life for whatever reason.  I love kids.  I have nieces and nephews, eight of them. And so therefore, the, my life as an adult and coming at marriage late in life, though I had previous long-term relationships with some delightful women, it was known to me in the inside that my interface with young America, young black men and women would come in other ways, 'Campus All-Star Challenge,' the quiz series for the students at historically black colleges [HBCUs], and other things that I have done have been my way of reaching out to the young community simply because I don't have children of my own.  I remember sitting in my mother's kitchen back there in probably the '70s [1970s], all of my sisters had children and I said, "Ma, you know--," I'd recently bought a piece of real estate at that time.  I bought a duplex and I said, "Ma, you know, I got this contract for this duplex.  It says if I do this, this, this and this and this, in fifteen years it'll be mine, be paid for, it will be mine."  So the contract closes.  I said, but with kids the contract never closes and that scares the crap out of me.  So that shapes my present family life.  So nieces and nephews and the outreach I do, I speak at schools, inner city kids.  I've done a lot of, I've gotten one of the officers of the foundation for the Television Academy [Television Academy Foundation]. Internships, making sure that there's minority kids who are considered for the internships.  I sat on the board of trustees for National University [California], which is an adult education school, but always looking to be sure that opportunities are put in front of young black men and women in however I can encouraging them and my employees with internships and all.  That has been sort of a surrogate family for me.  There's one ex-employee who worked for me for eight years.  Her name was Kimberly Holmes-Lamar, now the mother of two, and I knew her when she was a single young woman  trying to get a date (laughter) all the way through working for me, and her mother called me one day and she said, "You know, Nelson [HistoryMaker Nelson Davis], I'm so proud of my daughter and what you have helped her do in becoming an adult, a producer, award winning, she's responsible and she's good at what she does and I attribute a lot of that to you."  So, I've seen my employees as extended family.
Story_ID: 441596
Speaker 1: Is there anything else we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness, if there's such a thing as promoting media as a career choice for somebody, this is 2008 and this, whenever anybody looks at this piece of tape, whether it's a day or decade, electronic media and communication, I think will guide so much of our future lives and so that is a legacy I want to leave is that people understand that there's rampant opportunity, no matter what the economy's doing at any given time, electric media offers fabulous opportunities for communication, across gender, ethnicity, race and borders.
Story_ID: 441597
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Makes sound) As a humanist, different from humanitarian.  A humanist means that, to me anyway, while taking great pride in being a black American that I also take great pride in recognizing the innate humanity of all people around this rock that we all live on, regardless of the upbringing, regardless of their religious beliefs.  So I want to be remembered as a humanist, and, I guess a subset of that is if the work that I have done either through broader outreach that electronic media allows or in one on one contact being in the room with somebody and saying something, if it opened a door for them in their head because everything follows what you think, if it opened a thought door so that they could see themselves as meaningful, as whole, as useful, as productive, as being God's creatures on this earth, that's how I want to be remembered.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much for spending the time with us.
Speaker 2: Oh, the pleasure is mine to talk about--thank you for being such a patient listener (laughter).
Story_ID: 441598
Speaker 1: Lorean Spears Davis and Nelson Lee-Earnest Davis, Sr. [Nelson Davis, Sr.], and this photograph was taken in the mid-1970s.
Speaker 2: This was the beginning of our 'Making It! Minority Success Stories' show.  Michele Ruiz and Larry McCormick, the hosts of the show, and I'm hanging out in the middle with a strange backdrop (laughter).
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Nelson Davis as game show pilot host on a show called 'Double Cross,' and that was from 1973.
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-nine [1979], directing a number of spots for ex-governor Ronald Reagan [Ronald Wilson Reagan] about to be President Ronald Reagan, and he was endorsing a group of twenty-four candidates for various offices so that he'd have his face out in front of the public because he knew he was going to take a shot at the White House [Washington, D.C.] and I got chosen as the director for those spots.
Speaker 1: My grandmother, Pauline [Pauline Spears (ph.)], on the right, and her sister Mahalia [ph.] on the left.  Grandma Pauline lived, my mother's mother, lived in Montgomery, Alabama, and Mahalia lived near there.  Mahalia is the product of her mother, I mean my great-grandmother and the slave owner.
Speaker 2: I had the privilege of winning four Emmy Awards [Los Angeles Area Emmy Awards] for best public affairs series and that is one of those enthusiastic evenings.  Oh, that was, let me see, hold on, I can probably tell you, that would be like 1998.
Speaker 1: This was our first Emmy Award, and this takes us back to 1992.
Speaker 2: The--I'll pass on that one.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: You can pass on that one also.
Speaker 1: The game shows have been important to me and some of my buddies were game shows and we found ourselves together for an occasion.  Jim Perry on the left, he was the host of a couple of shows, including 'Dream House' [sic.], I believe, myself, Alex Trebek, most famous as the host of 'Jeopardy!' Pat Sajak, most famous as the host of 'Wheel of Fortune,' and Pat Sajak's agent friend.
Speaker 2: In my days at the network, I mentored a couple of people trying to encourage them and one of them was a young man to my left, or right I should say, in this picture named Brad Garrett, who went on to fame as one of the star players of 'Everybody Loves Raymond.'
Speaker 1: As a producer I've gotten to meet such fun folks over the years.  I do have to confess that Jayne Kennedy, I always had a crush on her so on this show, which was called 'Star's Table' shot at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel [Los Angeles, California] in 1986.  Jayne Kennedy is pictured with her daughter and the actor [Ted Lange] who played Isaac [Isaac Washington] on 'Love Boat' [The Love Boat'].
Speaker 2: In the, we've been privileged to receive lots of awards and this one is receiving supplier of the year award as a supplier of, to the southern--supplier to the gas company.  They were one of the sponsors of the 'Making It!' show.
Speaker 1: For 'Making It!' we did an awards show some years ago and we gave awards to minority business owners.  We created a special award and this is a gathering of those awards recipients.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980], Nelson Davis getting that staff photo done joining the NBC television network.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: We can pass on that one.
Speaker 1: During my network days in various departments, we would put on gatherings for the station affiliates and in daytime one of the pilots I did was a show called, shoot, I for- maybe we called it 'Just Men!' And one of the people we had in the pilot was Mr. T, and then a host, one of the host daytime was Alan Thicke there with his wife Gloria Loring and me.
Speaker 2: Sure.  In Los Angeles [California], politicians even climb aboard the bandwagon for minority business, and from the left is Mark Ridley-Thomas who's now running for board of supervisors [Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors].  My favorite mayor, Mayor Richard Riordan, who really believed in business because he's a businessman himself, and me and our show was embraced by city hall with great awards and all of city council as supervisors and I was grateful for that.
Speaker 1: One of my idols growing up in Niagara Falls [New York] I could hear Canadian stations and a man named Lorne Greene became famous.  Lorne Greene became famous because of 'Bonanza,' and once I moved to Los Angeles, we had some knowledge in common and places in common and I used to see Lorne on a fairly regular basis.  Interestingly, he didn't like his own voice.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISUCSSION)
Speaker 1: King Davis, a restless soul, a bit of a player and a courageous merchant who drove a Model T Ford [Ford Model T] with a Winchester rifle under the seat because he didn't want anybody to mess with him.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: One of the people I befriended early on were people who were doing the blaxploitation and beyond movies, and my favorite person was Fred Williamson, sometimes known as The Hammer, and the young lady in between was Miss Black California.  So, and that crazy outfit I'm wearing, I was the master of ceremonies for whatever the occasion was.  Fred still is in my universe, he lives out in Palm Springs, California and the lady in the middle now has a family (laughter).
