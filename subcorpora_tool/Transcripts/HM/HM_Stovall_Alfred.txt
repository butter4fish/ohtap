Story_ID: 59154
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's talk about your beginnings.  Can you give us the names of your parents and their birth dates and spell their names for us?
Speaker 2: I'll do the best I can.  My mother's name is Arrie.  Her maiden name is Jones.  It's A-R-R-I-E and my father's name is Franz, F-R-A-N-Z, Stovall, S-T-O-V-A-L-L.  They were both from Alabama.  My mom was born in 1917 and my dad is born about nine years before that.  I'm not sure of his date.  It says (unclear).  I don't know that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Maybe about 1908, I guess.
Speaker 2: That's pretty good, yeah, 1917, probably, yeah.  I remember something like 1911, but I think birth date was on 11th also, so, November the 11th, so that may have been what the 11 was all about.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they were--were they both born in Birmingham?
Speaker 2: Not necessarily, Birmingham.  My mother was from Uniontown, Alabama and dad was from--I think he was right from Birmingham, though, right out in Ensley, Ensley Avenue, which is right in the heart of Birmingham.
Story_ID: 59155
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did--did either one of them have stories about their ancestors?  Stories that come from reconstruction or from slavery?
Speaker 2: My mom does.  She still has some pictures of how we had the light skin into our family.  Probably three or four generations back from her.  The family was--were slaves and the great-grandmother worked in the big house.  And as a result of that union, we had several off-springs and it seems to be the beginning of the Bennett Jones family.  If you look at some of the pictures that my mom have up on our wall, you could--it looked like some old reconstruction generalist-generals back there (Simultaneous).  That was interesting on her part as opposed to my dad--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --sharecroppers.  My dad's grandparents were sharecroppers and then and not much about his father other than that.  I can remember Grandma Hassie, that was his mother, she loved to fish.  Was not a good cook, which was unusual back in those days.  But that is about all I could remember.  Now, my dad was a musician and part-time musician.  Worked for--he played clarinet for Coleman Hawkins.  And also worked in the steel mill, so I doubt that was very interesting.  And as I was a little boy, I was--it was always fun for me to sit on his lap and he would pick up the clarinet and maybe once a year and just go back and just play all those old tunes, just--that was just very interesting.  And I guess that's where I got an interest in jazz.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he--he played with Coleman Hawkins.  Was he on the road a lot--at--at one time?
Speaker 2: At one time he was and he always played when he came to Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they would move around and he would go with them sometime.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, so, when you were small, he was off and on with Coleman Hawkins?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, that's something.  Did--did his--now did you--did your grandparents have any stories about the past that they passed on to you or--songs or anything?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, which was married to my mother's mother, an interesting thing about him.  He was a very virulent, big man, hardworking man.  He's a farmer from the--parents, whose parents were sharecroppers.  He had a team of horses even after the family had automobile.  He kept farm animals.  He kept a little area that he plowed and grew vegetables.  And at the age of sixty-four, sixty-five, he left my grandmother and went off to start a whole new family.  Had two more children. Started a whole new family but he and my grandmother remained friends.  So this was an unusual situation there but that's what I can remember about my granddad.  Sitting up on his wagon and doing work.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is your father--your--
Speaker 2: My mother's (simultaneous) mother's husband.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his name was, Andrew Stephens (ph.).
Speaker 1: All right and anything else you may remember about your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Nope, we lived in a steel mill project, my grandparents did, right next to Republic Steel area. I remember the dirt and the people washing their clothes on certain days when there was no by-product being generated when the smoke would come.  I remember them sweeping their yards with brooms every day to keep from weeding, even though there was no grass.  And it was a fun time.  Poor as we were but we were happy.  Those were good times for me.
Story_ID: 59156
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kinds of things did you like to do when you were a kid and can you even--just continue with some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in your neighborhood?  What was your neighborhood called?
Speaker 2: My neighborhood was called, Ensley, Ensley, Alabama.  This was kind of an upscale black neighborhood.  Had some brick homes, frame homes.  Had a street--we had an ice house, we had a grocery store, which was--I think it was Jewish.  And--and the sounds were to be up to the ice house.  Would sit there and watch the people go by and see the transitions from horse and buggy time to automobiles, horseless carriages.  I really date myself.  And the other things were--there was a low end of the street which I was not allowed to go to on 18th Avenue.  I could go anywhere within a block radius about.  We lived two blocks from Tuxedo Junction.  Tuxedo Junction, I remember because of the food at Tuxedo Junction.  Barbeque, hot dogs, mostly barbeque.  It was just--that's what--that's what Tuxedo Junction was, a place where you could get a haircut and--and people hung out on the weekends.
Speaker 1: It was named after a song--or the song was named after it.
Speaker 2: The song was named after it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Tuxedo Junction is the--actually it's--it's a street car stop, called Tuxedo Junction, where the street car would stop there and you go from one car to the next, on the corner of 20th Street and 18th Avenue, or something like that, in Birmingham.  That was Tuxedo Junction.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I didn't know that was the Tux--that's the Tuxedo Junction.
Speaker 2: That's the Tuxedo Junction.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  Was that a Glen Miller song or who was it--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Duke Ellington?
Speaker 2: --Duke Ellington, or, I'm trying to think.  It might have been before Duke even.  I think it was before Duke but Duke did it--did it.
Story_ID: 59157
Speaker 1: All right.  What are some of the things that you all enjoyed to do, you know, that you enjoyed doing as a young--young man?
Speaker 2: My earliest recollection probably is about three to five years old, I don't know.  I happened to break my leg one day jumpin' on the couch and my mother was telling me not to do it.  She was ironing some clothes.  It was my first recollection in life.  And I remember that couch and I jumped.  My legs slipped down through it and she didn't know the leg was broken and she came in and give me the devil for it.  And that's the first thing I could remember.  Then after I got the cast on it, I remember using that cast to get sympathy from my mom and dad and grandparents, dragging around.  And after a few weeks the cast disappeared.  I drug it so much that it came off but that was the first recollection in life and I don't know what I did every day except I went to work with my mom.  She was--she was a hairdresser.  I remember sitting in her beauty shop eating crackers and jelly.  And that's about it.  Riding a--riding a scooter that we made with old skates and a two by four.  This was a little later, probably about the age of six or seven.
Story_ID: 59158
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any other siblings, I mean, or--
Speaker 2: No, I was an only child (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Oh, an only child.
Speaker 2: --but I was close to a cousin, named Donovan, who was a--Donovan was a Stovall and he--this was my dad's, mother's grandson, which is my cousin.  My dad's nephew.
Speaker 1: So you said you lived in the projects?
Speaker 2: My grandmother did--
Speaker 1: Okay, grandmother --
Speaker 2: --on my--on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: And you all lived in--in this--
Speaker 2: We lived in Ensley
Speaker 1: This upscale
Speaker 2: --but I stayed a lot with my grandparents--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --and I spent a lot of summers there as my family moved North, I would go back and spend the summers 'cause mom and dad were working a lot and I kind of enjoyed being there with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you in around Birmingham long enough to--to have any recollection of what the black community was like there?
Speaker 2: A little bit, a little bit.  I don't remember any violence in the black community back in those days.  I remember survivors.  There were people who--who did things in the community that provided services.  These were people other than, you know, the beauticians, the barbers and people with wagons that came by selling food.  That's about all I can remember but it sort of comes and goes.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you go to school in Birmingham?
Speaker 2: Just for a year because at the age of six or seven we came to Fort Wayne.  I remember going to a Catholic grade school for one year.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it an all black?
Speaker 2: No, come to think of it, it was not.  It was a--it was a mixed kindergarten--Catholic school.
Speaker 1: And that was unusual for Birmingham, right?
Speaker 2: It was--it was very unusual.  It was Council School and I don't know how the sisters happened to be there but I remember the sisters and I remember the rulers and gettin' tapped on the hands and I remember seeing white people.
Story_ID: 59159
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, you came to Fort Wayne [Indiana] when you were about seven years old?
Speaker 2: That's probably correct, yes.
Speaker 1: And, what--what brought you to Fort Wayne [Indiana]?  I mean how--why did your family move to Fort Wayne?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, on my mother's side, was here.  He had left.  This was my grandmother's first husband, Ferguson, Samuel Ferguson.  He had left Birmingham [Alabama] and then he come to Fort Wayne [Indiana].  He had lived in Fort Wayne for some years.  He was also working at the International Harvester, here.  He was doing quite well.  We came to Fort Wayne to visit with him.  My dad hadn't been working at the steel mill, Republic Steel, and he was on his way to Detroit [Michigan] for a better job.  And we stopped here and talked with my grandfather and he sent him out to get some interviews.  He said they were hiring at GE [General Electric] and at the [International] Harvester.  So my dad went and the first place he went was to the GE, they hired him, he'd never gotten further, so we've been here ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: That's how we got here.
Speaker 1: Yeah, how was Fort Wayne [Indiana] different from Birmingham [Alabama]?  Do you have any--any recollection of a difference between the two?
Speaker 2: There was more structure.  The city was, for me, even though Birmingham [Alabama] was a larger city, my environment had expanded because there was a distance between my house and school, which I walked, and after school, to go to my mom's place of business, was another walk which means it was a larger area for me.  That was the biggest thing.  It was--our family was pretty close since I was an only child and I felt I was pretty well protected so it really wasn't much different for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: --except the seasons.  Now, remember the seasons here.  The cold was something new for us.  The snow.  The getting the clothes and getting prepared in shoveling snow 'cause we were living in the basement of a Mr. Baber's house.  Mr. Baber owned a jewelry store here in Fort Wayne, Baber Jewelry.  My dad worked for him part-time cleaning counters and cleaning--cleaning up.  And we had a basement apartment down there that we paid third--$15 a month for.  We stayed there for a long time.  And I remember doing those things for the first time in my life.  Cuttin' grass, raking leaves, shoveling snow.  We didn't do that in Birmingham.
Speaker 1: The temperatures stayed pretty mild--
Speaker 2: Birmingham was mild, yeah.  Either hot or mild.
Story_ID: 59160
Speaker 1: Oh, did your mother and father have a story of how they met?
Speaker 2: I'm sure she's told me that many times.  I think she saw him playing horn one night in Ensley [Alabama] after she had gotten off work.  She and some girls, I think she said, went down and that's where she met him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did he continue to play at--after you moved to Fort Wayne?
Speaker 2: No, no.  My dad was just a workaholic.  He just worked.  He worked for GE [General Electric]thirty-two years and took one day off the whole time he worked there.  That was because he had a surgery.  It was during a shut down and--and he had--he got--he was a day late going back after shut down.  So, no, he, all he did was work.  He and I fished a little bit but he had no other hobbies.  All he--he worked two jobs all his life.
Speaker 1: So he wasn't around very much, right?
Speaker 2: No, but I worked with him on the weekends.  I'd get with him and I'd go help him worked on neighbors on the weekends.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you and your dad close?
Speaker 2: We were very close.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He and I went fishing like fifteen years.  I took him to Canada once I became a physician.  We went to Canada and fished.  We'd fly into the lake and fish.  And now I can't do that any more without him, you know, now that he died, ten, twelve years ago.  I haven't been back to Canada again.  It's just--it's just something I just couldn't do.  But my boys are after me to do it so we may.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If they pay for the trip, I'll go with 'em.
Speaker 1: How many sons do you have?
Speaker 2: I have three sons.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Do you have any--any girls?
Speaker 2: I have one son--one daughter, Dina.  Dina's the youngest.  She's the baby.  When I say baby, she's about 34.
Story_ID: 59161
Speaker 1: Tell me about school in Fort Wayne.  Where did you go to grade school and how did you like it and how did you fit in?
Speaker 2: Grade school, Harmar, Harmar Grade School.  It's--it's been torn down last fifteen, twenty years.  And I enjoyed it.  I remember some of the teachers were very--very difficult and it was--Harmar was mixed and it was not a segregated school.  As I remember, it was probably fifty-fifty.  So, the teachers were rough on you.  The principals were rough.  At that time, paddling was not a problem, it was expected, not a rarity.  I didn't find school difficult.  There were some bullies. I remember some giving--one day being chased home.  I was--Billy Burnett was the bully and he chased me home when I was goin' so fast I went right by my house and the other thing my mom came out and screamed at him, hollered at him and--and we've been good friends ever--ever since.  But the Burnetts--I can remember that vividly but that was early on.  School was always enjoyable.  I don't have any bad experiences from school.  It was enjoyable.
Speaker 1: So what--what did you enjoy about it the most?
Speaker 2: Like other kids, I enjoyed the recess.  I enjoyed going to school.  Coming home from school.  The casework was non-descript, I don't recall, no.  I enjoyed courses in shop.  Things that I could do manually with my hand.  The other work, math, science and those things came pretty easy.  They weren't difficult.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have any--any particular teachers that stand out in--as, I guess, role models and mentors for you?
Speaker 2: There's a teacher in high school, but not in grade school.  When I got to high school, my homeroom teacher, her name was Mrs. Spangler, she ran the science--nature--nature and science.  She was outstanding to me because I took an interest in things such as trees and birds, the Audubon Society.  The different trees of Indiana.  And I made it a point to try to memorize those things.  As a result, I became president of the Nature Society for two years in high school and she was always encouraging for me.  My grades weren't always the best and then when she looked at my report card, she would give me more grief than my mom and dad would if it was not up to what she felt in my ability.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she had a real--real sense that you can do a lot better.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you feel any pressure from home to do a lot better, or--?
Speaker 2: My mom asked me, "Did you do it--are you doing as well as you can."  If I told her yes, she left me alone.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it wasn't a lot of pressure.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't a lot of pressure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I didn't bring home "D"s and "F"s and, you know, "C"s, she would look at, but she didn't give me a lot of pressure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't give her a lot of trouble either.
Story_ID: 59162
Speaker 1: Right so, yeah, well, so what kind of young man were you at school?  Were you--you--I--I assume you probably were not a troublemaker?
Speaker 2: No, I was fairly quiet.  I was not a troublemaker.  I--in high school, I loved school and I'd go to work up to the "Y" [YMCA].  I'd come home, help clean the house up for my mom--'cause she wouldn't come in till eight or 10:00 at night from working.  She was working eight in the morning.  She'd get up at eight and 10:00 at night in her beauty shop.  And then dad, of course, had gone to GE [General Electric] at 3:18 and he didn't off till 11:48.  As I got older, in high school, I got to keep the car so in summer times I'd take him to GE at 3:18 and I'd make sure I was sitting out there on Taylor Street, pick him up at 11:48.  But I was no trouble.  I didn't drink.  I didn't smoke.  Probably tried weed a couple of times with the kids in high school.  Didn't particularly care for 'em.  So I was good.  I was a fairly good kid.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you have any sense at that time when you're in high school that you wanted to be a doctor?
Speaker 2: Not at all.  I knew it was something that my mother wanted me to be because Dr. [Roland Byer] Wilson had done a lot for Fort Wayne and a lot of people in Fort Wayne and--and--everybody kind of looked at Dr. Wilson as a role model.
Speaker 1: Okay, then tell us about Dr. Wilson.  Do you know his first name and--
Speaker 2: Our being, yeah.
Speaker 1: The little stuff he did.
Speaker 2: Roland Byer Wilson.  Practiced medicine here back in '40s [1940s] or before, after he came out of the Service.  My mother was working down on the avenue, which is Lafayette Street.  When he came back from the Service, she gave him some water out of her place to go clean his new office that he built and within a few years he was extremely, extremely successful position.  He did surgery.  He did babies.  He did house calls.  He did it all.  His brother was a dentist who worked around the corner and he was just successful and he was generous and he was good but he was--he was blunt to the point.  His language was not always the best but he got his point across.  And my mom kind of admired him because he was successful and he is--had survived.  And she wanted me to be there when, I think, I started rebelling because I just, you know, it was just more than I think I could bear.  But that's--I didn't decide to be a doctor until after I had left college the first time.
Story_ID: 59163
Speaker 1: What about high school graduation?  At the time of graduation, were you--and you were the president of the Nature Club in high school, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Right, and did you have a lot of pets at home and--did you--did you like animals, a lot?
Speaker 2: We always had a dog.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was about the extent of pets because pets required love and affection and time and we didn't have a lot of time but he was my responsibility.  Usually the pets were and it was always dogs.  Always dogs.  But as far as nature, I'm--I fished a lot at Three Rivers.  I hunt and fished every river in Fort Wayne.  So I learned the sycamore trees, the dogwoods, and I just learned all the different trees.  The cottonwoods, the poplars and it was--it was just a hobby of mine--nature was.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, when you--when you graduated from high school, now you--now you went to--what--what high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to Central [High School].
Speaker 1: Central.
Speaker 2: Central High School.  Central was torn down in an effort to integrate the higher education system here in Fort Wayne [Indiana].  It was the inner city high school, very good.
Speaker 1: It was torn down much later, though?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was torn down much later, after I left, yeah.  While--but my senior year, I took some tests and it says that I was proficient in chemistry and engineering and that's--was my reason for going to college to pursue a degree in Chemical Engineering.  But my interest once I got liberated from home, I turned to other things.  I really didn't apply myself at Purdue [University].  I didn't really enjoy engineering.
Story_ID: 59164
Speaker 1: Now, did you get any kind of financial assistance to go to Purdue?
Speaker 2: I had a scholarship.  I had an academic scholarship for one year, probably for $500, which was a lot of money back then.  I started out at the main campus in West Lafayette, Indiana and stayed there a year and three quarters.  I left in the middle of the year.  Just left school and decided to go out and work.  So I was out of school for about four years and worked in California, worked in New York, Rochester, New York, as an orderly in tuberculosis--tuberculosis sanitarium.  I didn't like that.  And my cousin, Donovan, who I was close to as a child, lived there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--you--in California did you go--go to live with relatives there too?
Speaker 2: No, when I just took off one day and just got in my car and packed and there was a guy who wanted to go to California, I said, well, I'll take you and we just took off at about $100--a bargain.  And we--we took off to San Francisco [California] and stayed there waking in a motel there and really found work.  It wasn't hard to find work if you really wanted a job.  You couldn't find out what you wanted but you could always do something.  So I sold china, sold tires, I did a lot of--did stuff in retail.  Enjoyed life, yes sir.  Those were fun years--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as a young man because it was fun hangin' out, stayin' out all night.  Doing the things young men do.  I was kind of catchin' up 'cause I knew that--that back in Fort Wayne [Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a good time in California.  Then you said you moved to New York after that?
Speaker 2: No, New York first, then--
Speaker 1: Then New York--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I came through home.  Mom said, no, you can't move back so I just kept on going.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Went to California and stayed out there for a year or two and then I talked to mom, she said, okay you can come home but why don't you to go back to school.
Story_ID: 59165
Speaker 1: Okay, you had a pretty good time in California but you--
Speaker 2: Right, while in California I worked--I worked at the Post Office, took the--took the exam, the Post Office exam, and aced it and so I was able to get a job even though I didn't have a--a military preference.  Most of the veterans would get jobs there 'cause they had a ten point preference.  But I was working nights, had night bonus, so I was making pretty good money so I bought me a nice car and then I found out I didn't have enough time to enjoy myself so I quit that and started doing a sales job.  So I went and sold china, out in Watts, Compton [California], and the money stopped rolling in so I said well, I'll go sell for General Tire Company.  The guy asked me to sell for them.  Did that and it was pretty good and then I just got tired of working and I called my mom and said, I think I want to go back to school.  And she said, yeah, come on home but, you know, you can't stay here unless you go to school and work.  And I did, I came back.  Got a job at the hospital.  Got a job at city, lifeguarding.  Had three jobs.  Was lifeguarding daytime, cleaning pools at night and I was lifeguarding, cleaning pool.  What else did I do--orderly.  I was an orderly at St. Joe Hospital, I mean Parkview Hospital.
Speaker 1: It says you had three jobs going at one time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what was your day like?  You know, what did you do?
Speaker 2: I slept at the hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I slept there. The day, I was a lifeguard.  During the day I was a lifeguard.  In the morning I'd get up and I left the hospital in the morning about seven, 8:00, I'd go directly to the pools and I'd clean four city pools.  After cleaning the pools, I'd go to work at the pool.  Would open the pool up at Memorial Park and I worked there till--till 6:00 at night, at which time I'd go home, clean up and go to the hospital.  So I did that the one summer and that's when I got interested.  I met some doctors when I was working as an orderly at Parkview Hospital.  New doctors in town, they're outstanding physician.  Now there was one Dr. Pretty (ph.) and, Dr. Albright, who used to be a coroner here.  But they were fairly fresh and new and I just--I said to myself one night when I was talking to the nurses, I said, boy, these--if these two guys can be physicians and have the troubles they have communicating as well as doing their job, and, you know, I think, it's something I can probably do.  It's something that's what my mother always did want me to do.  So I saved my money and I decided to go back.
Story_ID: 59166
Speaker 1: Went to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] with the intentions of going to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  And as I told you earlier, I talked to--while--while at Fisk University, I was the boss of my fraternity, Omega Psi Phi, and we had a conclave in Nashville [Tennessee].  Dr. Nesbitt [sic, Dr. James M. Nabrit, Jr.], who was also a Que, came down and we were sitting next to each other and he asked me what was I gonna do with myself.  I said, "Well, when I leave Fisk, I'm gonna graduate and I'm gonna go on to Meharry."  He says, why don't you, you know, give Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] the opportunity.  I said, well I did, but they turned me down.  They put me on a waiting list.  He says, well, if you're on a waiting list, they have just about everything except your last half semester's information.  He said, would you send me that.  I did that and then two weeks. I had an entry into Howard University and that's how medicine started for me and it like all started with these two doctors that I--I credit them today.  So the things that they did made me believe that I could also do it.
Speaker 2: Okay, and Dr. Nesbitt [sic, Dr. James M. Nabrit, Jr.].  What's his full name and can you spell it for us?
Speaker 1: Dr. N-E-S-B-I-T-T.  He was the president of Howard University, the entire Howard University back at that time which was in the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Probably would have been 1964.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Mid '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: All right, so, in--so was it 1964 that you--you go to--
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966].  I graduated, yeah, I left--I left Fisk University in 1966.  I had not graduated but because I had the admission to Howard [University], I went straight to Howard.  Since that time, Fisk University has given me an honorary degree as long as you pay alumni dues and so I started in '60[1960], no, let's see, I went to med school from '62 [1962] to '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's right, '62 [1962] to '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: Okay, so you started at Howard [University]--
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: --in '62 [1962]--
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in '62 [1962] 'cause I did an internship in '67 [1967] and I went directly to--to the service.
Story_ID: 59167
Speaker 1: During that time period that you were in medical school, out on--there was a lot of turmoil in Birmingham [Alabama].  I am just trying to find out if you had any relatives there that were caught up in any of the civil rights activity or did you have--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --chance of--
Speaker 2: --my mother came to Washington [D.C.] with me and we participated on the March on Washington.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: We were in a crowd right in front of Martin Luther King [Jr.] when he made his, "I Have A Dream" speech.  We were about 20 rows deep and we walked that day.  That was--we didn't do much of the sit-in's because I was in med school and I didn't have any relatives in Birmingham [Alabama] at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so none of that turmoil down there affected your family at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I mean directly?
Speaker 2: Not directly.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  How was the march out of Washington?  I mean, tell us--
Speaker 2: It was probably one of the most memorable days in my life.  It was hot, a lot of people, lot of happy people.  There was no fuss and no crowding, no pushing, no pullin'.  Everybody had a reason for being there and well organized, and my mother and I felt that we should participate and we did.  I don't remember all of the particulars of how we got out of there and the crowds and where we found parking.  We may have gone down on the bus from school and then caught the bus back.  I think it's probably what we did and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was a memorable time, historically for me.
Story_ID: 59168
Speaker 1: Now, how did you find Howard University's medical school?  Was it--was it difficult?  Did you find it pretty easy there?
Speaker 2: No, it was difficult.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Howard University Medical School was probably the most difficult thing I've ever done in my life.  It was not easy.  I have a son who found medical school easy, but I did not find it easy, at all.  I found it extremely hard.  My wife was home having a baby, my first son, she was pregnant.  I was there in my freshman year.  I was commuting every other week.  I'd jump in my car and drive to Fort Wayne [Indiana], check on her and the baby, drive back and it was difficult and I was living with one of her relatives and I remember many nights going--going to bed with this great big book on my chest not remembering anything.  I didn't know what I was going to remember.  I didn't know whether I was going to pass.  So I took a lot of hard--hard nights of studying, staying up with study groups, tend to get you over if you get four or five guys who were equally motivated because the information didn't come easy.  It wasn't like grade school and high school.  This was rote memory for what we were doing in anatomy, physiology, bio-chemistry.  That was hard.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Vietnam was easier than that.
Speaker 1: Okay, then you were commuting back to Fort Wayne [Indiana] and check on your wife, too?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Gee whiz, that's, that's a long drive from--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--it was about ten, eleven hour drive.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  So, did you have any--were there any teachers or doctors at Howard University Medical School that--that really stand out for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and he'll always be my friend.  His name is Dr. Leffall, Dr. LaSalle Doheny Leffall.  Probably one of the greatest black doctors around.  He--he still works.  When Vernon Jordan got shot, here in Fort Wayne, Dr. Towles and I operated on him and we consult--consulted Dr. Leffall.  He flew in from Washington, D.C. to come in and make sure we had done our work properly.
Speaker 1: Now can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 2: Leffall, L-A-F-A-L-L-E [sic].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: First name's, LaSalle, middle name Doheny.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is--is Do--Doheny--
Speaker 2: That's his middle name.
Speaker 1: Yeah, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: D-O-H-A-N-E-Y [sic], I think.  He's written a book recently, has done a book, so it should be out pretty soon.
Speaker 1: LaSalle Doheny Leffall.
Speaker 2: Leffall.  He was president of the American Cancer Society, the first black to do that.  Right now he is--he is the president of Howard Medical School or the--I think he is the president of Howard Medical School, now.  He was Chief of Surgery for a long time but I used to work for him.  It was a part-time job for me to go to the tumor clinic which he was a director of at that time, at noon, to go help him give patients medicine who had terminal cancer and also to help with him, I would help him in surgery sometime but I was a medical student so he allowed me a lot of freedoms that I did not have and this is what made it so much easier for me.  And I can remember him, every day, he'd say, "Every day you live, Stovall, you should learn something."  "You should get a pearl out of the day," and I remember that to this day.  And I'd make rounds with him.  He'd always ask, what'd you learn?  I used to know all his questions and then for the four years that I was there making rounds with Dr. Leffall, it was probably the most enjoyable time in my life, whereas med school was the most traumatic. But those were the--those were some bright moments and I can remember Dr. Leffall and I will always remember him.  He helped Arthur Ashe get started playing tennis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He used to talk about this young black guy who could play tennis very well in Washington and he was gonna give him a few bucks to get him started.  And he drove a Mercedes long before it was fashionable for us.  He's quite a man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He looks exactly now the way he did thirty, forty years ago.  Very statuesque, tall, six two, six feet, nice looking young man.  Nice looking man.
Story_ID: 59169
Speaker 1: Tell me about graduation from medical school?  How did you feel when you finally made it?  Were there any obstacles that emerged that--that made it look like you might not make it?
Speaker 2: No, no, I think we were studying hard enough that we were gonna--you know it was--it was a system there where it was--if you were above a certain percentile, you were gonna make it.  So, we had said in our study group, we had to keep fifteen percent or even better below us out at all times.
Speaker 1: Fifteen percent below you?
Speaker 2: Right, so, if we --it was a struggle to make sure that you were up to the eighty-five percent.  You know that you were on the top 85 percent.  Not top five percent, not ten percent, you were to get over.  Gettin' out of med school when you get ready to talk to somebody or prescribe them a pill or operate on their belly, they don't say, "Which--where'd you rank in your class?"  They just wanna know, are you a doctor.  And so that's the philosophy we took.  We wanted to be physicians.  We--we knew we couldn't be the best in class but we wanted to be in the class so we'd say, well, we just gotta keep so many brothers and sisters below us before we can get out.
Speaker 1: Now what--that seems like a strange philosophy--
Speaker 2: Well, that's--that's--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (unclear).  How did you all--
Speaker 2: Well, if you knew 15 percent of were going to punch out.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --it was on a curve.
Speaker 1: What measures did you take to make sure that they were below you, you know?
Speaker 2: Wouldn't let 'em in the study group and it was--it was kind of "dog eat dog".  You just get together and you--you would study when they would party or you go onto the--you go into the dog lab and do your physiology.  You go into the cadaver room and cut out your nerves and you do it--extra.  You do it--you put in extra time 'cause you know they weren't.  So you figured, if you put in extra time, you'll memorize that stuff.  That there's a certain number of people, aren't.  There's a certain number of people and these are all smart people.  Everybody in there was smart.  We knew they were going to rely on their intelligence as they have in the past, but you can't do that in med school.  You've got to memorize, you've got to rote memorize thousands and thousands of facts.  We had set up rote mnemonics on cranial nerves, the bones in the hand, the bones in the feet so's we could remember what those were.  But I happen to think about it, we'd make--make little poems.  So that's how we did it.  We didn't hurt, you know, we didn't-steal nobody's books.  But that was the philosophy.  We--I gave these people below us if we were to get out of here and I would tell the professors in a very joking way that if you don't let me out of here, I'm gonna burn this place down.  So pretty soon they started believing me, I think.  No, I wasn't--I kind of felt I was gonna--gonna graduate 'cause it was--that was your whole life.  It was just study and exams, study and exams, just--and there was nothing else.  On Sundays I would play golf.  I would take Sunday mornings off and go up to Silver Springs, Maryland and play golf and that was the only break I had.  I stopped for Krispy Kreme.  First Krispy Kreme in the world, I think, was on Georgia Avenue, Washington, D.C.  It was back--back at that time--back in the '60s [1960s].  Now it's huge.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --but that was the only fun I had.  I don't remember my kids growing up, no.  I'd see my wife at night, but the part I miss most was being with my kids, my children, 'cause I did not grow up with them.  In med school I studied and as a physician I worked.
Story_ID: 59170
Speaker 1: You graduated from Howard Medical School in '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Internship.  I was able to get a rotating internship at Pontiac General Hospital [Michigan], which is bigger than--than Chicago Cook County [Hospital] because Cook County was a good internship but it didn't pay anything.  This paid real money.  For the first time in my life, I'm getting a real check.  So I did an internship at Pontiac General Hospital and it was--it was good internship.  I did a lot of deliveries, I did a lot of assistance surgery, so it was a very good and as I told you before, at--while there, just about time for me to finish up my internship, the government wrote me a letter, changed my status in relationship to the draft and made me 1-A-and before I couldn't leave my internship, I had orders to go to Fort Sam Houston.  And that took the next two years of my life with Fort Sam Houston to take basic training, then Pan Am jet to--to Vietnam.  Ten months in the country at Vietnam, back to Fort Ord, California where I stayed until I--I relinquished my commission as Captain.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was Vietnam like and where did you go in Vietnam?
Speaker 2: Location.  Where did you intern?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, Pontiac, yeah.
Speaker 2: Pontiac, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he--yeah he--yeah. Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: P-O-N-T-I-A-C.
Story_ID: 59171
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  So where did you go in Vietnam when you--
Speaker 2: In Vietnam, I stayed at-- one place.  We were supposed to do six months in a compound, and six months in field, but when I went there I was battalion surgeon for a 93rd replacement battalion.  This is where all the troops would come in the country and they would leave country.  And we would exam 'em as they came into country to see if there's anything that would prevent them from doing duty in Vietnam and then we would--we would see them on the way out just to make sure that they were not intoxicated, had drug problems or had contraband, that was all part of our job on the way out.  We ran a dispensary for the replacement battalion and we were there during the Tet Offensive.  During the Tet Offensive, we lost a lot of people in our compound and as a result of our work there, our entire group received a Bronze Medal.  And that was--
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what place where actually--were you actually--
Speaker 2: We were at Long Binh.
Speaker 1: Long Binh, okay.
Speaker 2: Long Binh--
Speaker 1: And that's--
Speaker 2: --which is not right out of Tan Son Nhut Air Force Base, actually about thirty, forty miles north of Saigon.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, yes, so you were all--were right in the area of the Tet Offensive--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and they--that's where the North Vietnamese made a big offensive against the South Vietnamese--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: The American forces, they were guarding the South Vietnam or--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Tet Offensive--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so you all earned a Bronze Star?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the officers earned and there were some Purple Hearts--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --but it was a rough, rough night.  It was--it was rough.  That was some hard--that was a hard ten hours there, but I lost one--one of my pharmacy mates to battle--battle fatigue, but everybody else came out okay.  We lost a lot of people in the compound.  We did triage, we would take the people seriously injured.  We would have--of course, the dead people we didn't see at all.  But the seriously injured, we would triage them to the ones that we could treat and the one's we'd have to evac to the two evac hospitals, which were in the area.  They were set up just like the MASH Hospitals that you would see on--on TV.
Speaker 1: Tense and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so a lot of seriously wounded people passed through--
Speaker 2: That day was very serious, yup, yes, seriously wounded.
Story_ID: 59172
Speaker 1: Uh, are there any--any other aspects of Vietnam stand out in your mind?  I mean, did you have a sense that--that the war was--did you have any sense that the war was--that there was protest against the war?  That people didn't want to be in it?
Speaker 2: I knew of the protest, I knew there was people who did not want to come but I've been always, a little paramilitary at Purdue University [West Lafayette, Indiana].  I was on the drill team, ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  I was on ROTC at Purdue and you were on the drill team and we used to drill against some of the better drill teams in the nation.  And so you got, kind of felt that, so I didn't have a problem with--with being military or being drafted or going.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I'd had no protest and I felt obligated as a citizen of the United States to do my duty.  I didn't feel fear 'cause I had enough faith, I think, to believe that if God was gonna take me, he was gonna take me whether I was in a home front yard with the lightning striking or whether I was in the front line in Vietnam in my day, it would be my day.  So I really didn't have the fear except the night of the Tet Offensive.  That was--that was fearful.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I hadn't no protest against the war, no.  If--if my superiors told me, do it, I felt it was my job to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what did you--I mean when you heard about the opposition to the war, did you--did you--what did you think about it?
Speaker 2: I had good friends who went to Canada.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Some of 'em are still up there.  And haven't made it back yet.  It didn't bother me and it was their right to protest.  They had a right to protest.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were kind of--tried to stay apolitical about it, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was trying to--
Speaker 1: --neutral--
Speaker 2: Well they were saying that--that Vietnamese were not a threat to us but I didn't try to figure out, then, why am I going.  I didn't--I didn't question all the things that led up to the Vietnam War and I didn't question the fact that we lost it or whether we won it, I felt I did my duty.
Speaker 1: That--and you came back and--and you had two years?  Were you there for--
Speaker 2: I was there ten--ten months in Vietnam, ten months.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: I was there--
Speaker 1: --so '67 [1967] till part of '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Right, um-hum.
Story_ID: 59173
Speaker 1: So you were back here.  Was it, you know, a very--pretty short span?
Speaker 2: It was a short span in time.  My grandfather was very ill and I got some compassionate leave to come back to the States and then they gave me a drop of another month because it was so short before I would have to fly back and then come back again in a month, so I got another month, dropped, so it was a total of ten months in the country and then one month compassionate leave and one month drop.  And then I was assigned to Fort Ord, California.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were--
Speaker 2: --for my second year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you served a second year as a--you were a Captain by then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, you served that time at Fort Ord.
Speaker 2: Fort Ord, California.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Fort O-R-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Beautiful, in Monterey [California]
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Gorgeous country and it was easy duty.  I went to work at 8:00 and I had a Sergeant who'd been running that clinic for like fifteen years.  He'd come to work at about 9:30 and he said, doc, you can stay here and watch me if you want to, don't--as long as you don't get in my way, or you can leave.  So, every day I left.  They had a very nice golf course and I'd go out and play with the Generals.
Speaker 1: Was your family with you?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had--we had quarters at Fort Ord. That was--it was very happy times because my son started school there, Andre, my oldest boy, started school and we can remember looking down where we lived, you could go down this hill and we could see blue top schools and we could see Monterey Peninsula Bay out there.  It was--it was beautiful.  Easy duty, good weather and I had my family back and I was getting a check every month.  Life was good.
Story_ID: 59174
Speaker 1: Okay, so, when did you come back to Fort Wayne [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: After a year at Fort Ord, we--we thought about staying in Salinas Valley [California]. We had some opportunities to practice there.  Or going to Phoenix, Arizona where my cousin was.  I had an opportunity to go take over a doctor's practice there or come back home, and being the only child, my mom and dad here, I felt obligated to come back to Fort Wayne, and I've been here ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, was it pretty easy coming back and did you--did you set up practice right away?
Speaker 2: I set up practice right away.  I--Dr. [Roland Byer] Wilson, again, was instrumental in helping me do that.  Dr. Wilson and doctor, his nephew, had a building right where I practiced on the corner of Pontiac and Lafayette.  He bought it for his nephew and his nephew didn't need the whole thing so he worked on one side, I worked at the other one.  And then he left there and went some place else and I had the entire corner and I made it into one office and bought the building from Dr. Wilson and worked there for ten, twelve years and tore it down and built a complex.  Same corner that I've always worked, on that corner, thirty-two years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, the new medical complex that you built is on that same street?
Speaker 2: Same street, yeah.
Speaker 1: Same corner?
Speaker 2: I have one--one photo I didn't bring with me, but it shows the old building and the new building being built.  The--my staff put those together for me and got a picture of the two--the old building and the new building together and it's very symbolic but it's right there.  We--I bought the property.  I bought seven pieces of property and rented the properties until I got permissions and got funding and tore the properties down and then got funding with the help of--of a developer, Chris Payne, who's a good friend of mine.  He's the developer and we were partners.  We talked to some other doctors who decided to come in with us as tenants and partners and we built it.  And it stands today as a--at least my legacy to Fort Wayne [Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Yeah, this is a--this is a development of--how--how much money did it take to develop this?
Speaker 2: It was 2.7 million, 2.9 with furnishings by the time we furnished the interior for the owners.  We were able to leverage that also so the total cost was 2.9 million.
Speaker 1: That's quite a building, you know, from what I see, you know, we've seen in the photo--
Speaker 2: I was going to have you--to ask you to come down and do the interview there, but then it would be just as difficult as you had today trying to find a spot where you--and you had to call all the other people and so, I thought it'd be better for me to come to you all as far as your work was concerned.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now you have a certain philosophy around--on general practice and--and how it should be conducted.  I think that the building compliments, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, it's a family practice.  Family practice, I think, it should be a cradle to grave type of situation.  You should be able to walk into the doctor--walk into the door and get whatever service you feel necessary and then you should be able to get help.  No patient is sophisticated enough to take and go find their own specialist.  The family doctor has to do that.  Now the family doctor, or primary care physician, is not necessarily a family doctor and he may be an internist for the older people, he may be a pediatrician for the children, he may be an obstetrician, a gynecologist for the ladies and then have the family doctor, too.  But all of these are primary care.  In other words, when you walk in, these are doctors you see.  You don't just walk in, see a neurologist.  You don't walk in and see an orthopedics fellow.  You don't walk in to see a neurosurgeon.  You've got to have the referral and sometimes you get lost in the shuffle and it delays your care, which affects your quality of care if there is a delay in your care.  So access to healthcare is the main purpose of putting this type of clinic together.  To give our people in our neighborhood access to healthcare.
Story_ID: 59175
Speaker 1: Let me--okay, so, this new--the new medical center was completed in--
Speaker 2: Ninety-three [1993] we started and it might have been '93 [1993], '94 [1994].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And it's--everything is working that you know?
Speaker 2: It's--it's doin' fine.  We're--we're about eighty percent to ninety percent occupied.  Now we've got every--every primary care specialty represented, including podiatry, we have our own pharmacy, we have lab.  So, it's really, it's--it's a Class A medical space.  Built with Indiana limestone and real beautiful brick. It received architectural awards, efficiency awards from utility companies.  So it's quite an undertaking for--for a--physicians who are notoriously poor businessmen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're--you're a, I guess a decent businessman for a doctor.  I (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, you know you win some and you lose some in business.  I think I won a few more than I lost and that's--that's what makes you successful.
Speaker 1: Okay, you say you knew this seemed like a wonderful thing for the community--
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: --this medical center.
Story_ID: 59176
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about--you were the--you and another, Dr. [Jeff] Towles, I think were the primary physicians who took care of Vernon Jordan when he was shot, here in Fort Wayne, back in the--it had to be back in the--was in the '70s [1970s] or '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Eighties [1980s], I think--
Speaker 1: Eighties [1980s], okay--
Speaker 2: --it was in the '80s [1980s], yeah.  Yeah, we were--I was on the board of the Fort Wayne Urban League at the time when Vernon [Jordan] was here for our annual meeting, right, to give a speech for the annual meeting.  And he was shot by a perpetrator coming back from our dance.  I had already--I had left the dance and Vernon was still there.  And then I had gotten a call from another board member that Vernon had been shot and he was a John Doe at the Parkview Hospital, so I got up and flew there and then was able to take over his care and make sure that they knew who he was.  And, of course, I called in Dr. Jeff Towles, T-O-W-L-E-S, 'cause Jeff was a trauma surgeon who had worked with me.  He is also a primary care physician but an extremely astute surgeon and extremely good hands and very good mind.  And he helped me do many, many gunshots before.  Every Saturday night it was getting so that we were getting gunshots.  So he was--I forget he was going to be the best there was for that.  And we were successful in saving Vernon's life and it was a team of surgeons.  He had help with another surgeon there, too.  And Vernon was very grateful but he spent as little time here as he possibly could.  We put him on a plane and I escorted him back to--it was to--back to [Washington] D.C.  Either, not NIH [National Institute of Health] but it was a big hospital, big military hospital there.
Speaker 1: Not Walter Reed [Hospital]?
Speaker 2: Reed, yeah, it might have been Walter Reed.  Yeah, we flew him back there.  I remember that trip.  Vernon [Jordan] and I are still good friends and he's very good friends with Dr. [Jeff] Towles.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was shot with a high caliber bullet, right?
Speaker 2: Yes he was.  He was shot with a .30-06 or something like, that if I remember correctly.  And the way the forensic people described it, that the bullet hit the fence and was not coming straight.  It was tumbling and it was not straight so it hit sort of sideways, as it was tumbling.  And so it hit into some bones and--but not with enough velocity to make these bones explode inside and this was what saved Vernon's life.  Some of those particles are probably still in Vernon today.
Story_ID: 59177
Speaker 1: What are some of the other cases that you remember or--or patients that you remember that you've treated?  You said--said you treated a lot of gunshot wounds and have the proportion of those--well, there are two questions.  I'm getting' ahead of myself but I would--well, are the proportion of gunshot wounds higher now than it used to be?  Or are they about the same?
Speaker 2: I think they are less now so far as our treatment is concerned.  Guns are better and bigger and people don't survive.  We only treat the survivors, not just the gunshot wound victims.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Many of the victims, nowadays, don't get to the emergency room, they go straight to the coroners but we were--back in the old days, the .22s [rifles] and we would see some knives, we would see some, but things, you know, it--it--back in the '80s [1980s] and '70s [1970s], it started picking up.  But then I--I haven't gone to the hospital in the last ten, fifteen years, I quit.  Dr. [Jeff] Towles no longer does surgery because normally nine out of ten of these people did not have means of reimbursement and--and made the doctor get--Dr. Towles was getting old pretty fast 'cause staying up all night on the weekends and then was not fruitful for him financially.
Speaker 1: So, typically, a person gets shot and let's say a teenager gets shot, by another one--it's a drive by, something, they go to the hospital.  The doctor, like Dr. Towles, spends, you know, all night workin' on 'em and then--then he can't really even be reimbursed for the--
Speaker 2: That's true.  Nowadays, now we have, what--medical staff at the hospital where we did not back in those days for us.  As a matter of fact, we didn't even have doctors in the emergency rooms back in the--in the old days, here in Fort Wayne [Indiana].  So, if a patient came in and he wanted you, you had to come, whereas, now there's an emergency room physician trained in emergency room medicine that completely takes care of the patient for you.  You don't have to see him till the next morning when you make rounds.  It is their job to come in and do whatever is necessary to save his life, find whatever necessary specialist and if you want to come in, you can, but you're not obligated to come in like in the old days.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's a--it's a lot easier but it's true and reimbursements no better. It's true, most of these people do not have jobs.  It doesn't make any difference what color they are.  They may not have--if they do have jobs, it's service-type job where they don't have entitlements--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --as far as insurance.
Speaker 1: So, typically, people who get shot by other people are poor people?
Speaker 2: No--no I can't--I cannot--I definitely can't say that.  The one's perhaps that are not poor we probably don't hear about 'em or they will have a doctor meet them somewhere, at the hospital that's not read about, but so far as drive-bys, yeah, I would say you gonna hear a lot of that in the inner city but it's--it's happening everywhere now.  It--it happens in whites, Hispanics and blacks but it's just hard to--to say typically any more.

Speaker 1: So what--are there any other memorable patients that you had or memorable care that you had?
Speaker 2: Not tragic cases, you know, mostly fun cases.  Delivering babies are fun.  I remember delivering a twelve pound baby boy.
Speaker 1: Twelve pounds?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that was memorable and we did a vaginal delivery with no complications.  We had one shoulder--collarbone broken but that was done intentionally so we could get the shoulder down to get it out.  But things like that were memorable but those were good.  Those three or four days, the shoulder was fine.  Mom was fine, the baby was about the size of the momma by the third day.  Those were some fun things.  Takin' care of families were fun.
Speaker 1: Have you tracked this young man?  Is he still--was it a young man or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I used to see them.  It was a big family.  Now it's a big family.
Speaker 1: Is he still--
Speaker 2: But I don't track 'em.  No, I didn't track 'em.
Speaker 1: Is he still--okay.  I just wanted to--
Speaker 2: I delivered over 2,000 babies here in Fort Wayne and now I'm delivering so many babies' babies--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and grandbabies, at least that was third term.  But that was fun.  Just going to work.  Had a very good staff. Had a very nice facility and work was enjoyable.  I didn't worry about money.  I had a very good secretary, she was with me twenty-five years.  Took all the paperwork off me.  I didn't even have to open my own mail.  So it made life good when you have people, good people working with you.   So, no, I had a very good, blessed life--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when it came to medicine.  I never once got sued in thirty-two years, never a suit.
Speaker 1: That's pretty lucky--
Speaker 2: That was pure luck because a lot of people are unhappy with you.  They don't sue you 'cause--because from bad medicine.  They treat you because of bad treatment.  They could have gotten along but they still didn't like you.  So they'd sue you.  So you had to make yourself.  You had to realize, that you're in medicine that--that you're in--in the service business. In other words, you're there to provide service no matter how educated you are, how many degrees you got, when a person walks in the room, they want--they want to feel at ease that--that this time is my time and that you're gonna sit and listen to me.  So no matter how bored you are, no matter how many times you've heard it before, you already made up your mind what you gonna do half the time.  You've already gotten a prescription written out there on the chart but you got to sit and listen.  It makes people think that this is their time and they're an individual and you--you're gonna try to take care of their problem.  And--and so you don't get into trouble that way.  And--and that's what's fun.  That's--that's part of the fun.  I saw an average of sixty patients, a day, for thirty years and that's a lot of people.
Speaker 1: Yes, sixty a day, that's a lot.
Speaker 2: On average, two hundred a week.  The article that you got there says two hundred a month, but it was--that was--it was a week.  They couldn't believe it was a week.  They thought it was a misprint so they printed it the other way.  We've seen as many as 115 in one day in the old building.  We would work from seven in the morning till about eight at night but that's when you was need it like that.  Now we have a lot of physicians.  There's sixty or seventy, 800 physicians in Fort Wayne whereas back then there was 150.
Speaker 1: A hundred a day.  How--oh, my goodness--so you can spend about how much time on the average with somebody--
Speaker 2: Some of them would take thirty minutes, some of them would take thirty seconds.
Speaker 1: Um, okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Depends on what's wrong.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they'd sit out there and wait for you. They'd wait two hours, three hours.  If they'd wait, I'd see 'em.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: We would not shut the door as long as they were out there.  That was in the old days.  Now when you got staff now, and computers and all that stuff, you shut down time and you--you had to close up 'cause you had to pay overtime and you got--things changed. Back then everything was by the seat of your pant, you open the door and let 'em come.  When they stopped coming, you'd close the door and go play golf, go fishin'.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, okay.
Speaker 2: But it's a little different now.  It's a business and that's much more of a business now than it used to be.  Used to be an art.
Story_ID: 59179
Speaker 1: You're a member of the American Medical Association and the National Medical Association?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And American Medical Association and, you know, national organization, most physicians are a member, I guess.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: National Medical Association, it iss a black organization--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --of physicians?
Speaker 2: Primarily black.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  Are there any--any difference in the goals and the objectives of black physicians from those of the general population of physicians in terms of care and what they think--how they think the business ought to be conducted?
Speaker 2: There's a difference in AMA [American Medical Association] and the NMA [National Medical Association], basically.  The AMA, I think, is a political group.  They try to protect medicine--protect medicine against attorneys, protect medicine against politics but the NMA is basically a true social and professional organization.  I think they have good meetings, they go to areas of the country where they can attract the most physicians and even though I didn't attend a lot of the meetings, I think their goals and objectives were--were probably more patient oriented than the AMA.
Speaker 1: Okay, in what sense can you give me?  Give us a--
Speaker 2: They would give you statistics of black lung disease, maybe they would give you asthma, give you the breakdown of asthma, what to expect in children.  They would give you things that may be endemic to us such as sickle cell anemia, a lot more didactic care there.  Hypertension, you would get a lot more on hypertension, diabetes, whereas with the AMA, you may get more on cancer, stroke and heart disease.  That's what I saw, basically.  And you get to know--you get a lot of friends and they get to be social so that makes you go and then once you got there, you learn, whereas at the AMA, many times as I went to their conventions, I never met anybody twice that I knew.  I used to go to Chicago [Illinois] when meetings were there and, boring.  Information was good.  The handouts were good and you'd go to your bathroom and read them.
Speaker 1: Just be--you feel kind of isolated--
Speaker 2: Yup.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, is a--a black doctor still, basically, kind of isolated or do you think black doctors are isolated in the general medical community these days?
Speaker 2: No, not now.  I just looked up here in the last, you know, we used to struggle to get family doctors here in Fort Wayne [Indiana] but in the last month we received--in the last few months we got a neurosurgeon, came to Fort Wayne.  A rheumatologist, who's here now.  We've got five or six gynecologists, anesthesiologist, we've got everything here now.  I--it wasn't like that before, you know, you just wanted somebody to take care of the doctors but now we got doctors who take care of doctors, here, and there's no isolation because some of the most outstanding physicians in the United States applied. I think Dr. [David] Satcher, who's been working with the new administration.
Speaker 1: You and David Satcher, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum, he's outstanding.  I mention him in my--when I put my building together as some of the demographics that he would give us and access to healthcare problems, I quote him directly.  So there are people like that that are so outstanding that I don't feel we're isolated anymore but I still think there's a need for both organizations.
Story_ID: 59180
Speaker 1: One of the--what do you think are the major health problems in the black community?  If there is?
Speaker 2: The major problem is still access.  Access to healthcare.  Quality of healthcare.  Without access, quality becomes a problem.  And then the cost of healthcare.  To bear the cost to have insurance, to have co-pay deductibles.  Those are the three things that I feel that greatly impact the delivery of healthcare to minority patients.
Speaker 1: Now, were you in favor of the national health plan that, I think, that Hilary Clinton was advocating, you know, back in the early '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I didn't hear that--that much about it but if it was a plan similar to Canada or Europe, no, I would not want that.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Definitely not because I think it would--it would break down.  Also, you would end up into a national welfare situation and then haves would have their own.  And have nots would have that.  So, no, and for that reason I was not for that.  I think we should all share equally in the fruits of--of advances of healthcare that had been made in the last 15, 20 years and there've been many, many, many.  And that can only be done when doctors act as entrepreneurs and put up facilities and offer service, as merchants--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --not as employees.
Story_ID: 59181
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are your hopes and aspirations for the black community in general, I mean now--now that you're retired and when you look at the black community of Fort Wayne, where do you see it going or where would you like to see it go and--?
Speaker 2: I think it's going in the right direction.  Everywhere I go, there's black families in Fort Wayne [Indiana].  There are no isolated pockets.  I don't care if it's--we've got black people here with million dollar homes.  We've got black people here with $500,000 homes, 200, 100 and we have people on Section 8.  The thing is to get out of Section 8 and to move away from Section 8 and move towards the million dollar home just to--to change that demographic of where we live and as a result of where we live, things come--get better for you.  That's what I wanna see and also full employment.  There is a certain number of people who won't work if you--if you took them to work every day and picked them up.  We know that, but for everybody who wants a job, I'd like to see there be a job for them.  Access to healthcare, I think we're--we're getting there.  Cost of healthcare has not been quite taken care of yet.  There are gonna have to be, not welfare plans because those aren't the people, they get pretty good care.  Patients on welfare with a welfare card is better than Blue Cross card.  But it's the working poor that are now having the problem with healthcare.  It is the elderly who can't get prescriptions filled.  Having problem with healthcare.  So those are the things that I'd like to see.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Hillary [Clinton] felt that everybody needed insurance and I think that she wanted the working poor to be covered and everybody have the same.  It doesn't work that way, though.  It just does not work that way. We're still class society, we're not a homogeneous society.  So you can't have a homogeneous plan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything I haven't asked you concerning the medical profession that--that you think we need to discuss?
Speaker 2: I think you've covered it quite well.
Story_ID: 59182
Speaker 1: And--and about your own feelings about your work and stuff--is there anything I haven't asked you that you think you'd change?
Speaker 2: No, no, I think it was hard work but I enjoyed every moment.  If I had to do life over again, I wouldn't change a thing.  It's been a very satisfying, sixty-five, sixty-six years.
Speaker 1: What would you consider in your legacy?
Speaker 2: The babies that I delivered, 2,000, and to see those multiply into bigger families and then my--my biggest legacy, of course, would be the building that me and my partners put together, even though it caused some conflict but it's there.  It's brick and mortar.  It'll be there 100 years.  It's probably the best built medical building in Fort Wayne, bar none.  It was built by the best builders.  It was designed by the best architects.  Financed by the worst banks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you--what did your--were your parents very proud of you when you came out of medical school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mom was--she's always proud. I go over and I take care of her now.  She has a little senility and chronic--she has some traumatic brain syndrome pains and she's always saying, you know, and that's just--just a joy for me to go in there.  I have to shut her up sometimes.  She's so happy.  And my dad was that way but he was a very quiet, strong man.  Very quiet, strong man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they're happy with me.
Story_ID: 59183
Speaker 1: So, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: A--just "Doc Stovall."
Speaker 1: Okay.  You probably got another sixty years to go but--
Speaker 2: Well, I thought it was kinda interesting when--when we were talking about HistoryMakers and they said we need to get these things down on tape while they're still here.  And so I said, "Damn, how much time I've got left before I won't be able to tell this story?"  So, you know, whatever the Lord allows me to do, I'll take, whether it's two minutes worth, it's twenty years worth, and I'll try to enjoy it and take care of my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 59184
Speaker 1: You can just go ahead and start when you're ready.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a picture that was taken probably about three years ago at Sycamore Hills Country Club.  They did it of all members to go into their booklet, members booklet, and it was family pictures and--and individual pictures.  I should have brought the family picture, too, but I--that was probably the best picture I've taken in a long time.
Speaker 1: Great, next.  This is heavy.  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is the Life Membership certificate for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  I was very proud of that and was glad when I got old enough to make enough money to actually be a Life Member.
Speaker 1: Okay, when did you receive this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen Seventy-Six [1976], I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, great.  All right, thank you, next photo or next plaque.  We don't mainly do plaques but we're gonna see if we can get this one because it's such an unusual situation. Somebody went to trouble getting all the text to read.  This one has good contrast.
Speaker 2: It does have contrast.  This is the Urban League--provided that to myself and Dr. [Jeff] Towles for working on Vernon Jordan back in 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay, great.  Next please.  Sorry Dr. Stovall, go ahead please.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is "Business People Magazine's", September '95 [1995] issue and it shows myself in front of the marquee at our building on the corner of Pontiac and Lafayette, right in the inner city.  They came out and did a fairly extensive article because this is the first inner city medical center of this magnitude built in Northern Indiana and they were out three times.  We've been in three issues but this is my favorite.
Speaker 1: Right, thank you, next.
Speaker 2: Airway going down, you can see some of the oak and some of the glass with a very nice atrium-like effect that we have when you come in the first door, coming in--
Speaker 1: Just don't bend that corner back 'cause it makes a glare, thanks.  Okay, go ahead, sir.
Speaker 2: And that's just myself standing in the--in the atrium inside our medical building.  It's three stories high but this is the last--it opens up for two stories.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when was this taken?  Best estimate if you don't know that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's on the cover.  It was taken on the date of the cover that I said, what was that?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen--
Speaker 1: I have a photo you can flip it open Larry.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, look back on the front, it--I gave the issue date.
Speaker 1: Ninety-five [1995].  It says September '95 [1995].
Speaker 2: September '95' [1995], yeah.
Speaker 1: And when was the medical center dedicated?
Speaker 2: August of '94 [1994].
Speaker 1: Okay, great.  Next photo please.
Speaker 2: That's myself in my office.  I--I took a lot of pride in that office.  The money that I received from selling all the property, I paid the contractor to put together a real office I thought I'd be working out of the next twenty years.  That was only about five years ago.
Speaker 1: Great, okay, next.
Speaker 2: Well, what happened that you're not working there for twenty or--?
Speaker 1: I sold my practice because things in medicine changed, you know.  The hospitals were buying practices.  I sold my practice to Ancilla Sisters who owned the Catholic hospital.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: They in turn sold their hospital to--for profit Quorum.  It was the hospital.  They buy two or three--they've got two or three hundred hospital who in turn sold it to-
Speaker 2: And that's me working on a patient.  This patient just happens to be one of my employees who was with me like fifteen years in one of our exam rooms.
Speaker 1: What date would we put for this one?
Speaker 2: All those were taken at the same time (simultaneous).  Yeah.
Speaker 1: They were all in the same magazine.  Not paying attention, obviously.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were all taken the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay, great.  Next please.
Speaker 2: This is a small picture of the medical center.  The medical center is 33,000 square foot.  Has three stories, has efficient heating and cooling system, has won architectural design and as you can tell by the brick, it won on the design just on masonry alone.  It's made of brick and Indiana limestone.
Speaker 1: Who was the architect?
Speaker 2: Moake Park.  Dick Moake.
Speaker 1: Dick Moake.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, M-O-A-K [sic].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of myself at one of my skinniest times.  I was at Purdue University [West Lafayette Indiana].
Speaker 1: Lean years, huh?
Speaker 2: Lean years, not because I couldn't eat, it was because I was swimming at the time.  I was on the diving team and the coach was Mr. Papenguth who was a coach for the Olympics back in that time and I was to lose another 20 pounds and I just couldn't do it.  So I took judo instead but those were--the only picture I've got when I was down to 175 pound.
Speaker 1: Next photo, please.
Speaker 2: And that's at Purdue University.  That's Cary Hall in the background.  That's where the big dormitories at Purdue.
Speaker 1: And what--what year is this?
Speaker 2: That would probably be '54 [1954], '55 [1955], yeah, '54 [1954], '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: You should probably spell Cary Hall?
Speaker 2: C-A-R-Y--
Speaker 1: Okay, great.  Next photo.
Speaker 2: I received an award from the Martin Luther King, Jr. Club of Fort Wayne, Indiana and this was their first annual award after they got together.  And on the podium there is, from right to left, is my son, Al, Jr., then myself, my daughter, Dina, and my wife, Ernestine.  I think Andre was still in med school and then--the gentleman on the left, there, is Gene Butler, who is presently in my building and he owns the pharmacy.  He's a pharmacist and he's negotiating to purchase all of Lafayette Medical Center at this time.
Speaker 1: And the lady in the African dress?
Speaker 2: I don't know her (laughter)--I don't know her.
Speaker 1: Could we get a date?
Speaker 2: That was quite a dress.
Speaker 1: That was probably '86 [1986].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: It's '96 [1996], forgive me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was out of the "Fort Wayne Newspaper," in December of '84' [1984].  It is--it was a big social event here in Fort Wayne and I gave my daughter a coming out party, her sixteenth coming out party.  We were in a big old place and we had a band and we had--that's probably the most money I spent, other than my house.  We also allowed her to have two or three of her friend--girls and their guests to come and their families and it was a big social thing.
Speaker 2: Your daughter's name.
Speaker 1: Dina, D-I-N-A.
