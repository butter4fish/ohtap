Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Edgar Carey Lane.  Sir, could you give your full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Samuel F. Yette, S-A-M-U-E-L, F as in F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C-K, Yette, Y-E-T-T-E.
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell us--your name is often mispronounced.  People call you Yette and Yette--I get, you know, not like other people.  The other people have the same problem, but what is the origin of your last name?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Well, there are a couple of stories about it.  I'll tell the one I like best.  The--at the end of the Civil War, my great-grandfather [Samuel Yette] was being held in South Carolina.  And he put his goats in the road and drove them over the mountain into Tennessee.  And somebody apparently asked him a question, and he misunderstood the question--he thought they were asking him yes or no, and he said yes.  And they decided that he must have said his name, and it became Yet, Y-E-T.  Then later, it was added Y-E-T-T, and now mine is Y-E-T-T-E.  So, I like the fact that the name originated with my grandfather who was being held--my great-grandfather who was being held at the end of the Civil War, and he was then liberated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's an interesting story.  Now, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: July 2, 1929 in Harriman, H-A-R-R-I-M-A-N, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a publisher, author, journalist, and teacher.
Speaker 1: And a photographer?
Speaker 2: And a photographer (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  What is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is June 7, 2004.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time [Silver Spring, Maryland]?
Story_ID: 196556
Speaker 1: Next thing we do is we ask like five People magazine-ish type questions.  They're kind of lightweight questions and they don't require much of an answer.  But, the first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Chicken (laughter) and they tell me I make the best tuna salad around (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Perhaps blue.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring or fall.  They're, I think, equal.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I've been to Egypt only once, but I suppose--I've been to China and Africa a couple of times and so forth, but, and Europe, but my favorite place, I suppose, would be to return to Egypt.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.  I suppose the place I read most--I read a lot of Ralph Waldo Emerson, but also 139th Psalms.
Story_ID: 196557
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your parents and your family background--what you know about your ancestors.  Can you give me your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's maiden name was Cora, C-O-R-A, Lee, L-E-E, Rector, R-E-C-T-O-R.  She married my father [Frank Mack Yette], of course, and her name became Cora Lee Rector Yette.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: March 22, 1888.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your mother like?  What was her personality like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: She was the strongest-willed person I've ever met.  She was an indomitable personality.  She was also the best lawyer in my county [Roane County, Tennessee], although she had no law degree, no training of any sort, but she was just a very precise person.  It was said that her father could draw freehand circles and straight lines (laughter) because of his exactitude (laughter)--it was so said.  And my mother had some of that same personality.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about her being a neighborhood lawyer or community lawyer that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  She went to confront a white person once, a white couple actually.  And by the time she confronted her, and I was a party to the conversation, I actually began to feel sorry for, for the white woman (laughter) who, who was being torn apart by my mother (laughter).  She was, she was terrific as a--she had a legal mind.
Speaker 1: So, she was good at arguing a case and--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --cutting an issue?
Speaker 2: --oh, without question.  She could go to the heart of the matter--no question (laughter), no question.
Story_ID: 196558
Speaker 1: What do you know about her [Yette's mother, Cora Lee Rector Yette] ancestors?  Do you have any information and how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, her father, at least, died before I was born.  But I've heard stories about him, about his exactitude, and precise manner, and so forth.  My father's [Frank Mack Yette] mother still spoke an African language.  And so, my impression is that they--that her people came directly from the ship into Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, just to clarify, you said your father's grandmother?
Speaker 2: My father's mother.
Speaker 1: Mother could speak in African, okay?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Did she ever identify what language it was or talk about where--
Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry to say my--we do have family reunions which we've had every two years since 1971.  And my sister, one of my sisters is the historian, and she would be better at telling this.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, all right.  She might remember--she actually might know some details and--
Speaker 2: Oh, undoubtedly, she would, yes.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 196559
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Cora Lee Rector Yette] have a chance to go to school when she was coming up or--
Speaker 2: My mother got what was, at that time, a good education.  She finished the eighth grade and she had always wanted to go to Tuskegee [Institute, later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And we--I have twelve brothers and sisters, and she didn't get to go to Tuskegee.  But she valued education very much and, and for that reason, we had probably more degrees in my household than the rest of the county [Roane County, Tennessee].
Story_ID: 196560
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Frank, F-R-A-N-K, Mack, M-A-C-K, Yette, Y-E-T-T-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: December 7, 1886.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your father like and what did he do?
Speaker 2: My father was physically very strong and that was very helpful because my father sent most of us out of the city, out of the state, even to go to school.  And my dad worked as a farmer, and worked in a paper mill or a rock quarry, or wherever he could to make a living.  But we actually raised what we could, what we ate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did he have a chance to go to school or anything when he was coming along?
Speaker 2: It was said that my father could not read and write.  So, it was a great revelation to us when members of the family found love letters he had written to my mother [Cora Lee Rector Yette], and these are prized possessions.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he--his educational background is kind of obscure then, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, quite frankly, my father was quite intelligent despite the fact that he was thought not to be educated at all.  He was allowed to go to school, we thought, when he was too sick to work in the fields, and, nonetheless, he was intelligent.  And so, we were very much appreciative of finding these love letters he had written to my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think I neglected to ask you when he was born and where?
Speaker 2: I did--
Speaker 1: Did you?
Speaker 2: --I did answer that question--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but where he was born.  He was born in Parrottsville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Parrots--like a Parrot, P-A-R-R--
Speaker 2: Parrot, P-A-R-R-O-T-S-V-I-L-L-E [sic.], Parrottsville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what was the date again just to--
Speaker 2: The date was December 7, 1886.
Story_ID: 196561
Speaker 1: Well, are there any stories from his [Yette's father, Frank Mack Yette] side of the family about--other than the--now, we've talked about the story of the origin of your name.  And are there any other stories from that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, indeed (laughter).  Once I was on 'Meet the Press,' and a woman wrote to me.  She was obviously white, and wrote to me and she said, "My parents moved to California from Tennessee when I was very young."  She said, "But I've heard so many stories about your forebears.  And I've heard this name, Sam [Samuel] Yette, and they say he was so heroic."  And she said, "He must be kin to you because the way you ask those questions of the Attorney General [William Ramsey Clark] of the United States reminded me so much of what I'd heard about your forebears."  And she was correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, indeed, my dad used to tell a story about his father, the original Sam Yette, about even when they were grinding cane.  There had been some dispute about whether some land was owned by my father, or whether it was owned by the sharecropper, and/or the person who ostensibly owned the land.  And my father told about how he was told by a white fellow that he dare not go into that land and grind that corn or cane, sugar cane, excuse me.  And my father told about my grandfather, his father, was grinding the cane.  And the white guy came down and told him--said, "Sam, I told you not to grind that cane, get down off that wagon, and get out of this area."  And my dad said that he stopped driving the horse and--the mule, rather--and he said my dad just looked at him, and said, "Keep driving the mule, boy."  And (laughter), my father did, of course, keep driving the mule.  And my dad, my granddad, didn't even look at the white fellow.  And he said, "Sam, I told you get out of this lot, or I'm going to get my shotgun."  And he said, "Keep driving the mule, boy."  And he just kept driving the mule.  My granddad didn't even look at him.  And he smoked the pipe, and he just kept smoking his pipe--didn't even look at him.  And the white guy went to the house, came back, and with a shotgun.  And he says, "Sam, this is my last telling you, get out of this field, get down off this cane, and get out of here," and he cocked the gun.  And my dad, grandad, said he just said, "Keep driving the mule, boy," and he just kept driving the mule.  And the guy actually started to shoot, but he was so fearful that he dropped the gun, and went back to the house.  And at that time, of course, we're talking about, you know, we couldn't be talking about more than turn of the [20th] century.  And at that time, you wouldn't even have to go and report that you'd killed a black person, but they were so fearful of my granddad that he wouldn't take the chance.  My granddad always carried a whip by the way and (laughter) they didn't want to take the chance.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other story about that side?  Did you ever, did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I did not, I did not know my grandfather--no, I did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He died two years before I was born.
Story_ID: 196562
Speaker 1: So, you were born in Harriman [Tennessee] and raised in Harriman, Tennessee?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, tell us about growing up.  Where did you live, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, first thing, I should say that there was only a grade school.  There was no high school that black people could attend.  And when my older brothers and sisters, one of whom was a Tuskegee Airman, by the way, and another taught math on television for six years in Chattanooga [Tennessee] but, and it had some impact on the ability of the city to stay in the court.  But, anyway, we had to go out of the city often as far away as Louisville, Kentucky; Alcoa, Tennessee; Detroit, Michigan; even St. Paul, Minnesota, just to go to high school.  But my father [Frank Mack Yette], being an enormously strong man, was able to afford it barely because we valued education so much.
Story_ID: 196563
Speaker 1: You've got twelve brothers and sisters, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Are you one of twelve, or are you number thirteen?
Speaker 2: I'm number twelve--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --but I have a younger brother.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: He's number thirteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it's thirteen of you all.  Can you give us their names and the order that they, that they came into the world in?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: --I can.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: William [Yette] was first, then Edna, and Dorothy [ph.], and Howard [Yette], and Otis [Yette], and Johnnie [Jones], and Christine [Hope], and Lyda [McKeldin], and [Alma] Ruth [Wright], and [Mary] Imogene [Gibson], and I'm next, and then I have a younger brother named Emmett [Yette].
Story_ID: 196564
Speaker 1: You were raised on a farm or were you raised in town [Harriman, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Frank Mack Yette] had owned a grocery store.  And we're talking now in the 1915 World War I [WWI] period, 1915 to 1920.  And, but it was near a hosiery mill.  And my mother [Cora Lee Rector Yette] became infected from the hosiery mill, and it was said that she was suspected of having tuberculosis.  But my father then built a house out on Walnut Hill [Harriman, Tennessee] where my mother would have less trouble breathing.  And I grew up on Walnut Hill in Harriman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was Walnut Hill like?
Speaker 2: Walnut Hill was a place where, interestingly, it was fairly close to the school, farther away from the church.  And my mother, for forty years, was president of the missionary society and head of the PTA [parent teacher association] at the school because we had so many children.  But, incidentally, if you wanna make some money sometimes, bet some guy that he doesn't know where Sam [Samuel] Rayburn was born.  And he'll bet you, of course, in Texas, but actually, he was born on Walnut Hill in Harriman (laughter) Tennessee [sic. Kingston, Tennessee].  And his nieces and nephews used to carry the paper to my home.  So, Walnut Hill, I could have thrown--I never did--I could have thrown a sailing rock and hit the white Walnut Hill [Elementary] School [Harriman, Tennessee], but I never did.  But I went instead to the Jamieson Elementary School [Harriman, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's further away than Walnut Hill, than the other, the white school?
Speaker 2: Oh, of course, yes.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 196565
Speaker 1: What kind of a little boy were you?  What did you like to do, and who influenced you in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter), we had a character we called Zano [ph.].  And Zano was a character who used to intrigue us with great stories about how he shot Santa Claus, and Santa Claus wasn't going to come (laughter) this year.  And, oh, we had all cried, and but Zano also was a rap genius, he was a rap genius, even before rap was popular.  He could sing and pick a guitar and dance while he made up rhymes.  He was a genius, he was a genius.  He also taught me to hunt.  He was my absentee father in a way.  When my father [Frank Mack Yette] was at work, Zano was my man.  And he taught me, for example, he used to say, for example, if you want to learn how to shoot, say, what you do is--now he says, right over here, I'm going to go and kick that stump, and a rabbit will run out of there.  And he knew, he knew what he was doing, and he would go over and kick the stump, and a rabbit, sure enough, would go.  And he says, now, notice that I don't shoot the rabbit while he's going up the hill because I can't see him.  I shoot him right at the spot where he goes into the daylight.  And (laughter), and he would shoot him, and he taught me things like that.  But Zano was a rap artist before his time.
Speaker 1: Do you know his full name or--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, his name was Amos Cozart, C-O-Z-A-R-T, Amos Cozart.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did, where did Zano come from, do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, sure, he came from a little place--I think, called Emory Gap [Harriman, Tennessee], E-M-O-R-Y, Gap, G-A-P.  And I think his people came from Emory Gap, but he lived next door at the time I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, he sound like an interesting person.
Speaker 2: Oh, there's no question about it, no question about it.  In fact, we had, we had a lot of really, really bright people in our town.  We had a guy named Andy Reddy, for example, R-E-D-D-Y, who was another rap artist.  These, these guys could, these guys could talk your head off.  And Zano, for example, wouldn't--they wouldn't allow him to come down to the shooting gallery because he would take all their money.  Zano used to--there was an oak tree out in front of our house, and Zano used to stick matches in the tree, in the crevices in the tree, and he would light the matches with his rifle.  He would light the matches without disturbing the rest of the stem.  They were just--and another guy, I think about so often, named Piggie Miller [ph.].  Piggie wasn't his real name.  His real name was Herschel, Herschel Irving [ph.], but people called him Piggie Miller.  But Piggie would come to the games and his--incidentally, I have aspired to be a baseball player, a professional baseball player.  And, in fact, when I was in the seventh grade, I was manager of a baseball team.  But, anyway, Herschel Irving or Piggie Miller would come to the games, and he was as much entertainment as the rest of the game.  He would come in, and he would announce himself with a rhyme (laughter).  He would say, "I'm ragged, but I'm round here (laughter), wasn't invited, but I'm down here.  I'm so happy I'm about to shout, ain't nobody gonna throw me out" (laughter).  And, and he was going, and he would pull things like he would throw.  He was a globetrotter before the [Harlem] Globetrotters, and he would have a bucket of paper, and he would throw it all at the other team (laughter).
Story_ID: 196566
Speaker 1: Tell us about school.  Now, what did, what was school like for you?  You had, like one elementary school [Jamieson Elementary School, Harriman, Tennessee] in town [Harriman, Tennessee], right, that you all attended?
Speaker 2: Yes, one elementary school.  And, quite frankly, because my mother [Cora Lee Rector Yette], as head of the PTA [parent teacher association], insisted on a quality education.  I believe that Miss Ann encouraged her kids, encouraged her maid's kids to be unkind to us.  And so, we had to protect ourselves from people who, for no reason, no reason would engage (laughter) us in violence.  And I have supposed that it was because of that reason.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And so, generally, the atmosphere at the St. Mary's Baptist Church [Harriman, Tennessee] was far more civil.  But on school days (laughter), there was just a lot of--we lived in a Green Valley, if you understand what I mean.  There was--Roddy McDowall played in a movie a long time ago called 'How Green Was My Valley,' and this was a Green Valley.  It was a lot of ignorance as well as talent, it was a lot of ignorance as well as talent.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Jamieson, J-A-M-I-E-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --J-A-M-I-E-S-O-N.
Story_ID: 196567
Speaker 1: What are your memories of grade school [Jamieson Elementary School, Harriman, Tennessee] now?
Speaker 2: Grade school was really a fun time.  It was despite the violence I just mentioned.  It was really a fun time.  For example, I mean, we couldn't wait for recess, of course, because as I said, I was managing the baseball team.  But we also, we had, again, a lot of talent, a lot of talented people.  We had every morning, every Friday morning, excuse me, every Friday morning, we had what was quite openly called chapel (laughter).  And, and chapel--we now call it assembly.  And chapel, of course, was an occasion for kids to--each room would put on a talent show each year and each week, and we had a lot of talent.  And the coaches, the principal, by and large, thought that we ought to have boxing as a way of handling violence.  And (laughter), so, we all learned to box (laughter).  And so, recess was looked forward to.  But the classes were also very good.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the age of Joe Louis, too, being a star, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, exactly.
Speaker 1: And so, boxing became--did become a big thing--
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: All black youth and, pardon me for this comment--but I think that you might be able to verify this--it seems as though it's a lost art these days.  I mean, there was a time period, I think, when Joe Louis reached his ascendancy to maybe the, sometime in the '70s [1970s] where, you know, all black kids could box (laughter).  But at least all the ones I knew could, but I--it seems like nowadays it's not, you know.
Speaker 2: But perhaps, that's all, um-hm.
Speaker 1: But all you and your friends could box, right, knew how to box?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, we could box and play baseball.  And basketball, we thought was for sissies (laughter).  But we played football, and boxed, and baseball.
Speaker 1: And did you have a gym or the basketball hoop and all that?
Speaker 2: No, no, no. But we learned to tolerate weather because in Tennessee, you do have, in east Tennessee at least, you do have inclement weather.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What about the--
Speaker 2: One thing I would add--we had excellent teachers.  And the reason for this was the fact that once you have an education yourself, there were only so many areas you could go into.  You were discouraged from going into anything but two areas--the ministry, or--the religious ministry--or teaching.  And therefore, the principals had his pick of the crop.  And he could call in really fine teachers who were smart (laughter), and they were assiduous about teaching us.
Story_ID: 196568
Speaker 1: Now who are some of the teachers [at Jamieson Elementary School, Harriman, Tennessee] that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, easily, I remember Ms. Lisle [ph.], Ms. Hosanna Tate Hunter [ph.], Mrs. Grace Irving [ph.], and a woman who's now departed.  And everybody in my family apparently went through her except me--Annabel Cruikshanks Waterson Hickey [ph.] (laughter), and everybody went through her except me.  But I was exhilarated in a way, and that I made two grades in one year.  I went from the third to the fourth grade in one year and so I somehow missed her.
Speaker 1: Now, she was, now she had to be in those days, she had to be unmarried to teach, right?  Or was that true in your hometown [Harriman, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: That was not true in my hometown.  I know that in a lot of places that was the case, but that was not a requirement, so far as I could tell, because we did have teachers who were married.  And so, I, I suppose that the--
Speaker 1: Well, the female teachers--
Speaker 2: Yes, females; females who were married, um-hm.
Story_ID: 196569
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in grade school [Jamieson Elementary School, Harriman, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: My favorite subject was carrying Maxine's [ph.] books after school (laughter).  But in order to carry her books (laughter), you had to be at the head of the spelling line, and/or the reading line, or the math line.  And so, I was the--I was good at the spelling.  And the part of the incentive, of course, was, as I suggested to carry Maxine's books after Christmas--after, at the end of the evening, yeah.  Do you follow what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but who's, who is Maxine?  Now, you haven't explained Maxine yet.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Well, Maxine was the girl I fell in love with the first day at school.  And we went through grade school all the way.  And off and on, she chose somebody else, and so did I, but Maxine was a favorite girl.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 196570
Speaker 1: So, when you got to the--how far did your school [Jamieson Elementary School, Harriman, Tennessee] go--to eighth grade, did it?
Speaker 2: It went to the eighth grade.  And I must tell you a serious story about this.  One night my older sister, who is a mathematician, who figured into the desegregation plans in Chattanooga [Tennessee]--in time, my sister was up late.  And my mother [Cora Lee Rector Yette] inquired whether she was doing homework.  And she said, "No, I've finished my homework--I'm grading papers."  And my mother said, "You're doing what?"  She said, "I'm grading papers."  Well, needless to say, my mother got in touch with the principal the next morning, and asked him why his--why her daughter was grading papers.  And he said, "Well, she knows more math than anybody here" (laughter).  "So, why not let her grade the papers?   She teaches the class as well."  And (laughter), this was in 1939.  And my mother dictated a letter to what was called the [State] Developer of Negro Education in Nashville [Tennessee].  And my mother dictated the letter--as I said, my mother was the best lawyer in town (laughter), even though she was not prepared to be the lawyer.  But she dictated a letter to a lawyer, Hanna [ph.].  And he sent it to Nashville, and the plan was to add a ninth grade the next year in Harriman [Tennessee].  But because the Developer of Negro Education wrote to Harriman and said, you've got to do something about the schools in Harriman, you've got to provide better instruction.  Because of that, the city simply canceled the plans to add a ninth grade (laughter).  So, the cancellation required my mother to petition for desegregation of the schools.  We're talking now fifteen years before the Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] decision, before, so the petition against the schools did not incur admirers for my mother.  And, indeed, it caused some maids, and to be encouraged by the whites to be unkind to us, and we had that kind of problem.
Story_ID: 196571
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school [Rockwood Colored High School, later Campbell High School, Rockwood, Tennessee]?  How did you resolve that?
Speaker 2: Okay.  In 1943, when I was ready to go to high school, the county [Roane County, Tennessee] had worked out a compromise to where the school would not be located in Harriman [Tennessee], my hometown.  But it would be on the other end of the county, Rockwood [Tennessee], where my mother [Cora Lee Rector Yette] opted to settle for the best prepared person in the county.  And the principal we had, quite frankly, was less prepared.  And my mother opted for the best prepared, who was a wonderful, wonderful man, John Brown Olinger, J.B. Olinger, and O-L-I-N-G-E-R.  And he has figured into my life very significantly.  Among other things, he introduced me to the person who became my wife [Sadie Lee Walton].  But I would say that John Brown Olinger, J.B. Olinger, became my idea--godfather.  I have more ideas, quite frankly, emanating from him than from anybody else.
Story_ID: 196572
Speaker 1: Tell me about high school--I mean, in terms of what the--what was the name of your school and--
Speaker 2: Campbell, C-A-M-P-B-E-L-L, Campbell High School [formerly, Rockwood Colored High School, Rockwood, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was it like at Campbell?
Speaker 2: When I graduated, my class was the--at that time, the largest class that had graduated from the school.  There were twenty-one in my class.  And, at that time, it was the largest class that had graduated.  I had two sisters and a younger brother who also went through Campbell High School.  And Campbell High School tried to do a lot of things.  This man, J.B. [John Brown] Olinger, was a fabulous, fabulous man.  Except for a tragedy that had occurred in his own life, we would not have had access to this man.  He would have been a person on the national scene, I feel confident.  He was athletic.  He was, in retrospect, a good-looking man.  But perhaps, I should tell you the tragedy.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: In 1939, the World's Fair was in New York [New York].  And John Brown Olinger, who had graduated from Fisk University in Nashville [Tennessee], had not had a honeymoon.  And he decided that he would take his honeymoon at that time.  His wife was Billie [Vannoy] Olinger, and she was also teaching at the school.  And they decided to go to New York to the World's Fair.  But their son, by all accounts--I never knew him--but their son [John B. Olinger, Jr.], by all accounts, was really a kind of a genius, okay.  But he wanted to go to the World's Fair--they went without him.  They left him with their, with her father.
Speaker 1: Why did they leave him?
Speaker 2: Because they hadn't had a honeymoon--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --is my understanding.
Speaker 1: --all right, so just one son there?
Speaker 2: And they had this one son who was twelve years old and he wanted to go.  And when they arrived in New York, they had a telegram waiting that he had shot himself to death.  Except for that, this man would not have been available to us, I think.  He was a brilliant student.  He could walk into any class and take it over.  He could walk into--he taught science, math, and science courses himself.  And, but he could go into the literature class.  He could go into any class in the place.  And he would say, for example, I didn't--parenthetically, I didn't realize it, but I think I became a surrogate son to him.  But, anyway, he could walk into a class and he could put a book down, and say, "[HistoryMaker] Sam [Samuel Yette], start any point in this book and I'll complete it for you."  And he could (laughter), and he could (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: Oh, he could.
Speaker 1: --now, that's similar to Vernon Johns.  They say that Vernon Johns could do that (unclear).
Speaker 2: I knew Vernon Johns.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Incidentally, I covered him for the Afro-American [Company, later Afro-American Newspapers], yeah.  But John B. Olinger was this kind of person.  And he taught the math, and science, and physics, and so forth himself, but an enormously able man who also coached the football and basketball.  And he could do the drama.  He would stop and he'd say, wait, wait, that's not right.  And he would go up and portray the drama just as it should go--marvelous man, marvelous man.
Speaker 1: J.B. Olinger?
Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any other teachers from [Rockwood Colored] High School [later, Campbell High School, Rockwood, Tennessee] that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, yes.  Ann Watson was the niece [sic., aunt] of--oh, what's the poetess out of Cincinnati [Ohio]?
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, Nikki Giovanni.  Actually, Nikki Giovanni was married, was raised in Knoxville [Tennessee].  Her father--okay, her grandfather [John Brown Watson] was professor of Latin at Austin High School [later, Austin-East Magnet High School, Knoxville, Tennessee].  And Ann Watson--she married later--became my English teacher and, of course, she was great.  Mrs. Powell, Ann Brown--no, no, it's not Ann, it's Thelma Brown [ph.], I think.  Oh, we're talking half a century, but, anyway--sure, I remembered the teachers very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Charles Maxwell.  Yes, yes, they were very good.
Story_ID: 196574
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in sports?  I believe you were involved in sports?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.  I--in fact, I got--part of the reason I went to college was on a promise that my brother had made through the president of Morristown College [Morristown, Tennessee], which was that I would do the following:  I would play varsity football, sing in the choir, debate on the debating team, and clean all the johns in the men's dormitory (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, undignified part--
Speaker 2: (Laughing) And in my, in the--as I was retold later, my brother said, "He'll do all those things and carry an A average."  And my--the president of Morristown, Dr. [Miller W.] Boyd, said that he'll do all those things?  And he said yes, and he'll do them all, and I did.
Story_ID: 196575
Speaker 1: But at the end of my first year [at Morristown College, Morristown, Tennessee], I had done all those things.  But I had a run-in with my coach on the athletic banquet night of the athletic banquet.  I didn't get a letter, and I had won a letter--I'd earned a letter.  And Coach Young [ph.], very confident, who I later learned was also an Alpha man [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], Coach Young knew I would be coming to his office the next morning, and I did.  And I arrived at his office the next morning, and I said, "Coach Young, did I earn a letter in football?"  He said, "Sit down, [HistoryMaker Samuel] Yette."  I said, "Coach, I don't want to sit down--did I earn a letter in football?"  He said, "Sit down, Yette."  I sat down, and I said, "Coach, did I earn a letter in football?"  "Yep."  I said, "Did I get a letter last night?"  "No."  I said, "Why did I earn a letter, but didn't get a letter?"  He says, "'Cause I don't want you back up on that football field."  And I said, "But that's part of the way I paid my way here."  He says, "Yeah, but you don't belong up there--you belong in the library."  I was so insulted, I was so insulted (laughter) until I changed schools.  So, I went to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural & Industrial State College, later Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] the next year.  But my brother, who was down trying to get into Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] at the time--he was a dental student.  And I said--he was waiting for me when I got to Tennessee State.  And he said, "Listen, I want you to go and meet somebody."  I said, "Well, yeah, you want me to meet the coach, right?"  And he said, "Well, yeah, I want you to meet the coach, but I want you to meet somebody on the way, to meet the coach."  And we were walking up Jefferson Boulevard [sic. Jefferson Street] and I could hear these noises.  I could say--I said, "What, what's that noise?"  And he said, "Oh, they're just hitting togs."  I said, "Togs?  That grunting and that growling I'm hearing, yes?"  He said, "Oh, yeah, they're just scrimmaging" (laughter).  What I learned was that these guys--this was right after the war [World War II, WWII].  These guys were big and strong, and they had walked across Europe and, and they were husky and terrible.  And so, by the time we got to the field house, my brother had convinced me that I needed to meet the other guy he was talking about, which was Clyde Kincaid, who was in charge of the sports announcers and (laughter), and he was head of athletic publicity.  And I was ready to do some athletic publicity, and writing the programs and so forth, and which I did for the rest of my time there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, out of the field into the booth, huh?
Speaker 1: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 196576
Speaker 1: What did you major in at Tennessee [Agricultural & Industrial] State [College, later Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I majored in English.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I started the school newspaper [The Meter].  And in the process, I learned one of the best lessons of my life.
Speaker 1: Now, before you get into the lesson, you started the school newspaper, and they didn't have one before?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And what was the name of it?
Speaker 2: The Meter, The Meter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I went to the president [President Walter S. Davis] and pointed out to him that we were assessed a fund every year for a school newspaper.  And I said, "Where is the student publication?"  And he said, well, he said, "The school newspaper is a project of the student council.  You have to be on the student council to raise this question" (laughter).  So, I went and made a deal with a guy to help me get on the student council, and I would help him get elected to whatever he wanted.  And so, I came back to the president, and I said, oh, and oh.  And in the meantime, the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] ran the campus and I had, by then, become an Alpha.  And I said, "Make me chairman of the publications board."  And the Alphas said, "What do you, what do you want to do that?"  I said, "Just do it, just make me chairman of the publications board."  He said, "Okay, you're chairman" (laughter).  So, I went back to the president.  And I said, "Mr. President, I'm [HistoryMaker Samuel] Sam Yette."  He says, "I know who you are."  I said, "I'm chairman of the publications board of the student council."  He said "What--you're on the council?"  (Laughing), I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "Well, all right," he says, "So you want a publication, do you?"  And I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "Why do you want a publication?"  And I thought that ought to be obvious to the president.  And I said, without thinking about it, I said, "Well, so we can publish the highlights."  And he said, and he leaned forward, and he said, "Well, Mr. Yette, I'm not worried about the highlights, but what are you going to do about the lowlights" (laughter)?  And I said, "Sir, we would have to publish them, too."  And he says, "All right," he says, "since you're the chairman of the publications board of the student council," he said, "tell you what," he says, "bring me a program of work, bring me a program of work that tells me who's going to do what, where they're going to get the money, how it's all going to work?  Tell me everything I need to know about the publication.  And then, we'll talk about it."  I said, "No, sir.  We won't talk about it--tell me that we'll have a publication if I bring it back."  He said, "Okay, okay, all right, you'll have a publication if you can bring back what I told you."  It took me three months.  I came back to him.  I said, "Mr. President, here's the program of work."  He studied it--I guess, it seemed longer than it was, but he studied it for--oh, I guess, ten or fifteen minutes.  And he says, "Yette," he says, "I didn't know there was a teacher on this campus who could do this."  He said, "All right, you can have it."  He says, "Tell Dr. Crump [ph.] to set you up in a business office," so forth and so forth, and we did.  And the paper is now fifty-five years old.
Story_ID: 196577
Speaker 1: What a statement, though, about the school [Tennessee Agricultural & Industrial State College, later Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] is--was the--that's the president (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Who was the president then?
Speaker 2: [President] Walter S. Davis, Jr.  But the process, the process taught me how to do a program of work.  And any time I start something now, I start with a program of work.  Here's how it's gonna--here's, who's going to do what, and how they're going to do it, and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, how was your paper [The Meter] received?  What kind of a staff did you assemble for it?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, it was politics, it was campus politics.  Tennessee State, incidentally, is one of the strongest Greek campuses in the country of any color.  It is definitely run by the Greek organizations--no question about it.  The president of the student body was my fraternity brother.  The incoming president of the student body was my fraternity brother.  And we did it all in that way.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But since I was an Alpha [Phi Alpha Fraternity] man, and the Alphas were running the campus, I did all right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you cover like sporting events and campus events, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, it, oh, we organized it in a way that I had, I had two guys who liked to do art--Dip [ph.] and Dusty [ph.], they called themselves, and I had them to do editorial cartoons.  And I had a girlfriend to do features, to be feature editor.  And I had another guy in charge of advertising, and so forth.  But we were organized, and it had to be there in order for the, for Dr. Davis to say okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you cover any controversial news stories?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, of course.  We did in time, yes.
Speaker 1: Did--well, what, can you remember one that you did--did you do anything to get you in trouble?
Speaker 2: I think we had won the battle when Dr. Davis agreed that we could do a paper.  When he asked me that question, when he leaned forward, and asked me, "But what are you going to do about the lowlights?" I didn't realize at that time that he might have been concerned personally about the lowlights (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, he knew where the skeletons were?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But, yes, I mean, we organized, and it was--all I had to do was to make sure that the interfraternity council was represented and so forth.
Speaker 1: So this is in, this is nineteen--
Speaker 2: Forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 1: --Forty-nine [1949], okay.
Story_ID: 196578
Speaker 1: So did you think at that time that you would, you'd like to be a journalist?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, sure.  See, let me tell you, George W. Gore, Jr. had gone to DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana to study journalism.  But his father was a Nashville [Tennessee] preacher and he forbade his son to go into journalism.  He said, you know, as far down that road as you can go is education.  But George W. Gore was at DePauw University when Sigma Delta Chi, which later become, be called the Society of Professional Journalists [SPJ], he was there at the time it was organized.  And I'm the first black president of the Washington [D.C.] Professional Chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, which later became the Society of Professional Journalists.  I made it at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] and, but George W. Gore was teaching English 301, 302, and 303, which were journalism courses.  He was bootlegging journalism because that's what he had wanted to do.  So, Carl Rowan, Oprah Winfrey, Ollie Stewart, a guy named Streeter [ph.]--all these people came out of Tennessee State because of a tradition of reading and writing well, and so forth.  And that's the tradition that was established by George W. Gore, Jr., who was the dean of a college.  But in 1934, he founded Alpha Kappa Mu [Honor Society] which was the counterpart to Phi Beta Kappa [Society].
Story_ID: 196579
Speaker 1: Let me get you graduating from Tennessee [Agricultural & Industrial State College, later Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  When you graduated, did you graduate with honors or anything, or did you have a--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  No, I missed it by a point or two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And (laughter), I did not graduate with honors.  I chose--okay, I ran into, while I was editor of the paper [The Meter], the founding editor of the paper, I was over in the administration building one Saturday afternoon working on the paper.  And I ran into Dr. Sasser, Earl L. Sasser, Jr.--I ran into him.  He was the registrar, as well as--he was also teaching a course in History of the English language.  And I ran into him and I said, Dr. Sasser, I said, "By the way, I am not doing perfectly well in your class, History of the English Language, because I have chosen to work on the newspaper".  And he was an interesting person.  And he said, "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [Samuel] Yette, that's the first time I have heard somebody give a perfect definition of why they're doing something."  And I said, "What, what do you mean?"  And he said, "Well, many people choose to do something, but they don't know why they're doing it, but whatever you decide what you're doing, fine, that's fine.  You're making an exchange--good."  But I did not realize that he was going to nearly flunk me in that course.  And to be honest about it, I still don't think I deserved the grade he gave me.  But he taught me a lesson, and I'm not sure that the lesson has taken me where he wanted me to go.  But anyway, I had another course in philosophy by Professor Sharp [ph.].  And I said--I had made an A on the exam and I had made a presentation that was graded A.  And I said--but when I got my grades, I had a C.  I went in to see Mr. Sharp.  I said, "Professor Sharp, how could this be?  Didn't I do my work well?"  And he said, "Yes, but you failed the meaning of the course."  And I said, "How did I do that, sir?"  And he said, well, he said, "Do you remember the day"--and I won't call her name--"this person was giving her report?"  I said "Yes, I do."  He said, "Do you remember how you questioned her?"  And I said, "I thought I was asking appropriate questions."  And he said, "No, no, Mr. Yette, he said, this was a lady who is back here to finish her work.  She's teaching over in a place, and she's there to get her work done to get certified and whatever, and you questioned her in a way that made her feel bad.  And that was the point of the philosophy" (laughter).  So, so those two grades (laughter) kept me from being an honor student, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But they were serious about what they were trying to teach, yes.
Story_ID: 196580
Speaker 1: --Or how did you decide, or how did you get admitted to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Well, after--okay, I went to the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 1: You went there, okay.
Speaker 2: I went to the Air Force and--
Speaker 1: It was obligatory, right, to go?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was being drafted.  And President [Walter S.] Davis, President Davis [of Tennessee Agricultural & Industrial State College, later Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee]--I went in to say my farewells to him.  I went in to say goodbye.  And he said, "Wait a minute, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Samuel] Yette, you're on the collegiate counselors, and you're on the student council, and you're the editor of the paper [The Meter]--you can't leave."  And I said, "Well, sir, I'm being drafted."  And he said, "Well, just, just sit still for a minute," and he picked up the phone and called the governor [of Tennessee], and Governor Gordon Browning.  And he said, "Governor Browning, I've got a young man here."  He says, "He's too indispensable to leave this campus right now, and he's being drafted."  And he said, "Well, what's his, what's his draft board number?"  And I said, "Number seventy-seven."  And he said, "Oh, that's over in Roane County [Tennessee].  I'll get in touch with them, take care of it."  And he did.  And I stayed the rest of the year, but (laughter), as soon as I graduated, I joined the Air Force.  And, parenthetically, but importantly, the first technical school I was sent to, and this was the first desegregated school I had entered.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you choose the Air Force above, or did you--
Speaker 2: Above the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Well, for one thing, my older brother had been a Tuskegee Airman.  And I was not interested in getting shot--going up Pork Chop Hill [Korea].  I was, you know, more interested in the technology that would be available in the Air Force.  And, technologically speaking, I came out number one in the class.  And that was an interesting situation since I was in school with all these guys who had had opportunities of everything.  They had every opportunity there was to learn anything that they wanted, but I still came out number one in the class.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, where were you stationed in the Air Force?
Speaker 2: This was, this was a base at Francis E. Warren, W-A-R-R-E-N, Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming.  And it was a fixed wire communications school.  And, as I said, I came out number one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they--the captain was amused that I had come out number one because, apparently, [HistoryMaker] James E. Cheek had graduated in the class ahead of me, who became president of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] later, and he had also come out number one in his class.  So, my coming in the next class, and coming out number one, the captain called me in.  And I came in, and he said, "Well, what's going on here?"  And he wanted to know my parents and that sort of thing.  And he said, "Well," he says, "you know, we give the opportunity for the person who comes out number one in the class, we give them the opportunity to serve wherever they want."  And I said, "Well, sir, I, I want to go where the service needs me most."  And he said, "Good answer" (laughter).  And they sent me down to Colorado Springs [Colorado], the Air Defense Command headquarters [at Peterson Air Force Base], and so that's where I served most of my time, except when I went into the Officers' School [Officer Candidate School, later Officer Training School].
Story_ID: 196581
Speaker 1: Now, the Korean War was going on?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And was there any threat to send you to Korea or any--
Speaker 2: No, I spent most of my time in, in schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The--certainly, the Officer Candidate School [later Officer Training School] took six months.  I was in Cheyenne [Wyoming] for six months, and so I'd used up a year in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I graduated from officer school, I put in for public information.  And they sent up to an Air Force base in--oh, what's the name of it?  Anyway, I went to an Air Force base.
Speaker 1: Oh, not, not Boulder [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: No, no, it was [Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base] on Long Island Sound [Westhampton Beach, New York]--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --in Long Island.  But anyway, you had to go and come to the island (laughter) from--anyway, that's where I went and, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, when--is there anything of--I guess, of note that happened in the Air Force, you know, that really--
Speaker 2: Yes, there was.  The very first day I was there in Officer Candidate School in San Antonio, Texas, Lackland Air Force Base, the very first day I was there, the person could not have seen me before because they had just gone to Christmas.  And we had just come while they were away.  So, a fellow came down to the inspection, and we were all lined up outside the doors.  And a fellow named Klahn, K-L-A-H-N, came down and popped in front of me.  And he says, "What's your name, mister?"  And I said, "[HistoryMaker Samuel] Yette, sir, Samuel F."  And he said, "Make a movement, and gaze at my name tag, and tell me what my name is."  I looked down--came back to attention.  I said, "Sir, Klahn, Richard P."  And he said--and he got right up in my face to where his spit was hitting my face.  And he said, "That's what it is to everybody else, but to you, it's Ku Klux Klan [KKK], and don't you forget it."  And I didn't, I didn't forget it because he had at least three others who were equally committed to being Klansmen.  He had three right behind him who were absolutely insane racially.
Speaker 1: Were there any incidents of--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --this craziness that you can--
Speaker 2: --oh (laughter), absolutely--
Speaker 1: I mean, that conversation was kind of crazy but--
Speaker 2: --oh, absolutely.  Well, for example, they would go up to the bar and get high, and they would come back.  Now, we were absolutely required to be in bed from ten p.m. until five a.m.  But these guys would go and come back and get me out of bed, and post me on the fire escape, and order me to say [President] George Washington's farewell address until they came back.  And then, they would go to bed.
Speaker 1: So, they'd keep you up all night--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --doing that?
Speaker 2: --yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Wow!  And they could do that?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were insane, they were insane, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Did, did you have anyone that you could appeal to--to--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Lieutenant McLaren [ph.] was from South Carolina and he brought it all with him (laughter).  He was the person I would appeal to.
Story_ID: 196582
Speaker 1: So, but you had to have no more than sixty demerits at the end of the three period, three-months period, and I had ninety-three demerits.  And, therefore, you had to appear before a Flight X Board.  And I appeared before the Flight X.  And he said, and the colonel was in the center, a captain on each side.  He said, "Do you know why you're here?"  And I said, "No excuse, sir."  And he said, "You should come to at-ease position because you are on your way out of here unless we're convinced otherwise."  And I came to parade rest instead of at ease.  And I said, sir--and I began to describe what they had done.  And they stopped in the middle and said, "Get Lieutenant McLaren [ph.] over here" (laughter).  And I passed the Flight X.  Incidentally, I was one of the academic leaders and they asked me and, in fact, says, why is that you're one of the academic leaders in your class and, militarily, you're near the bottom?  And that's when I explained to them what had happened, and that's when the reprieve came.
Story_ID: 196583
Speaker 1: After the [U.S.] Air Force, Indiana University in Bloomington [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I wrote to the journalism department.  A guy named John [E.] Stempel was the chairman of the department.  And he, for one thing, wrote me right back, and sounded like a person.  And I had gone--I was living in Chattanooga [Tennessee] at the time--and I had gone to the draft board or the, excuse me, the place where they give you the G.I. bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].  I'd gone to the G.I. bill and--
Speaker 1: For the Veterans Administration [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, and applied.  And the woman said, "Well, all right, now, so long as you don't want to go to one of our schools around here" (laughter).  I said, "No, I want to go to a good school" (laughter) And she didn't catch on.  And she said, "All right" (laughter).  So, I filled out the papers and sent a letter to John Stempel.  And he wrote me back and told me there were some courses he would recommend, and so forth and so forth.  And I went to Indiana, and and got to Indiana University, and there were a couple of teachers who would not admit me to their classes.  There was a course in constitutional law I wanted to take, and a course in history of political thought, and they wouldn't allow me to take those courses.  And I went back to Professor Stempel, and I said, "Professor Stempel, you know, I have just come from the [Korean] War, and I don't want to have a war here, but I will if I have to."  I said, "These two teachers would not admit me to their classes."  I did not know at that time that he was a cousin to the chancellor [Herman B. Wells], but he said "Just leave it with me--I'll take it, I'll take it."  And the next morning, he said, "Take them back over.  They, they'll take you" (laughter).  And so, I went back over and got into the courses that I wanted.
Story_ID: 196584
Speaker 1: Now, at that time--now this is Indiana, which is--been described as--and not that racism doesn't exist in the North, but it seems to be a state where it's been described as being much like a southern state in its attitude towards black people for many, many years.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, what--how many other black students were in Indiana [University, Bloomington, Indiana] when you were there in the grad (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly, they had, on the student-wide council, they had--all black people had to run for a seat called the Negro minority seat.
Speaker 1: Well, they really describe it--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, it was--believe me, I'm speaking literally.  It was called the Negro minority seat.  And everybody on campus had to run for that one seat.  Otherwise, you couldn't qualify for any of the other forty-eight seats on the council.  Okay.  Now, I was working with a fellow who was in law school, a fellow named Nathaniel House [ph.], who had been a classmate of mine at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural & Industrial State College, later Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And I was working with Nathaniel House, and he and I--oh, incidentally, at that time, you couldn't even use the name of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in the newspaper (laughter).  So, I was an associate editor of the newspaper, the [Indiana] Daily Student [IDS], which is a really good paper.  Oh, at that time, it was ninety-two years old and so, we're talking a hundred-fifty years or thereabouts, but it's a good paper.  But, anyway, I was working with him, and we were conniving to bring these issues to the fore.  And he apparently, apparently didn't graduate.  And I don't know how much of that had to do with his efforts--our efforts together--I don't know how much that had to do with it--

Speaker 1: By the darndest coincidence, once I got to Newsweek magazine, the fellow who had been the editor of--the publisher of the daily newspaper downtown--had died and left some money to bring in three persons per year--a chief editorial writer, a news reporter, and a columnist, I think, okay.  So, I was selected as a distinguished graduate to come back [to Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] and lecture for a month.  And (laughter), which I, of course, did, and that was where I met Carl Rowan.  Carl Rowan was a reporter with the Minneapolis Tribune at the time.  And this Sigma Delta Chi group, which I mentioned earlier, the Society of Professional Journalists [SPJ], was looking for a top guy to give our banquet speech.  And I said, "Well, listen guys"--I'm the only black person in the room, of course (laughter)--and I said, "listen, guys, how would you like to have somebody who has, who was a member of the Sigma Delta Chi, and who has already written three books," and so forth?"  They said, "Oh, my God, if we would get a guy like that, that's great."  And I said--and I kept the--my eyes right on Professor Savage [ph.]--because he was in charge of seeing over the students.  And I kept my eye right on him, so he couldn't take his eyes off me and signal to anybody else, 'cause he knew whom I was talking about (laughter).  He knew I was talking about Carl Rowan, but he didn't--so I kept my eyes right on him.  And I said, "Professor Savage, could we go into your office and use your phone and see?"  And he said, yes, yes.  So, we went in, and I called Carl Rowan in Minneapolis [Minnesota].  And I said, "Mr. Rowan, we would like to have you come and give our banquet speech," and so forth and so on.  And he said, "Well, you know"--he was very casual about it.  And I said, "Well," I said, "I'm sorry we don't have enough money to bring you here, but I was hoping that we could."  And he says, "No, no, you'll have to get in touch with my agent."  And I said, "Well, you know," as I was saying goodbye--I said, "you know, you and I have something else in common."  And he said, "Oh, what's that?"  And I said, "Well, you and I both went to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural & Industrial State College, later Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And he said, "Do you mean Tennessee State out on Jefferson Street [Nashville, Tennessee]?"  And I said, "Yes, sir."  And he said, "Oh, well, now, that puts a different picture on things."  He said, "All right."  He said, "I'll come"--given things I had already recited to him that we had discrimination and so forth on campus--and he says, "okay, I'll come, but you just take care of my agent--I'll come for free."  And he did.  And I went over to pick him up.  And we had a white chap driving, and I got in the back seat with Carl Rowan.  And I said now--he said, "Now, tell me about these things you were reciting before."  And he took out his typewriter and set it on his lap, and was typing his speech while we were talking.  He was, he was an amazing man.
Speaker 2: This is a real typewriter, not a heavy type (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, a portable (laughter).  He took out a portable and was typing, you know, while we were driving.  And he gave a whale of a speech that night, a whale of a speech.  And, in fact, there's--I said to Bill [HistoryMaker William] Raspberry later--he, for all I know, he was offered back every year from then on.  He was invited back--he was a terrific man.

Speaker 1: You go back to Campbell High School [formerly, Rockwood Colored High School, Rockwood, Tennessee] at a certain point, yeah?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went back and taught one year because the man I had mentioned earlier, J.B. [John Brown] Olinger--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --the second week after I got out of the [U.S.] Air Force, J.B. Olinger had a heart attack, and I was called to come in and fill in for him.  And I did, but something else of interest happened when I went back to Campbell High School.  I went to the library to get some books to hone up on the subjects I would be teaching.  And when I went down to the [Harriman Public] Library [Harriman, Tennessee] and filled out the cards, and handed them to the persons, they gathered in a room.  And there was a big ferocious conference (laughter).  And they were, they were on the phone, and then they were talking.  And then, finally, I was waiting at the desk.  And, finally, the person came to the desk and said, "[HistoryMaker] Samuel [Yette], here is your library card.  It's your own, your own library card."  And I said, "Okay, okay."  I'd been away for a while and I didn't realize that I was home now.  And that I--and I was the first person to get a library card who was black in my hometown [Harriman, Tennessee].  So, on my way home, I was saying, gee, they were strange, gee, they were strange.  And I went to my mother [Cora Lee Rector Yette], and I said, "Mom, I said, they had a lot of conferring to do down at the library.  They gave me a library card, but, boy, they went through a lot."  And she said, "You got a library card?"  I said, oh, my goodness, don't tell me, she's affected, too (laughter).  And I said, "Well, of course, I got a library card."  She said, "You've got the first library card of any Negro in town."  And I said, "But, mom, we always had books in the attic.  We've always had--and they said, Harriman Public Library--we've always had those books."  And she nodded, and she said, "Yes, but do you know how we got them?"  I said, "Well, no, I guess, the usual way."  And she said, "No, your brothers would have been sent to the penitentiary if they knew why we--and how we got those books."  And I said, "Well, how did we get them?"  And she said, "We had an arrangement with Mr. Sanders [ph.], and they were coming down to get the books for Mr. Sanders--not for themselves." (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I've heard about that kind of thing before.  Well, you know, that's, yeah, things--they have changed.

Speaker 1: Well, you came out of IU [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] in '59 [1959]?
Speaker 2: I came out IU in '57 [1957] actually--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I went to Ebony--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and worked at Ebony for two years and--
Speaker 1: Well, how was that experience?  Now, you were probably well--Ebony started in the early '50s [1950s], right, or--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, Ebony started in 1945.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Negro Digest [later, Black World] started in 1943--that was [HistoryMaker John H.] Johnson's first publication.  And so, I was on the Ebony staff for a couple of years.
Story_ID: 196588
Speaker 1: But I, in the meantime, I got married to Sadie Lee Walton, and she had been the queen at--of the campus at Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee].  And J.B. [John Brown] Olinger had, being a fraternity brother [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], we were having a convention at Knoxville College.  And the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority was hosting us to a soiree.  And we went to--they went on a bus, and J.B. Olinger and I went together.  I picked him up, and when we got to the center, we were to pick a number out of a hat, and the person who matched that number would be our first dance.  And I picked--I guess, number thirty-two or whatever, and I went in, and I thought the lady was terribly old, but she was only thirty years old.  I thought she was so old (laughter).  She was probably no more than thirty-five years old, but I was, you know, in my early twenties.  And so, I was struggling through the dance with her.  And I heard this voice behind me saying, "Sam [HistoryMaker Samuel Yette], Sam--here, why don't you change with me?  She's too young for me."  And I turned and looked at the most beautiful person I've ever seen in my life--and it was the campus queen.  And I, I said, my goodness, and I told her that she would marry me.  And she said, "You've been drinking, haven't you" (laughter)?  And I said, "No, no matter, but I have a feeling with your--you're going to be mine."  So, Mrs. McClatchey, Sally McClatchey, had chaperoned the girls there.  And I said, "Who would let me take you home?"  And she said, "There's nobody here who's going to let you take me home" (laughter)  And I said, "Well, there's got to be somebody here."  I said, "Who--if there were somebody--who could give me that permission?"  And she laughed, and she said, "Nobody is going to give you that permission, but I can tell you who would, if she could--Mrs. McClatchey."  And I looked over, and she's a very stern-looking woman (laughter).  And I said, "C'mon, c'mon, let's go over."  And she said, "No, don't you dare--I'm not going over there with you."  And I said--I went over, and I said, "Mrs. McClatchey, I'm Sam Yette, and I am dancing with Sadie Lee Walton, and I wish to take her home."  And Mrs. McClatchey had never, never done that before.  And she said, "Yes," she said, "I want you to take her home."  And I beckoned to Sadie, and she said, "Mrs. McClatchey, don't you dare!"  And she said, "Yes, I want him to take you home" (laughter), and, and she couldn't believe it.  She said, "I'm not going anywhere with him--not by myself."  And she said, "Okay, ask Norma [ph.] to go with you."  But Mrs. McClatchey wanted me to take her home--and, and I did.  I took, and I said, to Bill Darcy [ph.] from Chattanooga [Tennessee]--I said, "Bill," I said, "I got two girls.  You want to ride with me?"  And he rode with me, and we were parked right beside their dormitory.  And they didn't even recognize that we were there because they had never been off the campus before.  It was a very restricted place.  But, anyway, a couple of years later, we were married in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, what, yeah, what year was it that you all got married?
Speaker 1: Oh, we were married in 1958.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This, while you were working for--
Speaker 1: Ebony.
Speaker 2: Ebony, okay.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right--
Story_ID: 196589
Speaker 1: But my older of two sons--Fred [Frederick Walton Yette] was on his way rather early.  And I decided Chicago [Illinois] was not the place to raise a kid.
Speaker 2: Now, what was wrong with Chicago (unclear)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But for a country boy, it wasn't the place.  And so, we went to Alabama, which is where she [Yette's wife, Sadie Lee Walton Yette] was born in Alabama, but we went to Tuskegee [Alabama].  And Tuskegee [Institute, later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] had been asking me for some time to consider coming, and being director of public information, and setting up an information bureau.  And so, with my friend--I told him I would come if I could get a friend of mine to come with me--[HistoryMaker] Dorothy [B.] Gilliam, who was Dorothy Butler at the time.  But I was at her wedding to [HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam and so forth.  But, anyway, I--my wife and I did accept the job at Tuskegee, and went down and set up an information bureau.  And Dorothy agreed to stay for one year, and the idea was that she was going to save her money, and go to Columbia University [New York, New York] the next year, and she did.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, that's--this is Alabama in 1959, right? And--
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 196590
Speaker 1: You just had a successful conclusion to the Montgomery Bus Boycott.  And there was, you know, a lot of, you know, still some turbulence and turmoil in Alabama then, huh?  How--did it affect you at Tuskegee [Institute, later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] at all or--
Speaker 2: Well, as a point of fact, the reason that had been given by the Montgomery Advertiser newspaper for not being able to get our material placed in the Montgomery Advertiser was that we did not have it professionally written.  So, my point in coming down--the reason they wanted a professional writer was to make sure that it was, in fact, professionally written.  And, and I came down on that condition.  And Grover [C.] Hall, who was the editor of the newspaper, was complaining that he couldn't get the professionally written material.  However, there was a fellow named [Dr.] John T. Scudder, S-C-U-D-D-E-R, John T. Scudder, who had worked with Drew, Charles [R.] Drew.  And Scudder had made some comments in Chicago [Illinois] the night before he was on his way to the Tuskegee Clinical Society [John A. Andrew Clinical Society], a meeting.  And he had made some comments that caused a lot of confusion, a lot of discussion around the country that had to do with whether blood ought to be transfused from one patient to another.  Now, Charles Drew and John Scudder had worked together.  And John Scudder was on his way to the Tuskegee Clinical Society--the John A. Andrew Clinical Society--it was properly named, to give a paper on the question.  And when I went in to cover the paper, he wouldn't give out a paper.  John Scudder would not give out a paper.  And the AP [Associated Press] guy said, "Well, hey, if he won't give a paper, I'm out of here," and he left.  So, my opportunity was to show--indeed, we were superior.  And I took notes, and went across the street and typed up my notes, typed up in a story, and brought them back to the reception for John Scudder, and said, "Dr. Scudder, is this what you said?"  He not only agreed, but he signed it.  He said, "This is the first time I've ever had anybody understand what I'm saying"--and he signed it.  And I went to--back and called the Montgomery Advertiser, Grover Hall.  And I said, "Your man left, the AP guy left."  I said, "I happen to have John T. Scudder's story--not only do I have the story, I have his signature on it."  He said, "You've got what?"  And I said, "Yes, I have his signature on it."  He said, "May we have the story?"  And I said, "Yes, on two conditions."  He said, "What?"  I said, "That you run it front page, the same place you were going to put the other story, and that you give me a byline."  He said, "I better think about that a minute."  I said, "You got a minute."  He said, "Okay, we'll take it, give it to us tonight" (unclear).  And it appeared the next day, not only page one, but with my byline.  We broke that up.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's quite a story.  So, anything else in Tuskegee that--
Speaker 2: Well, there's a lot of Tuskegee.  I did do a story for Ebony while I was there.  I did a story on the veterinary medicine there.  There were, at the time, only eighteen medical schools in the United States, and Tuskegee was one of them, and there were only four others in North America.
Story_ID: 196591
Speaker 1: How did you get a job in Dayton [Ohio]?  I mean, how, what happened?  How did you manage to take that job?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the Voice of America [VOA] had been asking me to work for the Voice of America, a propaganda arm of the U.S. government.  And the guy kept coming to Tuskegee [Institute, later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], and calling me and whatever, and I got, I got a little intemperate about it.  And I decided that I'm not going to do propaganda for anybody in a country in which I cannot even work in my field.  And so, I wrote to John [E.] Stempel, my dean at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana].  And I said to him, "Hey, why can I not get a job?  As you know, I was one of the top students in my class, you know (laughter), as you know."  And he called me back and said, "You'll hear from somebody in Dayton."  And I heard from somebody, John Moore [ph.], in Dayton, and he asked me to meet him at--in New Orleans [Louisiana] at the Associated Publishers meeting.
Story_ID: 196592
Speaker 1: So, I met him [John Moore (ph.)], and the reason I'm laughing is because when I got to the airport [Moisant Field, later Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport] in New Orleans [Louisiana], I was asked to sit up front.  And I said "No, I'm not going to sit up front.  I'm sitting right here in the middle row where I want to sit."  And the guy said--he got out and he says (laughter), he says--went over to the starter and says, "I got a guy out here who doesn't want to sit up in the front with me" (laughter).  And so, he says--and the guy comes over and he's all in this hat and all this stuff, and he says, "May I ask you a favor?"  (Laughter)  I said, "What do you want?"  And he said, "Would you do me a favor and just sit up front?"  I said, "No" (laughter).  So, he said, "Hey, go on."  And so, so we're getting near the Maison de Ville Motel [Hotel Maison de Ville, New Orleans, Louisiana]--that's where John Moore [ph.] is.  And so, he lets everybody out on the way there but me.  And he says to me, he says, "Hey, buddy," he says, "look, I'm not a bad guy."  He says, "I go up and hear the coloreds play music all the time" (laughter).  He says, "I'm not a bad guy."  He says, "But look, are you sure you want to go to the Maison de Ville Motel?"  And I said yep.  And he said no--he says, "I don't think you want to go."  And so, he drove around, around, a couple of times, around the block.  And he says, "Now, mister"--he says, "this is your last chance."  He said, "Now, look, they don't let boys like you come up to the Maison de Ville Motel."  He says, "Now, this is your last chance, man.  You want me to take you up there?"  And I said, "Yep."  And he drove up there, and he says now, look, he says, "If you have trouble, I'm going to wait right here, I'm going to wait right here 'cause they're going to throw you out" (laughter).  He says, "I'm going to wait right here" (laughter).  And I went up. And John Moore had already told the guy to be on the lookout for me.  So, so the guy came down, and the desk guy came down, and grabbed my bags and brought me up.  And the guy was confused as all, get out, the cab driver--he was really confused.  He says, "What's, what's going on here?"  And so, I go and, and so, I go back and meet Mr. Moore from the Dayton [Ohio] Journal-Herald [later, Dayton Daily News].  And I met Mr. Moore, and in time, we talk, and he wants to have dinner.  And he says, "Let's have some food."  And I was, okay, fine.  And he ordered, and the guy would bring in the food, and he was holding it up like this.  And when he saw me, he dropped the whole thing (laughter), he dropped the whole thing.  He said, "Good God, I can't--" (laughter), so, so, Mr. Moore told him, "It's all right, it's all right.  Clean it up and go, go get it again," you know (unclear).  But anyway, I couldn't get, I couldn't get out of--nobody would come up in the French Quarter [New Orleans, Louisiana] to drive me to the airport when I was ready to leave.  I had to call an old [U.S.] Air Force buddy, Lloyd Cresse [ph.] to come and get me finally and take me back to the airport.  But, anyway, that's how I got to Dayton.
Story_ID: 196593
Speaker 1: So, were you the first black journalist hired by the Dayton [Ohio] Journal-Herald [later, Dayton Daily News]?
Speaker 2: No question about it, no question about it, no question about it.  I was, I was there for about thirteen months.  And I got this call from Carl Rowan who wanted to know if I would come into Washington [D.C.], and consider a job with the Peace Corps.  And I told him, you know, fine.  I would come and when I turned in my letter to the Journal-Herald, I had--okay, first, let me tell you this.  First, Hugh McDiarmid and a guy named Douglas [ph.] were talking back and forth in my hearing, so they were trying to send me a message--my first day there.  And Hugh McDiarmid says, "Well, Doug, I hear we've got a new reporter."  And Doug says, "No, I hear that we've got a new boy."  And Doug says, "No, I hear that this one can read and write" (laughter).  And he says, "Naw, I don't believe that."  And I decided that I was going to take their jobs right away (laughter).  So, McDiarmid was covering the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base [Dayton, Ohio], and Doug was covering [Dayton] City Hall.  And I simply was a better reporter--it's just that simple.  And (laughter), and the desk knew it right away.  And they said, my God, let's send this guy out to Wright Pat.  So, I took this guy's job within two months.  And now, they say, look, this guy is so good--really, you know, I'm not being immodest unnecessarily.  But let's send him to city hall while Doug goes down to cover the legislature [Ohio General Assembly, Columbus, Ohio].  And I went over to city hall and that was it (laughter).  They never, they never got back.
Story_ID: 196594
Speaker 1: The first day I got there [Journal-Herald, later Dayton Daily News], which was the day before I was actually to begin work, we get off the elevator.  And we walk to the right around, we walk in a circle, and come back to Glenn Thompson's office.  And I was puzzled by why we went in that circle to get to Glen Thompson's office 'cause we could have walked to the left, and it was right there (laughter).  So, it took me a long time to figure it out.  First, my second son [Michael Yette] was on his way very prominently, very prominently, and he was only a month from birth.  And they wanted to show off my wife [Sadie Lee Watson Yette].  She was with me--they wanted to show off my wife being pregnant.  We walked all the way around to Glenn Thompson's office.  And once we were in there with Glenn Thompson, he says, "Now, [HistoryMaker] Sam [Samuel Yette]," he says, "you know black people want to live, you know, elsewhere, other than the Third Street Bridge [Dayton, Ohio] and all that," and so forth and so on.  And we got into an argument.  Now, he's the top editor.  And I said, "Look, Mr. Thompson, I spent the last four hundred dollars I got moving to Dayton [Ohio].  But, if necessary, I'll borrow four hundred dollars more from somebody, and move back to Tuskegee [Alabama].  But we're not going to settle it this way."  And he slammed his hands down on the desk and told Mr. [John] Moore [ph.] to get me out of there (laughter).  Well, two things now--I have to tell you two things.  One was that when I turned in my letter of resignation, Mr. Thompson asked me--he--to come to his office.  And he said, "Sam, he says, you have been such a difference in this place in Dayton."  He said, "I want you to go to your desk and write anything you want, at whatever length you want, and explain how it was that you came with such pre-dispositions, or whatever such thoughts, as you had."  And then, he went to tell me a story.  He said, "I was born in Memphis, Tennessee."  And he said, "I have never had anybody your color to tell me no about anything."  He said, "When I was a little boy," he said, "my mother had a maid whose son played with me.  And we got into an argument about a toy or something, and that mother came over and she spanked that boy and told him that I was white, and I should never get into an argument with a white person."  And he said, "You came in here, and for the first time in my life, I had been told no by a black person."  He said, "You go to your desk, write at whatever length you want, whatever you want, to explain how, how this came about."  And I did--and that was my resignation.
Story_ID: 196595
Speaker 1: However, the other story was--I wanted to tell you that Ted Bingham, who had also graduated from Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], and I had considered him one of the good guys at the paper [Journal-Herald, later Dayton Daily News].  He was the city editor.  And he came over to me after I had been there about three months after I had moved to [Dayton] City Hall [Dayton, Ohio].  And he came over to me and says, "[HistoryMaker] Sam [Samuel Yette]," he says, "I want you do me a favor."  And I said, "Well, was it?"  And he said, well, he says, you know, I don't want to call her real name, let's call her Gerry [ph.].  He says, "Gerry has a problem with her back."  And I said, "Well, what's got to do with me, Ted?"  And he said, "Well, she wants you to drive her home."  And I said, "Beg pardon?"  And he says, "Well, because she left her notes at home."  I said, "Get out of here, Ted, what are you talking about?  I got to go to City hall."  He says, "No," he says, "I want you to do me a favor."  And I said, "Well, wait a minute, Ted.  It's either a favor for you personally, or an assignment--now, are you assigning me?"  And he walked around the desk for a little bit and says, "Okay, I'm assigning you."  And I said, well, I'm assigned now to be a chauffeur.  So, I went over to her desk and I said, "Okay, Gerry"--as we're calling her--"let's go."  We got on the elevator.  She had parked right across the street.  We went right across the street, got in her car, and she was, oh, ailing with her back, and she asked me to drive, and I drove.  She lived out in some place, and I (laughter) drove her up to the door, her driveway and whatever.  And she got out and she says, "Oh, can you help me in?"  I came around, helped her to the door, and I said, "I'm going to wait here 'cause you're going to get your notes right away."  And she said, "Oh, no, no, come in."  And I said, to myself--I said, every guy by age fifty has had to be a Jackie Robinson at one time or another.  You know, he doesn't want to intimidate, and he doesn't want to be nice when the pitchers are throwing at his head and all these.  I said, c'mon, I said, "Okay, I'll step right inside, and wait for you."  So, she went up the stairs, and she said, "Sam, pour yourself a drink."  And I said, "No, we don't have time--get, get out of here, we gotta go."  She said, "No," she says, "help yourself, says, well, have a seat."  And I said, "Hey, I don't want to sit down.  We gotta, I gotta cover City Hall."  Suddenly, there's music.  Suddenly, without a strap on her body, she comes downstairs (laughter), grabs me, and says, "Oh, did you know that I'm a Gold Dancer?"  I, I, it's--my God, it's a nightmare!  I don't know where in the (laughter)--what's going on here?  I said, "Hey, turn me loose!  What--get out of here!"  And she says, "I'm a Gold Dancer."  She said, "There's copper and there's silver, and then there's gold--I'm a Gold Dancer."  I, I--I went to the door, went out, got in the car.  Five minutes later, she comes back, walking straight.  She says, "I'll drive," gets in the car, drove there.  I am, I am dizzy, I am dizzy with amazement (laughter).
Story_ID: 196596
Speaker 1: Well, the only way I found out what was going on was there was a photographer who was going with me to the West Side [Dayton, Ohio] to photograph something.  And I said to him, I said, listen, did you know, West Side, Third Street Bridge [Dayton, Ohio], and all that stuff--I said, "Look, we're right near my house.  Why don't we stop and have my wife [Sadie Lee Walton Yette] serve us some lunch while we're at it?"  And he says, "Okay."  And he belonged to one of these--non-drinking people, you know--churches, one of these non-drinking.  And, but in those days, I did have a beer once in a while.  And I thought, you know, ham and cheese, and a beer would be great.  And I said, "Well, look, why don't you have a ham and cheese and a beer and whatever?"  I didn't realize that he didn't drink.  And he says--his eyes started getting funny--and he says, "Yeah, well, no, I can't tell you this, no, no, I can't tell you."  And I said, "Well, have another beer" (laughter), and I poured him so more.  He says, "I can't tell you, I can't tell you this" (laughter).  I said--so I poured him some more and I said--and he says, "Well, maybe I can tell you 'cause you need to know, you need to know."  And I said, "Well, what, tell me what, what do I need to know?"  "No, I can't tell you."  Well, I cajoled him into telling me.  So, what he tells me is (laughter) that before they would hire me at the Journal-Herald [later, Dayton Daily News], the photographers wanted to go on strike because of my coming.  And the negotiation was that they would test me, and if I failed, they would fire me.
Speaker 2: So, that all was a setup?
Speaker 1: Oh, entirely, entirely a setup.  And, and he was the one who told me.  And I, otherwise, I never would have known what it was about--it was a setup.  The, the negotiation had taken place that they would fire me if I fell for their trap (laughter).
Speaker 2: All that, and there are so many implications in this or what black people want, and black men want, and what they would do, and all this.
Speaker 1: Well, what, what--I, I came home that night, and I explained to my wife.  She said, "Why, why, what is this all about?"  And I couldn't, I couldn't explain it.   And I said, "I, I have no idea what it was about."  And she--strange place, you know, but what, what we finally were pleased about was that she [Gerry (ph.)] was a pro, that she was a pro, that she went on, and told the guys the truth that I--hey, hey, I went to the car as quickly as I could--get out of her grasp (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, what a story.  That's a bizarre (laughter), what a bizarre story.
Story_ID: 196597
Speaker 1: So, now, Peace Corps, next--
Speaker 2: Well, I left there, and went--Carl Rowan called me.  And I came to the Peace Corps, and went to Africa for the first time with [R.] Sargent Shriver.  Douglas Kiker, who later worked for NBC News, was the head of the information bureau of public information [director of information] at the Peace Corps.  And Sargent Shriver was, frankly, a very difficult person for whom to work, very difficult, very demanding.  And, in fact, Kiker's job was on the line, because the most recent guy who had traveled with Shriver to South America, Shriver sent him back mid-trip--said, get out of here, go, go back, and get fired, or whatever, you know.  So, Kiker's job was on the line.  So, he sent Shriver a note saying, "I'm sure [HistoryMaker] Sam [Samuel] Yette can handle what your demands are--take him to Africa."  So, we went.  And one of two things, I think, really caused him--once we got to Ghana to--we were visiting Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ghana.  But he sent Kiker a letter when we got to Ghana, saying, Sam Yette is doing an excellent job.  And what that meant was your job is saved for the moment.  Now, I think two things especially turned him around.  I was interviewing the, President [William] Tubman, who was very proud of the fact that he had descended from slaves in Georgia (laughter).  But anyway, while I was interviewing him, then I went--Shriver was getting an honorary degree from the University of Liberia [Monrovia, Liberia].  And I went, not to--you know, I didn't care that much about the reception.  I went to the office and ran off copies of my story telling about his honorary.  And in the story, I had used the initials for the degree, and whatever.  And the [U.S.] State Department guy, who later became a state department executive, who was the in-country person in charge--the next morning, was looking at it.  And he says, "Oh, Sarg," he says, "No, he's, he's made a mistake here."  And I said, "Beg your pardon?"  And he said, "No, I, I, I don't think that's--."  And I said, "No, no, no, you're thinking--I checked it" (laughter), "So it is correct" (laughter).  So, oh, oh, he says, "Oh, oh, okay."  So, those two things caused Shriver to think that--hey, he needed somebody in his office who could take care of things like that.  Number one, I knew what I was doing and, secondly, I had gone on, and done it--the work instead of going to the reception.
Story_ID: 196598
Speaker 1: At the Peace Corps for the first four months, you were like public information officer?  You were in the public information office, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  But then, when I came back from the African trip, I had really become a favorite of the [R. Sargent] Shriver's.  And Frank [Franklin] Williams, who was a person, who was one of the executives, called me on the phone and told me--he says, "[HistoryMaker] Sam [Samuel Yette]," he says, "Bill Moyers is on his way up to ask you to be executive secretary."  He says, "Sam," he says, "don't worry about it--Sarge [R. Sargent Shriver] would not ask you to be executive secretary if you weren't able to do it.  Tell him yes."  And he says, I know he's on his way up now.  And so, Moyers came and, quite frankly--frankly, told me how difficult the job was.  And (laughter), and I said, hey, you know, all I want to do is what Sarge wants, you know (laughter).  And so, I'm--and so, I was number six guy down in information.  And now, I'm now number three guy in the whole organization (laughter) behind Moyers and Shriver.  And so, that was quite a leap.  In fact, [Douglas] Kiker didn't want me to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were at the Peace Corps there for--until '64 [1964], right?  I guess, right--yeah, until '64 [1964]--
Story_ID: 196599
Speaker 1: You worked for--you were special assistant for the director of the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity [OEO]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did that transition occur?
Speaker 2: Well, I was literally standing with [R. Sargent] Shriver when [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson called and asked him to start a poverty program.  And I was already executive secretary of the Peace Corps.  But since they did not get money until late in the year, I had to be executive secretary to both, peace and poverty (laughter), which means I didn't get much sleep at all.
Speaker 1: That's a--so the Johnson administration is famous for its poverty programs and the War on Poverty, and introduced the Job Corps, and quite a few other programs.  And you wrote about all of these in your book, 'The Choice: [The Issue of Black Survival in America,' Samuel Yette] in '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Just, before we get to that, let's just--I just want to--let's see, okay.  You went from--well, how did the--your term as director of U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity--you were there till '67 [1967]--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --and then you went to Newsweek.  But what, how is that--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was because--is that because of the election of [President Richard Milhous] Nixon as a--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in 1967, [Senator James] Eastland joined forces with [Mayor Richard J.] Daley in Chicago [Illinois]--Eastland in Mississippi--
Speaker 1: Is it Senator James, Senator James O. Eastland?
Speaker 2: --in Mississippi, joined forces with Daley in Chicago.  And what they had in interest was that the anti-poverty program was an election issue that the people in the poverty program were really against them, and wanted to throw him out of office.  So, the Child Development Group of Mississippi, CDGM, the Child Development Group of Mississippi--Eastland decided had to go because they were teaching folks how to vote, and they were going to vote him out of office (laughter).  And the effort was made, and it came up--I was on the senior staff.  And the issue came up to our senior staff meeting and I voted no.  I say, hey, hey, we can't have the CDGM shut down without understanding why.  And on the way out of the meeting, there were persons who counseled Shriver that they would have to leave me out of the next meeting, which they did, and made a decision to cut him off without my involvement.  In Chicago, there was a meeting of--there was a convention going on of the church of--it was one of those church groups.  Anyway, they took out a full page ad in the New York Times saying, "Say it isn't so, Sarge [R. Sargent Shriver]."  And they took out a full page ad and explained how, hey, you, you've gone back on what you're trying to do.  The long and short of it was I resented my being left out of the second meeting.  But Sarge had the answer that the ad in the New York Times saying that, hey, we made this decision with my civil rights advisor, and so forth (laughter), which wasn't true (laughter).  So, he and I clashed at that point.  And I told him I had to leave, and he told me I wouldn't make it if I left.  And I said, "Sarge, what you're talking about?  There was a war fought about that, and what you're talking about lost.  I got to go."  I had, at that time, a couple of job offers in my pocket.  The next morning, they disappeared (laughter).
Story_ID: 196600
Speaker 1: So, I had to go all the way to New York [New York] to find a job, so I went to New York in May.  And then, in September, there was a requirement that the New York City Board of Education [sic, New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE)] had been required by the New York State Legislature [New York State Assembly] to find four ways to keep from--the school in the Bronx [New York, New York], from being overpopulated with black people.  And while we were required actually to do one, we found four.  But that was a job I took under Nelson Associates [ph.], okay.  And while I was in New York, I applied to Newsweek, and came to Newsweek on January 1, 1968.
Story_ID: 196601
Speaker 1: Newsweek, you were at Newsweek during the time that [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And there was a lot of urban unrest arise afterwards and so forth?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, you were there--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --were you the first black reporter for Newsweek?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: First Washington [D.C.] correspondent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had other personnel in New York [New York] and Chicago [Illinois] and Los Angeles [California], but I was the first Washington correspondent.
Speaker 1: The southern-most of the (laughter) assignments, I guess, right.  Okay, what was like--what, you know?  Just give us a few highlights of that and 'cause that's important, you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Well, it--that'll be very difficult for you to believe this (laughter).  The [Washington] bureau chief, Mel Elfin, refused to call me by name (laughter).  I know, I know, but he's--okay, now, he's the assignment editor.  And if you don't answer by the name he calls you, you don't get the assignment (laughter), okay?  So, his name for me is Pussycat (laughter).  So, I said, "Mel, you're a grown man; I'm a grown person.  What, what is this Pussycat business?"  "Oh, you don't have a sense of humor."  I say, what--"You can call me [HistoryMaker] Sam [Samuel Yette], it's okay."  "All right, Buster, that's what we'll you--Buster."  I--"Buster, what, what's wrong with my name?"  So, (laughter), the problem became such that--the long and short of it was after four years, he would vary sometime between Buster, Pussycat, Mr. Yette, which was another absurdity.  And the long and short of it was that when the book ['The Choice: The Issue of Black Survival in America,' Samuel Yette] came out in '71 [1971], I knew that they were going to fire me because I had done the book without their knowledge or without their cooperation.  Now, others used company time, company information, and whatever to do their books--I did my time entirely on my own, entirely on my own, but that was not sufficient.  So, I knew they were going to fire me when the book came out.  And, in fact, Mel Elfin called me to his office and said, "Sam"--by now, it's Sam--"the White House doesn't want us to come back until we get rid of you."  And I said, "What's the problem?"--as if I didn't know.  And he said, "You know, [President Richard Milhous] Nixon doesn't trust you, and our writers in New York don't trust you, and, therefore, you have to go."  And I said, well, okay.  But I also got my lawyer--we stayed in court six years.  Edward Bennett Williams, do you know that name at all?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, they fired--I won the first case, and they fired that lawyer--and hired Edward Bennett Williams, which means they're serious, and he got it turned around at the Appeals Court [D.C. Court of Appeals].
Speaker 1: So, so the--you already lost the case, you said, that's your impression--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, he turned it around.  I asked for a writ of certiorari, and you have to have at least four persons on the court to agree to take the case.  I had only two, Thurgood Marshall and one other.
Story_ID: 196602
Speaker 1: Let's get to the book 'The Choice:  The Issue of Black Survival in America' [HistoryMaker Samuel Yette], that's published in 1971.  Now, who was the publisher of 'The Choice?'
Speaker 2: The first publisher was G.P. Putnam's Sons and they were the first publisher.  And there was a paragraph in my contract that provided for me to reclaim the publishing rights, and I did so later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they published the first edition in '71 [1971], right?
Speaker 2: Oh, they published the first, the first nine editions.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  The book that was--it was, it made a tremendous impact on the way black people look at, you know, politics in the United States in much disgust.  And people remember passages verbatim almost and they--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, as I've said earlier, one professor I know used to always use your name to spell it out when he said Samuel Yette, "Y-E-T-T-E--remember that," you know.  It was--so you became sort of a personality, you know, on college campuses speaking, you know, about the book.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And summarize the book for us.  What was the book about and why did you write 'The Choic,', you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I was covering stories in Washington [D.C.], particularly health, education, and welfare; [U.S.] Department of Labor, occasionally, the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.]; occasionally, the White House [Washington, D.C.].  What I discovered was--and, and the [U.S.] Congress [Washington, D.C.], of course.   What I discovered was that there was a serious discussion, high level, on whether black people ought to be permitted to survive in this society, and that there were those who said that guerilla warfare ought to be committed against black people.  And I, I heard it and I began to collect information on it saying, you know, these people are serious.  These are high-level people and I--if I can look at your book for just a minute.  So, one of the things I found was that there was a group of persons very much interested in rice who were also interested in whether we survived.  And let's see, I used to know the number.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the whole piece about rice growing in the South--
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: --is--you kind of--I mean, I think about it often today in 2004, we're in the midst of this war in Iraq--
Speaker 2: It's all about oil.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 196603
Speaker 1: What I discovered was--a couple of things.  One, I'm going to read from page 130 [of 'The Choice: The Issue of Black Survival in America,' HistoryMaker Samuel Yette], okay.  "When the decisive decade, the 1960s began, the United States was not a leader among the world's rice growers, exporters, or consumers.  At the close of the decade, the United States still was not a big rice consumer, nor even a major rice grower.  But as an exporter, the United States was number one despite a green revolution that dramatically increased rice yields in the Philippines, India, Pakistan, and South Vietnam--all customers for U.S. rice.  As the decade closed, the United States still produced less than 1 percent of the world's rice, but was incredibly the world's leading rice exporter, consuming only 35 percent of its rice produced, selling the other 65 percent abroad to a hundred countries, but mainly to South Korea and South Vietnam."  Now, what I discovered was there are only five rice-producing countries, uh, states in the United States, only five--California, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and what's the other--
Speaker 2: It should be Mississippi, wouldn't it?
Speaker 1: --Mississippi.  And the people who were chairmen of these committees were all from these states.  For example, just let me give you an idea.  The congressional chairmanships in the 91st [U.S.] Congress and these rice-cut representatives are in bold type.  Their allies in italics.  In the [U.S.] Senate, the Agricultural [sic. Agriculture, Nutrition] & Forestry Committee, [Senator] Allen J. Ellender, and his third in command, [Senator] James O. Eastland of Mississippi; the appropriations committee, Allen J. Ellender of Louisiana; [Senator] John [Little] McClellan of Arkansas; [U.S. Senate Committee on] Armed Services, [Senator] John C. Stennis of Mississippi--
Speaker 2: He was almost 100 years old then (laughter).
Speaker 1: --[Senator] Russell B. Long in charge of [U.S. Senate Committee on] Finance; [Senator] J. William Fulbright of Arkansas was in charge of [U.S. Senate Committee on] Foreign Relations; John McClellan of Arkansas, in charge of [U.S. Senate Committee on] Government Operations [later U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]; James O. Eastland and John McClellan--Eastland from Mississippi, McClellan from Arkansas--both in charge of [U.S. Senate Committee on] Judiciary; [U.S. Senate Committee on Education] Labor and Public Welfare[later, the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP)], [Senator] Ralph Yarborough of Texas; and so forth.  Well, they can control anything, including the fact that the President [Lyndon Baines Johnson] of the United States was from Texas, one of the rice-producing states.  It was about food and the manipulation of the ability of those people in the Far East to feed themselves.  That's what it's about.
Speaker 2: So the dynamic of that, as I remember the book, is that, as the U.S. bombed South Vietnam and the rice paddies were destroyed, then rice would have to be exported from the United States to--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --at the taxpayers' expense?
Speaker 1: Absolutely, absolutely.  And when they were talking about burning off the vegetation, the brush, defoliation, as they would call--as it was called, defoliation of the jungles.  What they were doing, they were destroying the people's rice (laughter).  That's what the defoliation was.
Speaker 2: They were telling us that the Viet Cong were hiding in the foliage, so we need to get rid of the foliage to (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yes.  And so, now, what we're faced with, we're faced with a situation--not unlike the '60s [1960s], but we--it's just changed places.  Now, it's oil--still about oil.
Story_ID: 196604
Speaker 1: And once again, influential politicians who are linked to private industry--I think, just to go back to that other point a second, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, and the point you're making also is that these, these senators actually have personal interest in the production of rice.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, absolutely, absolutely.  They were, in fact, for example, one of the senators from Mississippi, for example, put in soil bank, two thousand acres of land, for which he was getting a quarter of a million dollars a year.  So, he says, why am I paying these black people to work in my fields, and I can put it in a soil bank, and get the money myself--just get it outright, and keep my money, and keep my land, and keep my money (laughter).
Speaker 1: Also, we're not some--these same individuals sat on top of the committees that appropriated--created funds for the poverty programs as well, right?  Is that--
Speaker 2: Well, they were working.  I, I--one afternoon, I asked my secretary to stay.  And I said, J.B. [John Brown] Olinger used to say, you know, figures don't lie, but liars figure (laughter).  And I said, "Joan [ph.], stay for a minute, and let us find out how much money is going to poor people out of this program.  This is the Office of Economic Opportunity [OEO], but how much money are the people getting?  And let's compare it to how much money is going to the big companies."  And no money was going to the people.  The big money was going to the big corporations.  And that's what I spell out.
Story_ID: 196605
Speaker 1: I was covering the Miami [Florida] Convention of the AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations].  And I went up to see George Shultz, the [U.S.] Secretary of Labor, and he thought I was dumber even than I am.  And I asked him what he was going to do about all these programs.  And he said, "Oh, we're going to take care of you people."
Speaker 2: And I said, "Well, how are you going to do that?"
Speaker 1: He said, "Well, we're going to provide Job Corps Centers for, you know, whenever we got a boy who's poor, we got a sister who's poor also."  I said, "Oh, what are you going to do about that?"  He says, "Well, well," and he's studying me, and he says, "well, we're going to bring them in, and we're going to bring both of them into the Job Corps Center."  And I said, "Well, that's interesting--what are you going to do with the rest of them?"  He said, "Well, now their parents are poor, too."  And I said, "Well, what are you going to do about that?"  And he said, "Well," he says, "we're going to bring the parents and the children, and all of them into a center."  And I said, "Well, my goodness, what are you going to do about that?"  And he says, "Well, they won't have to leave for any reason."  I said, "Really, really?"  And he says, "Well, no, in fact, we're going to give them jobs right there, right there in that place."  I said, "Really?"  And he said, "Well, they won't have to go anywhere for anything."  I said, "Really?"  And he says, "Well, yes," he says, "We're going have their jobs, and everything located right there where they're living, and we're going to bring them all into the center."  And I said, "My goodness, they won't have to go anywhere for anything."  And he said, that's right.  So, I remembered that when I got him on 'Meet the Press' a couple of weeks later.  And I said, "Secretary of Labor," I said, "what are you going to do with these Job Corps Centers?  I understand you've closed a couple of hundred of them, and we've got a lot of investment in them.  What are you going to do with them?"  He said, "Well, I'm gonna--we're going to take care of them."  And I said, "Well, what are you going to do?"  And he says--so as, as he saw the question coming, Secretary Shultz began to kind of frown and wagging of his head, as if to plead with me not to complete the question.  When the question was through, he sat for a long, embarrassing pause, and finally responded with a classic dodge, which was, in effect, an admission that even an obvious dodge would be less incriminating than the truth.  And I said, "What are you going to do with the Job Corps Centers?"  And he said, "I think I will just have to duck on that one."  And in other words, I said, "In other words, they might be used for concentration camps."  He said, "No, I'm not going to get into the argument between the Washington Post and Mr. [Richard] Kleindienst."  But (laughter), well, well, what he was clearly intending to do was to make these Job Corps Centers concentration camps.
Speaker 2: You won't have to leave for anything?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you won't have to leave for anything.
Speaker 2: They'll put you to work right there?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  We're going to bring your job right to you.
Speaker 2: Parents and the--
Speaker 1: And, and the kids--parents and the kids.
Speaker 2: It's a labor camp--it sounds like, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's what [Adolf] Hitler thought he was doing when he was taking kids, uh, Jews, to labor camps--same thing.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.
Story_ID: 196606
Speaker 1: During that time, during the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s]--I think it was the early '70s [1970s], too, the book by John A. Williams called 'The Man Who Cried I Am', where he outlined a fictional plan called the King Alfred Plan, which was--actually had a real parallel in real times called the McCarran Internal Security Act [Internal Security Act of 1950], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and, in fact, I know John A. Williams and his is fictional, but it is parallel to what we're saying here in non-fiction.  We don't have a line of fiction in this.
Speaker 1: That's right.  So, so the--tell us something about--I guess, rather than have me editorialize about it, but what about the reception of the book ['The Choice: The Issue of Survival in Black America,' HistoryMaker Samuel Yette]?  How did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I had--one fellow I remember very well (laughter), Herb Mangrum--we had worked at the Afro-American [Company, later Afro-American Newspapers] together.  And Herb came to me and he said, he says, "Man, you're so paranoid."  He says, "Ain't nobody tackling nobody's phones and stuff like that.  Why, why do you say things like that?"  One year later, I give him lots of credit--he came back and said, "Hey, man, you're right" (laughter).  He said, you are right.  He said, "Man, they're not only tapping our phones, they're doing everything else.  They're sleeping under our beds, and listening to us."  And Herb did say that, and but, the reception was dubious.  And, but there was a lot of intelligent reading and listening.  In the forward to this edition, [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Barbara Reynolds tells how [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory told her to go and get a copy of this book and read it, and you'll understand what is going down.  And she did the foreword to this edition.  And Dick Gregory helped (unclear) her to it, and she said--he said, go and get a copy of this book (laughter).  It's terrible what they're trying to do to us.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think it'd be safe to say that anybody that had any kind of political sense knows they was (unclear) black, was trying to get a copy of 'The Choice.'
Speaker 2: Well, the sales have been very good really.
Speaker 1: Over the years now--this, the information was written initially in 1971--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and it stays in print.
Speaker 2: This is the eleventh printing in hardcover, and the fourteenth printing in paper.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a--other than works of fiction, you know, classical works of fiction, you know, I can't think of any other book that's had that kind of--
Speaker 2: Well, it's been used at more than a hundred universities as a text.  There are a hundred at least, I know, have used it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, today, when you look at some of the conclusions in this book, do they--do you still see similar pattern of activity from the government?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, what I hear is that you can't really understand today unless you read this.
Story_ID: 196607
Speaker 1: After 'The Choice: ['The Issue of Black Survival in America,' HistoryMaker Samuel Yette] came out, and you left, you left--well, they--you were released from Newsweek?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What I said, to put it in a euphemized way, I guess.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You went, you taught at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], right?  That's one of the things--
Speaker 2: For fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Fifteen years.
Speaker 2: And my students have just been terrific.  At least one [Isabel Wilkerson] has won a Pulitzer Prize already and--
Speaker 1: Which one?
Speaker 2: Well, it's--the bureau chief in Chicago [Illinois], the New York Times bureau chief in Chicago.  And several have written books, and I have copies of several of their books there, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I won't put you on the spot (laughter), but can you remember some of the names of some of the ones in the--yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I have a list, which I'll be glad to share with you--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that'll--okay.
Speaker 2: --I'll be glad to share with you.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And at Howard, during the '80s [1980s]--I think it was during the '80s [1980s] that we had the--well, we just recently had this case with the young man, Jayson Blair, at the New York Times.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: He's, you know, a situation where he's about the only black person in the newsroom.  And he gets, you know, he gets all these assignments.  And then they say, I'll look, see here--look, he's messed it up, and that sort of thing.  And all the black journalists are embarrassed.  It seem like black professionals all over are embarrassed because of this.  And it harkens back to another case with Janet Cooke at the Washington Post--I think it was--who wrote a story that was proven later on to be a fabricated story.  What are your thoughts about these cases and the--
Speaker 2: Well, my students were being taught how to detect a phony story.  And I told them at the time this came out, and, in fact, [HistoryMaker] Roger Wilkins has written, that I told them at the time that, hey, this story has no attribution.  It's a fake story, and they expressed some doubt about it.  And one kid says, "Well, wait a minute, Mr. Yette, this has won the Pulitzer Prize."  And I said, "What is the Pulitzer Prize?"  And she said, "Well, the Pulitzer Prize is a monument in journalism."  And I said, "Well, that means that they've told a monumental lie.  It doesn't mean that it is the truth."  And, sure enough, a year later, when they had to return the Pulitzer Prize, the students were very comical.  They were bowing in the hallway, you know, as I came in (laughter) saying, okay, you did tell us so.  And they--one of the places where we actually have to test whether a story is--these so-called blind attributions, you know, when you don't--if you have somebody who is willing to tell you off the record, that means that they are not accountable themselves, which means they'll tell you anything (laughter).  And this was a non-attributable story.
Story_ID: 196608
Speaker 1: It seems as though people have gotten used to stories that are--that can't be attributed to anybody--I mean, as being truthful in a sense.  If you think of--they're still trying to figure out who Deep Throat was in Watergate, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, yes, well (laughter), actually, they didn't really have to go outside the Washington Post newsroom to find Watergate, to find--
Speaker 1: Deep Throat.
Speaker 2: Deep Throat (laughter).
Speaker 1: It could be as simple as that (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I see, I see.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, as long as everything panned out in the end then--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I mean--see, when you've got as much, as many skilled personnel as the Washington Post, you have, as a matter of fact, your own intelligence community from all over the world--feeding you constantly.  They're coming in, even as we speak, they're coming in constantly from all over the world.  And so, when you've got that many competent journalists, you've got an intelligence community yourself.
Speaker 1: Because you really don't--yeah, it may work a lot better than what we think is intelligence community--maybe on a level if that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Unless they're using trained journalists, you know, in military intelligence (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well, they have.  In 'The Choice: ['The Issue of Black Survival in America,' HistoryMaker Samuel Yette], I point out that the--Father [Theodore] Hesburgh, for example, was one person who was used in the intelligence community, and there have been others who have--
Speaker 1: He was a president of [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana] or something?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But these people can go back and forth and work in the intelligence community, and work in the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], and the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], and whatever, and go back and forth.
Story_ID: 196609
Speaker 1: You've written for the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers] with--you've been a commentator for Black Entertainment Television [B.E.T.] throughout the '80s [1980s] and the--but in '82 [1982], I think, it's significant that you founded your own publishing company?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Cottage Books?
Speaker 2: Cottage Books, right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: The--anybody who goes on the, online, can look us up--Cottage Books and posters and Merchant America [ph.] through Merchant America, and they can look us up and order through the company.  Merchant American will allow you to use your credit card and we'll send the books right out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you publish other authors than yourself or--
Speaker 2: That has been my intention although I haven't gotten around to it.  I've been publishing instead posters and postcards and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, the secret here that most people don't know is that you're an accomplished photographer as well.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Well, that secret, we ought to get rid of.  But that is a fact that we have one book, for example, that has--it's a book of 160 photographs of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and the marches and so forth.  And it's called 'Washington and Two Marches, [1963 & 1983]:  The Third American Revolution' [co-authored with Frederick Walton Yette].  And I hope people will get a chance to see that as well.

Speaker 1: Over the years, in every town, there seems to be some black journalist who's engaged in, you know, the fight, you know, to inform the black community--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and keep them on their toes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, you know, Chicago, we have [HistoryMaker Lutrelle] Lu [F.] Palmer [II] who's, you know, who's incapacitated right now, but was a great warrior in his day.  [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jarrett just passed away, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In Dayton [Ohio], we had Lawrence Nelson [ph.], you know, he was trying to hold the light up.
Speaker 2: What was his name?
Speaker 1: Lawrence Nelson (unclear).
Speaker 2: I don't know him.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had something called Dayton Black Press [ph.] and--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --and Lawrence Nelson was associated with that, and some other publications, too, but he's passed away.  And W.S. McIntosh was also--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, I know Sumpter McIntosh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, Nelson and McIntosh--
Speaker 2: Sure, in fact, he's pictured in the book on the marches.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But who are some of the people that you admired, other black journalists that you admired, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I did admire, and liked Louis [E.] Martin, who's now departed.  I knew very well and liked Carl Rowan, despite the fact that Carl was defamed in some ways, and that he made some comments regarding Malcolm X and so forth, but Carl was an awfully able man.  And I knew and liked Vernon Jarrett very much who, incidentally, graduated from Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee].  And Knoxville College is where my wife [Sadie Lee Watson Yette] attended and where I met her, as a matter of fact.  So, I have admired people like [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Butler Gilliam who's a long-time friend of mine.  And there's a fellow who writes for the Post now--what's his name--Courtland Milloy.  I think he writes an interesting column, sometimes brilliantly really, um-hm.  So, I have a number of colleagues.  I did enjoy--in fact, Larry Steele [ph.], who is now deceased; and Steve [Steven W.] Duncan, who was with the New York Daily News; Valerie Russ, who is with the Philadelphia Daily News.  Steve Duncan and I--as a matter of fact--worked a project to help [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] through a situation.  But Steve was a very competent and able fellow.
Story_ID: 196611
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, first, I found Bill Cosby's comments of some interest and validity.  He, of course, criticized people who are not taking care of business, and who are wearing their pants low, and who are not achieving.  Sometimes I go to schools myself--and I went to a school and gave a black history lecture.  And some, otherwise really handsome young fellow was sitting in the very back row, and he was doing everything he could to disturb the class.  And when he left, he was one of the last to leave.  And I said, "You know, when I was your age, I was not able to attend any high school in my community because of my race."  And he said, "Oh, but we've gotten rid of all that."  And I said, "But if it had depended on you, would we have?"  And he just shrugged and walked out.  Now, what I would wish for us would be that we would do a better job of positivizing our women.  I absolutely don't understand the negativity that takes place regarding our women.  I just can't fathom that at all.  I hope that we come to a place of respect for one another.  I have said it before, and I repeat it here--that in my years as a journalist, what I have discovered is that people who disrespect one another, wind up eventually in one of three places--the hospital, the prisons, and the morgue--prematurely.  Therefore, I would hope that our people would learn self-respect and, therefore, respect for others, and therein lies the ability to achieve, and the ability to understand what the world is about, and to go up in the world.  We are still, I fear, threatened with survival, physical survival, and the nonsense that goes into our heads.  And if we don't respect one another, we're on that way.
Story_ID: 196612
Speaker 1: What do you think the prospects are for aspiring black people that want to be journalists today?  What do we think the prospects are, and what advice would you give to them?
Speaker 2: Well, the editor of the NNPA, the National Newspaper Publishers Association--a fellow named [HistoryMaker] George Curry says that he decided to become a journalist when I gave a lecture at Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee], and I'm pleased about that.  And I think that becoming intelligent people is tied to this whole business now of the digital separation, you know, that is threatening us.  But we do have to be computer literate and, but the inquiring mind, the inquiring mind, reading broadly, and giving us a base for questioning.  And we must question everything, everything, everything, we must question everything because we're in the throes of great danger, great danger.  And I just think that the inquiring mind is what we must arouse in our students.
Story_ID: 196613
Speaker 1: Sir, when you look back at your life thus far, what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I enjoy the fact that I've never stolen a nickel in my life.  I remember one of my favorite moments--the moment when I was in [Rockwood Colored High School, later Campbell] High School [Rockwood, Tennessee], I proposed to the Nunn Bush store in my town [Harriman, Tennessee] that I could shine shoes for fifteen cents.  And if the client was willing to add fifteen cents to his bill, that he would get his shoes shined.  And the company, the Nunn Bush store, would keep ten cents, and I would get a nickel.  Well, the man who owned the store went off to the [U.S.] Navy.  This was during World War I [WWII].  And his parents didn't understand what had happened, and they put on a sale.  You see, we had to ration shoes.  Shoes were--sugar and so forth-- and things we had to ration.  And they put on a sale of no stamps because it was near the end of the war, and they thought the war going to end, and they didn't need the stamps anymore.  Well, the young man who owned the store wrote to his parents and told them to stock up and whatever and--but they needed stamps.  So, what do you think they did?  They accused me of stealing the stamps.  Well, I was, I was dumbfounded.  I said, "What am I going to do with stamps?  What, what are you saying to me?"  And she said, "Well, you know, we won't need you after Friday."  And I said, "No, no, no, no, if you're accusing me of stealing, I'm leaving here tonight."  It was the middle of the week--I said, no, no, no, we're leaving tonight.  And I remember how, how it was a cold night, and I walked all the way home in the snow.  And I hated to tell my mother [Cora Lee Rector Yette] this story because my father [Frank Mack Yette] had then, had a stroke.  And he was then lying flat on his bed.  And I remember as much as I hated to tell my mother this story--I said, "Mom, I got fired."  And she came to attention quickly and she said, "Why did you get fired?"
Story_ID: 196614
Speaker 1: You were walking home from the [Nunn Bush] Shoe Store and--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --you get to your--
Speaker 2: --yes, so I was walking home [to Harriman, Tennessee] afterward, and she told me that she didn't need me after Friday, and it was the middle of the week.  And it was a cold night.  And I walked home, and as badly as I hated to bring my mother [Cora Lee Rector Yette] bad news because my dad [Frank Mack Yette] had, had a stroke, and he was lying flat of his back of a stroke--first time he'd ever been sick, really seriously, yeah.  But, anyway, I--what I most remember, and what I most treasure is my mother's response to what I had told her.  I said, "Mom, I got fired."  And she said, "Why did you get fired?"  And I said, "Mrs. Edwards [ph.] accused me of stealing."  And this is what I treasure--my mother said to me--not I said to her.  She said to me, "You have never stolen anything in your life.  Get that woman on the phone" (laughter) and, and we got her on the phone.  An hour later, at my mother's insistence, we were at their house, and my mother tore the lady to shreds.  She tore her to shreds with their logic and incisiveness.  And so, the lady finally says, "Well, we don't, we don't, we don't have to pursue this any, any further."  She--and my mother says, "Oh, no, no, no, you accused, accused my son of stealing.  No, we report this to the police tomorrow" (laughter), oh, no, no, we report this to the police tomorrow.  Well, as it turns out, they had enough money and whatever, and influence and whatever.  To avoid any further accusation--but my mother contacted the police the next day.  And, and they equivocated, backed out of it--ended the whole thing.  But the point I'm making is my mother knew, knew, knew that I had not stolen.  She didn't have to ask me, did you steal it?  No, no, no, she knew that I had never stolen anything in my life, and I've treasured that; I treasure that.
Speaker 1: That's an affirmation of your own character, you know.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 196615
Speaker 1: I'll just go onto the last question we usually ask.  And similar to legacy, but it's--oh, if you had, if you had something to do over again, what would it be, or if there's something that you could go back and do, what would it be?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's a good and fair question.  Let's see, what would I redo?  I suppose I would have been more patient with my students.  I certainly would have written 'The Choice: [The Issue of Black Survival in America,' HistoryMaker Samuel Yette], and the book I've written with my son [Frederick Walton Yette], 'Washington and Two Marches, 1963 & 1983: The Third American Revolution,' Samuel F. Yette and Frederick Walton Yette].  There are not many things I would redo really.
Story_ID: 196616
Speaker 1: Have you considered writing another book?  I know that this is a--it seems to be, just observing this and knowing the importance of that book ['The Choice: The Issue of Black Survival in America,' HistoryMaker Samuel Yette] when it came out, and its continuance, its continued importance in black political thought.  That book, it seems to me--you can correct me if I'm wrong here--it seems to me that it came out of a singular set of experiences that it would be hard to duplicate, you know, 'cause you're not inside, or in government right now, and that sort of thing.  But it, but have you considered writing another political piece?
Speaker 2: I'm working on something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, good, good.  Can you tell us something about it (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  No, you know, one of the things I say to people who ask me that question.  I explain to them that there is an intellectual energy, and there is an emotional energy.  And when you see a train standing in the station, letting off steam, it means it's not ready to go yet.  But when they cap up the steam, it's ready to go, and you don't want to let off your steam.  You don't want to let off your emotional energy because once it's gone, you can't recap it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we'll find out, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Story_ID: 196617
Speaker 1: Last question is, what--well, did your mother [Cora Lee Rector Yette] get a chance to see you become successful as a journalist and--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --and your father [Frank Mack Yette]?
Speaker 2: Oh, certainly my mother did.  My father died before the event I'm going to tell you about.  But, but, yes, they had an opportunity to appreciate my work.  But in my hometown [Harriman, Tennessee], which was in 1964, seventy-five years old, it was celebrating its Golden Anniversary.  And I, I was selected as one of the thirty hometown heroes, okay.  And I was pleased with that, although I have others who should have been so honored.  But I was honored at that time because I was the highest-ranking person in the [U.S.] federal government from my hometown.  I was, at that time, executive secretary of the Peace Corps.  But anyway, I was one of the three persons asked to speak on that occasion.  And I told how the town had progressed and I was hoping to bring progress also.  And Governor [Frank G.] Clement, Frank Clement, was one of the speakers also.  And he came to me afterward and said, "You know," he said, "I hear a lot of speeches every day of my life, and I have never heard a finer speech than the one you gave."  And I said, "Thank you, Governor."  He said, "No, I mean it."  I said, "Thank you, Governor."  He said, "Don't call me Governor--call me Frank."  And I said, "Well, thank you, Governor."  He said, "No, call me, Frank."  And I said, "Thank you, Governor."  And he said, "You know why I want people to call me Frank?"  And I said, "No, tell me, Governor."  And he says, "I want people to call me Frank because if they call me Governor, I don't know whether they like me, and I want you to like me."  And I said, "Thank you, Governor."  And he said, "Well, tell me this, would you and your mother like to ride out with me to the park to the next event?"  And I said, "Thank you, but, no, I want this moment to be with my mother alone.  I'll see you at the park, but I want this time to be with the woman, my mother, alone, and to savor this time."  And he met me at the park, and I was able eventually to call him Frank.

Speaker 1: This is a piece [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks and I did of a--in a Life magazine series in September and October of 1956.  The Life magazine took a page, a full page, to apologize for bringing this to the attention of the American people.
Speaker 2: It's a good shot of work.  You can describe the (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is the eleventh edition of 'The Choice: The Issue of Black Survival in America.'  It's my best known work.  The--this is the eleventh edition and the fourteenth edition in paper.  They both are available still.

Speaker 2: This is a book on [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy and the Negro ['The Kennedy Years and the Negro: a Photographic Record' by Doris E. Saunders].  This is [R.] Sargent [Shriver], oh, okay, when I was executive secretary of the Peace Corps.  And I believe--certainly I've been told--that I was the first executive secretary of an agency in the U.S. government.

Speaker 1: About what year is this (unclear)?
Speaker 2: This would have been around 19-, oh, this would have been around 1940--okay, my dad had a stroke in '45 [1945], okay, okay, hmm.  This would have been around 1950, around '50 [1950], '52 [1952], '52 [1952] or '53 [1953].

Okay, that's Maia standing on the ground, and Fred [Frederick Walton Yette] and Joyce [ph.] are their parents.  And Laila is on the pony, L-A-I-L-A.  That's one of the photographs I took in China and that's a picture of the Great Wall of China.  What I discovered was that the Great Wall, when it is continued, is as long as from New York [New York] to San Francisco [California].  It's thirty-seven miles long.
Speaker 1: Thirty-seven thousand or--
Speaker 2: Thirty-seven hundred--I'm sorry, did I say 37,000?  I meant 3,700 miles long.
Speaker 1: Thirty-seven hundred, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  These are my wife's [Sadie Lee Walton Yette] parents, Mr. and Mrs. Louis Walton [ph.], and they, of course, sent my dear wife off to Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: This is the one right here.
Speaker 2: That's when I was in the [U.S.] Air Force Officer Candidate School [later Officer Training School].  And as I described earlier, it was in 1953.
Speaker 1: You put them sideways where they scan better that way.

Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's me with the--standing with the red tie on.  I wanted to take a picture with [HistoryMaker] John [H.] Johnson and his wife [Eunice Walker Johnson].  And he was, of course, the publisher of Ebony when I was there.

Speaker 2: Yeah, 2003.
