Speaker 1: Alright. There's a lot of information out here that you were born in another town.  Can you--what is that--
Speaker 2: Right, so that was where the hospital was where I was born.  There's sort of a--the town of Halifax is small.  Roanoke Rapids I think is adjacent to it, but I actually live in Potecasi, North Carolina.  So, that's the real town where I was, I feel is my birthplace.  So, that's why there are those other places out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Alright.
Story_ID: 22688
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask everyone, that are sort of a warm-up, and they don't require anything more than a short answer.  The first question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes. (laughter).
Speaker 1: What is it?
Speaker 2: I would say apples are my favorite food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's the first time we've heard that answer.
Speaker 2: (laughter).

Speaker 2: Yes, I like to vacation on Cape Cod [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase: "C'est La Vie."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22689
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  We're going to start with your mother's side first so we don't get them mixed up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Lillie Virginia Grant Langford, L-I-L-L-I-E, V-I-R-G-I-N-I-A, Grant, G-R-A-N-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Ah, I don't know the exact date, but it would 1904, approximately.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Potecasi [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, now how far back can you trace your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: I'm not very good at the history, but those who have done the genealogy of the family--can be traced back to at least before the Civil War.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are there stories that are passed down on your mother's side about what life was like before the Civil War and whether they were slave or free or where they may have come from in Africa, or--
Speaker 2: There were some stories that were passed down, and again, you know, I don't know all of the facts.  But there was, my great-grandfather, there were quite a few stories about him.  He had two different families.  So, he was married to his first wife and I think there were seven or eight children by that family.  And then he had a second wife and there were four or five children.  And my grandfather was one of the children of the second wife.  And so, there was quite an extended family, with all of those, you know, with the two sets of children.  But this great-grandfather was instrumental in starting a small school for the children.  And so he was, as I understand it, he was free.  I don't recall whether he bought his freedom or whether he was born as a free individual at that time.  And he went on to acquire land, and he had, he was a farmer and he was able to send some of his kids off to technical school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was, I hope I have this right. Gustas Grant, I believe was his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'm not absolutely sure on that one.
Speaker 1: Alright.  And he lived there in Potecasi?
Speaker 2: He lived in Potecasi.  There is a small stream called the Potecasi Creek, and he was, it was a part of the town, yes, of Potecasi where he lived.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, okay.  Now, did the school bear his name?
Speaker 2: The school, it was not in existence when I was a child, and so I don't know if it ever carried his name or not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you know where some of his offspring went to school?  I mean, if they went to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think they went to either Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] or Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia]
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22690
Speaker 1: So, was your grandfather Grant on that side, a farmer?
Speaker 2: He was, he was.  So he, he actually purchased a sizeable farm, and he was a very, very industrious man.  He actually had to clear the land.  It was pretty much a forest when he bought it.  And so, he was able to clear the land.  He built a very lovely home on the property and that's where my mother grew up.
Speaker 1: So, this is your mother's [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford] father, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And what was his full name?
Speaker 2: His name was Gardwin Grant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there is a graveyard on the property with some of this information on it, so we could confirm some of the dates.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I take it that Potecasi is an Indian name?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's the folklore at least, that it has Indian origin.  But again, I haven't been able to trace it to a specific Indian expression.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, what about your grandmother on that side?  Are there any stories about her?
Speaker 2: I don't know very much about my grandmother.  She did, I know that her maiden name was Bowser.  Her name was Dolly Bowser.  And her family was from a different place not too far away, and I don't know exactly where it was.  So I don't know a lot about her and what she did.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But as far as you know, she was a housewife?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, definitely.
Speaker 1: And helped raise the children and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 22691
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford] have any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she, she was the second daughter to be born to the family.  And it was a tradition in farm families that the one child would often be chosen to go to college and to go to school.  So, my mother's older sister was the person who was chosen to do that, and she was the one who worked in the home, for the most part.  And my mother being the second child and a daughter, had to really work with her father [Gardwin Grant] in the fields.  So, she was really tapped to do much of the very hard and brutal work of clearing land and planting crops.  So, her life was pretty rough, although she never complained about it.  But she was an extremely hard-working woman, very physical, and able to do extremely tough work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did she come from a large family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think there were ten of them in the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so she was, was she able to go to high school?
Speaker 2: She did get through.  I think she started high school, but she really didn't spend a lot of time in school.  But she was, she was very, very interested in school.  She always worked hard to make sure that she stayed current with what was going on.  She read, even though she herself was not educated beyond, I would say, junior high.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now let me, now did she share with you an aspiration that she had growing up that she hoped she could have fulfilled, or would she have liked to have gone to college?
Speaker 2: She would have loved to go to college, yes.  She always talked about, you know, she wished she had had that opportunity to do it, and that's why she was always interested in her kids going to college.  She really would have loved to have been a school teacher.  That was sort of her aspiration.  But she also liked farming, so she never regretted the fact that that was really her primary responsibility.
Story_ID: 22692
Speaker 1: Did she [Langford's mother, Lillie Virginia Grant Langford] continue to do like the heavy labor when you were growing up [in Potecasi, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely, absolutely.  I worked with my mother, you know, everyday in the field.  She was quite phenomenal in her ability to understand farming, you know.  My mother and my father [Maynard Langford] were farmers, but I think she was really sort of the brains behind the whole farm.  She had a better sense of what it takes, you know--the planting season, you know, the strategies for controlling weeds and harvesting, you know, the crops.  So she was, she was an intimate part of that.  And as a child I worked more with her than I did my father, you know.  He was sort of the manager of the farm and did a lot of traveling and buying of products and selling products, but it was my mother who did the day to day work in the fields.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's unusual, I guess even, especially for those days, I guess, that she would be the primary, you know, farmer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a little unusual, but I wouldn't say--I think there were quite a few women who really did hard labor.  I mean she had, if you would think of her day, it was getting up early to get everyone settled, you know. We had, on the farm we had farm animals that had to be fed and taken care of in the mornings, and all of the family had to be fed.  And then, not only that, but prepare food for lunch and for dinner, and then to go and spend a day in the field working.  So, it was an incredible task, and she managed it with incredible facility.
Speaker 1: So, okay, when it came down to, you know, you hear and see in movies and on TV and read and hear stories about scenarios where the wife is at home cooking the meals for all these guys that come in, you know, where they eat breakfast--they have a breakfast and start off after they eat all this food for energy and go out and do this heavy work, and they come back in at noon for the main meal and eat it and then they go back out.  Who was preparing these meals for her, you know?
Speaker 2: She was doing it all herself.  She got up and she cooked the meal, the breakfast and the dinner, which was lunch, you know, for the big meal in the middle of the day.  And then she would prepare the meal in the evening as well.
Speaker 1: And in the meantime, go out and--
Speaker 2: And then she would go out and spend the day in the field herself.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she sounds incredible.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, she was truly an amazing woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she just had energy.  I mean, she was always moving and she was the kind of person who just had to be doing something all the time.
Speaker 1: Was she a large person or a small person?
Speaker 2: She was a large woman.  She was, I would say 5'9, 5'10, [five feet, nine inches or five feet, ten inches] you know, in statue, but a very muscular woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were getting ready to say something.
Speaker 2: I was going to say that, you know, what was so incredible about her, is her--you would love to watch her work because she had such facility with the things that she did.  Whatever she was doing, if it was chopping cotton, you know, if you're out in the field, you know, she had the ability to use implements in ways that I could never, ever match, you know.  And also, just incredible quality to the way that she did things.  So, you could always admire and just enjoy--it was like watching a dancer or a performer because of her, the quality, the way she performed the things she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's interesting.  I've never heard anybody describe, you know, work like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 22693
Speaker 1: Now, we're going to go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is Maynard, M-A-Y-N-A-R-D, Langford.  But he was often called Mahlon because a lot of people had difficulty saying the word Maynard.  So, you also see Mayland as his name.
Speaker 1: So that would be spelled--
Speaker 2: M-A-H-L-O-N, or M-A-Y-L-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Potecasi and, again, his, he was born in 1904.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  And how far back can you trace his side of the family?
Speaker 2: So, his side of the family can be traced back to the early 1800s.  There is some information on the web that you can go back to.   Usually--the earliest member of his family was a man called James Langford who, we're not clear whether he, we know that he was a free black.  It's not clear whether he, again, bought his freedom or whether he was born free.  The story is that he did marry a slave woman and he was able to buy the freedom of his children.
Speaker 1: Did his wife remain in slavery?
Speaker 2: It was my understanding that she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any information about the situation, you know, her work situation?
Speaker 2: I don't know very much about her work situation.  I do know that he though--apparently I don't exactly know where he got his money, but he was able to buy property.  He was responsible for establishing the first church in the town of Potecasi [North Carolina], and for the first school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was the name of the church, do you know?
Speaker 2: It's the Second Baptist Potecasi Church.  The First Baptist was the white church, and so this was the Second Baptist.
Speaker 1: That's often the case that the Second Baptist church is the black church.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Detroit's [Michigan] famous Second Baptist Church downtown is the same way.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the same way.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he established a school as well?
Speaker 2: He established a school, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what, is there a name for the school?
Speaker 2: Well, it became the Potecasi Graded School, when I went there.  At that time it had been taken over as a public school.
Speaker 1: Potecasi Graded School?
Speaker 2: Right, and it was grades one through seven.
Story_ID: 22694
Speaker 1: Now, James Langford [Langford's paternal great-great-grandfather], now did he live through the Civil War period?
Speaker 2: He did, yes, right.
Speaker 1: So, he was born during the days of slavery and was free at some point, we know, and then he was able to purchase his children during slavery?
Speaker 2: That's right, during the period of slavery.
Speaker 1: And then, you know, he lived through the, you know, the Reconstruction Period?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, some of his children actually were, participated in the Civil War on the Union side.  And again, I don't know the details, but that is part of family lore.
Speaker 1: Okay, fought in the Union.  Okay.  Is there any information about like what actions they saw or were they in any specific, you know, fights?
Speaker 2: Right, I don't, again, I don't have that information.  But, I think there is some, again, some information on the web about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he would be, James Langford, would he be your great-great-grandfather, or--
Speaker 2: So, yes, he would be my great-great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now what about your--so your great-grandfather, was your great-grandfather one of the children that fought in the--
Speaker 2: I don't think it was my great-grandfather.  I think it was one of the brothers, one of the other brothers of my great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So his brothers actually fought in the Civil War?
Speaker 2: Not James' brother, but the great-grandfather, my great-grandfather's brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you know your grandfather?
Speaker 2: No, my grandfather died early.  As a matter of fact, he worked in the cotton gins and died of, what is the lung disease that--Brown Lung [Byssinosis; an occupational lung disease caused by exposure to cotton dust in inadequately ventilated working environments], I think it's called.
Speaker 1: So, Brown Lung is a disease that's caused by inhaling cotton fibers?
Speaker 2: Cotton fibers, right.  So, he died at unfortunately an early age.  And my two--, my father's [Maynard Langford] two youngest siblings then lived with him, because he died before they were mature.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22695
Speaker 1: Now what did your father [Maynard Langford] say about growing up?  Did he have any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: He didn't have a lot of stories about growing up.  He was, he actually had a somewhat easier life than my mother [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford].  He actually was able to go as far as high school.  So he went to the W.S. Creecy [ph.] High School.  He was able to because the high school was, oh, ten or twelve miles away from Potecasi [North Carolina].  It was in Rich Square, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: In, I'm sorry, what's the name?
Speaker 2: Rich Square.
Speaker 1: Rich Square, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  He had to actually find a place to board while he was in high school, so he stayed with, I think it was the minister who was the pastor of the church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your father, so your father's family, he came from a family that really represented, I guess the family that was a leading family in Potecasi, founding the church and--
Speaker 2: That's right.  It was the founding family, exactly, for the town.  So it was, it was, yeah, sort of the premier family.   It was, you know, definitely--what I recall my mother saying was that everybody wanted a Langford boy you know, to marry (laughter).  So, it was definitely sort of a family that sort of set the standard for the town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your mother's family seemed to have been accomplished on a level, too, with owning the property, and--
Speaker 2: That's true, right.  But they lived, they were really farmers.  The Langford side of the family, they were merchants, they were the petit bourgeois, the owners of restaurants and cleaners, and you know, the small general grocery store, you know.  So they were--and many more of them had actually gone on to college.  I had quite a few uncles who were carpenters.  They were, you know, they were tradespeople.  They were carpenters and plumbers and electricians and general merchants.
Story_ID: 22696
Speaker 1: Now, where is Potecasi in North Carolina in reference to say, Charleston [North Carolina] or Columbia [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: So, it's, it borders, it's in the County of Northampton.  And it borders the state of Virginia.  So, it's near the home where Nat Turner [Nathaniel "Nat" Turner, American slave who led a slave rebellion in Virginia on August 21, 1831] grew up.  So, Nat Turner was in Southampton, Virginia.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And Northampton is on the North Carolina side.  So, it's near the [Great] Dismal Swamp [marshy area in the Coastal Plain Region of southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina, between Norfolk, Virginia, and Elizabeth City, North Carolina] where Nat Turner spent his time hiding out from the authorities.
Speaker 1: Now this is, this is big history here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Nat Turner revolt, the Dismal Swamp, you know, is depicted in African American folklore, you know, again and again, as a place--there's a lot of stories about the Dismal Swamp and people running into the Dismal Swamp, and--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --"haints" in the Dismal Swamp, all kinds of things.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, this is a, the story of Nat Turner--like you know--resonates in history as a period of time when the South decided to crack down on black people.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Everybody around there, you know, and it reverberated all the way to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and the cities in the North, you know.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And white people were afraid.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Especially of free black people, of what they might do.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, so this is the neighboring county in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Now, is Potecasi a black town as such, or did it--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, no.  Potecasi was a segregated town.  The town was settled by whites.  There was a famous family called the Lassiter family, the white family that owned most of the property in the town.  So, there were about four or five major white families that owned most of the farms.  And so, my father [Maynard Langford] was a sharecropper.  He was renting land from, you know, the white landowners in the town.  And eventually, you know, when small farms were no longer buyable--and that's sort of my lucky attribute, is that my father actually gave up farming when I was about ten and he began working at the sawmill that was owned by the Lassiter family.  And I say it was lucky for me because it meant that I really had time to go to school, which was not so easy for my other siblings.
Story_ID: 22697
Speaker 1: So, Potecasi [North Carolina], it was, I would say that it was an equal number of blacks and whites, and it was completely segregated.  So, there was the black side of town and the white side of town.  And as a child growing up, you know, I had no interactions with white kids my age, or any white individuals other than the few white adults who would come to our house to see my father [Maynard Langford] or my mother [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford].  So, in town there was, you know, the general store that was owned by Mr. Lassiter, and it was the place that many of the farmers would come to buy their groceries, and they would run up a tab over the course of the year.  And then when they harvested the crops, they would then pay off their bills.  But, within the black community my father actually ran a small general store.  So, he had sort of a small shop that had those emergency items you needed when you didn't want to go to the store in town.  And it also served as a juke joint on the weekends, and it was where the people came to listen to music, to the jukebox and to relax.  And so, there was--my uncle on my mother's side had a dry cleaning business.  He also had a restaurant and, let's see, those are about the only establishments other than the church on the black side of town.  And in the town you had the post office, the general store, and a gas station.
Story_ID: 22698
Speaker 1: So, you said your father [Maynard Langford] was able to go to W. S. Creecy High School in Rich Square [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, so, did, were there members of his family that went to college?  I would think so.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  His eldest sister went to Elizabeth City State Teachers' College [Elizabeth City, North Carolina].  She was an elementary school teacher and she taught in Greenville, North Carolina.  And let's see, I think he had another brother who went to college, but I think she was the only one who actually completed her degree.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 22699
Speaker 1: Well, is there a story about how your parents [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford and Maynard Langford] met?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I'm trying to remember.
Speaker 1: Well, how they got together, really, because they probably knew each other.
Speaker 2: They knew each other, and I'm pretty sure they met in the church, you know.  That was most likely because my mother was a member of the church as well as my father.  And I don't believe they went to school together, so I think it was primarily through the church that they met.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's the Second Baptist Church [Potecasi, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Is there a story about how they fell in love or anything?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the specifics of that, except, you know, I mentioned that my mother was keen on dating my father, because as she said, everybody wanted to marry one of the Langford boys, and so she felt it was quite a coup.  And she was able to do that.  But I don't remember any of the specifics of their courtship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now they, did they, when did they get married?
Speaker 2: So, I think that my mother may have been seventeen [years old] when they got married, and--
Speaker 1: In about 1922?
Speaker 2: 1922, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: And they started a family right away.  I'm trying to remember the date my brother was born.  My oldest brother is eighteen years older than I am.  So, if I was born in '44 [1944], that means he was born in '26 [1926].
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 22700
Speaker 1: This era, the era when they [Langford's parents, Lillie Virginia Grant Langford and Maynard Langford] got married [early 1920s], there was a lot of trouble in the South, and the [Ku Klux] Klan and that sort of thing and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you hear any stories about that time period?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, this is very interesting.  My father was one of these members of the community who had excellent working relationships with whites in the town.  He was one of the, again, there were elders in the town who could manage conflicts between blacks and whites.  And my father did this all of this life.  Whenever there was a ruckus between the black and white community, he was able to step in and try to negotiate peace.  So, we really didn't have a lot of incidents of whites coming into the black community, to cause trouble.  And I don't know of any strong Klan presence in that part of the town, in that part of the state [Potecasi, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, we, you know, this is one of the other interesting things about the town of Potecasi.  It was completely segregated and so we didn't have any public facilities.  We had no police force, you know, we had no legal services, there were no civic activities, there was no organized government in the black section of town.  And so, when there was, you know, a security issue with someone, you know, if there was a fight or if there was any disturbance, then the white police had to be called into the black community.  And blacks were very reluctant to do that because, you know, they were so badly treated by the white police.  And so, often again, the elders in the town had to sort of serve the security function.  And again, my father was often the person who was called in to try and settle disputes within the black community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is, now--in rural North Carolina in those days, would you think that would be a typical situation?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure, yeah, yeah.  It was typical throughout the South.  Now it may have been a little bit different in the larger towns, where blacks may have had some--I doubt if there were blacks who were part of the police force or had any elected office in any of the towns of North Carolina, at least not in any of the places that I visited.
Speaker 1: So, your father and the black elders in town would handle situations in the black community as best as they could?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And if there was a conflict across racial lines, then your father would be--was it him and other people or just--
Speaker 2: It was him and other people, and you know, the church sort of served as that social and political organization with the town.  So, the minister of the church, the deacons of the church would often serve that role.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Can you remember any stories about your father having to handle this situation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there are quite a few stories.  I'm trying to think of those specific ones, but, I can recall once when my brother was, had gotten out of service.  He served in World War II and was stationed in Okinawa [Japan].  And when he got back he had a car, and he was driving above the speed limit and was stopped by the police.  And I recall that my father was called to the scene to really adjudicate the situation because, you know, they were about to take my brother to jail and to, you know, to lock him up.  And my father was able to convince the police officer to release him on, you know, good behavior.  So, there are quite a few stories like that, you know, where he was able to actually provide some help in getting people out of a very bad situation.

Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford and Maynard Langford] personalities, their hobbies, their habits, their gestures, their looks--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I definitely think I take after my mother [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford] (laughter).  She was the person who was much more organized and, you know, she stayed on task.  My dad [Maynard Langford] was someone who loved to dabble in lots and lots of different things, you know.  So, he was running the farm.  He loved to garden, he loved to, he raised animals, he bought and sold horses, he built things.  He was sort of a carpenter.  He was a self-trained carpenter, but he loved to build houses.  So he was into everything.  My mother sort of had to keep things on the straight and narrow.  So, I feel that I definitely have more of her characteristics than his.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 22702
Speaker 1: Now, can you name your brothers and sisters for us, and tell us where you fit in the order?
Speaker 2: Right.  So, I'm the youngest of nine.  My oldest is Dollie, D-O-L-L-I-E, and my--second is my brother Broadis, B-R-O-A-D-I-S.  And then the third child is Irene, and the fourth is Ida.  And the fifth is Bevonne, B-E-V-O-N-N-E.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind that name?
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: Bevonne?  It's like Yvonne, but--
Speaker 2: Right, right, (laughter).  I think my mother wanted to be inventive, and she came up with the Bevonne name, because no one had ever heard of it before.
Speaker 1: So, Bevonne instead of Yvonne?
Speaker 2: Instead of Yvonne, right.  And then the next one is Harvey, and then my youngest sister Josephine, and then me, George.
Story_ID: 22703
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory, the first thing that you can think of that you remember?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Well, I'm not so sure that it's my memory or it's the story that everybody tells in the family.  But the story is that, you know, I was, I would have been four [years old] maybe, I guess, or so.  And we had, we had a white horse that was sort of a pet for the family.  Sometimes it was used for plowing the fields, but most of the time it was sort of just the farm pet.
Speaker 1: Well, what do you mean by pet?  Now, you're on a farm and here's a horse, which is a pretty big animal.  He was, you know, just like a friendly horse?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a friendly horse that everyone loved to, they would occasionally ride the horse.  But the horse was just in the barnyard all the time, you know.  And so, everyone sort of liked to pet the horse.  But, for some reason the gate to the barnyard was left open, and the horse came out and went into my mother's [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford] garden and started eating the corn.  And when I saw this, I went to shoo the horse away.  And I used a short stick, and I tapped the horse on the back leg.  And the horse kicked me in the stomach and I was thrown into the air and knocked unconscious.  And so, my sister Ida found me, you know, she came out of the house and there was I.  And so, you know, they were all frightened.  "Oh my God what has happened to this boy?"  And so, they had to rush me to the doctor.  Well, it was just that I'd had the wind knocked out of me, and I was just fine.  But, you know, it was the story that stuck, you know, of the time when I was nearly trampled by the pet horse (laughter) in the family.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the horse's name?
Speaker 2: Bob, that was the horse's name, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: A very regular name for a horse.
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Story_ID: 22704
Speaker 1: Now, there's another story, too, that I've read about--and in all the articles we have about--there's a story about you opening the gate as a little kid and letting all the animals out [on Langford's family's farm in Potecasi, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Yeah, right, yeah.  Again, they tell me that that's something that I did.  I don't recall, yeah, of opening the gate.  But quite often the chickens would come out--the pigs and the horse--and you know, so, my siblings didn't like it because they would have to round them all up and get them back in the farm yard--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The story goes that your mother [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford] hears this commotion outside and all the animals are pouring out of this gate (laughter), and you're standing there.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how big a house did you all have out there?
Speaker 2: The house that I grew up in, was, let's see, a three bedroom house, so it was a very small compact bungalow.  And it was sort of standard for the neighborhood but, you know, it had a living room and dining room, kitchen and then three bedrooms.  But it was, the house that I grew up in was the first house that my father [Maynard Langford] owned.  The houses before that, he had rented as part of the farm where he was working.  But then when I was a child they actually put in a new road through the town, and this is when the farmers were moving off of the farm into the little village.  And so, there are these plots of land that had been sub-divided and my father purchased one and built a home there.  So, it was my younger sister and me that were the ones who were born and raised in that house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you say you were about ten [years old], I guess, when you left the farm?
Speaker 2: When my father stopped farming, I was about ten.  But he was still farming when we moved to this house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, this is a big development because, you know, as blacks began to acquire small amounts of money, you know they could actually afford to buy a home and live in the village as opposed to on the land.  So, you would then leave the tractors or drive the tractors there, you know, where the farm was, but you actually lived in the town itself.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 22705
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  The sights, it was a very rural area so the sights were farms.  So, and farms are beautiful: cotton farms and cornfields and peanut fields.  These are very, very beautiful things to see, especially in the early spring when they're first, when the plants are first coming up, and then over the course of the summer when they're growing, and then in the fall when they're ready to be harvested.  So, the sights were, you know, farmlands, wooded areas, forests--and there were lots of trails in the woods where as kids we could go to play.  So, I loved the wildflowers that you'd find as you walk through the forest.  And in the fall when the pine needles would fall on the ground, there's nothing more beautiful than the freshly covered ground with pine needles.  And then there are fruit trees, which is the other thing.  There were lots of fruit trees that were sort of planted around the neighborhood--pear trees and peach trees, plum trees.  In terms of sounds, I think it's mostly the natural sounds that I recall.  The bird sounds, the sounds of the animals on the farm, but also the sounds of people, the joyous sounds when people got together.  And of course, the sounds that you heard--the music and the voices in the church.  So, you ask about sights, sounds, and what was the other one?
Speaker 1: Smells.
Speaker 2: Smells, smells.  Yeah, the smells of the flowers blooming in the spring.  My aunt had one of those bushes that had an incredible aroma.  I can't even remember the name of the bush.  But all of the kids would love to go and pick one of the blossoms and squeeze it so that you could have this lovely smell.  Honeysuckle smells, roses, and of course, all of the smells that you would have in the garden.  But there was also the smell of the barnyard which wasn't a very pleasant smell (laughter).  So, we had to clean out the stables for the horses and the cows and the pigs, and those are smells that you don't forget.
Story_ID: 22706
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're the youngest coming along?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, you had a lot of supervision, I would think.
Speaker 2: Oh God, yes (laughter).  I had lots of mothers.  So, yeah lots of supervision.  But there was a gap of about four and a half years between me and my next sibling, my sister [Josephine].  So, the older sisters [Dollie, Ida and Bevonne] had actually all pretty much grown up and were on their own.  But nevertheless, you know, there was a lot of, there was a lot of supervision, if you would use a kind word (laughter).  Mothering is the word that I tend to think of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And here you are, you're the baby boy of the family--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you come along and I would just think that the, I guess the process of raising children would have been, you know, pretty well perfected by the time you came along--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --with your mother [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford] being as methodical as she was and everything, so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, do you think you benefitted from, like you know, like an accumulation of knowledge of how to--
Speaker 2: Oh, I definitely benefitted.  It was, so I was, my parents [Lillie and Maynard Langford] were more like grandparents by the time I was born, you know.  They were less strict.  They, you know, they were also more forgiving, you know.  So, my siblings all say I got away with things that they never could have (laughter).  So, but yeah, they had, you know, they were also very stable at that point in their lives.  You know, they had purchased a home, my father was doing reasonably well.  This was a time of great expansion in the U.S., you know.  Small farms were going by the wayside but there was a lot of economic development right after World War II.  And so whereas my older siblings were born during the [Great] Depression, you know, I was born during the boom time in the U.S., and so I benefitted from that.  I benefitted from the fact that my father stopped farming so that I could actually go to school.  I didn't have to miss school in order to, you know, to harvest the crops.  So, yeah, it was a very--I had a very, very different experience from my other siblings.
Story_ID: 22707
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did you like to do growing up?
Speaker 2: I was always sort of a nerdy kid.  You know, I really, really did like to read and to sort of, you know, go to the library when I could, or, watch the news when I had to do that.  I also liked to do things outside as well.  I, you know, played hopscotch and stickball and riding the bike, those kinds of things.  But definitely I felt that I was more on the side of the kid who liked to read books and spend time indoors, which didn't make me very popular with my father [Maynard Langford] (laughter).  He felt I should be outside doing all those boy-like things that he was expecting.  So, my mother [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford] had to come to my rescue quite a few times, and said it was fine, I needed to do my homework, I needed to do, you know the reading and stuff that kept me inside.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's interesting.  So, he thought you ought to be outside more?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes.  He, my father was definitely the macho kind of guy, you know.  He really wanted to always prove how strong he was, and doing the heavy lifting, as opposed to being inside reading and writing or doing other kinds of intellectual things.
Story_ID: 22708
Speaker 1: Now, was your father [Maynard Langford] tall, too, like your mother [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford]?
Speaker 2: He was about the same height, or maybe even a little bit shorter than my mother, but very, very strong.  And I always looked forward to the day when I could arm wrestle him and beat him, and I never did (laughter).  He died at the age of 101, and I think he was still stronger than I was.
Speaker 1: So, he lived to 101?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's just, that's 2005.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's when he died, 2005.
Speaker 1: Did he have anything that he attributed to his, you know, long life?  Anything in particular?
Speaker 2: No.  He said, you know, he would often tell the story that if he knew he was going to live so long he would have taken better care of himself (laughter).  So, but he was part of a genetic study, because they were looking at long-lived--the genetic factors for individuals who lived long.  And he had several siblings and relatives who lived long.  His eldest sister was also in her 100s when she died.  So--
Speaker 1: Who studied your father?
Speaker 2: It was a group out of Mass General [Massachusetts General Hospital] in Boston [Massachusetts].  I don't know if they actually revealed the names of the individuals that they had in the study, but he was one of the individuals that they collected blood and other tissue from for that study.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22709
Speaker 1: Now when you were coming along, I know there was radio in the home?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But when did--now, you were born in '44 [1944], so television must have come along when you were about six or seven [years old]?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I think I was in junior high school before I remember, and I may have even been in high school before we actually got a TV.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, your information and the things that you would read were coming from the library, I guess, and from--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford and Maynard Langford] subscribe to the magazines like 'Life' and 'Look' and those kinds of things?
Speaker 2: Right.  They would buy 'Life' and 'Look' and 'Ebony'.  And then there was, there was a black paper.  Was it the 'Atlantic Journal' [newspaper], Atlanta Journal?
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's an Atlanta Journal, yeah. There's also, 'Pittsburgh Courier' was popular.  'Norfolk Journal and Guide', you know, in terms of distribution--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.  But I know, because I had a--
Speaker 1: Afro-American of course out of--
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, so we had--there was one of those papers that we got weekly, because I, it was part of the school, actually.  My teacher bought the papers and had us distribute them in the community as part of a paper route.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was one of the black papers.  And you're thinking it was one from Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: That's what I thought it was.  The Atlanta Journal is what I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22710
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?  What was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: So, I started school at the Potecasi Graded School [Potecasi, North Carolina].  So I went through grades one through seven there.  But at the time that I finished the school, it was consolidated, it was closed, and all of us were transferred to the Woodland School, Woodland Elementary School.  And normally we would have gone directly to the W.S. Creecy High School from Potecasi.  But I did one year at Woodland and then I did nine through twelve [grade] at Rich Square [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Now, the Woodland School was in a nearby town?
Speaker 2: It's the next town over.  It would be three miles away from us.  So, when they consolidated the small rural schools, our school was closed in Potecasi and all of the kids were transferred to Woodland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then the Creecy High School was where--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The W.S. Creecy High School was where I went to high school.
Speaker 1: Who is W.S. Creecy?  Was he a black man?
Speaker 2: He was a black man.  He was a black man who started that school.  W.S. Creecy, Sr. is who the school was named after and I'm pretty sure it would have started in the early 1900s.  When I got there, W.S. Creecy, Jr. was principal.  He'd taken it over from his father.
Speaker 1: Was Creecy, Sr. the first principal of the school?
Speaker 2: He was the first principal, yes.
Speaker 1: Was it a school that was supported by the State of North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was taken over as a state-supported school.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  And I'll ask some more questions, but I want to go back to grade school.  Did you have any science instruction in grade school?
Speaker 2: I can't recall a lot of science instruction in grade school.  I would say, though, that you know, the teachers were pretty good that I had in grade school.  And, I'm pretty sure that they introduced some of the general concepts, but you know, we really sort of focused on the basics, on reading, writing and arithmetic.  And I just can't recall any specific science training that I had in grade school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it was mostly basics.  Who were, was there any particular teacher in grade school that you really remember as a--
Speaker 2: Well, I remember all of them.  My first teacher, Mrs. Boone, who really was an excellent first grade teacher, I mean, for going through the alphabets and the numbers and learning to read.  I can recall having a lot of support in that, in those early grades.  And then I had in the middle grades, there was Mrs. Joyner who was a neighbor.  And it's one of the nice things about the school.  She was the only teacher who actually lived in the community.  But everyday she would come to my mother's [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford] house to report on how I was doing (laughter).  So, there was lots of supervision, and there was not very much that I could get away with, you know, in the school.  But, you know it was, it was excellent having, you know, the teacher as part of the community.  Not only was she a friend of my mother but she was also a participant in the church, and so we got to see her in many different venues.  And then in the fourth, sixth, and--no, the fifth, sixth and seventh grades--I had a Mrs. Cherry.  And she was from a neighboring town, from (unclear) Mohawkski (ph.).  And again, I was very glad I had her because she was a younger woman who had recently graduated from college and she brought in a lot of new information and techniques.  So, I felt really very well prepared when I left elementary school to go on to high school.
Story_ID: 22711
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, we're talking about school.  Now, did you have a favorite subject in grade school?
Speaker 2: Let's see, in grade school [Potecasi Graded School, Potecasi, North Carolina], yes.  I always liked, the story time.  We often had to make up stories, and so I always liked the time when we could either tell a story that we'd read or one that we would make up.  And often we would have to make diagrams, I mean, pictures to accompany the story.  And that was the part that I always enjoyed.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  That does sound like it would be fun to do in school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were in eighth grade you all went to Woodland [Elementary] School?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was that very much different than, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was different because I had a totally new group of classmates, and also I didn't know the teachers and the setting.  I knew a lot about the high school [W.S. Creecy High School] because my older siblings had gone there, and I was familiar with that.  But Woodland was totally new and different.  So, it's a year that doesn't stand out in my memory.  It wasn't particularly pleasant or, you know, it was sort of--I wanted to go to high school, you know.  It was a place I really wanted to go, so, I was not so happy to have to go to Woodland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how are your grades as a student in grade school?
Speaker 2: My grades were average.  You know, I really didn't stand out.  This is one of the interesting things about growing up in a small town.  There were favorites (laughter) and I had had, all of my siblings had gone through the school.  So, I was always compared to them, and I never could be quite as good.  So, I did not stand out as a student in elementary school, and it sort of carried over to high school as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did you, let's see, you described yourself earlier as having a keen interest in certain subjects, you know, and wanting to read and study, you know, or to learn about things.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, what was it that you weren't really competitive, was it that kind of thing in school?  I mean, for grades and that sort of thing, or what?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I, yes, I didn't feel, I guess I wasn't as competitive.  But I also felt that because I wasn't selected by the teacher, you know, to respond or to do a project, that I didn't have the same kind of encouragement that some of the other classmates had.  And I can't emphasize this enough.  It was--I was so very relieved when I was able to leave the small town.  I mean, it was a very nurturing place, very sheltered existence, but, you know, there was a hierarchy and, you know, you sort had to fit into it.  And for all of the reasons that you know about in the black community, I wasn't at the very top.  There was a lot of color discrimination within the community.  You know girls got preferential treatment over boys in the school setting.  And, you know, if you were an active child, you know, you got into trouble a lot.  And so, so all of those things sort of factored into not being, you know, having the best grades or the best impression from the teachers.
Speaker 1: Now, you seem to be a very, kind of a mild-mannered, quiet person as we're doing this interview.  Were you an active kid or were you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was very active.  Yeah, I was, you know, I could never sit in my seat, you know.  It was just (laughter) very difficult to do the quiet things that teachers always wanted us to do.  So, I was always ready for recess.  And so, yeah, sitting for long periods doing, you know, work that requires that you actually sit down, I wasn't really the best.  And I, you know, I'm not, I wasn't the best also at getting my homework done in a timely way, you know.  So, I was a little bit of an unruly child.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this seems almost in contrast to what you said a little while ago about staying in the house a lot and your father [Maynard Langford] being upset that you're in the house.
Speaker 2: That's true.  But I did like those kinds of things.  But, again, in a classroom setting I tended to be the kid who was acting out, you know.  Someone was teasing me or I was teasing someone else, or whatever.  So, I definitely, I wasn't the teacher's pet.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Once they, I guess, in a small school--and you only have so many students, once you get that reputation, then it's hard to break out or whatever, of being typecast, you know--
Speaker 2: Exactly, that's right.
Speaker 1: --who's the guy that's going to act up?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Story_ID: 22712
Speaker 1: Now, Potecasi [Graded] School [Potecasi, North Carolina] had about, how many students would you think when you were there?
Speaker 2: I would say--we started out in first grade with about twenty-five or thirty [students].  By the time we graduated I think it would have been twelve or fifteen.  So, there was a huge dropout over the course of the elementary school.
Speaker 1: Now, this is something we don't, that's hard to imagine nowadays.  You know, the high school dropouts--but the elementary school dropouts is something you really don't hear that much about.  But in those days, people would drop out of elementary school.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  It was frightening to see how those numbers dwindled over time, you know, especially for the boys.  You know, as they grew up, they would be required to work, you know, and so they really could not continue school.  And they would get behind in their classes, so they would be retained in the lower grades and not advance.  And so they would eventually get discouraged and they simply dropped out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's hard to make up for lost time, and then they were embarrassed, I guess.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  So, many of them never really learned to read and write well, you know.  So, there were kids who eventually dropped out, and they were essentially illiterate.
Story_ID: 22713
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't ask you a lot about church.  But what role did church play in your upbringing?
Speaker 2: Well, I felt as though I lived in the church, you know.  It was the only social, political, religious organization that there was.  So, it was a lot of time that I spent at church.  So, there was Sunday School and Sunday service, but there was always something going on in the evenings at church, and then Bible School.  So, the church was sort of the center of the town.  It was, also, I was very interested in music as I grew up, and so the church was a place where we could go to sing in the choir, to hear performances.  So it was a, it played a really big role in the community in general and in my life in particular.
Speaker 1: Now, did you sing or anything, or--
Speaker 2: Yes, I sang in the choir.  I also took piano lessons, and so I was the accompanist for the youth choir in church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any other musicians in your family?
Speaker 2: No.  I had a sister who played music, who loved music and played a little bit.  But she never took piano lessons.  But there weren't a lot of musicians in my family.
Speaker 1: Now, you came along during the--you were growing up during the Civil Rights Movement days.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did, I know it was on the national news, and did they discuss it from the pulpit at church at all?
Speaker 2: They did, they did.  We had, the pastor of our church, the Reverend Dr. Paul Bishop, a very learned man who was part of the Baptist Convention--
Speaker 1: The National Baptist Convention?
Speaker 2: The National Baptist Convention.  And the National Baptist Convention supported Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina].  And so, every Sunday he would raise funds in the church to support the operating costs at Shaw University.  So, yes, he would often talk about what was happening nationally, you know, in the Civil Rights movement and, you know, we were all encouraged, you know, to be full participants in that process.
Speaker 1: Now, was he part of the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], Dr. [Martin Luther] King's organization?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I never had that impression.  I think he was primarily through the National Baptist Convention organization that he worked.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But he actually raised money for Shaw.  Do you remember hearing about the Montgomery [Alabama] bus boycott in--?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't remember hearing about that you know, when I was, you know, in elementary school.
Speaker 1: You would have been about eight [years old], I think.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in 1956.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  So I don't, I don't recall any specifics about that.  Uh--
Speaker 1: Do you remember the first time, the first national civil rights case you heard about?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm trying to remember.  It was the Birmingham [Alabama] bombing.  I think that was the one that I most vividly remember.  And then it was the other case of this little boy from Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Emmett Till [African American boy from Chicago, who was murdered in Mississippi at the age of fourteen].
Speaker 2: Emmett Till, yep, yep.  Those were the two cases that resonate the most in my memory from that period.
Speaker 1: Do you remember seeing the Jet Magazine with the picture?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yep.  That was a very, very distressing image that, yeah, I can recall from when that was first published.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22714
Speaker 1: You said race relations in Potecasi [North Carolina] were fairly manageable, I guess.  But was there overt segregation downtown with the signs and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: There were definitely overt segregation, and we knew what the rules were.  I mean, I can recall a time when I was younger, before I understood how this worked.  I was working with my mother [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford].  We, in order to earn extra money we would, sometimes my mother would take us to work in the fields of one of the white farmers.  We could chop or pull weeds in the summertime.  And I recall, this is a very hot day in July, and I was with my mother out in the field weeding cotton or peanuts or something.  And I looked to the house, to the farmer's house, where there was a kid, his kid, the same age as I was.  He was riding his bike in the shade.  So I asked Mom, "Why isn't he out here pulling weeds like I am?" (laughter)  And she said, you know, "Do you not know the color of your skin?"  You know, it was sort of the first time that I realized the difference in, you know, the life of a white kid versus a black kid, since I never saw them in my community.  But that was--so then as I grew up, you knew that there were certain things you could not do when you would go into the general store in town.  You know, you couldn't open the icebox where the drinks were and take one out yourself.   You had to ask for it.  Yeah, and I recall once I had my cousin from New York come to visit.  He was my age.  And he went in the store and he just naturally opened the box and took out a soda, and he was yelled at by the owner of the store.  And my father [Maynard Langford], of course, had to step in to settle the situation because he didn't, you know, he had no idea that was not permitted.  So there again, you knew what the rules were.  I would go into town on occasion to purchase things for my mom or dad, but most of the time I lived in the black community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were these, were the rules of what you're supposed to do taught as they came up, or were they, did your parents sit you down and tell you at a certain point, "Now when you go into town you can't do this and that?"
Speaker 2: No, it was just, you were encouraged to observe the way it was being done.  And it was, no one ever discussed what they were, but there was a clear understanding.  And even as a child, you picked up on it very quickly, that these were the things that you could or could not do.  On occasion I still would, you know, violate the rules.  For example, my mother had me deliver a paper, a contract or something, to one of the white families in town.  And I knocked on the front door, and the guy came out to take the envelope.  And I was making the motion of walking into the house.  And he stopped me and stepped out onto the porch.  You know, as a black person, you don't enter the front door of a white person's house, you know.  So, sometimes I wouldn't always remember, you know, what those rules were, and would be in an awkward situation like that.
Speaker 1: Would, did they have the signs posted downtown in the public buildings?
Speaker 2: There were no signs that I saw.  I don't know if any of the buildings had, were big enough, you know, to actually have signs up that was--separate, you know.  We didn't have any water fountains for example, or, you know--it was the post office and the little grocery store and the gas station.  So that was pretty much it.
Speaker 1: What about restrooms?
Speaker 2: And restrooms, there were no public restrooms in the town, you know.  So, again, only when we went to the theatre you know, the movie theater in town, we had to go up the stairs, we could not sit on the main level.  It was only the balcony, and there you did see signs for whites and for colored.
Speaker 1: Now was the--I've noticed in the South during those days when I was growing up, the white side of town was often paved and the black side of town was not.
Speaker 2: And that was true of the street that we lived on.  It was a dirt road for a very long time.  It wasn't paved until I think I was in high school.  And the road in town was in fact paved.  So that was very, very standard, you know, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22715
Speaker 1: Now, when you go on to high school, you're going to W.S. Creecy High School [Rich Square, North Carolina], and it's, how far away is it from Potecasi [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: It's twelve miles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was a bus ride.  The bus would come and pick up us in the mornings and go to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so were things better there in terms of academics than they were--
Speaker 2: They were a little better but still again, there was a very close relationship between the teachers at the high school and the town of Potecasi.  Because all of my siblings had gone through the high school, most of the teachers knew my parents [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford and Maynard Langford], and vice versa.  And again, I would always be compared to, you know, my sister [Josephine Langford] who had gone on before me who was a very popular girl in school, and all of the teachers liked her.  So, I never did quite measure up, but I think my performance overall was much better, and I actually did find some teachers who served as great mentors and took a very, very strong interest in me.  And that was sort of where I began to develop my interest in science.  I had this great chemistry teacher, Dr., I mean Mrs. Clark, and she was the one who first really saw that I had ability in the sciences, and she strongly encouraged me to do well in the sciences.  And she actually encouraged me to do one of the projects for the science fair, and that was my first experience with actually doing experiments and trying to understand a scientific process.  And my project was to learn how to develop and print film.  And so, I had to actually set up a darkroom, mix all of the chemicals and go through the entire process of developing and printing film.  And I exhibited that at a science fair when I was in the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did Creecy High School have much in the way of scientific equipment?
Speaker 2: It didn't have a lot, but it had some.  You know, the high school was, I thought, particularly good.  You know, the teachers there were extraordinary, because these are mostly black women who were very bright individuals but didn't have any other options in terms of career.  And so they gravitated toward teaching as the profession that they could actually make a career of.  And so I felt that all of the teachers that I had were extraordinarily good, and if they had any other opportunities, they probably would not have been in the high school.  And the same is true of Mr. Creecy, the principal.  He was a very well educated man who under normal circumstances would have been, you know, a national leader.  But because of the limited opportunities, you know, he was quite happy to be a principal of a small local high school.  So, we had labs, we had, you know, a small chemistry lab, a small set of equipment for physics.  Biology was much less well equipped at the time, but we had some.
Speaker 1: Now, you were chosen for a math award, I think, by Miss Clark.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Right.  I think it was Mrs. Bishop, actually who chose me for the math award.  I had an excellent geometry teacher, Mrs. Bishop, and she was the one who I think nominated me for that award.  And she, again, was one of those very, very inspiring and encouraging teachers to help me to understand that I had ability in the sciences and in math and that I really should pursue that as a career.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this had, you didn't know this in grade school, I guess.  I mean, nobody encouraged you in terms of this in grade school, I guess?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I definitely was not thinking this way in grade school.  I didn't have any of the teachers that took a particular interest in me, as I found when I did get to high school.
Story_ID: 22716
Speaker 1: Now, growing up on a farm [in Potecasi, North Carolina], and in the midst of nature as you described so eloquently in the beginning of the interview--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean, did you, were you drawn to biology more than any other science?
Speaker 2: I was.  You know, I liked the idea, you know, of understanding organisms, biological systems, both plants and animals.  I mean, I had a lot of experience with that, you know, from the point of planting seeds to seeing the plant grow up and mature, and the same with animals.  You know, we raised pigs on the farm.  We raised cows.  So, you know, it was something that I was very familiar with, and that did pique my interest in the biological sciences.  But when I was in high school [at W.S. Creecy High School, Rich Square, North Carolina], I was actually pushed more towards the physical sciences, you know, because that's where I had the strongest teacher.  My biology teacher was not strong in high school.  So, when I went to college, I thought I was going to major in one of the physical sciences, and not in biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you think you'd be a physics--
Speaker 2: In physics or chemistry, yeah, right.  And it turns out when I got to college, that the strongest department was biology, and so that's why I really gravitate toward biology rather than physics or chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22717
Speaker 1: Now, during your high school days [at W.S. Creecy High School, Rich Square, North Carolina] were you involved in other high school activities like sports, or members of various clubs?  Did you run for president of school council, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I played football for a very short period of time and, you know, I really didn't have any great skill in athletics.  But I really, again, I liked music, so I began taking piano lessons in high school.  And I was part of the Glee Club, I was part of the Drama Club, and, I was also part of the Science Club.  Those were the primary activities that I did in high school.
Speaker 1: So, would your grades be considered outstanding in high school?
Speaker 2: They were definitely not outstanding.  Again, I was right in the middle of the pack.  There were many kids who were considered the top group of students in the class.  Again, this is historic.  It's, you know, also the fact that, I didn't have, you know--whereas my parents [Lillie Virginia Grant Langford and Maynard Langford] were very supportive, they were not the kind of parents who were in the schools and, you know, trying to both advocate and make sure that I had whatever additional resources were available to get through to do the, to get to the top of the class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22718
Speaker 1: So, when you were a senior high school [at W.S. Creecy High School, Rich Square, North Carolina], then, what were your prospects in terms of college?  And how did you, were your teachers suggesting that you go to school?
Speaker 2: My teachers were.  They were all encouraging me to apply, because the high school really wanted to increase the number of kids who went on to college.  So, they were looking for kids who would--both had the interest and they felt had the ability to be successful.  So, I got very good guidance from my homeroom teacher, who was also the guidance counselor for the school and she very strongly encouraged me to apply to go to college.
Speaker 1: Now, were you pushed towards Fayetteville [State University, Fayetteville, North Carolina], or--
Speaker 2: No, the reason I chose Fayetteville--well, I only applied to one college, because my sister, two of my sisters had gone there, you know.  And so, for me it was an obvious choice.  It was a school that I was familiar with.  Fayetteville State was one of the state teachers' colleges in the state.  And the other option would have been Elizabeth City [State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina].  And I wanted to go to a school where none of my other classmates were going.  And it was farther away from home, it was in the city.  So Fayetteville fit the bill.  You know, it was a perfect school for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that's a state school operated by the state of North Carolina?
Speaker 2: That's right.  It's part of the state's teachers' college system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, everyone going to Fayetteville is on the track to become a teacher?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: so, everybody was an education major, or--
Speaker 2: Well, you majored in your discipline, and then you got your certification to be a teacher.  So, you were not an education major.  So, I was a biology major, or a physics--, whatever.  And then you had to take the educational courses to qualify for your teacher's certification.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now did you, was there anything special leading up, you know, I mean, did you have any special recognition in graduation from Creecy, from W.S. Creecy [High School]?
Speaker 2: Other than math and science, those are the major areas that I had recognition in.  You know, I was sort of on the 'B' honor roll, you know, rather than the 'A' honor roll when I was graduating.  But, I should mention the principal, Mr. Creecy, who also taught classes and was a very inspirational leader.  I took a senior class with him.  He was strongly encouraging me to go on to college.  And I'd sort of always envisioned that one day I would come back and take his job (laughter).  So, that was sort of my goal in life at that point when I was leaving high school, you know, that I would go on to become a teacher and eventually become a principal of the high school.
Story_ID: 22719
Speaker 1: Alright.  Tell us about Fayetteville State College [University, Fayetteville, North Carolina].  Who was there, and what was it like?
Speaker 2: Well, for me it was the greatest thing that ever could happen--was leaving the small village of Potecasi [North Carolina] (laughter).  And, actually being in a residence hall, I had my own room.  Actually, I did have roommates, but it was definitely a wonderful experience to be independent and on my own.  So when I got there, you know, I was really, really very excited about it.  And the biggest surprise to me was in my first semester I had mostly As in all of my courses, which I had never had before.  So, so it gave me a great deal of confidence in starting out my career in college and, I can say on the whole, the entire experience was really terrific.  But I was a kid, a country kid coming from, you know, a small rural town in North Carolina to a college where there were kids coming from all over the country, you know.  So, my roommate was from Orange, New Jersey and another one was from Brooklyn, New York.  And so I really felt unsophisticated, you know, as a kid in school.  And so, my biggest challenge was trying to develop some sense of being more than just a country bumpkin, you know, at the school.  But, I had, I had good friends.  The teachers were all very warm and welcoming, so it started out to be a very good experience.
Speaker 1: So, this was 1962?
Speaker 2: 1962, right.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And then, of course, in the fall of '63 [1963], it was when President [John F.] Kennedy was assassinated and, you know, that was, that was a moment that you all remember, you know, as college kids with all of us figuring out, you know, what was happening.  It was a very traumatic experience.
Story_ID: 22720
Speaker 1: Now, that was a traumatic year [1963].  And that summer was the summer of the March on Washington.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And then Birmingham [Alabama], the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church was in September, I think it was.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then President [John F.] Kennedy was killed in November.
Speaker 2: In November, right.
Speaker 1: That was a traumatic year for--
Speaker 2: That's right, a very traumatic time.  Jesse Jackson [civil rights activist and Baptist minister] was enrolled at [North Carolina] A&T [Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] at the time, and he was engaged in the sit-ins in Greensboro.  So it was a very, very active time.  So, I got very much involved with the Civil Rights Movement, you know.   At Fayetteville we had begun sit-ins in the town, because at the time there was still colored and white signs at the bus station when we would arrive.   There was, you had to use the fountain for colored.  The movie theaters were segregated, the lunch counters, and many of the merchants didn't allow blacks to patronize the stores.  So I, I became a leader, I really did.  In high school [W.S. Creecy High School, Rich Square, North Carolina] I wasn't very much in a leadership role, but I did become very much in the leadership position at Fayetteville.
Story_ID: 22721
Speaker 1: I joined a fraternity.  I became the (unclear) of the fraternity.  I became--
Speaker 2: Which one?
Speaker 1: Omega Psi Phi.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, I was elected the president of the student government in my senior year.  And during that time, the student government decided to really press hard for integration in downtown Fayetteville.  And what we decided to do was to write a letter to General [William] Westmoreland, who was the commander in charge of the troops in Vietnam, and ask him to help us in this endeavor by not allowing the soldiers to patronize the stores in Fayetteville.  And he in fact did issue an ordinance to the town, that if blacks could not patronize the restaurants and the theaters and the stores, that the soldiers from Fort Bragg [United States Army installation, North Carolina] would not purchase there.  And so, Fayetteville became integrated very, very quickly because of that intervention on the part of General Westmoreland.
Speaker 2: I'd never heard that story before.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, that's really--so, did you come up with this strategy yourself?
Speaker 1: It was the strategy that--I was the president, but it was the council that really came up with the strategy, because we had been sitting in, you know, for, at that point two years, and had seen very little change in the attitude of the merchants downtown.
Speaker 2: So, I imagine--and correct me if I'm wrong, that Fort Bragg was like a huge chunk of the economy in Fayetteville?
Speaker 1: Absolutely, they absolutely depended on it, you know.  If the soldiers weren't coming down to shop in those stores, you know, they would have been in real trouble.  So, yeah, that was a big part of it.
Speaker 2: It's like Fort Jackson [United States Army installation] is in Columbia [South Carolina], and these forts in the South--
Speaker 1: Uh huh, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 2: --carry a lot of weight.  So, now this is something, though--and it's not--here your student council thinks of it--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but no one in the [John F.] Kennedy administration thought of it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Exactly, yep, yep, right.  Well, we were on the ground so to speak, so, you know, so we could see it immediately.  And I was really pleased that we could come up with--we had no idea, you know, that the general would be supportive of this.  So, it was quite extraordinary when that decision was made.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's interesting.  You pick a figure like General William Westmoreland who was, you know, like I say, the most, he was the, you know, most important figure I guess in the Vietnam War--
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --to, you know, write a letter to about that.  It just makes you think.  You think about all the years when black leaders sat down with the President of the United States and congressional leaders and urged them to do something about lynching and about civil rights, you know, and here you come with this army boycott of the merchants, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, it hit where it really, really counts with the merchants downtown.
Speaker 2: So, this is in, this is in 1963 or '64 [1964]?
Speaker 1: This would be in '65 [1965], '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right, because I graduated in '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.
Story_ID: 22722
Speaker 1: Now, were there any, so was there formal SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference; African-American civil rights organization; Dr. Marin Luther King was its first president] activity on your campus?
Speaker 2: There was--we were more closely aligned with SNCC than with SCLC, and so there was a formal organization there.  And we were all, you know, listening to Stokely Carmichael [Trinidadian-American civil rights activist] and the folks from the Student, what was it--Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee?
Speaker 1: Yeah, so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, that's interesting, because the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee--and they were formed in, were they formed in North Carolina in a meeting? Where was it?  Was it Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina] or someplace?
Speaker 2: Is that right?  Okay.
Speaker 1: I think so, in a meeting called by Ella Baker and Bob Moses [civil rights activists].
Speaker 2: Ah, okay.
Speaker 1: They had students attend a conference, and out of that came SNCC.  I think it was in North Carolina A&T [Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: That could be, that could be, yeah.
Speaker 1: North Carolina--yeah--no--was it North Carolina? It was Shaw, one of the two. Yeah, one of the two. [Shaw University]
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But at any rate I should know.  Alright, so that's--now did you get in, was there any pressure from the school administration to get you to back off?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  They really were very concerned about, you know, ruffling the feathers of the local politicians who support the institution and some of the other donors in town who were supporting the institution.  So, there was a lot of pressure from the administration, but on the whole they allowed us to march into town.  So, as long as we informed them, as long as we got the permits, you know, the university allowed us to do it.  And we had a regular assembly, student assembly, and often the administrators would attend the assembly.  But we got them to agree not to attend on a couple of occasions so that we could discuss the strategies that we were planning to use, you know, when we did the marches in town.  So I'm, you know, they were, they were gently supporting although, you know, they were very concerned about both the liabilities of kids getting hurt in town as well as alienating potential supporters of the institution.
Speaker 1: Right, it being a state school, and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --an institution supported by the state, but also it was an institution where the state supported segregation.
Speaker 2: That's right, exactly, yeah.
Speaker 1: So then, did, was there like a domino effect in the state when a place like Fayetteville, you know, desegregates?
Speaker 2: I think it was really a town by town, you know, kind of change. Fayetteville was ahead of some of the other towns.  Greensboro, you know, was very famous for the sit-ins that went on there.  And it was a longer fight and a much more public fight for that integration to take place.  I think that's where Jesse Jackson did most of his early work, was the sit-ins and the lunch counters in Greensboro.  I think Charlotte was equally slow in changing.  So it really was sort of the influence of the military that made Fayetteville happen so much quicker than the neighboring towns.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22723
Speaker 1: So, by the time you were a senior at Fayetteville State [University, Fayetteville, North Carolina], you were focusing on biology?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Who, was there a particular professor there that was like a mentor in biology?
Speaker 2: There was, there was.  As I said, you know, the biology faculty was the strongest faculty in the sciences there.  And I had an excellent professor, Dr. Joseph Knuckles, K-N-U-C-K-L-E-S, who was, you know, he was a Ph.D. from the University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut], a highly respected scientist himself.  But again, because of discrimination he couldn't get a job at a research university.  And so he tried as best he could to set up a research program at Fayetteville.  Now, he didn't have a laboratory himself.  He had to use the teaching labs to do his research, but nevertheless he did carry on an active research program.  And he really tried to encourage all of the students to, to not just learn the science in the textbooks but to really understand how to conduct an experiment and to, you know, do original research.  So, that was Dr. Knuckles.  And then while I was there we recruited a professor, Dr. F. Roy Hunter.  And Dr. Hunter was also a very active researcher.  And he, in order to carry on his research, he spent the summers in the laboratory of one of his mentors, a Dr. Bill Danforth.  And that is how I got to go to the Illinois Institute of Technology [Chicago, Illinois] for my Ph.D. work.  Dr. F. Roy Hunter had worked with Dr. Danforth and highly recommended me for admission to graduate school.  So, that was two of the major professors.  And then I--a couple of others--Dr. Bond and Dr. Fleming, who were also very encouraging and supporting, both while an undergraduate but also encouraging me to go on to graduate school.
Story_ID: 22724
Speaker 1: Now, apart from science, I mean in terms of--how was Fayetteville State [University, Fayetteville, North Carolina] in terms of teaching the liberal arts?
Speaker 2: It was extremely good.  Again, I felt very fortunate in the quality of the professors that we had at Fayetteville.  We had an excellent music department.  Again, I was very interested in music, so that was my outlet from the sciences.  I was a student of piano, I sang in the choir and I played in the marching band, as well as in the concert band at school.
Speaker 1: What did you play in the marching band?
Speaker 2: In the marching band I played drums or cymbals.  I was--a reed instrument--I played the oboe in the orchestra.  And so, for the marching band I did percussion.  And, you know, this is a great experience because I had, you know, the choir gave tours every year, and we could visit the different towns in the state, often at churches.  And we often had a competition outside of the state.  So, a great experience there.  And you know, you're talking about the liberal arts.  We had really excellent people in literature, in history and, art and music, and I would say religion.  Our religion department was very good.  We did not have a philosophy department when I was there, so I didn't really take any philosophy courses.  But then I had to take all the education courses.  So, we had educational psych [psychology] tests, measurements and, you know, the higher level principles and practices of teaching that we took.  And those--I felt that the teachers that we had in the education department were some of the strongest of the faculty that we had at the institution.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I just want to ask, because as Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences now, you know, you got to deal with the liberal arts, too, you know, so I was wondering.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I didn't, I wouldn't say that I really took my passion and understanding of the liberal arts from Fayetteville (laughter).  It was very much later that I developed an appreciation.  It was primarily at Dartmouth when I was there as a faculty member.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Story_ID: 22725
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about going to Chicago [Illinois].  This was the summer before you're a senior right [at Fayetteville State University, Fayetteville, North Carolina]?  Did you go to Chicago, or was it the summer after your senior year?
Speaker 2: It was the summer after I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're going to Chicago to the Illinois Institute of Technology?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That had to be exciting, I guess.
Speaker 2: It was very exciting.  And again, for the first time I'm leaving a small--the state of North Carolina to go to a major city, urban city.  So, that was a big culture shock, to say the least.  And it was the first time that I was going to an integrated, well, historically white school.  So, I'd been you know, I'd started at the black schools all of my entire life.  So, that was a real challenge and it took some adjustment.  The first year was definitely very tough.  And believe it or not, the winter of '67 [1967] which was my first winter there (laughter), was a winter of the major blizzard in Chicago.
Speaker 1: That was the worst winter ever.
Speaker 2: That's right, absolutely.  And I was totally unprepared for, you know, a Chicago winter, let alone a blizzard, you know.  And so, that evening I actually was scheduled to go and visit a friend.  And not realizing what a blizzard was really like, and not paying attention to the weather, I was out in the weather that night, you know, with snow drifts of 15, 20 feet.  I almost got stuck.  It was just a bit of good fortune that I was able to get back home without getting stranded in the street that evening.
Speaker 1: Now, yeah, you know, the truth be told, I mean, people spent the night at work--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and it started snowing hard as the afternoon was winding down--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and when it was time to go home, a lot of people spent the night at work, they never went home.
Speaker 2: They never went home, they were stuck in their cars.  I mean, it was, yeah, it was just an incredibly terrible storm.  So, that was my introduction to the winters of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22726
Speaker 1: Well, Chicago [Illinois], now, Chicago has been called one of the most segregated cities in the United States, even now.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, did you find Chicago, you know, to be different from North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you still--even though it was segregated, to me it seemed to be very, very integrated because you could downtown to a Macy's or Marshall Field's [department stores], you know, and you didn't see any real evidence of segregation.  It was only when you began to appreciate how the housing patterns--you know, there was the South Side, and I quickly learned that that's where the jazz clubs were, and the other places that blacks went.  And so, that's where I began going.  And so, you could see that segregation.  But to me I didn't feel it when I was in downtown Chicago.  There was no evidence of a colored fountain and white fountain or places that you couldn't go or eat.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, now you were down on 22nd Street.   This is just south of the Loop.  Did you stay on campus?
Speaker 2: I stayed on campus, yes.  So, IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology] is at 35th, 35th and State [Street], right.  So, yes, I stayed on campus.  I was in the dorm, my first year.  And then I met my wife the second year and we got married and moved into an apartment on campus.  So, I stayed on campus for the entire time.
Speaker 1: Now, was she a fellow student?
Speaker 2: No, she was working for IBM [International Business Machines] at the time in the city.  She graduated from Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] in '64 [1964].  She'd gone to the University of Illinois Champaign at Urbana for a couple of years.  And then she took a job at IBM in '66 [1966].  And so it was by happenstance that her friend and a friend of mine were participating in a program in Chicago.  It was the National Science Foundation [NSF] Summer Teacher's Institute.  I don't know if you recall those, but they were very popular back in those days.  And so, the two of us were invited by our respective friends to a party at one of their houses, and that's how we met.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now her name is Sylvia [Tyler], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: And so, now tell us about, what was your relationship with William Danforth [Langford's doctoral advisor at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Danforth was a wonderful mentor.  He was a quiet man, extremely highly respected in his field, in you know protozoan metabolism.   And it was because of my relationship with F. Roy Hunter that he had invited me, you know, to work in his laboratory.  When I got to graduate school I had no idea of what one was supposed to do, how graduate school worked.  I mean, this was a totally new experience for me.  So, I was floundering, and Bill Danforth came to me and said "George, if you want to work in my lab I'd be happy to have you."  And so I did, because there was nobody else in the department who did.  You know, most kids were sophisticated enough to know that, first of all, when you apply to the school you know pretty much know who you want to work with.  And if you don't, you go through a process of interviewing with faculty and eventually coming up with a mentor.  I really was not aware of how that process worked.  So, it was, it was very good of Dr. Danforth to step in and invite me to work in his lab.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22728
Speaker 1: Now, I've read on the [research] outline that your laboratory skills were weak.  That was your weakest area.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And was that because of lack of facilities or poor facilities in Fayetteville [State University, Fayetteville, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: That's right.  We didn't have, you know, it wasn't possible to get very much in the way of real laboratory experience because we didn't have the equipment. We didn't have, you know, the kinds of things that we can provide for our students now, which is professors who have an active research program.  A student can go in and do a research project in that professor's laboratory.  I had none of those experiences when I was there.  So, I was pretty green, you know.  My knowledge was basically book knowledge, things that I had learned in courses and not, you know, laboratory techniques.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you chose to deal with cell biology?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That's like lab intensive.
Speaker 2: Very lab intensive.  And the reason I chose cell biology is because another wonderful thing happened.  As I joined the graduate program at IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois], they were building a new biological sciences laboratory, brand new life sciences lab.  And they brought in a new chair of the department, Dr. Teru Hayashi.  And it was Dr. Hayashi who really brought cell biology to the university.  And so, he really converted a very traditional biology department into a very modern cell and molecular biology program.  And so, I was really fortunate to be there at the time that he arrived and he was transforming this program.  And this was at the same time that the whole field of cell biology was developing, so I was getting in it at the beginning of a new field.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, biology kind of took a radical shift there.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  It was the time--
Speaker 1: That's when people started to understand DNA [deoxyribonucleic acid].
Speaker 2: That's right.  So, those big experiments that, you know, DNA was discovered and, you know, we were beginning to understand the different parts of cells and how those cells functioned.  We were developing these new imaging techniques so that we can actually image all of the different parts of the cell.  And so, there were new discoveries being made everyday, you know, a new structure, you know.  And at the time they were just discovering the structures that I work on now, actin filaments and microtubules [cytoskeletal structures; cellular scaffolding or skeleton contained within a cell's cytoplasm] that weren't even known before that.  So, it was an extraordinary time.  And Teru Hayashi was an individual who took a lot of interest in the graduate students and he took an interest in my career in particular.  So, even though I was working in Bill Danforth's laboratory and studying sort of traditional physiology of cells, you know, he encouraged me to think about moving in a different direction, and really sort of engineered a way that I could get a post-doc [postdoctoral training position] with one of the most famous scientists in the world, Shinya Inoue.  And this happened because he invited a good friend of Shenya's, Dr. Jean Clark Dan, to do a sabbatical at the university, and I was assigned to be her teaching assistant for that course.  And so I got to know her very well and she was able to write a letter on my behalf for Dr. Inoue for my postdoctoral training.
Speaker 1: Now, Dr. Dan, she was one of the few black women involved in this.
Speaker 2: She was actually a white woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, but very--of the few women who were involved.
Speaker 1: Oh, they got, they provided a picture here.  And it certainly looked like a (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Is that right?
Speaker 1: I thought maybe--there's something--you know, I apologize for that, but I didn't know, I thought she was black.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, she's white.
Speaker 1: Well, she's one of the few women, I guess that was involved?
Speaker 2: That's right, very few women that were involved, and she was, again, a great mentor.  I was really fortunate to be able to work with her, because everyday I would have lunch with her and she would, you know, tell me about a lot of the historical background of the research that she was doing and others were doing at that time.  So, it was very, very enlightening to be able to have a close relationship with someone who could tell you a lot of the history of the field.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you finished your master's [degree] in '69 [1969], and then you just went straight through--
Speaker 2: Well, see, I had enrolled in the Ph.D. program, and it's not required to get a master's.  But what happened is in '68 [1968] I was drafted into the service.  And so, I had applied for a student deferral, and my appeal was denied at the local and the state level.  And I had to go all the way to the presidential level to actually get my student deferment approved.  And in the process, I was advised by the university to take a master's just in case the appeal was not approved and I would have to leave the university.  So, that was the reason that I completed a master's before continuing on to the Ph.D.
Story_ID: 22729
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now, you were in Chicago [Illinois] during one of the, I guess, most tumultuous times for the city of Chicago in terms of--we described a blizzard, but now we've got in '68 [1968] the assassination of Dr. [Martin Luther] King and the riots that ensued, as well as the Democratic National Convention.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, where were you, did that affect anything you did at all?  I mean, I know, being a research scientist it may not have (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, it was, it was a very traumatic time.  I mean, when Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated and the, you know, the city went up in flames it was a very, very scary time.  My wife's [Sylvia Langford] parents lived on the South Side and so it was, you know, a very frightening prospect, you know, that things would get totally out of control and people would lose their homes.  So, yes, and then when the National Convention came to town, you know, there was such a disturbance.  And I think it was also the summer when Robert Kennedy was assassinated.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: That's right.  So, yeah, it was a very, very difficult moment in the history of the country.  And so, in that sense, it was a real distraction from some of the things that I was doing at the university.
Speaker 1: Now, there was a lot, I remember there was plenty of local political agitation I think around the superintendent of the schools, [Benjamin C.] Willis [superintendent of the Chicago public schools from 1953 to 1966], I think it was, and the "Willis wagons" [the pejorative term for portable school classrooms used by Superintendent Willis' critics when protesting school overcrowding and segregation in black neighborhoods from 1962 to 1966] and the overcrowding of the Chicago schools.  And, was it a time when you, did you pay much attention to the agitation around town and the political meetings and--
Speaker 2: I really didn't.  I was pretty much on campus all the time, so that was my community.  I really wasn't very much engaged with activities off-campus.  So, I knew it was all happening around me, but, you know, I was pretty much focused on what I was doing in my studies.
Story_ID: 22730
Speaker 1: You were able to go straight through and work to finish your Ph.D. [degree] in 1971.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And can you tell us your, you have these mentors-[William] Danforth, [Teru] Hayashi, and Jean Clark Dan. Were there any other black students in the--
Speaker 2: There were a couple of other black students. There was one student who was there at the same time I was, Art Washington, who went on, he completed his Ph.D.  He went on--I think his first appointment was at Prairie View State University [Prairie View, Texas], and he's worked at other places.  But he was the only other one.  So it was, it was a small group of black students on campus.  Actually, my closest friend at the time was a guy from Nigeria, Urunzi Chuko (ph.) who was in the engineering program, and he was Ibo [Nigerian ethnic group], and he was in this country during the Biafran War [Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970] in Nigeria.  And then there were a couple of other students from Ethiopia and other African countries.  So, that was sort of the social group that I had when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 22731
Speaker 1: Now, can you explain what was your dissertation about?  I think you studied Euglenas [single-celled eukaryotes; a genus of protozoa], right?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  I studied anaerobic metabolism in Euglena. Euglena is a protozoan that has an unusual property of having a chloroplast so that it can both utilize sunlight for energy but it can also feed on carbon sources, like acetate or ethanol.  And so, as I said, Bill Danforth [Langford's doctoral thesis advisor at Illinois Institute of Technology] was one of the world's expert on metabolism and Euglena, and had figured out the carbon pathway for metabolism of acetate, and I had taken on this additional project of understanding if they could grow in the absence of oxygen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you find?
Speaker 2: We found that they could, that the cells were able to exist for fairly long periods of time in the absence of oxygen.  And the next part of the project would have been to understand the anaerobic pathway, but there wasn't enough time during my graduate training to complete that part of the project.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22732
Speaker 1: Now, you joined the American Society for Cell Biology [ASCB] in '72 [1972], it says here.  I don't know if you remember (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright--and before you proceeded to your post-doc [postdoctoral training] assignment with Dr. [Shinya] Inoue [at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], right?
Speaker 2: Well, I started there in '71 [1971], so I was already there when I joined the American Society for Cell Biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, that was an important organization, and as you can see, I've been very, very involved with the American Society for Cell Biology.  As I said, you know, that was, it was a fairly young society starting a new field, and I really felt very fortunate to be there at the beginning of it.  And it helped to shape my career as well, because it was, you know--the mentors that I met through ASCB, that I was able to have a very successful research career.
Story_ID: 22733
Speaker 1: Now, your post-doc [postdoctoral training] assignment was at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, as a, this is in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Philadelphia, right.
Speaker 1: With the NIH [National Institutes of Health; funding source].  And tell us about that.
Speaker 2: So, with the strong recommendation of Professor [Teru] Hyashi [at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois, where Langford earned his Ph.D. degree] and Professor [Jean Clark] Dan, Shinya Inoue, who was a leading figure in the field at the time in cell division, how cells divide, accepted me as a post doc.  And so, I joined his laboratory.  He was--he had one of the best funded laboratories in the country at that time and one of the best equipped laboratories at the University of Pennsylvania [UPenn].  His real contribution to science was the development of the polarizing light microscope, and he was at the forefront of imaging living cells.  And so, when I got to Penn, this was what I was able to do, was to learn these new techniques of cell imaging using the polarizing light microscope and understanding the dynamics of the cytoskeleton [cellular scaffolding or skeleton contained within a cell's cytoplasm]. And so my, my research took a different direction.  So, instead of the physiology, physiological studies of metabolism, I was moving into cell biology and high resolution imaging of living cells.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there until--
Speaker 2: Until '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: '73' [1973].
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So, it was a two year post-doctoral training.  I had an NIH, post-doctoral fellowship.  This was, again as you recall, this was the time when historically white universities were beginning to admit under-represented minority students.  At the time they had none of the programs that we now have in place to support students who were coming in.  So, you're pretty much on your own, you know.  You were admitted into the program, but there, you know, they had no idea of how to facilitate the integration of minority kids into the program.  So, when I was at Penn, you know, it was very, very difficult because there was a lot of prejudice.  It was primarily, I would say, class rather than color.  All of the students at Penn were from other Ivy League institutions, and they really wondered why someone from a place like the Illinois Institute of Technology, and having gone to a historically black school for undergraduate [Fayetteville State University, Fayetteville, North Carolina], could end up as a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania.  So, that was, that made it socially very uncomfortable being there.  But it was an extraordinary place to work because of the quality of the mentor and the other students in the program.
Story_ID: 22734
Speaker 1: You studied the motile axostyle in termite protozoa.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Now, what does that mean?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So, my mentor, Dr. [Shinya] Inoue, said, "Since you are familiar with protozoa--" I'd studied Euglena [for his Ph.D. degree at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois]---.  He said, "I have this very interesting organism that you should study." And it lives, is a protozoan that lives in the hind gut of termites.   Now I don't know if you know this, but termites feed on wood, right?  They do damage to your house because they live on wood, but they do not have enzymes to break down the carbon source in wood, that is, cellulose [enzyme].  So, they have to harbor these protozoa in their guts to break down the food source that they eat.  And so, these are extraordinary animals.  They live in the gut, which is an anaerobic environment.  There's no oxygen there.  But they feed on the wood, and they break it down. And because the gut content is so viscous, they have developed extraordinary ways to move around inside.  And so the organism that I studied, Pyrsonympha [genus of protozoans], has a ribbon inside of it that generates waves and light, a flagellum that allows the organism to move.  And that's what I studied.  I wanted to understand how it moved and what was the mechanism, what were the proteins involved in generating the force for movement?
Speaker 1: In high school biology, you know, we studied how the amoeba [a genus of protozoa] moves, how they kind of just droop, and then stretch themselves--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and then the Paramecium [genus of protozoa] moves, and the cilia and the flagellum, and you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So this, is this a new way of movement?
Speaker 2: So, this one is similar to the flagellum, except, instead of--a flagellum has a very specific kind of structure, you know.  It's made up of a circle of microtubules, so it's a nice rod-shaped structure and it generates waves.  This is a ribbon.  It's made of, not of nine sets of microtubules, but of a thousand of these little flying filaments that are called microtubules.  So, it uses a very similar mechanism, but it's a different, different structure.
Story_ID: 22735
Speaker 1: So, now in '73 [1973], also you joined the faculty of the University of Massachusetts as a professor of cell biology.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So that's, after finishing my post-doc [postdoctoral training at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you know, I began to look for faculty positions.  And my mentor [Shinya Inoue] really had encouraged me to, you know, to look at some of the best universities in the country.  I interviewed at Georgetown [University, Washington, District of Columbia], I interviewed at Washington University in St. Louis [Missouri], and then I also interviewed at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.  The campus--, the UMass campus in Boston was fairly new.  It was a new campus that they were building, and now it's located on Columbia Point there in Boston.  At the time the plan was for the university to become a fully Ph.D. granting institution, and all of the disciplines in the sciences.  But as things developed, it turned out that there was a lot of competition.  There were, you know, real questions about whether there was a need to develop another cell biology program in the Boston area, when you had all of these other very, very highly regarded universities in the city.  So, I took the position thinking that there would be an opportunity to really be part of a campus that was becoming a leading campus in cell biology.  But after I got there, I realized that, you know, that wasn't really going to happen, you know, because of the politics in the town.  It was a great place to start my career as a faculty member, but I realized if I wanted to really become a research scientist, I had to move to a different place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so, well let me ask you this.  I've visited Boston during that era, and Columbia Point was a--was there a housing project there at Columbia Point?
Speaker 2: That's right, there was a very famous--
Speaker 1: Dangerous ones, too.  I mean--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --there were a couple of riots out there during that era.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  So, there's the Columbia Point housing project that's there.  But this was built right on the harbor, on the water, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --there was no interaction between the two.  But nevertheless, you know, it was not the most desirable part of the city.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when I mean dangerous, I mean, a man was liked burned alive, I think--
Speaker 2: Oh, my.
Speaker 1: --a white man, in 1974.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when we were there.  So, it could be dangerous.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: So, now when did you, now you were at University of Massachusetts from '73 [1973] to--
Speaker 2: '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 22736
Speaker 1: So, it was while you were there [University of Massachusetts in Boston] that you took advantage of the Marine Biological Laboratory [MBL] at Woods Hole [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  I began going to the Marine Biological Laboratory in '72 [1972] when I was at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And then I continued going for the time that I was at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us the significance of this place.  And then there's another, there's a figure in the history of black science that spent a lot of time there, Dr. Ernest Everett Just [pioneering African American embryologist who studied the early development of marine invertebrates].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I think you've discussed him in lectures and that sort of thing, so--
Speaker 2: Right.  Yes, so the Marine Biological Laboratory became one of the most important institutions in my development as a scientist.  I went there while I was a post-doc at Penn because my, post-doc mentor Shinya Inoue always moved his laboratory there in the summers.  And I went there to take the physiology course, and this was one of those amazing experiences.  It's a total emersion course.  It teaches you really the fine points of research science, and you're learning it from the best people in the discipline.  So it's a great place, it's very student-oriented.  Faculty members who come there do it because they love to do it.  They are accessible in ways that they're not when they're at the home institution.  And it creates this atmosphere of openness and really strong support.  So, you develop, you know, an excellent network of individuals to work with as a result of being there.  So, I went there in '72 [1972] for the physiology course, and I went back in '74 [1974] for the neurobiology course.  And then I began to go as an independent scientist.  I served as an MBL Steps [ph.] Fellow, a Macy--Josiah Macy Fellow, working in the laboratory of other scientists as I was developing my own research program, and then began to go there as an independent investigator.  So, it's really, it's a unique place.  If you've never been there it's really worth a visit because there's just none other place like it.  So, for my own advisor, you know, because of the stress of all of the things he had to do when he was at the university, it was very hard to get in to talk to him.  But in Woods Hole, it was easy, you know.  You had, you could sit out on a bench by the water and talk at lunch.  You could go--you know, you could spend time in the evenings working together.  So, people were just accessible, and it was a wonderful learning experience.  Because as I said before, you remember--I, you know, research science was all new to me, and it takes a long time to really develop a strong network and to understand just how to move a science project forward.  So, I depended a great deal on the network of friends that I developed at the Marine Biological Laboratory.
Story_ID: 22737
Speaker 1: As you say, Ernest Everett Just [pioneering African American embryologist who studied the early development of marine invertebrates] was one of the scientists who did his groundbreaking research at the MBL [Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts].  So, I had the privilege of learning about him once I got to the MBL.  I really didn't know very much about him before.  I knew his name, because he was one of the founders of Omega Psi Phi at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], and so I'd known of him from that, but I really didn't appreciate his science until I got to the MBL.  And there I learned, you know, how he had developed the techniques for culturing sea urchin eggs in vitro.  So, some of the early work on in vitro fertilization was done by Ernest Everett Just, as well as early stages of development.  So, it was very inspiring to hear the story of Just, and understand what he went through to pursue his science, working primarily at the MBL and then in Europe.
Speaker 2: Who, I guess, kind of introduced you to his significance? I mean, was it--
Speaker 1: It was the, the laboratory director at the time.  Ebert was his name, Jim Ebert.  He was, he actually knew Just and had been a very strong supporter of Just.  And he was also interested in increasing the number of under-represented scientists at the MBL.  So, he's the one who introduced me to Ernest Just.  The other way I learned about him, there was a famous picture of him hanging in the library at the Marine Biological Laboratory.  So, when I saw that, I began to inquire about who he was.  And that's how I got a chance to talk to Ebert, and he told me some of the history of Just and the people he worked with at the MBL.
Speaker 2: So, we take it that he had a significant impact on the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole.  And we know that they don't celebrate Black History Month there, so he must have really made a--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --great contribution.
Speaker 1: He did, he did.  He was, he made a huge contribution there, and as I say, he was not about to get a position at a major research university because of the color of his skin.  And so, he always had to come back to the MBL to get his work done while he was on the faculty at Howard.  And he spent a lot of time as an expatriate in Europe, you know, in Germany, France and in Italy until, you know, he was chased out by the fascists.  And so, his life story is an incredible story.
Story_ID: 22738
Speaker 1: And as I tell everyone, you know, I now look back on his [Ernest Everett Just, pioneering African American embryologist who studied the early development of marine invertebrates] career and I see many parallels to my own.  He grew up in South Carolina, I in North Carolina, but when I think about how my career developed, I depended a great deal on mentors, you know, as Just did.  Just had the good fortune of having H.R. [Frank] Lillie [director of the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory, Massachusetts] as his mentor and a real strong supporter, and I have really benefitted from the mentors that I've had, including--I've mentioned [Teru] Hayashi [at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois], [Shinya] Inoue [Langford's postdoctoral advisor at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  But, Robert Allen is the other person who was very influential in my career.  I worked very closely with scientists from Europe because it was much easier to develop collaborations and networks with scientists abroad than it was with white male scientists in the U.S.  And that was very similar to the experience that Just had.  And then it was the fact that Just had dealt with the question of whether blacks could do groundbreaking research science.  You know, I didn't have to deal with that question because he had already done it.  He'd proven that that could happen.  And so it lifted that kind of pressure from my shoulders, and I could really go ahead and pursue my research without having that nagging issue in the back of my mind and being raised by other people.  I could point to Ernest Just as the person who'd already broken that color line within the sciences.
Story_ID: 22739
Speaker 1: Now you, you came along at a time when a lot of old scientific theories about a lot of things were being changed, and I guess some of the scientific theories about race, you know, the ones that were holding Ernest Everett Just [pioneering African American embryologist who studied the early development of marine invertebrates] out of big institutions, big research institutions, were falling to the wayside as well, I guess.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, what, do you have any reflections on your interaction in the scientific community during your era, you know, and what the scientists were really concerned about in terms of race and that sort of thing?  Were they concerned about what color you were once you got in a place like Woods Hole [Massachusetts; Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was always the issue of color.  I mean, it's quite amazing.  I thought, for example, when I got to the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], that a very elite Ivy League institution would not hold those kinds of thoughts and feelings.  And I saw that they were very conservative.  They definitely felt that, you know, it was the exceptional black who could do this, you know, that for the most part blacks were not capable of abstract thinking, you know, that this was still challenged on most levels.  And so I, I really found it very difficult to network with white colleagues who were in the same laboratory with me.  And again, that's why I had to actually depend upon colleagues from abroad to provide both collaborations as well as feedback on my research in ways that I couldn't get from my fellow colleagues who were either, you know, working at the same institution or in the same field.
Speaker 1: Now, can students of color today expect the same kind of reaction, or have things changed?
Speaker 2: Well, things have changed now.  I think what has changed is not so much that, black students are not going to find these kinds of attitudes, but institutions have developed support systems that weren't in place when I was there.  So, there is a way to get the information, through organized programs that simply did not exist at that time.  So, I think, you know, any black scientist will tell you that they feel, you know, the young ones will say, "I feel isolated," you know.  "I still have difficulty developing good relationships with my white colleagues."  If you look at the data that's coming out right now, for example, the number of publications of black post-docs [postdoctoral researchers] coming out of the laboratory are less than that of white post-docs coming out of the same laboratory.  So, again, the mentoring isn't the same.  They're not, you know, being given access to the same opportunities to present at workshops, to publish their work and to take on projects that have high impact.  So, that's still happening.  If you look at NIH [National Institutes of Health] grants, it's still much more difficult for under-represented minority scientists, the young scientists, to get funded than it is for white male scientists.  So, it's better, and there are definitely ways, there are programs in place to help, but the problem has not disappeared.
Story_ID: 22740
Speaker 1: Now, in '77 [1977], you took a job teaching at Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In the College of Medicine, right?  So, what were you, you were teaching cell biology?
Speaker 2: I was teaching cell biology to medical students.  So, this is the anatomy department.  It was the anatomy and cell biology department.  I was responsible for teaching the first year medical students, and the reason I chose to go to a medical school is because of the additional time that you have to do research.  The teaching loads are less in medical schools than it is in a traditional biology department.  And again, I really wanted to have the time to pursue my research.  And so, I made the decision at that time to move from the biology department and the liberal arts college into a medical school.   It was really great being at Howard, being at a historically black school [HBCU], but again, an opportunity came along for me to join the faculty at the medical school at UNC [University of North Carolina at] Chapel Hill.  And UNC, of course, was one of the top ranked research universities in the country.  So, it was a pretty unique opportunity.  And so, I was really glad to be able to take that position.
Story_ID: 22741
Speaker 1: Okay, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  So--
Speaker 2: Right.  So, this was a very big move for me and I was there for twelve years.  I would feel that that's where I really built my career as a research scientist as part of the university.  I was, I had the good fortune of working with some good people in the department.  Christopher Fordham was the dean of the medical school at the time that I was hired, and he was very interested in increasing the number of under-represented minorities at the university.  So, it was great to have support at that level.  It was, again, you know, a difficult situation where I was the only black faculty member, one of a very small number of black faculty members in the medical school.  And I may have been the only basic scientist.  The other blacks on the faculty were in the clinical sciences. They were M.D.s as opposed to Ph.D.s.  So, again, it was, you know, it was a challenging environment to work.  And even though North Carolina had changed a lot since I'd grown up, many things were still the same.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what kind of things were the same? (laughter) Did--I have to ask, because--
Speaker 2: Well, for example, the only black men that I saw on a daily basis were the grounds people you know, the housekeepers, and this to me was very troubling as a faculty member in the department, you know.  And when I tried to explain this to my colleagues they couldn't understand why it upset me, you know.  They said, but that's just the way it is.  And so, that was, you know, the sort of thing that, you know, the kinds of racial discrimination that exists becomes invisible to people around because it's ordinary.  They see it as the way things work.  So, you have that sort of thing.  I also, there was an incident that I had when I was there.  My wife [Sylvia Tyler Langford] had given me a large plant on one of my birthdays, that I had in my office.  And after being in the office for about a year I hadn't been taking care of it very well.  It didn't look very well, and my wife said, "Well why don't you bring it home and we'll try to rehabilitate it and you can take it back."  And in the process of taking the plant out of the building, I was stopped by one of the white techs who thought I was stealing the plant.  And he called the police and, you know, I had to deal with (laughter) this awful situation.  And, again, you know, I ended up having to apologize to him because, you know, the guy said that I had insulted him.  And, you know, the dean of the medical school, who wasn't Chris Fordham, it was one of the associate deans, had decided that I should have been more responsive to what he was trying to say.  And, you know, this is, I'm a professor at the institution, and I had identified myself to this guy.  And instead, you know, he continued to, he used his car to block mine from exiting the parking lot until the police got there.  So, you know, things had changed, but they hadn't changed all that much.
Speaker 1: So, you had to apologize for just speaking harshly to him, or--?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --not cracking his skull or anything?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Which is what I wanted to do, you know.  But, you know, it wasn't felt that it was inappropriate for him to do what he did.  So--
Speaker 1: Maybe on the brighter side, I don't know if it's the brighter side or not, but when you were there when Michael Jordan [professional basketball player] was playing basketball there.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: James Worthy [professional basketball player]--
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the era of all of those famous basketball players that came out of Dean Smith's [basketball coach] program.  But again, you know, the culture was still pretty much entrenched.  It wasn't--at least you know, for my generation of people who were part of the faculty, you know--I don't know what it was like for the students at the time, but I know institutionally they were talking the game, but your day to day experience was, you know, was not all that great.
Story_ID: 22742
Speaker 1: This had to be a sensitive time because I can imagine the University of North Carolina [at Chapel Hill] had not been integrated with black students that long.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Of course, you know, North Carolina went through that consent decree in which they were--so, Fayetteville [State University, Fayetteville, North Carolina] and the other historical black schools [HBCUs] were taking on a set number of white kids, and the white campuses were beginning to take in black kids, but it was in the late '70s [1970s] before that really happened.  And I was there in 1980, from '80 [1980] to '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: So, some of the newfound openness was decreed by the court, basically?
Speaker 2: That's right, it was decreed by the court, and you still had the typical, you know, the housing patterns.  The town was fully segregated.  We were the only black family in the white community that we lived in, you know.  And my kids now reflect back.  They grew up in elementary and high school there, and they talk about the pressure of what it was like to be the only black kid in the class or to be the only middle class kid, because they had bussed in some of the kids from some of the neighboring communities.  And so, you know, it was not, it was not a very easy environment for kids to grow up in.
Speaker 1: Oh, I can imagine.
Story_ID: 22743
Speaker 1: So, so, in '85 [1985], you were named the first chairman of the Minority Affairs Committee of the American Society for Cell Biology [ASCB].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, what did you do in that role?
Speaker 2: Well, we at the American Society for Cell Biology, it was, you know, it was one of the organizations that we really worked hard to try to get more support for minority scientists.  And so, we had--before that, a group of the black scientists had gotten together to sort of organize an informal group, and we decided that we wanted to become an official part of the organization.  And so, we formed the Minority Affairs Committee of the American Society for Cell Biology.  I think Winston Anderson [also a HistoryMaker] was the first chair of that committee.  And then in 1985 I was appointed to succeed him as the chair of the committee.  And the idea was to provide a mechanism for networking among black scientists, to provide travel grants to graduate students and post-docs [postdoctoral researchers] to attend the meetings, and to advocate for issues, you know, that were of importance to the black community.
Story_ID: 22744
Speaker 1: Now in '88 [1988], you were appointed to the National Science Foundation [NSF] where you served as the director of cell biology from '88 [1988] to '89 [1989]. Now, this is a position where you are determining grants, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  That was a position as the program officer for the cell biology program.  I was in charge of reviewing all of the applications that came into the foundation in that discipline, and to decide ultimately who received funding for their programs.  So, it was a very, very interesting experience.  I got to see how federal agencies work, you know, you get a better idea of the whole process of writing grant applications.  And, you get to see the best ideas in the field, you know, through the proposals that come in to be reviewed.  So, it was a very important experience for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22745
Speaker 1: Now, you were at the University of North Carolina [at Chapel Hill; UNC] until 1991?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you were invited to join the faculty of Dartmouth College [Hanover, New Hampshire]?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And how did that take place, and--
Speaker 2: The alumni and faculty at Dartmouth had advocated for setting up a professorship to increase the number of minority faculty at Dartmouth.  And they decided to have the professorship named in honor of Ernest Everett Just [pioneering African American embryologist who studied the early development of marine invertebrates], who graduated from Dartmouth in 1907.  So, they were able to raise up to a million dollars.  I don't know what the final sum of the endowment was, but it was primarily driven by faculty and alums at Dartmouth.  And then they began to search for the first appointee to that professorship.  And luckily, I was invited to apply.  I was doing very well at UNC.  I really wasn't thinking about moving at that time.  But, I was invited to apply, so I decided to do that and then I was offered the position.  So, it was, it was a unique opportunity.  I'm really, really pleased that I was selected for that position.  And so, I was appointed in 1991 as the Ernest Everett Just Professor of Natural Sciences at Dartmouth with an appointment in the biology department as well in the medical school.
Story_ID: 22746
Speaker 1: And as I said before, you know, it was really at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire] that I began to develop a full appreciation for the liberal arts.  Because now I was moving from medical school where I'd been for twelve years at UNC [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill], and before that at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], back into a biology department which was part of a liberal arts college.  And it was, again, great to be back interacting with undergraduates and graduate students, and teaching undergraduates as opposed to medical students.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  What aspects of the liberal arts caught your attention at Dartmouth that made you--
Speaker 1: Well, again, I was brought in by the president of Dartmouth, James Freedman.  James Freedman had been recruited to Dartmouth to raise its academic profile and to build programs, including the graduate programs. Dartmouth at the time was primarily considered an undergraduate institution even though it had professional schools and graduate programs.  So, Freedman was brought in to really raise the profile.  But Freedman was a very strong spokesperson for a liberal education, and so he's actually written a book on, you know, the qualities of the liberal arts education.  So there I had the opportunity for the first time to really interact with humanists, with faculty members in English and African American studies and you know, and religion and philosophy and also in the social sciences and economics and political science, and geography.  So, it was one of those very, very enriched environments in which as a faculty member, you know, I could cross over and work with faculty outside of the sciences, an opportunity that was not available to me at UNC, simply because the medical school was so self-contained there was very little interaction with people on the graduate side of the campus.  So, it was a great place.
Story_ID: 22747
Speaker 1: And there [as a faculty member at Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire], after interacting with some of the humanists, I decided to--I had also started this program, the E.E. [Ernest Everett] Just Program [pioneering African American embryologist who studied the early development of marine invertebrates], for students in the sciences which was designed to increase the number of black students who were majoring in the sciences.  Because this is another phenomena--and I'm not sure if you're familiar with it, but students, black students entered the university at Dartmouth with the same percent of them interested in the sciences.  It was about 45 percent as there are white students.  But as they go through the institution, white students, about 30 percent of them major in the sciences, but for blacks it's about 15 percent.  And what we wanted to do was to reduce that attrition of students who come in with an interest in science but for a variety of reasons, choose not to pursue science as a career.  So, I started that program and working with the humanists, I actually organized a conference at Dartmouth on whiteness and white privilege, because I really wanted to try to deal with some of the issues that black students faced and that white faculty are not really conversant in, and often really don't appreciate what they do to discourage black students.  And so, that was one of the opportunities that I had to sort of work across disciplines to bring in people who were studying issues of whiteness and white privilege from a humanist point of view, sociological point of view, as well as scientists who were dealing with these questions as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 22748
Speaker 1: Now is there, among scientists, is there much respect for social science as a science?
Speaker 2: It's, the social sciences are considered soft sciences compared to the natural sciences.  So yes, you know, many scientists, you know, thumb their nose at a lot of the sociological or social science work.  But I think we're now at a point where it is being supported by hard science.  So, brain imaging, for example, is being used to show that when white people interact with a black person, you can see different regions of the brain light up, you can show when they're thinking, you know, unpleasant thoughts.  So, I think a lot of the science now, a lot of this soft science is being supported by the hard sciences.  And scientists are beginning to really wake up to this.  Now, a lot of scientists don't have any reason to think about these issues, so they don't, you know.  So, if you tell them, you talk to them about a stereotype threat, they don't know what you're talking about.  You know, if you talk about white privilege, they don't even know what that term means.  They say, "Oh, but I grew up on a farm, too, and it was very hard for me, and I came through." (laughter)  So, and that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about their status as a person in this country, you know.  And so, trying to get people to understand these issues is very difficult because they don't have any reason to really think about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, how these things play out on the ground is something that eludes most people in this country, black and white.  They don't understand how they really manifest themselves, and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and there have been a lot of studies about how you know, white privilege is taken for granted by blacks and whites--it's just something that happened.  It's like swimming in a stream.  You just don't even think about it.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.  That's right.  And so, because it's like the air you breathe, you can't even get people to understand it, you know.  It's not a phenomenon they can even identify with.  So, for me it was always very frustrating, because I would try to talk to my colleagues about this.  And they would just sort of look, you know, like what are you talking about, you know, this just doesn't make any sense (laughter).  So after awhile, you get just frustrated and you give up, you know.  We're not making any progress here.  Let's not even talk about it.
Speaker 1: But it's really something that you really can't give up about, but eventually you're going to have to hit it again, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, that's right.  And the way I think about it is, I say to students that you have to take responsibility for yourself, you know.  And you've got to understand how this works.  You have to understand that because of the color dynamic, that when you're in the presence of the white professor, you know, this is likely to be the way you will respond.  You have to recognize that, and then you have to come up with strategies to deal with it, you know.  And I feel that that's a much more, effective way of trying to bring about change than really trying to get a senior white colleague who is really stuck in this idea that I got there because I am better, you know.  It's very hard to get them to understand that no, it's all of the wonderful things that the opportunities have represented to you that allowed you to do it.  And those opportunities were not available to black students and black colleagues who were coming along.  So, you know, it's not so easy, but I've learned a lot from white women who've had to deal with the, you know, the superior white male syndrome.  I mean, they have come up with some very good strategies for thinking about these issues.  And so, I really try to point black students to a lot of that literature because it's extremely helpful.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 22749
Speaker 1: Now, what sort of research were you dealing with at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire]?
Speaker 2: So, at Dartmouth I was doing research on using the squid axon.  I was interested in the question of what we call axonal transport.  Nerve cells have very long fibers.  As you know, you have a sciatic nerve that runs from the base of your back down to your foot.  And the cell, the part of the cell that contains the nucleus is located in the base of the spine, but it's producing materials that have to be transported down to the tip of the foot.  So, our question is, what is the mechanism by which what we call vesicles, or organelles, are transported from one part of the cell to another?  And that's the research that I was doing.  And I was using the squid preparation because it is much easier to use than using mammalian tissue, like a mouse or a rat.  And what we were able to do is to take material that is the cytoplasm, what we call axoplasm, out of the cell so that we could remove the membrane around the tissue and look at it directly with the microscope.  And what we discovered on the basis of that, is that particles inside of the cell were moving on two different kinds of filaments, on microtubules and actin filaments, and they could switch from one to the other.  And this was a new discovery, because at the time the thinking was that particles could move on only one, on the microtubules, and they couldn't move on the actin filaments.  But we had firm demonstration that they could move on both.  And so, that was the major, my major discovery that we published in 'Nature' [scientific journal] in 1992.  And I've gone on to discover the proteins that are involved in that process, the myosins that are involved and how they are regulated.
Story_ID: 22750
Speaker 1: Now, you and your colleagues working on this project were following the work begun by the late Robert D. Allen, who you mentioned a little while ago.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: This was an important mentor of yours.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about, some more about Robert D. Allen.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Robert Allen, was also one of the investigators who worked at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole [Massachusetts].  And he along with my former mentor, Shinya Inoue, were developing this new technology called video microscopy.  And video microscopy was the first time that biologists had used a video camera attached to a microscope to visualize what was happening inside of cells.  And because of the properties of the video camera, you can actually isolate this small range of gray levels in a cell to detect structures that are below the resolution of the light microscope.  And this is an extraordinary finding, and Bob Allen was one of the first to do it.  And Shinya was doing it independently, so both of them came up with video microscopy as a new technique.  And, Bob Allen invited me to begin working with him, because he was at the time working with the squid giant axon preparation, and I had expertise in electron microscopy at the time.  And so, we began this very close collaboration.  And he served, as I said, as a very important mentor and collaborator because he encouraged me to work with him.   And I continued that work even after he died prematurely, and you know, we were able to continue and make the discovery later, on the motility on actin filaments.
Story_ID: 22751
Speaker 1: Is there any part of the human body that mirrors the giant squid's giant axon?
Speaker 2: Yes, so the processes that we discovered in the squid giant axon, apply for human cells.  So, we know that the same process is going on in our bodies right now.  So, the same proteins--there are slight differences in how these proteins work and their composition, but it is--what we find in the axon of the squid, applies to human cells.
Speaker 1: What's the most exciting aspect of this study of these axons?
Speaker 2: Well, what we ultimately want to understand is the cellular basis of learning and memory.  And so, what these studies allow us to do is to understand better how nerve cells communicate with each other and how information is stored in those cells.  So, ultimately as we begin to understand this process better, we should be able to understand what happens when diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease occur, where you have these neuro-degenerative processes that cause nerve cells to lose their function.  So, there are real applications to our whole concept of information storage in the brain, the whole process of learning, of memory, and as well as how we forget.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.   Now, so this is okay.  So, then you all really discovered a new way that cells are able to move?
Speaker 2: That's right, we discovered a new way by which particles move inside of cells.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because at the time before we did this work, there was no demonstration that particles moved on actin filaments.  It was thought to be just on microtubules.  And the thinking of the day, if you were to go to a textbook it would say that in plants--vesicles move on actin filaments.  In animals, they move on microtubules.  And these are two separate systems.  And we were able to show that those systems operate in animal cells and that particles can jump from one to the other.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: So I would say it was a very significant development in the field at the time.
Story_ID: 22752
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in 1998 you were appointed to the National Science Board by President [Bill] Clinton.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Yeah, that was a very important appointment.  I was very, very delighted to be selected for that position.  The National Science Board is the governing board of the National Science Foundation [NSF].  The recommendations come in from many different quarters, but I think I was supported by the National Academy of Sciences [NAS].  Bruce Alberts was the president of the academy at the time and he had put my name forward.  So, I was very pleased to be selected for that position.  It was an extraordinary experience of serving with some of the best minds in the country. Warren Washington [also a HistoryMaker] was on the board at the time and he became the chair of the board.  So, it was great having the opportunity to both get to know him as a scientist and as an individual, and as a leader of the National Science Board.
Speaker 1: Just for the record, explain who Warren Washington is.
Speaker 2: Warren Washington is a scientist at this national laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. It was the National Atmospheric Laboratory [National Center for Atmospheric Research, NCAR].  And he was one of the earliest scientists to understand the mechanisms of earthquakes, I do believe.  So he's a very highly regarded African American scientist who spent most of his time as I said, in Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22753
Speaker 1: [In] '99 [1999], you served as vice chair of the National Science--, I'm sorry, the National Science Board's National Workforce Task Force Sub-Committee.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: What is that, now?
Speaker 2: So, the chair of the board at the time, Eamon (ph., unclear) [M. Kelly], wanted to address this issue of the lack of students going into the sciences.  And so, he put together a task force of the board to really look at this issue.  And so, for a year we actually studied the trends for students going into the sciences.  And, you know, it was really frightening what we observed, you know.  The data showed that we were still under-producing students in the sciences. We were doing better in the biological sciences but the numbers were very, very, small in physics and they were pretty miserable in chemistry and really bad in engineering.  And so, the board put together a strong set of recommendations on how we could increase the number of students, the domestic students, who were majoring in the sciences.  This is an ongoing problem, we haven't solved it.  But the board was really on top of it way back there in '98 [1998], '99 [1999] to try to address that issue.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now in 2000 you were nominated by President [Bill] Clinton for a second six-year term on the National Science Board, and you then subsequently served in 2002, you served as chair of the National Science Board Education and Human Resources Committee.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So, the board had several standing committees.  And one of the standing committees was the Committee on the Education and Human Resources Directive.  And so, this was a very important assignment as well, because this was the committee that oversaw all of the program activities at the NSF [National Science Foundation] that were designed to increase the pipeline.  You know, programs that were designed to increase the quality of training in the public schools in K-12 [kindergarten through twelfth grade] as well as curriculum changes within the universities.  And so, this, the committee was in charge of oversight of all of those grant programs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How closely did you work with Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson?  You know, she was in charge of the science committee.
Speaker 2: That's right, yes.  I got to attend several workshops that she organized to deal with this question.  And she was a very, very strong supporter of the National Science Foundation and the programs that it had designed to increase students in the sciences.  So, she was considered one of our strongest champions on the [Capitol] Hill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22754
Speaker 1: Now, in 2005 you became the dean at the University of Massachusetts [Amherst, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: That's right.  So, I had been at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire] for fifteen years and it was really the most productive period of my scientific career.  It was the time when I had really reached national prominence, being selected by President [Bill] Clinton to serve on the National Science Board, and through that experience on the National Science Board, I had gained a lot of experience about, you know, the broad fields of science.  And I felt that I could make a bigger contribution to science, building large programs, than in my individual research laboratory.  And so, when the opportunity, when I was called by the University of Massachusetts to interview for the position of dean of the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, I decided to take that opportunity.  So it really was a transition for me.  I was going from being a professor with a research laboratory into an administrative position, but I felt I really had something to contribute--to build programs, especially the integration across the sciences, as well as the idea of translation of moving basic science to the marketplace, that is innovation, new discoveries of products and procedures.  So, that's really what attracted me to the position at the University of Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were there for three years, right?  And what are some of the highlights of your stay there?
Speaker 2: So, when I was there I developed several new initiatives within the college.  I was very, very interested in renewable energy.  So, the University of Massachusetts has a very strong group of scientists who are studying the different forms of renewable energy: solar energy, wind, and geothermal energy as well as bio-mass conversion and bio-energy.  And so, I worked with the faculty to develop a new set of initiatives that were supported by Governor Duval Patrick.  So, I was very, very pleased to have the opportunity to work with him on that initiative.  We had that one, as well as stem cells and regenerative medicine.  Again, a strong support from the governor, who was very interested in building up the biotech industry in the state of Massachusetts.  So, I feel that those were the two majors areas that I made contributions while dean at UMass Amherst.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22755
Speaker 1: In 2008, you were hired to work as Dean of [the College of] Arts and Sciences at Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York], where we are today.  How did that take place?
Speaker 2: Right.  So, at the University of Massachusetts [Amherst, Massachusetts], one of the disappointments that I had is that the sciences and the humanities were divided into separate colleges.  And I always felt that it was very important for scientists and humanists to work collaboratively, because I think there's a lot of synergistic energy between the two areas of study.  And so, when the opportunity at Syracuse came open, I was invited to apply for this position, and I realized that it was going to be closer to what I had hoped I would find at UMass, and that is a college of arts and sciences that includes the humanities, the social sciences and the sciences.  So, that was the primary attraction of the position at Syracuse University.  I also, at UMass there was a change in leadership.  The chancellor was leaving to go to another position and a new chancellor had been, was being hired.  I was there during the transition year.  Tom Cole, who was the interim chancellor is an African American man who is president of the Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  So, it was a great opportunity to work with him.  But he was there on an interim basis and they were hiring a new chancellor of the university.  And because of the change in leadership, you know, I felt that I knew it would be some time before, you know, things would stabilize again, and it was a good opportunity to move.  And Syracuse had a very dynamic leader, Nancy Cantor and, you know, she was trying to a lot of the things that I had been working on anyway.  So, it was a very good fit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what have been the highlights of your stay here at Syracuse?
Speaker 2: So, since I've been here, again, I've continued to try to build programs that spanned the disciplines in the sciences but also connect the sciences with the humanities.  And so, here we have three big initiatives that we're pushing at the moment.  One is in clean water.  We have an excellent group of scientists here who study hydrology and different aspects of what are sources of water and water contamination.  So, we have a wonderful program there.  We also have a program in the digital humanities, how digital technology is affecting the disciplines in the humanities as well as our own human experience.  And the other area that I'm working on is forensic and national security science.  We are in an era when national security remains a burning issue.  We have to develop better scientific techniques to promote national security.  And so, that's what we're working--to forge forensics and national security in the science discipline.  So, this is really a science-based program to develop technologies for detecting terrorist threats and for identifying information that's found at crime scenes.  So, those are the major areas, but I'm also developing our neuroscience program here.  I've just hired new faculty who are building neuroscience as an area in collaboration with the [State University of New York] Upstate Medical University.  So, I'm very excited about that development.
Story_ID: 22756
Speaker 1: Is there a major project that you'd like to complete here before you leave Syracuse [University, Syracuse, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, on a personal level I want to, I still have an active research program, so I'm still hoping that I can continue to make reasonable contributions to science.  We have a study right now of looking at how yeast infections affect skin cells.  For example, this is a problem with a lot of the elderly as well as individuals with HIV AIDS.  They get yeast infections, and these can be very, very difficult to treat.  So we're doing some-a research project on how these toxins, or virulence factors that are sec-created by the yeast affect skin, and how these cells are able to penetrate and ultimately infect the skin of the body.  So, that--but I also want, you know, to continue to build strong relationships between the sciences and the humanities.   And so, I'd like to see the projects that I've started mature to a stronger level, so that when I have completed my tenure as dean, they will continue to be thriving programs at the university.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in terms of arts and science.  Are there collaborative projects between the humanities and the sciences right now?
Speaker 2: There are, there are.  And I can think of a few of them.  In our philosophy department, ethics is a very important subject.  So, we have ethics of research, you know.  Ethics--biological sciences ethics, you know, all of the ethics around stem cells and regenerative medicine.  Because now, you know, we hope we will be able to grow tissues in a dish and that we will be able to replace aging organs with tissues that we're developing.  And there are a whole kind, there are all sorts of ethical issues that are involved with those kinds of new developments, new technologies.  So, there's a strong relationship between our philosophers, our ethicists, as well as our scientists.  And then there are other areas, too.  As I mentioned, you know, digital technology:  there are scientists who are developing new technologies and new sensors, but there are all kinds of ethical issues that you have to deal with when you have ways to monitor the activity of individuals.  You know, we can now monitor every keystroke that a student performs over the course of a day.  And the question is how one uses that information in a positive way, you know, to provide better services to students, but at the same time not invade their privacy.  And then there's the whole concept of singularity.  You may have heard of this concept where, you know, digital devices will eventually merge with the brain so that we can communicate directly between the two without an interface.  And, you know, is this going to change our humanity?  You know, what becomes device and what becomes the individual?  So, getting scientists and humanists to work across these kinds of issues are very, very important.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: You hear so much talk now with the unemployment being so high, about the need just to teach technological skill and (unclear) in colleges especially that are state-funded, and that sort of thing, and to disperse with teaching about humanities as if it's so much fluff (unclear) or something.  What are your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: You know, we have, we have a new initiative that we are developing called cyber-literacy and emerging pedagogies.  We realize that students are now coming into the institution with a whole different skill-set in terms of accessing information, you know.  I have a two year old grandson who understands how to access information on the iPhone [Apple, Inc. device], you know.  He can bring up Sesame Street (laughter) or he can find, you know, his favorite song that he likes to listen to.  And this is at the age of two.  And so, these kids are growing up with smart devices.  And so, we are admitting students now who've gone through a couple of generations of these devices, and they have a certain literacy about these devices that a lot of our more senior faculty did not grow up with.  And I think it's important to tap into that so that we can deliver content in a different way today.  So, I'm not sure you're going to see the straight lecture format as often as was true when we went to college.  You know, we have different ways now of using these devices to deliver content to students.  And I think it's going to really have a major impact on the way in which materials are now delivered to incoming students.  And I think that's a good thing.  I think students are going to be smarter.  You know, we sort of think about--now if you ask someone a question, the first thing they do is to Google it to find out, you know, what is it.  And you think this may be making us dumber, but you know, it's really a way of making sure that we can access, we have access to a much broader range of information than we had in the past.  So that's really smart.  You know, that's not dumb.  So, I see this as having a huge impact and a very positive impact on universities and how we deliver content to our students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22758
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, my hopes are that the African American community will really reach the point where there is the full sense of citizenship in this country.  This is one of--in my own life this is the one of the major breakthroughs that I felt that I had when I went abroad.  I spent time in Germany and France and Italy, and the interesting part of that experience was that when I was in Germany--a person that is in this country would be called white.  In Germany, it was German.  And I wasn't called black, I was called an American.  And so, it was having to go out of the country to realize that I am American--it was not something that I ever felt when I was in this country, you know.  And so, my hope is that we will reach that point as a community, that the black community will have that sense of full citizenship that, you know, I am every culture that was born in America and I am an authentic American, and I think President [Barack] Obama has expressed this in many ways.  I wish he could have found a way to make this a part of his agenda, but I'm hoping at some point that the black community will reach that point, that that's who we are.  And, you know, it's an important part of one's own psyche, this is where I belong.  My fears are that-- we still have the economic inequality in the country and that it's disproportionately affecting the black community.  And I think this--the perpetuation of that inequality is going to make it harder and harder for minority kids to reach their potential.  So, how do we crack this huge problem of, you know, of hollowing out the middle and increasing the amount of very wealthy individuals, and trapping a large segment of the population in the low income area?  And just how do we help blacks, kids especially, who are sort of caught up in that, in that situation?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22759
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  When you look back on everything you've done to this point in life, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope that my legacy includes two things.  One, that I built a very strong scientific career that allowed me to make original contributions to the scientific literature.  And that I was able to stand on the shoulders of giants like Ernest Everett Just [African American developmental biologist] and move to the next level, you know, that I was able to accomplish something that he wasn't able to do because of the discrimination at the time.  And I feel proud that I was able to, to advance the position of African American scientists by working at major research universities and being a contributing member of the faculty.  So, that's on the science side.  But I also hope that I have made real contributions to advancing the career of other minority scientists, you know, through the programs that I worked with: the Minority Affairs Committee of the American Society for Cell Biology, the Ernest Everett Just program for undergraduate students at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire], the work that I did through the National Science Board, and the things that I'm doing now as an administrator, you know, as the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences [at Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York].  So, I do hope that those things will leave an impact on the institutions and the individuals that I've worked with over the years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22760
Speaker 1: And likewise, when you look over what you've done so far, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, there are some things that I would do differently.  In hindsight, you know, it's easy to see, you know, some of the opportunities missed.  I don't think I appreciated how important entrepreneurship was as a developing scientist.  As a scientist you run a laboratory which is like a small, a small independent operation.  And you have to be very entrepreneurial in terms of garnering resources to keep the lab functioning, of moving your ideas along, you know, from inception to completion.  And I wish I had developed stronger skills in this whole area of entrepreneurship.  I just wasn't attuned to it as I was coming through.  I was very interested in what contributions I was making, but I wasn't thinking of all of the elements in the process of getting it started, funding it and moving it to the next level.  So, that would be something, you know.  My advice to young people is that it's not only important to be a good scientist, you have to be an entrepreneur as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What advice would you give young people, you know, pursuing the STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] sciences now?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the pieces of advice is that there is room for optimism that things really have changed a lot, but on the other hand, it is still incumbent upon you as an individual to understand the fine points of racial discrimination and racial bias and the other kinds of biases that exist, and come up with good strategies for handling those situations.  It still puts the onus on you, you know, the victim, as we sort of think of this issue.  But nevertheless I think it empowers you when you know about these things, and it gives you the upper hand in trying to control some of the situations.  So, I would say, you know, stay attuned to the kinds of research that's going on that is addressing these issues.  And you really do have to avail yourself of the information and make sure you're not caught short, you know, when it comes to understanding what could be potential roadblocks as you move through your career.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22761
Speaker 1: Now, could you tell us about your family?  You mentioned grandson and you mentioned grandchildren, but how many children do you have, and--
Speaker 2: I have three children.  I have two boys and a girl.  My kids went through elementary school and mostly high school in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, so they consider themselves from Chapel Hill.  But then I moved to Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire] and my daughter and my younger son actually graduated from the Hanover High School in Hanover, New Hampshire.  They all spent the summers with us, and we're told that the Marine Biological Laboratory [Woods Hole, Massachusetts] and the village we're told, has this wonderful program called Science School where all of the kids can go to take science courses from the age of seven until they are fourteen.  And so, my kids all went through Science School.  And I was fully expecting that they would all go into the sciences, and they all went into the arts, of course. (laughter)  So, I did not get one scientist out of the bunch.  My older son [George Langford] was in music, my daughter [Joy Langford] was in dance, and my younger son [Grant Langford] is a jazz musician.  And he's the one who's actually made a career of his art.  He is a member of the Airmen of Note, which is the premier jazz band of the [U.S.] Air Force.  My daughter is completing her degree, a Ph.D. in educational philosophy, educational policies, sorry.  And my older son works as a facilities manager at Northwestern Law School in Chicago [Illinois].  I have seven grandchildren.  My oldest son has three; my daughter, two; and my younger son, two.  And we all got together this summer on the Cape for a few fun days of having all the grandchildren together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your wife [Sylvia Tyler Langford], does she still, now she's an administrator at Dartmouth [College]?
Speaker 2: That's right.  My wife is an associate vice president for student affairs here at Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York].
Speaker 1: Oh, Syracuse, she's here, alright.
Speaker 2: Right.  And she's, she's been in student affairs since Dartmouth.  She was their dean of the upper class students and then at UMass [University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts] she was the assistant to the vice chancellor for student affairs.  So, her area is student programs, and she has several programs including career counseling.  She oversees the sororities and fraternities and several other student programs on campus.

Speaker 1: You said that being at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire] like really kind of opened your eyes to what was going on in the liberal arts and humanities?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your colleagues there that--I guess that--
Speaker 2: Right.  I would say it was the, the dean of the college, the dean of the faculty at Dartmouth when I was there, who was Jim Wright.  And Jim Wright was a strong supporter.  He was an historian by training, became dean of the college, and really encouraged my interaction with faculty outside of the sciences.  There was a professor in the English department, Don Pease, who helped me to organize the conference that I had on whiteness and white privilege.  I got to co-teach a course with a professor in the English department, Professor Marty Favor, and we taught it on scientific, what is it called, sci-fis--science fiction novels--and we talked a little bit about resistance and the use of science as a way to justify some of the ideas that people had about blacks and other minorities.  So, those were some.  But I had pretty close interactions with quite a few faculty at Dartmouth and other departments.  I sat on a fair number of committees, you know, search committees, and other university committees including the promotion and tenure committee.  And in those settings I got to interact with humanist social scientists as well as scientists.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  I thought I'd ask that because I didn't pursue that and it gnawed at me (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 22763
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, well, I definitely would like to be remembered for the major contribution that I feel that I-- my primary contribution to the field of cell biology.  And that is the work on the cellular skeleton and this model that we developed of dual filaments.  So, I'm hoping that, you know, that will be a contribution that I will be remembered for.  But in addition, I think I've had to find ways to exist in pretty difficult environments.  And it may appear on the surface as though I'm very soft-spoken, but I hope I can be remembered as someone who was very determined, who has pursued a career in spite of factors that may have been serious roadblocks, and did trip up a lot of people.  I mean, there were quite a few blacks who started out with me, and not all of us have been able to get through a lot of the issues that arose.  So, I hope I can be remembered for being able to figure out ways to get around some of those issues.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Okay.
