Story_ID: 217764
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to explore your family background.  Could you please tell me about your mother?  What was her name and where was she born?
Speaker 2: Her name is Mamie Fuse Delaney.  She was born in Montgomery, Alabama.
Speaker 1: And what do you know about her background and her growing up?
Speaker 2: Not too much.  She was an only child of a mother who was an only child.  My grand- her mother was an only child.  She was an only child, meaning there--she had few people in her family.  I didn't have any aunts and uncles on her side.  She finished high school in Montgomery, and she and my father [John Paul Delaney] got married within the next year.  She pursued numerous vocations throughout her life; nursing, insurance salesperson; but mainly housewife and parent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How would you describe your mother?  Did she share any stories with you growing up?
Speaker 2: We were not a very communicative family.  My father was very quiet.  My mother was a little more vocal, but there was six of us children.  I was the oldest, and it came one, two three, four, five, six, behind each other.  So, there was little time for play, chitchat, before she was having another baby and raising six children.  So we, you know, we weren't close in that regard.
Story_ID: 217765
Speaker 1: Could you please tell me about your father?  What was his name and where was he born?
Speaker 2: His name was John Paul Delaney.  He was born in Montgomery [Alabama] as well.  He was professionally a carpenter.  Eventually he became a contractor as was his father [Paul Delaney], who was a contractor.  And he was from a family of four children.  So I had aunts, uncles, first cousins, et cetera, on my father's side.  And he was, as I mentioned, we weren't that close.  Again, he was a very quiet man.  We didn't do, you know, the conventional things like sports and all.  He was not an athlete.  And so, we didn't have an extremely close relationship either.
Speaker 1: What do you know about his background growing up?
Speaker 2: Very little.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he share any stories with you that you can recall?
Speaker 2: Well, one thing I remember from his background, he was--he came to adulthood during the [Great] Depression and on through the Depression.  And he became--he was very conservative with money, for example.  And as we were growing up, everything he bought, he insisted on paying for it in cash, no credit.  So we had to wait to get a refrigerator, wait to get a car, until he had the money to pay for it.  And that affected me, and I'm just the opposite.  I love credit (laughter).  And I'm not afraid to take the risk of credit, but he was.  And I think my being that way is in direct reaction to the way he was.
Story_ID: 217766
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Just to my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what were your grandparents' names?  You can start by telling me on your maternal side.
Speaker 2: My grandmother, I do not know her maiden name.  In fact, I think she was the product possibly of a, if not a slave owner, a family member of a slave owner.  She was very light skinned, obviously with a little African mixed up in there.  And she grew up in rural Alabama somewhere around Montgomery [Alabama] about her family and, otherwise, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: And her husband?
Speaker 2: John Paul Delaney.  Well, actually, his name was Paul Delaney.  And as I said, he was a carpenter in Montgomery.  He was responsible for a lot of construction in Montgomery and around Montgomery, including a couple of places that bear his name today, at the church that became headquarters of civil rights rallies during the [Civil Rights] Movement, when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]--Holt Street Baptist Church [Montgomery, Alabama] was founded by my grandparents.  And my grandfather built the education building, he and another contractor, and their names are on that building today as--well, as the builders of that structure.
Speaker 1: And in the instance of the paternal side of your family, what were your grandparents' names, on your paternal side?
Speaker 2: It was called Paul Delaney; my grandfather's name and my father, John Paul Delaney.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, I know what I did.  I was asking you about--so just now you were telling me the maternal.  And then there was the paternal.
Speaker 2: The paternal, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But see, I was describing what he did.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And so, your grandparents are the furthest that you can trace back your origins.  Do you know if they were slaves or free?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't.  It appears that they were born either just after slavery, either at the end of slavery or immediately afterwards.  My grandfather, as I mentioned, my grandmother, who was, obviously had white blood in her, and my grandfather, obviously, had Indian [Native American] blood in him.  So he was--had Indian features.  So somehow, I don't know; other than that, I have no knowledge of their background.
Speaker 1: Were there any stories, legends or songs that had been passed down through your family that you'd like to share?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I mentioned, we were not a very communicative family.
Story_ID: 217767
Speaker 1: Could you please share with me the names of your siblings in birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: I was the oldest of six children; second born was William Delaney, who drowned when he was twelve years old; next was Alfred [Delaney]; then--I'm sorry.  I'm giving you the boys.  You want the order.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The order.  First, I was the firstborn; next was--then two girls followed, Dorothy Jean [Delaney] and Pauline [Delaney]; then William, who I mentioned drowned; then Alfred; and the baby was Richard [Delaney].
Story_ID: 217768
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, living around Montgomery [Alabama].  One thing, I put it together later, I used to go--my grandfather [Paul Delaney] used to take me to the woods where he would cut leaves and roots, and I would help him.  And I did not know and discovered only years later from my first cousin, that in the community he was the herbalist; he was a doctor.  And he would get these roots and herbs and make medicine for the people in the community, besides being a carpenter.  And I remember going on many excursions to the outskirts of Montgomery looking for whatever particular leaves and herbs and roots that he wanted and helping him bring them back to the house.  When I was a kid, I didn't know what he did with that.  And then later, my cousin told me exactly what he did with it.
Story_ID: 217769
Speaker 1: Could you please share some other memories with us?  Perhaps you could describe what family life was like, holidays, special events or just day-to-day living?
Speaker 2: Well, one thing we were close, the family, we had meals together growing up the children.  And there was--I remember my mother [Mamie Fuse Delaney] daily--she must have gotten up at five in the morning, because by seven, there was a fully-cooked meal for the family, for breakfast.  And we all ate together at breakfast and later in the day in the evening there was the family dinner.  And this, you know, the family dinner (unclear) and it was especially the Sunday dinner was especially important, and we ate together daily.  I remember that especially for years up until my (unclear) left early teen.  We were also required to go to church every Sunday until when I was the first one to reach, oh, thirteen or so.  And then it was my choice on whether I was required to go.  And as each child, say, turned thirteen, he and she made the decision on them to go to church on Sunday if they want to.  In that way, we were a close-knit good family.  Dinners were something that held us together.  And to my--well, I feel that, and this was because of the demands of urbanization, the pressures--well, we grew up and found other interests.  And the family dinner went, and I think that kind of led to the dispersal of the family, and we eventually.  And eventually (unclear) and we moved to Ohio to Cleveland [Ohio] where there was further dispersal.  And, again, I think that was part of each of us reaching maturity, adulthood and kind of the breaking of the family.
Speaker 1: What street did you live on when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I lived on Leola Street in Montgomery.
Speaker 1: And do you remember the exact number?
Speaker 2: Eleven, it was.
Speaker 1: And can you describe your block, your neighbors or your community?
Speaker 2: It was a very close-knit community.  I used to walk to the butcher shop almost daily to get meats.  And we shopped for groceries every Saturday.  In every direction, east, west, north, south in the neighborhood, everybody knew everybody.  I could not walk two blocks away from home without every neighbor knowing who I was and vice-versa.  So we were in that respect just a close-knit community.
Story_ID: 217770
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up [in Montgomery, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: The main avenue through the community, there were restaurants, juke joints, stores; that I remember it as being a very lively street.  It was great.  I used to, as a young, as a kid, peek into the juke joints to watch people who danced and to listen to the sounds of music coming out.  I loved that.  I remember the smell of cooking on that street and in the neighborhood; the, well the people who, the neighbors going to work, knowing all of them.
Story_ID: 217771
Speaker 1: Do you have any other memories of growing up or what it was like growing up that you'd like share?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a lot of close friends.  I was kind of--I was short and slight.  I weighted probably a hundred pounds as a kid, but I was real popular and got along well with all of my schoolmates and friends and had a lot of close friends.  And I remember that, in looking back, having kind of nurtured my dreams, ambition and what I eventually became.  And at one point after, as a teen--at seventeen I left Cleveland [Ohio]--I had left Montgomery [Alabama] behind and went to Cleveland, where I found a lot of the same thing, close-knit community and a lot of support from friends, relatives that I remember well.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Loveless Elementary School [Montgomery, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Were any teachers there that influenced you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Especially the English teachers.  That's how I went into writing and journalism.  I was influenced by my English teachers and by my science teachers.  Even though I was--never considered myself good in science, I was still influenced by my science teachers.  You know, I did not say math teachers.  I was terrible at math.  Therefore, I didn't particularly care for the math, geometry and algebra.
Speaker 1: Do you recall the names of those teachers who were influential?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Mrs. Hardy [ph.] was a science teacher; Mrs. Fritz [ph.] taught biology; Mrs. Hardy taught physics; Mr. Lowe [ph.] taught English; Mrs. Kennedy [ph.] taught English and history.
Speaker 1: And what kind of student were you early on?  Were you well-mannered or rambunctious?
Speaker 2: I was well-mannered.  I was quiet in the classroom, and studious.  I'm not a troublemaker at all.  I didn't like being punished even at home.  I was the nice kid, because I just didn't enjoy being punished.  So I was not--and, again, I was--in high school I was a leader, and I was on the student council; vice-president of the student council.  So I wasn't that quiet and shy.  And, again, I was popular, so, but I was not the hell raiser (laughs) or the troublemaker or the problem child.
Speaker 1: Did you go from elementary school to middle school or to high school?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I went to high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The way the structure was at that time.
Speaker 1: So when you were transitioning from elementary to high school, do you recall if there were any teachers that influenced you when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, those were high school teachers, I'm sorry, that I was naming.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those were high school.  Going back to elementary school, I don't remember too many who shaped me that early.  And I can't even remember their names.  I'm sorry.  I was--I gave you the names of my high school influences.  But elementary, I can't--there was one, Mrs. Langford [ph.], who was an English teacher.  But other than Mrs. Langford, I don't remember too many in elementary.
Story_ID: 217772
Speaker 1: Did she [elementary school English teacher, Mrs. Langford (ph.)] influence you, you think at all, as it relates to deciding to go into journalism?
Speaker 2: Well, from--I cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else other than write.  I didn't think-- I didn't want to go-- I didn't want to be a lawyer.  I didn't want to be a doctor.  I just wanted to be a writer.  And I don't know if any one teacher influenced me.  And I really cannot put my finger on where that ambition emanated.
Speaker 1: What were your dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: They were, in looking back, kind of limited.  That is, they were not major.  There was a song when I was a boy growing up called 'Far Away Places.'  And the words went, "Going to China or maybe Siam, I want to see for myself those faraway places I keep [sic. I've been] reading about in a book that I took from the shelf."  When I dreamed about travel and going to those faraway places, I didn't think that I would go there.  And I--in my dreams I wanted to write about them.  And eventually I became a foreign correspondent; for example, I did go to those faraway places.  But that one song and that one ambition kind of was the driving force.  So, yes, that was the thing.  I know that was--that occurred and influenced me, my life.
Speaker 1: And what do you think was impacting you as it related to your dreams and aspirations?  Did you know very early on precisely what you wanted to be or had you had earlier ambitions of being something else?
Speaker 2: No.  I never had any ambition of being anything other than a writer.  Now, again, my foresight was limited.  I never thought I'd, for example, end up going to the New York Times.  I never--I dreamed of traveling, but I never really thought it would happen, that I would get to Europe and the Caribbean and just about every big city in America.
Speaker 1: Who was influencing you as a young person? Who were the voices that you were listening to as you were beginning to come into your own?
Speaker 2: I read a lot of--I started reading a lot, and I read a lot of--and I would take it, my reading, other than schoolwork, that is, and, of course, with schoolwork, the English writers, because we took English literature, and I read everybody, of course, on assignment, from [Geoffrey] Chaucer up to [William] Wordsworth, [William] Shakespeare, et cetera.  And I then read a lot of American literature, writers.  And then on my own I started taking certain categories; for example, at one phase, I used--I've read as much French--as many French authors as I could; poetry as well as fiction.  Then I read the Russian writers.  And I went and did things like that for long periods of time.  I read everything by [Raymond] Roussel, for example, and various writers.  And then I took French in college, and I started reading French literature in French at one point.
Story_ID: 217773
Speaker 1: At that time, I'd also like to know, how else were you spending your time?  Were you involved in any other extracurricular activities or was your focus on your writing?
Speaker 2: In high school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, as I mentioned, I was not athletic, so I didn't participate in sports other than junior varsity sports; I played junior varsity basketball.  But, otherwise, it was more of reading, writing, and 'rithmatic.  I didn't--I did a little bit work.  I worked, for example, in this dead end program.  I worked in a photo studio in my growing up, where I didn't learn to take pictures, but I worked the laboratory.  I was a, like, the process film, for example, and enlarge--it was a photo studio where I worked that got me interested in photography.  And in school I did start a photography club.
Speaker 1: Where--what is the name of the church, again, that your family attended?
Speaker 2: Holt, H-O-L-T.  Holt Street Baptist Church [Montgomery, Alabama].
Speaker 1: And was that a source of cohesion for your family on Sundays?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was a--since the family founder was one of the fourth founding families; so we were very intricately tied to that church.
Story_ID: 217774
Speaker 1: So at this point, you are maturing, you're in high school and you're beginning to understand what you'd like to be.  From there where do you go?
Speaker 2: Well, college was next.  And when I was getting ready to go to college, and as I mentioned, I wanted to be a writer and I had to make a decision on what I would major in.  I did not--I wanted to major in literature or English.  But that meant as a career teaching.  I didn't want to be a teacher.  And also it meant a lot of schooling.  I didn't want to become a Ph.D. (laughter).  So I decided to major in journalism knowing that I would write and I--which I'll always have a job.
Speaker 1: So when you were graduated from high school, your matriculation--and matriculating to college, where did you go?
Speaker 2: Well, I started--I graduated high school in Montgomery [Alabama], and I started college locally at Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama].  And there I did major in English and literature for a year, and then--but I didn't go back, so.  We had moved had moved to Cleveland [Ohio] by then, by the end of my first year.
Speaker 1: Did you continue your formal studies or was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I went to [The] Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your major at Ohio State?
Speaker 2: Journalism.
Speaker 1: And what kind of student were you as an emerging journalist?
Speaker 2: It was a good J-schools dynamic.  And I learned a lot from my professors and my fellow students.  But now, there's another gap.  When I left Montgomery, we moved to Cleveland.  At that time there was the draft, something called the [U.S.] military draft.  And I was not in college, so I was subjected to the draft and I as drafted after I moved to Cleveland, and I spent two years in the [U.S.] Army.  And that was my introduction to Europe, 'cause I was based in France, and that got me started on a lot of European history, my interest in Europe, and my--at one point I went back to--as a reporter for the New York Times, I went back to--and became the Madrid [Spain] bureau chief.  So that began my interest in overseas.  And I spent two years in the military and came back and then enrolled in Ohio State and became--and majored in journalism.
Speaker 1: So what was service in the military like at that time?
Speaker 2: It was easy.  Nothing to it.  There was no war, so, it was not a matter of fighting or fearing a fight or anything.  So it was easy assignment.  And going to France was more like a vacation than anything else.  You spent weekends in Paris [France], for example; and based in Bordeaux [France], and we'd go up to Paris on the weekends; go down to Spain for vacation.
Story_ID: 217775
Speaker 1: When we stopped, we were talking about your experiences at [The] Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you discuss a little bit more about what your experiences were like there?
Speaker 2: Well, that was a great experience.  The J-school [The Ohio State University School of Communication, public affairs journalism department, Columbus, Ohio] was very activist.  I was on the school paper, The Lantern, the daily Lantern, a daily paper where I started as a reporter and eventually became an editor; even became the sports editor my senior year; learning to be a journalist and being--we're talking about the mid-to-late '50s [1950s]--and trying to--and during a period of complacency in the country, and nowhere more so than Ohio, very complacent place, the state and the campus.  So we--the youths may be tried to shake up the campus; for example, we--there's one example, Woody Hayes, the great football coach, of course, had number one football teams during that period; but we, on the paper, the editor managing editor--and I was sports editor--deliberately chose to become anti-football.  So we wrote editorials and articles on--suggesting that they should sell the stadium and start paying the players pro salaries, that kind of thing.  And Woody Hayes once confronted the editor and pointed out that the football team made more money for the school than the journalism school, than the newspaper; so la-de-da.  But we did that kind of thing, kind of trying to get the university to get students off the dime and to do something, because before then, for example, in 1955, there was the Hungarian Revolution [of 1956]--was that '50 [1950]?  You know, I'm getting the--I'm reversing it.  In 1955, Autherine Lucy tried to integrate the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama], and, of course, was denied.  And there were barrels put around campus to raise money for her defense.  And the students threw garbage in and it made the black kids mad.  But the next year, 1956, was the Hungarian Revolution.  And so, people put up barrels around the campus to raise money for the Hungarian Revolution, but kids threw--used them for waste containers.  So tit for tat, at least the students were consistently not concerned with major issues of the day.  And we on the paper tried to change that, to no effect.  And, eventually, of course, the Civil Rights Movement started in the early '60s [1960s], leading to the antiwar movement in the later '60s [1960s], which got the campus off a dime.
Story_ID: 217776
Speaker 1: How were the relationships between the African American and white students on the campus [of The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] then?
Speaker 2: They--it was live and let live.  We were not very close; for example, we had separate--the school was integrated, lived in an integrated dorm; but I found out later I had, I had--while I was there, I had two white roommates, and the state had just passed a law restricting the use of photographs on applications; meaning the dorm councils--dorm officials see photographs, you are black, and they put the black students together in the room.  The state had just passed a--enacted a law that barred--tried to bar discrimination in housing on campus and no use of photos anymore.  But then, the dorm officials tried using names so they matched my name, [HistoryMaker Paul] Delaney, with the name from Cleveland [Ohio], the name of a Kennedy from Cleveland, thinking we were both Irish, and he was white, Ron Kennedy [ph.].  But what they did unbeknownst to me until later, they went to Ron Kennedy and asked him if he were okay having a black roommate.  If he'd say, "No, I'm not okay," they would transfer.  Ron said he was okay.  We were roommates for a year.  But we knew of other whites students who opted out and did not want a black roommate.  But that's how they continued (unclear).  So we had separate dances; for example, I never ever went to a homecoming dance, because the featured attraction--usually, the dance, the band was usually a country-western band that most black students were not going to go and dance to Tammy Wynette, somebody that like.  So we did not participate in a lot of activities, and there was no or little effort to kind of bring us together and cater to our wishes.  As long as we weren't rioting and at each other's throat, it was--as I said, it was live and let live.  The campus officials would say, "Okay.  Fine," thinking everything was going smooth.  But, since we weren't fighting each other--but, if that was not the case, it was a lot of tension as there is now.  But we kind of just lived and let live at that time.
Speaker 1: Did you have any encounters where you thought that you'd been discriminated against or had been treated prejudicially related to your school work or (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The best example, when I became sports editor of the school paper [The Lantern], the sports editor of the downtown paper, the Ohio Dispatch [sic. The Columbus Evening Dispatch; The Columbus Dispatch] accused me, not to my face, but went to the head of the journalism school and accused and charged that I was giving more play, disproportionate play, to black football players, black athletes, than I was to whites.  And that teed us off, we went through, for example, a football season, and counted every story that featured black football players and white football players to disprove this charge.  And we did.  There was no question that more ink was devoted to white players than to black players.  But the idea of this guy making this charge, so, yeah, there was--that was a major instance of discrimination as far as I was concerned.
Story_ID: 217777
Speaker 1: What's the most memorable experience you had that was positive during your college [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] years?
Speaker 2: I think--I don't know, I don't think I was the first black sports editor, but I was sports editor, Ohio State used to be number one or two in the country, we used to go to the Rose Bowl.  And my senior year as sports editor, I went to the Rose Bowl and covered the Rose Bowl for the school paper [The Lantern].  That to me was--I thought it was terrific.  Another isn't a positive, positive, but when I graduated from J-school [The Ohio State University School of Communication, public affairs journalism department, Columbus, Ohio], there were fifteen graduates in the class.  I was the only black, and also as it turned out, I was the only one who did not go to work for a daily newspaper immediately, get a job on a daily newspaper.  I was turned down by most major papers in the country.  And so, all my colleagues, the other fourteen, each, every one of them, got a job on a daily newspaper somewhere in the country, most in Ohio.  But most newspapers just were not hiring, just for the old papers, but not hiring black reporters in 1958.
Speaker 1: So then what was next for you?
Speaker 2: I went to work for the Baltimore Afro-American [Afro-American Newspapers] in Baltimore [Maryland].  But it was a bad experience, and I stayed there for one summer and I quit and went back to Cleveland [Ohio] where I drove a cab for a year before coming to Atlanta [Georgia] to work for the Atlanta Daily World.
Speaker 1: Let's pause.  What made it a bad experience for you?
Speaker 2: Well, here, you know, you got this kid graduating from college, ready to set the world on fire, the world of journalism, the world to write all the ills out there.  And I was hired on the Afro-American's national desk.  And what that entailed was, rewriting stories from daily papers for the Afro.  But the worse part of it was--the worst part of the job was, I was sitting there making up letters to the editor based on some story that ran the last couple of weeks in the paper, like, "Dear"--I would make up a letter "Dear"--and the editor would tell me which stories I should make up a letter to react to, and he'd give it to me and I would make up a letter "Dear Editor.  That was a dynamic story on" blah, blah, blah.  And I'd fake a name, you know, Joe Brown, Fayetteville, North Carolina, or something like that.  Well, after a summer of that, I couldn't--you know, again, being idealistic and young, I couldn't do that.  So I moved back to Cleveland and drove yellow cab for a year.
Speaker 1: And from there you came to Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 2: I was--I had tried Atlanta Daily World when I was graduating.  But they didn't have anything, couldn't hire me.  A year later, I heard from them, this--in time, after driving a cab for a year.  And I was offered a job as a reporter, and I came to Atlanta in September 1959.
Story_ID: 217778
Speaker 1: And that was a very interesting time to enter the city [Atlanta, Georgia].  What was the climate like?  What are some of the things that were going on?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the first people I met, for example, was [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter[-Gault], who was living in Detroit [Michigan] going to Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan] while her lawsuit against the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] was on appeal.  And so we met during the winter of '57 [1957], '58 [1958], and became fast friends, good friends.  And, of course, she won her case against the University of Georgia, and she and Hamilton Holmes integrated.  But also, the most significant thing that happened was--okay.  I said '57 [1957], I meant '59 [1959].  I moved to Atlanta [Georgia] in September '59 [1959], the Civil Rights Movement started February 1st, 1960.  So I happened to be living in Atlanta being a reporter at the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement.  And that was a significant thing in my life.
Speaker 1: And so what were some of the other things that you recall in terms of the communities; the church community, certain neighborhoods.  What are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Here in Atlanta?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, Atlanta was dynamic.  It was--the mayor was William [B.] Hartsfield, and he--the Atlanta leaders, black and white, were trying to position Atlanta to become a major league professional town.  It had had no professional, as in sports activity at the time.  So they were trying to keep the lid on.  They didn't want--the students started--there were demonstrations in Atlanta, but it came a month and a half after the demonstrations on February 1st.  Elsewhere in the South, it was exploding.  But Atlanta wasn't exploding.  And the city leaders, black and white, fought furiously to keep Atlanta from exploding, because they didn't want Atlanta to get a bad image, because they were trying to get a football team, a pro baseball team.  And so, by that--in that regard, the--we was, you know, a give and take.  The city--when demonstrations started, the city did everything it could to stop them, including a secret compromise on integrating downtown; that is, opening up lunch counters; hiring blacks as clerks, cashiers in downtown department stores.  And it--eventually it happened.  And Atlanta was saved from kind of the horrors of Birmingham [Alabama], Albany [Georgia], Selma [Alabama], Montgomery [Alabama], Mississippi.  Atlanta never had that kind of violent reaction to the Movement, which positioned it to get--indeed, the attract businesses, major businesses, as well as pro football, pro sports teams.

Speaker 1: So in that first year that you're working for the Atlanta Daily World, what kinds of stories are you doing?
Speaker 2: The first year, it was kind of quiet.  I had--I did a lot of police coverage.  I had a little beat where I covered Grady [Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia]--Grady's Hospital, the black part.  It was segregated then.  And I'd go to spend, say, time in the emergency room.  The thing was very loose.  You could walk in, talk to the patients, talk to the nurses, talk to the guards, the doctors there.  And there was always something interesting happening in the emergency room, believe it or not.  And so I did that.  I did feature stories.  There was a suit to integrate the public schools in Georgia.  And the state had some hearings around--the government had some hearings around the state to listen to people on whether to integrate the schools or close them.  And I covered those hearings around the state.  So there was a lot of good activity going on.  And in the [Civil Rights] Movement, Atlanta [Georgia] became kind of, like, London [England] during World War II [WWII]; became the hub of activity, a beehive of activity.  Everybody who was coming south to demonstrate came through Atlanta.  Atlanta Daily World's office was two doors from the office of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].  SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], the student organization, was diagonally across the street.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was on Hunter Street, while all these other offices were on Auburn Avenue.  So Atlanta was just humming.  And every leader, anybody major or minor in the Civil Rights Movement, came through Atlanta, and then we all enacted in some way.  I was cover them and meeting them.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people within that first year that you met that are the most memorable for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, we started with, if we go to some of the student leaders, [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond was here; [HistoryMaker] John Lewis, [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, Lonnie [C.] King [Jr.], [HistoryMaker James] Jim Forman; the Ladners, [HistoryMaker] Joyce Ladner and her sister [HistoryMaker] Dorie Ladner; a whole slew of people.  As I mentioned, everyone Staughton Lynd, was Howard Zinn.  Just about everybody showed up in Atlanta.  And if they were going south to cover--to demonstrate, the kids I met, the youngsters, would--they'd be here.  Atlanta would be the staging area, but it also served as rest, R and R.  But when they've gone out and demonstrated and gotten beaten all over Georgia or Alabama, they'd come back to Atlanta for R and R.  And I'd get a chance to meet and talk and interview.
Speaker 1: What was Auburn Avenue like at that time?
Speaker 2: It was humming, because you had all--you had-[Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] moved his--moved SCLC here; and the first director of SCLC was Ella Baker.  It turned over to Ella Baker, who lived in my apartment building three doors down from me on the same floor.  And people--there were a lot of smart people.  You had the colleges here.  You had a lot of great professors who were advisors to the students; [M.] Carl Holman, [HistoryMaker Samuel] Sam DuBois Cook; just a whole number--just a number of people, adults who were involved in the movement.  We had all of this activity.  So Atlanta was a social, cultural, economic and intellectual hub of the Movement.
Story_ID: 217780
Speaker 1: How long did you stay with the Atlanta Daily World?
Speaker 2: I was with the World for two years before I was fired.
Speaker 1: Fired for what?
Speaker 2: I used to argue with C.A. Scott [Cornelius Adolphus Scott] everyday about our coverage of the [Civil Rights] Movement.  He was--the World was against the movement, and would editorialize and skew the coverage, and I used to fight through every day. And eventually I was fired.  And I knew I was going to be fired, but eventually I was fired.
Speaker 1: Structurally, who else was making decisions at the Atlanta Daily World at that time?
Speaker 2: C.A. Scott made--he was the editor, publisher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the buck stopped with him.  And he was thoroughly against the movement.
Speaker 1: And do you recall his explanation to you for being against the movement?
Speaker 2: Well, he, you know, I think he reflected the attitude of a whole lot of the older blacks in town, the older black (unclear).  One, they didn't want Atlanta [Georgia] to become a Birmingham [Alabama]; two, there were students who were leading this movement, and these students were a threat these guys, their leadership.  And they were losing control and they didn't want to do that.  So they were against the movement.  And they felt they would lose economically if things--if Atlanta got a bad image in the national press.  And so, they truly did not want these things to happen, did not want the demonstrations in Atlanta.  And they knew that if the movement continued, there would be that kind of stuff in Atlanta, which would challenge their leadership.  And eventually it did.
Story_ID: 217781
Speaker 1: And so after being fired [from Atlanta Daily World], where did you go?
Speaker 2: I was hired by the municipal court.  I became the first black probation officer with the municipal court.  So I worked for the court for a couple years before getting back into journalism.
Speaker 1: That was different.  So what were you doing in that particular--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was overseeing--I was counseling--mainly I was--it was adults.  There were adults who put on probation for minor charges of shoplifting, et cetera.  And most of those were youngsters, adults, from eighteen--between eighteen and twenty-one.  So I was supervising a caseload of kids mainly who--to keep them from going to jail.  They didn't--in those defenses and stuff like that.  And I just keep them and kind of reporting to me to make sure they were--they wouldn't get into any more trouble.  But I was supervising that kind of a caseload.
Speaker 1: So from there, you eventually...?
Speaker 2: I was hired by the Dayton Daily News, which was owned by the Cox Newspapers [Cox Media Group], which also owned, at the time, the Atlanta papers [The Atlanta Journal, The Atlanta Constitution; Atlanta Journal-Constitution].  And I tried to go to the Atlanta papers.  They never had a black reporter.  And they would--told me that they were not ready for a black reporter.  This was in 1962, '63 [1963].  But then when their sister paper, the Dayton Daily News, Dayton, Ohio, came after me and hired me, but my interview was conducted by editors at The Atlanta Constitution [Atlanta Journal-Constitution] on behalf of the Dayton Daily News (laughter).
Story_ID: 217782
Speaker 1: And so, now you've moved into reporting in that area.  What were some of the stories like?  What was changing?
Speaker 2: Well, I was still--and I covered a lot of civil rights here [Atlanta, Georgia].  A little bit was still going.  I moved to Dayton [Ohio] in September 1963.  As soon as--well, one thing that happened.  As I was moving--before I got to Dayton, a week before I got to Dayton, there was the March on Washington in August of '63 [1963].  And then when I got to Dayton in September of '63 [1963], there was a church bombing in Birmingham [Alabama] with the little girls, the four little girls killed.  There were no demonstrations in Dayton.  But eventually, for example, SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] was getting ready for Mississippi summer [Freedom Summer], 1964.  And the training for the youngsters who were going to Mississippi occurred in Oxford, Ohio, right outside Dayton.  So I covered those training sessions.   But my big job in Dayton, I became the court reporter.  I covered all the courts in Dayton.  I didn't cover civil rights, but I covered from local courts to federal courts.
Speaker 1: And how long did you stay in Dayton?
Speaker 2: I was with the [Dayton] Daily News for four years, from 1963 to 1967.
Speaker 1: What were some of the more memorable stories that you reported on?
Speaker 2: There were some fascinating integration cases in Dayton that I covered.  One of the--in retrospect, the most fascinating period of my career was, and I look back and marvel over how youthful I was and energetic as a youngster.  Not only, I had the--was I the court reporter covering all the courts in Dayton, I had a weekly jazz column in the Sunday magazine; I reviewed movies, plays, nightclubs.  And that was--and I couldn't--and again looking back, I don't see how I did it, but I was full of energy and did all of that.  And I have clips from all those areas of coverage.
Speaker 1: Could you share, perhaps (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And I did a weekly column, a weekly legal column on Sunday.
Speaker 1: Could you share, perhaps, some of the reporting that you were doing on jazz during this time?
Speaker 2: There were some local--there were a couple of local piano trios, and eventually, one hit it big and moved to New York [New York].  But I started writing about him first.  His name was Roy Meriwether, a pianist.  And Roy is still playing around New York now.  And he eventually played with a lot of the greats in New York.  But Roy Meriwether was from Dayton, Ohio; was playing clubs around Dayton, and I used to cover him and I wrote articles about him.  And he went on to do things. And you recall anything, perhaps, that was occurring that you were reporting and related to the movies? Well, the movies--this was--time of the mid-'60s [1960s].  American movies were terrible in those days.  Most of them were really bad, were not worth seeing.  And so I didn't feel like wasting my time for covering most of them.  So I covered mostly foreign (laughter).  I covered--there were a couple of art theaters in Dayton, and I did most of the art stuff.  There were some good American movies at that period.  'The Pawnbroker' for example.  But for the most part, it was, like, I covered more of the English flicks; French; [Jean-Luc] Godard, and the great directors; the Italian movies I would review.
Story_ID: 217783
Speaker 1: So around 1967, 1968, you left Dayton [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I left Dayton and moved to--I got a job with the Washington Star in [Washington] D.C.  So I moved to Washington [D.C.].  And then there I covered the emerging city government, the new city government in D.C.
Speaker 1: And so what were the things that were emerging related to city government that you were covering?
Speaker 2: Well, the government in--the local government in Washington had for almost a century been three commissioners appointed by the president--and historically, it had been three white commissioners--as the city became black, and three very conservative, usually, people to kind of oversee Washington.  In 1967, [U.S.] Congress passed the law and President [Lyndon Baines] Johnson signed to make the city government, the mayor, the city council--again, all appointed by the president--but at least there was a mayor, a semblance of a Democratic government.  And so, I covered that transition and then covered the government in its first year or so, a new government doing new things, the city being able to enact its own laws for the first time in the century.  So that was very exciting in those early days.  And it was amateur young men; that is, amateur politicians.  These guys were not politicians, so they were very--they were honest and open, and it was a great time to cover them, unlike governments nowadays (laughter).
Story_ID: 217784
Speaker 1: We were discussing previously when you were working for the [Atlanta] Daily [World], for the Atlanta Daily, you were saying there was some other work that you were doing in the evening that was a little controversial.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Well, since the World was against the [Civil Rights] Movement, and I became tight with the-- not only the students, but with a lot of the-- their mentors who were professors at the-- on the campuses.  I-- And the students were not getting their voice heard in the World.  I surreptitiously helped them with their student paper in the basement of people's houses and eventually in the office.  And we--I helped them start what eventually became the Atlanta Inquirer.  It was student-led at the time.  Then the Inquirer kind of became--started going a little bit conservative, because it started making money.  And we left the Inquirer and started The Atlanta Voice, which became the student paper.  And some of the people who worked with us, [M.] Carl Holman, edited the paper.  [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond was an editor.  Jim Gibson, James [O.] Gibson and his brother John Gibson [ph.], and the late--I'll think of the name in a second--along with [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter[-Gault] and myself, were the reporters.  And we put out the student paper.  I had to have--of course, I couldn't use my name, because I was working--after I left the World and went to municipal court, I couldn't use my name, so for my first byline in the paper, Julian Bond was editing my story.  And I asked Julian--he called me at home and said, "What name do you want me to put on this story?"  He said, "I can't use your real name."  I said, "Well, Julian, you're bright, you're smart, you think of a good name."  The next day when the paper came out, the page one story in there was this made-up name by Julian Bond for me.  The name he gave was P. Delano Lane.  And I said, which was about as close as to Paul Delaney as you could get (laughter).  And I chewed him out about that.  And to this day he kids me about being named P. Delano Lane.  But those were exciting days which were--the person, the late Jondelle [Harris] Johnson, was one of the movers and shakers who helped us start the paper.  She eventually became the local director of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], Jondelle Johnson.
Speaker 1: There are many who get the idea that there was a lot of consensus and support for [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King's [Jr.] vision, particularly here in Atlanta [Georgia].  Do you think that that's true or--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, when he was--Dr. King's reputation was in Montgomery [Alabama], was leading demonstrations.  And when he--it was a shock to local leaders that he was going to move SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] from Montgomery to Auburn Avenue.  And the black leadership was not going to have this.  They couldn't buy the thought.  And I was in meetings where Dr. [Martin Luther] King Sr., daddy King, was a part of the leadership, and they all agreed that Dr. King Sr. would go to Martin Luther King Jr. and tell him, that if he moved to Atlanta, he cannot hold demonstrations in Atlanta.  Again, you know, the city was trying to maintain this image and keep the lid on.  And Dr. King promised that he would not demonstrate, he would challenge these guys.  And so, for quite a while, a year or so, Dr. King held no demonstrations in Atlanta; everywhere else, but not in Atlanta until it was compelled to do so.  In fact, he was asked to intervene because the students were getting really mad before an agreement was reached on how they integrate Atlanta.  So Dr. King Jr., when he came to Atlanta, most of the leadership did not want him here.
Story_ID: 217785
Speaker 1: Okay.  So let's fast forward back to your tenure with the Washington Star and you're mentioning that you stayed there for--
Speaker 2: Two years with the Star.
Speaker 1: For two years?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I was hired by the New York Times in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: And what were you doing at that point?
Speaker 2: I became an urban affairs reporter.  The Times had an urban affairs team.  There were four of us who covered urban affairs nationwide the beginning in 1969.  Our calling was to discover and report on trends across the country.
Speaker 1: What types of things were you reporting on?
Speaker 2: Oh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: This must have been in 1970?
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969], '70 [1970], '71 [1971].  We, for example, found, at that time, the big thing in this country was the suburbanization of America.  Whites leaving the inner city and moving to the suburbs--abandoning--white flight, abandoning the cities.  The second was the expansion of interstates and the building of beltways, perimeters around all the big cities.  And we found that as whites left the city, they set up communities around those perimeters, a major--and you see that in Atlanta [Georgia] today; all of the cities around [Interstate] 285, [Interstate] 20 and [Interstate] 75 to [Interstate] 85; all of the towns that sprouted and thrived to the detriment of the inner city.  It happened across the country to, you know, New Orleans [Louisiana], Montgomery [Alabama], Houston [Texas], Dallas [Texas].  It just happened that way.  And we covered that.  We also covered this exodus of people to the Sun Belt from the North; the old, industrial cities of the North to Florida, Texas, Arizona, California; just this huge complex change in the characteristics of this country.  That's what we were covering, and the social, racial, et cetera, implications of those changes that were going on.
Speaker 1: And that was through 1971.  What occurred after that?
Speaker 2: Well, 1972, the election was 1972.  [President Richard Milhous] Nixon.  I started covering politics then, and we kind of abandoned the cities to cover politics.  And then Watergate drove up.  So there was--those were the driving forces in '72 [1972], '73 [1973].  And the black community, 1972, that was the [The National] Black Political Convention in Gary [Indiana].  That was a major thing for black politics as the Voting Rights Act [of 1965] was really taking effect, and more black politicians were being elected across the country.  Blacks met in Gary to decide on trying to influence the 1972 presidential election.  And so that was a major, major happening within the black community.  Then we had the campaign, Nixon versus [Senator George] McGovern of 1972; the election of Nixon in November '72 [1972]; then we also had, remember, all these antiwar demonstrations.  That was vicious, that we're getting--and then with Watergate added on.  And then later in 1973, when Watergate really took hold, leading to the resignation of Nixon in 1974.
Story_ID: 217786
Speaker 1: Subsequent to that, what was next for you?  Did you stay on [at the New York Times]?
Speaker 2: No. Here's--in '74 [1974], I moved from Washington [D.C.] to the Chicago [Illinois] bureau of the New York Times covering--still covering urban affairs, but covering the Midwest; everything urban in this vast area of the Midwest.  I was covering it from 1974 to 1977.  Then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And what kinds of stories were emerging there?
Speaker 2: The cities were still the big stories.  I mean, you had problems in large and small cities.  East St. Louis, Missouri [sic. Illinois], was imploding, just tearing apart; Cairo, Illinois.  Then you had other cities in the Midwest; Kansas City, this thriving.  You had the farm belt, a lot of farm stuff in Iowa.  And you had a few--[Mayor] Richard J. Daley died, the mayor of Chicago.  There were a lot of politics going on.  There was a lot of action in the urban areas at that point.
Speaker 1: And so what would you say were the greatest challenges that you were facing, maybe ethically or in terms of your perspective as a journalist?  By this time, you had a good ten years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, there were no ethical--I wasn't helping students run newspapers (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Anymore.
Speaker 2: --anymore.  No.  That was gone (laughter).  I get--those out of my system since there was no Civil Rights Movement.  Then the movement, the Civil Rights Movement, of course, led to the Women's Movement, the Gay Rights Movement, then other movements.  But we did--and the black, when it did have--we did have the emergence of the Panthers, the Black Panthers; the emergence and decline.  I did a lot of stories on the Nation of Islam.  I had good sources and came up with a lot of good information on some problems; money problems, some crime problems; and did a lot of writing, a lot of stories on that.  But, otherwise, just covering the changes still going on in the big cities as it is--became less white and more black.  And then the election of black mayors in Gary [Indiana] and Cleveland [Ohio] and other places, as the political landscape changed as a result of the white flight, in particular.
Story_ID: 217787
Speaker 1: [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and Malcolm X both were very visible in the media.  How were they covered from your perspective?
Speaker 2: Well, positively for Dr. King, for the most part; and not so positive for Malcolm X for the most part; that is, the [Civil Rights] Movement would not have succeeded without the coverage of the press; the Civil Rights Movement would not have succeeded if the press had hadn't given complete coverage.  TV, for example; TV news, every evening splashing into the homes of--into the living rooms of Americans, white Americans in particular, every day, pictures of dogs biting blacks or about white cops beating black demonstrators; that kind of stuff.  And so that was positive.  The media's effect was positive.  And then, of course, the media can also turn on you.  And the personal problems of King, as for example, J. Edgar Hoover leaked certain information.  Then that became so that the media ran with that.  On Malcolm, as long as he was--when he was with--at the beginning, with leaving the Nation [of Islam] and be anti-white, his coverage--the coverage was negative.  But then as Malcolm went to Mecca [Saudi Arabia] and sort of changed and become more Orthodox and rejecting, then was expelled by--from the Nation by Elijah [Muhammad], then Malcolm became more of a darling of the press at that time until he was assassinated in '63 [1963].  But that was the way the two were, were covered for the most part.
Story_ID: 217788
Speaker 1: So 1974 Chicago [Illinois], was there a lot going on in terms of Chicago politics that you were covering as well?
Speaker 2: Oh, Mayor [Richard J.] Daley was--Richard Daley was the mayor.  And Daley had a stormy relationship with blacks.  He was the all-powerful mayor and he was powerful in the Democratic Party, he was conservative.  And so, there was Daley clashing with civil rights leaders and pro-civil rights politicians; [Senator] Hubert Humphrey, for example, and others who fought with Daley and Daley's supporters.  Then in Chicago, there was a constant fight between anti-Daley blacks and whites against the Daley forces always.  And there was Daley in Chicago versus the rest of the Illinois, which was mainly conservative and sometimes Republican.  So that was always a good story.
Speaker 1: So how long did you stay with the Chicago division of New York Times?
Speaker 2: I would stay there four years in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Were there any really controversial stories that you covered?
Speaker 2: Nothing major controversial.  The black political story was very warm.  That is, the politics going on, different factions led by [HistoryMaker] Richard Hatcher and Congressman [Charles Cole] Diggs [Jr.] on one hand, and Amiri Baraka [LeRoi Jones], and black militants et cetera, on the other hand.  That kept the black community in the--kept roiled up for a long time.  And then, of course, you had the Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam.
Story_ID: 217789
Speaker 1: So in 1977, '78 [1978], where did you go on to?
Speaker 2: I left, I became an editor at the [New York] Times in 1977.  I became an editor on the national desk.  That took me out of daily journalism, daily writing.  I still kept my hand and I did a lot of writing but not as much.  I was more of a--I was an editor then so I did do--I wasn't in the field like I had been before.  And I became the first black editor on in the newsroom at the Times.
Speaker 1: How were you received by the people that you had to work with?
Speaker 2: There I had a reputation already of a long, established reporter.  So that was among my staff.  It was--we--there were no problems with the staff, my colleagues.
Speaker 1: Was racism at all or prejudicial treatment an issue in your capacity or in this particular role?
Speaker 2: I think race is always and racism are always there.  You know, you see it and things you attempt to do and not being promoted sometimes.  But it's there in various ways, always is, always has been there.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And so you were the editor there for the national news desk from 1977 to when?
Speaker 2: 'Til 1986.
Speaker 1: So a quite long tenure.
Speaker 2: Yep.  Very long.
Speaker 1: What do you recall as being some of the more important or more significant events that you covered as an editor or stories that you were dealing with?
Speaker 2: It happened during--well, pick up in 1977, we--'78 [1978], we had the election of 1980, [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan; the Reagan years started in 1980, where conservatism was beginning to take hold through the '80s [1980s], and another election in '84 [1984].  Well, we had the election of '76 [1976] too, when [President James Earl "Jimmy"] Carter [Jr.] beat [President Gerald Rudolph] Ford [Jr.]; and then, of course, the Iranian Crisis when--right before Reagan--right before 1980, when Reagan beat Carter.  And then we went through the '80s [1980s] with the, you know, conservatisms making more and more headway.  Civil rights became less on the agenda than in previous administrations, and it kept getting worse in the '80s [1980s], for civil rights through the '80s [1980s] until 1992 when [President William Jefferson] "Bill" Clinton was elected.  But then I left--we had a, we had a major change at the Times.  A new team came in, a new editor and his team.  So I left the desk and went back to reporting, that's when I went to Madrid [Spain] and became the bureau chief in Madrid, Spain.
Story_ID: 217790
Speaker 1: What was that [being New York Times bureau chief] like and how were you received there [Madrid, Spain]?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was great.  I covered Spain and Portugal and North Africa.  And it was a great assignment.  Did lot of stuff.  Spain was going through some changes, and in North Africa you could see the beginning--you could see the seeds of anguish and protest against American foreign policy that today is raging through--it's now happening with Al-Qaeda and the rage within the Arab communities around the world.
Speaker 1: What were they angry about?
Speaker 2: They loved Americans, loved people, they loved the culture, they loved our film, clothes, et cetera; but they didn't like the policies of our government that supported the regimes in the Arab world.  They didn't like that.  And, of course, that was our policy.  Our government supported the dictators and the kings in the region.  And these were kids, usually youngsters, who were seething about that.  They were not--and they were very poor and they blamed it on their governments and the U.S.  And I think it kept getting worse and worse until finally it exploded.
Speaker 1: Did you see in this climate that people were coming together politically or were they coming together based upon their religious convictions?
Speaker 2: They--I think religion held them together.  There were political divisions, but religion certainly held them together.  But, I think their anger at the U.S. was also some glue that held them together.  They were (unclear).  And these were kids.  These were youngsters that you could see--and then as the age, the average age in those countries was getting lower and lower.  And most of these--a lot of these kids were out of work.  You could see on the screen.  It was obvious that something was going to happen at some point if their needs were not addressed, and some of their needs were not addressed.  And so, eventually, things exploded.
Speaker 1: Do you think that you had different perspective as an African American journalist perhaps than any other journalist that would have been reporting these same stories?
Speaker 2: I think as an African American, yes, to answer your question.  But as an African American citizen, person, my point of view, my perspective is different from say-- for example, from, say, the average white citizen, yes.  I think we look at things, most of us, differently.  I think if that we can understand why these folks are mad more so than other folks.  And we have some, a little bit more understanding of their grief.
Story_ID: 217791
Speaker 1: Of stories that you were reporting regarding, which stories were you the most sympathetic towards?  Which ones did you feel a sense of connectedness to?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I used to love all my stories.  I loved all the subjects that I covered, all the stuff that I did.  I, for example, I loved the people stories I did in North Africa or Spain or Portugal.  I did a story once on the fledgling women's movement in North Africa.  It's still fledgling today.  I did stories on grassroots movements in Spain.  Oh, and covering the Spanish government, for example, the government was--this was coming--this was a new government coming after forty years of dictatorship by [Francisco] Franco, and this was a Socialist government.  And it was just great to be in Spain to watch how the people--I had been in Spain under the dictatorship.  So it was the first country I had ever visited where there was a dictatorship.  And it was strange being an American in a place where everything was controlled, and there were cops on every street; I mean armed soldiers on every street and secret police and people scared to talk about certain topics.  And so, when I got to Spain as a reporter to see the difference, and the difference was people were free, totally free to do everything.  Maybe they were even taking their freedom to extremes; that is, for example, under Franco couples couldn't walk down the--couldn't display affection publicly.  Now, when I went back to report, they were doing things publicly that they never would have done under Franco.  Under Franco, for example, they couldn't do drugs.  I mean, you could probably get your hands chopped off or get life in prison for being caught with drugs.  Under the new government, you could--people openly smoked pot [marijuana], for example.  And the new government was very aware of not arresting people willy-nilly like happened under the regime.  So that was a major, major change in the attitude and the culture of the people that--and that's what I was covering.

Speaker 1: What did you find was different about reporting from abroad [as New York Times bureau chief in Madrid, Spain] as distinguished from actually reporting more locally here in the [United] States [of America]?
Speaker 2: It's a--well, it's a--it's a totally different thing.  And you have to be ready for it; that is, you are leaving your own culture and moving to another culture.  You have language differences, cultural differences, money differences.  When you leave one--when you leave North Africa and go to--I mean, leave Spain and go to North Africa, you got different monies to deal with, different people, different culture, different languages.  And you have to be ready psychologically to do this as a journalist on a daily basis.  One of my editors told me that, if you move, if you go overseas, if you have any problems, family problems, marital problems, if you move overseas, these problems are going to be magnified (laughter), and it was true.  Because there's a lot of family pressure.  I mean, when I was in Spain, I was gone from my family most of the time.  And my poor wife [Anita Jackson] was there in Madrid [Spain] by herself, you know.  She found a lot to do, but I'm gone.  And it's like that with foreign correspondents.  And this was not a hardship--a lot of hardship (unclear) this was good.  Picture Baghdad [Republic of Iraq], picture [Republic of] Iraq or the rest of the Middle East where there is violence; (unclear) Egypt, Israel, where there is real violence all the time; and picture a reporter and his or her family living there.  There's a lot of pressure on family life if you're overseas.
Story_ID: 217793
Speaker 1: Let's rewind a little bit.  Somewhere in this process--we've gotten as far as 1986--you started a family.
Speaker 2: Oh, I got married right after college [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].  Sorry.  My--we were college sweethearts and got married after college, and I've been married ever since (laughter).  She is a social worker, had a career as a social worker, started here in Atlanta [Georgia], back to Ohio and Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: What is her name?
Speaker 2: Anita from Columbus, Ohio.  Anita Jackson.
Speaker 1: And do you all have children?
Speaker 2: Yeah, two boys.
Speaker 1: And their name?
Speaker 2: John Paul [Delaney] III, in fact; and David Delaney.  And they're both married now.  David has no children.  David is the youngest, but Jay [John Paul Delaney, III], the oldest has two children.
Story_ID: 217794
Speaker 1: And so, you were mentioning now as you are moving into this more international role, that there was just a great deal of distance between the world that you were in there and the world that you left perhaps here in the [United] States [of America]. Could you discuss that a little bit, and how you adjusted to and navigated through that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I had been--after being in the service overseas, I was used to doing--to Europe visiting, Paris [France] and France, Paris in particular, and Spain.  So I was not--it was not new to me.  I knew what I was getting into when I moved to Madrid [Spain], and loved it; loved living in Spain, great lifestyle.  In fact, the Spanish lifestyle of late dinners, I can live with that.  And I was just in Spain last month on vacation and--for two weeks, and just thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed.  So it wasn't that much of a--it was a change, I would say, in lifestyle, habits, work.  But it wasn't that traumatic to as--other than, you know, I had to leave my wife [Anita Jackson] alone in Spain.  But just about every month (unclear), every other month we had visitors from the States.  We had this big apartment in Madrid.  We had a lot of visits, then we had a--and we did a lot of entertaining, a lot of parties, having both American and Spanish friends coming by who knew every time we had some guests, we had a party for them (laughter) 'cause they always an excuse to give a party.  So there was a lot of socializing.  But I know that my wife was kind of lonely when she had to stay a week or two by herself in Spain.  And there's only so many times you can go to Toledo [Spain] and go to the [Museo Nacional] Del Prado [Madrid, Spain] (laughter) and take people there.  In fact, she got tired of taking people to Toledo.  She would send them to visit the sights and tell them where to go.  But, you know, your home life is disrupted, but your home life in the U.S., if you work for a major paper like the New York Times, Washington Post, L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times], your home life is disrupted and you have to adjust.
Story_ID: 217795
Speaker 1: So when did you come back [to the United States of America]?
Speaker 2: In 1989.  We came back and I became a--still an editor, my title was senior editor and for newsroom administration, meaning handling all of the things--all of the details of-- of administrating a newsroom.
Speaker 1: And so, then moving into the late 1980s and the early 1990s, what were some of the stories that were really, really, important?
Speaker 2: Well, in the--when I came back to the newsroom, I was not in news then.  I was not covering from 1989, then I left the [New York] Times in 1992.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in that period I was not covering--one of the main things I did at that time was, we would--the Times was trying to get rid of its all-white image, and so we made a big pitch to hire more non-whites, and I was a part of that effort to get--to change the newsroom.  And we went out and found and hired a lot of African Americans, Asians, Hispanics.
Speaker 1: What was the rationale behind that?
Speaker 2: Because the newsroom was practically white.  Remember I told you I was the first black editor?  Well, they then hired some more editors after I came, but they needed more reporters and more editors (unclear) and needed, and it still continues to change the color of the newsroom, because--I mean, up until the '60s [1960s], the Times didn't have any blacks.  We would hire one black.  The first black was hired in the '40s [1940s], one guy; and, then in the '50s [1950s] they hired another one.  And it wasn't until the '60s [1960s] that they started hiring more than one.  And most papers were like that.  In fact, most newsrooms were like that and they still behind--and they still were hiring, so.  But in the '90s [1990s], made this big push through, because of the climate in the country to deliberately change the face of the newsroom, and they did.
Speaker 1: How does the color of the newsroom impact reporting in your opinion (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, you get a different view, you get a different perspective; like we were talking a second ago, that our perspective, for example, on what's happening in the Middle East is different--well, at least a lot of our perspectives are different from our colleagues in the newsroom.  We can bring that to play in coverage, perspective on how people feel about the black community.  Historically, that was negative.  The coverage was very negative historically.  That's different today.  It's not very--it's only negative, not very negative.  And we're still working on getting TV news to quit leading with news that bleeds; if it bleeds, it leads kind of thing.  We're still working on that.  But in the newsroom, you needed different voices, different backgrounds of people to cover the entire community as this country change--as this country becomes more a country of color than it has been.  You got to have people, journalists who understand what is going on and to report on it.
Speaker 1: Has there been or have there been any efforts that you are aware of to sensitize traditional white (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yep.  Yep.
Speaker 1: --reporters to reporting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --on non-white events?
Speaker 2: When I was at the Times, we had meeting after meeting after meeting to talk about this.  We had workshops.  We had diversity experts come in.  We had lectures.  We had visits.  Oh, yeah, we had managers' meetings to deal with this.  And it's and they're still going on.
Story_ID: 217796
Speaker 1: So by the time you are making this transition from being really staying the senior editor, but just moving back, 1992, what were you doing after that?
Speaker 2: Well, let me back up.  One other thing--another thing, on that very topic on changing the color of the newsroom, in order to facilitate to help that change, a group of us formed the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ] in 1975, mostly from big papers.  We got together after years of trying to get together to do something about the fact that there were few blacks in the newsroom, we didn't get promoted, we didn't get certain jobs like covering major events, like covering the White House [Washington, D.C.], covering [U.S.] Congress.  And so, we formed NABJ to put pressure on companies to help do that.  And so, by time I got to the newsroom--got in to newsroom administration, we were doing this.  We had our team of people trying to do that, to change the newsroom.  Thought I'd left out that fact that we formed the NABJ for that exact purpose.  And by 1992 when I left the [New York] Times or '93 [1993], we were still far behind in trying to colorize the newsroom.
Story_ID: 217797
Speaker 1: In 1993, where were you--where did you go (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I left the [New York] Times.  I had an offer and I took a job as chairman of the journalism department at the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama].  So I went there.
Speaker 1: And that was a unique--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --position for you.  And what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, if you remember, I was born and raised in Montgomery [Alabama].  And when I was in school in Montgomery, I could not--the University of Alabama was segregated when I left Montgomery.  I could not attend the university, and it wasn't lost on people that, here's a guy who couldn't go to the university and coming back to be chair of the journalism department.
Speaker 1: How was the transitioning from the newsroom to the classroom?
Speaker 2: I found I preferred the newsroom (laughter).  I liked--it was more than the classroom, actually.  It was administrative.  I taught one class per term, but most of my work was administrative, dealing with tenure, dealing with professors, dealing with paperwork; and that kind of--which was the worst of it.  I did not like that.  The politics I could take, 'cause, you know, if you run into politics in the big newsroom at the New York Times, you could deal with politics on campus.  And I did so I could.  But I just didn't like the--I didn't like it.  And I preferred the classroom, but I taught one class per term.  But most of the work was administrative.  I enjoyed it.  I had a good time.  They loved--they treated my wife [Anita Jackson] and me well.  We had a--it was--the people were wonderful.  But she didn't like Tuscaloosa [Alabama], and a job came along--an offer came along that I took after three years in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Before you go into that, I just want to ask another question about teaching.  What was important to you when you were teaching to impart to the students?
Speaker 2: When I came from the New York Times, my career at the New York Times, and my main purpose was to, one, find students who were real sharp and wanted to be journalists and wanted to succeed and wanted to do it right, and to help them understand the commitment they needed, what they had to do, the ethics of journalism, sensitivity, and also the hardships; that they were not going to walk out over the news and want to get rich--walk out of the classroom and go work for the New York Times or the Washington Post.  And I think I succeeded in that, manifested by a lot of my students still stay in touch with me.  Today, I get invitations to weddings; like, I write references; and I counsel.  They talk about should I change jobs, et cetera.
Speaker 1: What would you say was one of your best experiences in the classroom?
Speaker 2: I think, one of the things that I really--where I feel a sense of accomplishment was inspiring black students.  A lot of black students came to that journalism program because I was there and felt very attached to me, felt they got--and not breaks, but that they were treated equally for the first time on campus; whereas, when before then, they didn't--and there's no question--they didn't feel a lot of their professors gave them the same amount of counseling, advice, help, resources that they gave to their, to the white students.  And I was reminded I was the only black faculty member there on the--while I was in the J--in the communications college [University of Alabama Department of Journalism, Tuscaloosa, Alabama].
Story_ID: 217798
Speaker 1: And where did you go from there?
Speaker 2: Well, a bunch of guys got together to start a black weekly newspaper called Our World News.  We were going to set it up in Baltimore [Maryland] and come out once a week, and it would be a real newspaper with real news, not your-- the type of fare you get in black papers, weekly black papers now.  And we tried for a couple of years, but we never got the funding that we needed to start it.
Speaker 1: And so that brings you on through to 19 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm up to 19--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Ninety-five [1995], '96 [1996]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '96 [1996].  I'm in Baltimore.  And since I'm in Baltimore, I get a job at the Baltimore Sun writing editorials.  Then a friend that's at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] thought it was a great idea to start something called a Center for the Study of Race and Media.  That's just to look at all of the issues in the media involving race.  And similar to Our World News, we didn't get the funding for that, and I stayed there for about a year.  But we never got the funding that we needed to put it together.
Speaker 1: And so, what types of work were you doing at the Baltimore Sun?
Speaker 2: Writing editorials on urban affairs and general assignments on the editorial board (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--
Speaker 2: --and writing a column now and then.
Speaker 1: What kind of column?
Speaker 2: Whatever political stuff that ever came in my mind, political cultural.
Speaker 1: And so, from 1996 until when were you?
Speaker 2: I went back to--I moved to Washington [D.C.].  I was looking for work either in New York [New York] or Washington, where I was going to move to one of those places, back to.  And some friends in New York started something else called the Gene, G-E-N-E, Gene Media Forum [S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse University, New York, New York].  And what they were doing, putting together an organization that would help--that would be a resource for journalists who are covering this new field of genetics; these new things that were happening wasn't a new field, but the new things that were happening in genetics and cloning, et cetera.  And we started holding--it was based in New York--and we started holding seminars for the media about once a month on topics involving genetics.  Like, we had one seminar on black, sports and genes.  You know, the old saying that black--there's a sports gene in all blacks, meaning that we have an advantage because of genes.  Well, we did a seminar on that.  We did another one on stem cells, where right before he died, Steve Reeves was--Christopher Steve Reeves--Christopher Reeves [sic. Christopher Reeve] was the speaker.  We did another one on blacks' diseases and genes.  And we did one, again, about every month 'til our money ran out.  And we--that--on paper we still exist. We're still looking for money, and if we find some money, we'll start the seminars again.
Speaker 1: So in the meantime, that kind of puts us about 1990 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ninety-nine [1999] or so, 2000.  And I'm back in Washington, living in Washington.  And I'm doing--I'm writing.  Up to now I'm writing.  I'm writing my memoirs, right now.  And I do a lot of --I write for Savoy magazine, for example, and other things.  I was on the board of NPR for a long time.  I do some stuff for the [Henry J.] Kaiser [Family] Foundation.  Little things like that keep me busy.
Speaker 1: So what's been at the core of your more recent works?  What types of things are intriguing at this point for you to write about?
Speaker 2: Well, here, look at race relations in the U.S.; how bad they still are (laughter), after all these years; for example, in journalism.  We're having a thirtieth anniversary of the founding of NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], and at the convention in Atlanta [Georgia], we were--the founders were honored.  But we were also, as founders, we are-- we were and are disturbed at the trends in journalism, that we're back to a lot of the issues that got us started in the first place: not hiring, not being promoted.  And it's just showed us that the need--to continue and strengthen NABJ.  And so, those are the things that have occupied a lot of attention and to write about; and I still write about them, those issues.
Story_ID: 217799
Speaker 1: The nineteen--the late 1970s, early 1980s gave rise to a video explosion, particularly as it related to rock and hip-hop.  How do you feel that hip-hop and reporting about hip-hop in popular culture has impacted or swayed reporting in the media?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, a lot of people, from the beginning, they were focused, the reporting intentions focused on the violent aspects of hip-hop rather than the more significant and substantive point of hip-hop.  And, of course, there--you know, the leaders of newsrooms are always looking for the mainly extremes of any movement or anything, any social activity.  And we've come to today that the extremes of hip-hop are the commercial part rather than the social ethnic ramifications.  So we get all these stories nowadays about who's making--who the millionaires are.  And because we have this entertainment culture, the feature is the entertainment part of it, which isn't really important, rather than--I mean, in entertainment meaning who's in People magazine, et cetera, rather than its full impact on white and black communities.  We don't get that as much as should.
Speaker 1: So do you feel as if the images of African Americans and other communities have improved or digressed?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's improved.  I mean, we cannot say that we when started NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] in '75 [1975], there were so few of us in the field, and now at the convention in Atlanta [Georgia], there must have been about three thousand journalist, black journalists.  Well, that's improvement, no question about it.  And, obviously, certainly among those three thousand people spread across the country, you're getting somewhat of a more realistic view of the black community.  But we still have the problem, as I mentioned earlier, if it leads, it bleeds, and most of the bleeding is among black people.  So you get most of TV coverage of black people today deals with crime.  Well, that's the way it was in 1975 when we started NABJ.  So, yeah, it's there--it has been progress.  You can't argue about that.  But there's--it's kind of incomprehensible that, here it is today and we're still doing this. We have the same complaints that we did thirty years ago.
Story_ID: 217800
Speaker 1: From your ideals, what role should the media play in the life of American citizens?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I'm one of those who may be a little idealistic to believe that, if you don't have a free, truthful, honest act with media, you cannot have a democracy.  If the media lets the government and others, like, the corporate world, get away with anything they want to do, then you don't have a democracy.  And I think the media are the main ingredient to keeping that from happening.  If there is no media, government's corporations will do anything, cut corners, do anything to get away with its policies and practices.  So the media is extremely important.  If there isn't this media, that is, it's got to be a watchdog media.  It cannot be part of the government, cannot be part of the corporate world.  And those are the big fears that's happening today.  If we don't have that, we won't have a democracy.  And maybe we don't want a democracy.  But, that's the fact.
Speaker 1: How do you feel about ore recent accusations against journalists, that they are mainstreaming stories?
Speaker 2: Well, that's the problem I mentioned, the corporate takeover of newsrooms that has--cannot help but force journalists to reflect their ownership, their corporate owners.  So that a very real danger.  Yes, that is happening and it's unfortunate.  The ethical lapses, the--I mean, well, the Iraq War, an example of the media not being what they should be in covering aggressively this war, the lead up to the war; that is, if the media are not going to expose lies, deceptions by those who are doing it, then we are doomed.  The democracy is doomed.
Story_ID: 217801
Speaker 1: Who have been some of your heroes or some of your mentors as you progressed as a journalist?
Speaker 2: I've had several, if you want to go back.  I had a good friend here at the Atlanta Daily World George Coleman, who was a great--one of my first heroes.  In fact, when I first went to North--to Algeria, I used to hear George Coleman, who was a veteran of World War II [WWII] in the Red Ball Express, he used to amaze us with stories about North Africa and the town, the North Algerian town of Oran [Algeria] on the Mediterranean.  Well, when I got to Spain, I made it to Oran.  And I saw it and I thought about it.  I lifted a drink to George Coleman as a result.  Jim Fain, my editor at Dayton [Daily News], who got me started, was a great editor, terrific editor. It was only--Jim's only fault was that he was a southern white man and very militaristic.  He was a General in the [U.S.] Army (laughter), and he was a big supporter of the Vietnam War, which was a mistake.  At the New York Times, [David R.] Dave Jones was the national editor, a great, great newsman, was my hero on the Times, my mentor.  So I've had some good guys.
Story_ID: 217802
Speaker 1: When you look at the future of journalism, who do you think are amongst the best and the brightest up and coming?
Speaker 2: There's a lot of youngsters who--in various places; a lot of my former students who--but given the right atmosphere, climate; given the right-- given the right encouragement and help, are going to become terrific journalists.  And they are the ones that are going to save us (laughter).  And we had some youngsters on the Washington Post the New York Times, L.A. [Los Angeles] Times, and down in the--out in the country.  A lot of my colleagues who had become editors of those papers, I'm looking to them to help save journalism (laughter).
Story_ID: 217803
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you'd like to add, perhaps something we didn't share?
Speaker 2: I'm sure something will come up after I--after I walk away.  Just a quick think back.  Can't think of anything at the moment.
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life and what is important to you?
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of people say, "If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing."  That's not true for me.  I would change a lot (laughter).  A lot of things I would do differently.  But I'm satisfied in general.  I've had a good life.  I think I made some contributions, and I've tried to do some good things.  And maybe a few people will say, "Yeah, he did some good things."  And I kind of look back, especially--as I mentioned, some of my students--they're not only students, but some people I have helped in journalism, and if they are successful, then I feel good that I have accomplished something.
Story_ID: 217804
Speaker 1: For those going into media or journalism, what suggestions do you have for them?
Speaker 2: Well, they--I was telling some kids earlier at the [National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ)] convention that--and it's pretty typical.  I mean, it's nothing--this is not new, but if you're going to be a journalist, you have got to read.  You have got to read your daily papers.  You got to look at the news.  You got to be familiar with issues of the day.  And the best thing you got to do is read a lot of literature; fiction, nonfiction, so you can appreciate the writing that has gone before you; appreciate the people who did that writing, and not necessarily copy them, but develop your own style from appreciating the styles that you're reading, the ideas that you see coming from great writers.  You've got to--if you're going to be a successful journalist, you're going to have to do that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 217805
Speaker 1: This might be a strange question, but do you--would you have chosen a different path if you had to do it again?
Speaker 2: Well, there some things that I would have changed in my career to get where I got.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What would you have changed?
Speaker 2: Well, for example, a couple of times I had fights with my editors at the New York Times, and I had offers from the Washington Post.  Maybe I should have taken one of them just for the heck of it; something like that.  I mean, I would have changed the course of life.  And when I left the Times, it was changing the course of my life, and I was thinking I should have changed the course earlier.  And another thing, for example, when I became an editor, I had been hounding the Times, because the Times did not have a black editor, had never had a black editor.  So I kept hounding to--"You guys, come on," 'til they finally asked me to be an editor.  And I didn't really want to be an editor, but I wanted to stay in reporting.  But they said, "No, no, no.  You've been pushing us, and we've selected you to be an editor."  So I couldn't say no.  But in retrospect, I wish I had stayed in reporting longer (laughter).
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: I want to write my book.  I want to write my memoirs.  And then some--and write a few other books.  I have a lot of things I haven't said yet that I'd like to say, I'd like to get out there.
Speaker 1: Would you like to share with us, maybe, one (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, just on politics and race relations, on observing race relations in journalism, and just race relations in the U.S. today and yesterday.  That kind of stuff I'd like to just throw my points of view out there.
Story_ID: 217806
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: You know, I think we're in bad shape.  I think we have been affected more by our history in the U.S. than we truly realize.  I think the legacy of slavery and the legacy of discrimination left some scars on us to the extent that we're afraid of--we don't deal with them because we're afraid of the charge by whites that "Oh, you're victims.  You have this victimization syndrome."  Well, there are some serious problems that we have that have not been resolved, that even white folks have to resolve.  We don't talk about race with white people honestly and openly anymore.  Remember when [President William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton had his race commission [One America in the 21st Century: The President's Initiative on Race] going around the country?  The commission was not received too well, because Americans do not want to talk about race.  So that would be--that's something that has yet to be resolved at some point.  I don't know when and if it'll ever happen, because I think the lingering effect on black people is still devastating.  Only the Native Americans suffer more than we do in the racial scheme of things.  And as long as--and I don't think it'll ever--I don't think it'll change too much as long as the system allows just a few of us to come in and keeping out the vast majority, it's not going to change us too much.
Story_ID: 217807
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life, what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: I don't know if anything stands out in my life other than being a survivor (laughter) and trying to help people.
Speaker 1: What values do you consider to be the most important and why?
Speaker 2: I think being--dealing as much as possible with the people very openly and honestly about real problems.  And you'll come to that as you, you know, later in life, as you mature more and experience things and go through a lot of issues.  I think that's very important, and in our relationships, the most difficult things to manage individually and collectively.  And if you can do the best you can in trying to manage your relationship, my relationship, relationship with each other.  If you work at it, that'll be a most important thing that you can do in life.

Speaker 1: Some argue that there's a crisis currently amongst young black men.  If you were to offer advice or counsel to them, what, what would you say?
Speaker 2: Well, this goes back to this, this a problem in America where, I think, again the vestiges of slavery, discrimination and what this country itself has become, what it has done, especially to black men.  We don't want to deal with it.  The best thing you can do with black males is give them work so they can support themselves and then support their families.  There's a controversy right now over programs that the [President George Walker Bush] administration is promulgating regarding marriage, trying to tempt black men to get married.  Well, that's not going to work.  The way you tempt people to get married is give them jobs.  Give them the economic structure, platform, basis to take care of a family.  If you're married, the government's gonna give you $10,000 or $5,000 a year.  That is not going to help the marriage.  You start by giving people, vulnerable people, black--young black males, work.  Give them steady jobs and--with enough wages to support themselves and a family, and I think a lot of problems will be solved then.  And I don't think at this stage this country is ready to do that.

Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: Oh, it doesn't matter because a hundred years from now, who would care?  Ten years from now after I'm gone, who'd care other than my close family?  Five years from now?  You know, no matter how you're remembered at your eulogy, it's down the drain, it's down the tube, it's gone (laughter).  So I just want to be remembered as I am.  However people have reacted to me, that's how I want to be remembered.  But, again, it won't make any difference to me.  But again, it won't make any difference to me, but--if I'm lying there dead.  But, you know, ten years from now, it won't matter to anybody, not by--the great thing about it is, you can Google me, you can go to the New York Times will see every story I wrote, and if you want to, you know, if you think I did some good and some of that stuff, great.  But who will care in the future (laughter)?

Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: Because if you don't live by it, you will die by it.  If we continue, for example, to ignore our history in America, our racial history and the serious problems of relations in America.  And, again, the dominant culture, white, and it's relation to blacks, Native Americans, and the other minorities, if we don't come to grips with that, with the historical perspective and learn from that history, that bad history, nah, we're doomed.  So history is important.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, just say I tried and I was only human.  And if I succeeded in something, great.  If I failed in something, I didn't mean to.
