Speaker 2: Color?  Blue.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase or saying?  I don't have a phrase or saying, is that okay?
Speaker 1: That's fine, not--many people don't have favorite phrases or sayings, so that's not.
Speaker 2: Yes, I don't dabble in aphorisms.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So nothing immediately comes to mind.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Although my mother's [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] favorite saying is: don't take any wooden nickels (laughter).
Speaker 1: Nickels?  What does that mean, no--what does that mean?
Speaker 2: That means don't be taken advantage of, yeah.
Story_ID: 522151
Speaker 1: I wanna start out by--why don't I ask about your mother?  Can you give her name and her year--date or year of birth and what you know about her background?
Speaker 2: Sure, my mother's name is Kimberly Bettina Muhammad [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl].  Her maiden name is Satterfield.  Her birthdate is September 3, 1952.  She grew up in Chicago [Illinois].  Her parents were both Chicagoans as well so somewhat unusual for the migration train, she's a second-generation northerner.  She was the, or is the youngest of four.  She lost her mother at a young age, her mother passed at nine.  Mostly was reared by her grandparents [Laura Gavin and Eugene Gavin] and an aunt.  Graduated high school at sixteen, went to college, had me at nineteen. Married into the Nation of Islam to my father Ozier [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad], and spent thirty-five years as an educator, fourteen in the classroom, twenty-one as an administrator and is currently retired.
Speaker 1: So, did she talk about growing up at all in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you share some of those stories?
Speaker 2: Well, she was also part of a first generation of young people to experience the post-World War II [WWII] public housing boom in Chicago.  So, she describes her grandparents moving to Altgeld Gardens on the far South Side [Chicago, Illinois] when it was its on panacea for overcrowding and tenant conditions all--particularly on Chicago's southeast side of the city.  They were modest, sometimes poor, she talks about essentially being orphaned at nine and in a context where the community took care of a lot of kids, and particularly her grandparents, but she has essentially described her childhood as a kind of Motown generation.  So, she didn't really experience the Civil Rights Movement given her age. I mean she came of age in it but it wasn't felt in a way it would be felt in the South or in post 1970s.  So, my mother really felt very connected to both her family and the city.  I think she also was very conscious of having a biracial background.  Her grandfather was perceived to be white in a time when that was perhaps less common in general, but, but maybe even more common than most people really wanted to talk about, and I think that gave her a sense of uniqueness.  She's not biracial herself, but the complications of a very visible white male protector and provider in her household, married to a very dark-skinned woman from Mississippi, Laura Pearl [ph.] from Holly Springs, Mississippi created a unique circumstance for her mother who was very fair and might have passed if she had chosen along with her mother's sisters and brothers.  So, it was an interesting confluence of both, a city on the move for black folks, opportunities and possibilities in terms of a fresh start in public housing, which again in the beginning was a real opportunity, not unlike Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor who came of age in a similar time here in New York City [New York, New York], but at the same time they faced challenges and my mother was able to overcome some of those challenges in the workplace, et cetera through a very--a great job in the public school systems.
Story_ID: 522152
Speaker 1: How do you describe your mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl]?
Speaker 2: As a type A, very self-directed, very independent, very strong-willed Virgo.  She--I nicknamed her a--as a young person, my mother's very small.  She's about 4'11".  She wears a size five shoe, but she's powerful and mighty and the nickname I gave her was Shorty Rough (laughter), because she was the kind of person that, she didn't mince her words.  If she felt that someone was not paying attention to her or disrespecting her, she spoke up.  My father [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] tells these stories of going out on a date when they were young and before they got married and my mother complaining incessantly at a restaurant about whether or not her steak was cooked to perfection and he was certain that their food had been violated by the cooks in the kitchen (laughter) so he came to dread going out to restaurants, particularly steak houses precisely because of this, but (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Well, that's because people will--it's known that wait- waiters and things will put things in the food if you complain too much (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, yeah, yeah, no it's just, and I grew up to a mother who, if again, if there was any perceived injustice in terms of personal interactions between her, particularly in retail establishments, but, but also in professional settings, she definitely always spoke her mind.
Story_ID: 522153
Speaker 1: One question that I wanted to ask just because--was there any issue around color?  Did she ever speak of color, you know just because of the--you said, was it her grandmother that was--?
Speaker 2: Her mother.
Speaker 1: Her mother.
Speaker 2: Her grandmother [Laura Gavin] was very, very dark skinned, but her mother, the child of--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He--it turns out that this is a little bit complicated.  He wasn't white in the, in the sense of his, his ancestry being pure.  His grandfather had been a Confederate soldier in Mississippi (laughter), I know it's shocking.  His name was Robert Henry [ph.] and he had a child to a, an enslaved woman Betty Wharf [ph.] on a Mississippi plantation, several children actually and that--one of the children of that relationship, Henry [Henry Gavin], was my grandfather's grandfather, so Robert was the great-grandfather, the Confederate soldier.  So, it's very complicated, this family, but they didn't learn any of that as, as children.  They just thought their grandfather, my mother thought her grandfather was a white man, but instead (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: So who found that information out?
Speaker 2: I have a cousin who fancies himself an amateur genealogist, and he used ancestry.com and made all sorts of connections.  It actually turns out that my great--my grand, my great-grandfather, my mother's grandfather whose name was Eugene Gavin, the person we've been speaking about, turns out he was alienated from his family precisely because his siblings passed as white, that they had no black lineage.  So, they married into white families and essentially abandoned him.  So, he grew up in this very visible black space to a very visibly black woman and had biracial children at the time of which my mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] was born to one of them.  So color--so to answer the original question, color was definitely part of the consciousness of my mother, her siblings, the family--there's also a strange in the family telling, and I'm gonna say this very deliberately because this is how my mother described her family story, but there's also a very powerful trope of the tragic mulatto and that's because many of my mother's aunts, including her mother, passed prematurely, literally died of various tragic circumstances, including being struck by lightning, early disease onset, drug addiction and overdose, just the kinds of things that might happen to one person in a family, but in this case, particularly for these beautiful women, seemed to keep happening.  So, we're at a stage in my family's life on my maternal side where there're not a lot of elders in the family.  There're essentially the two youngest of my great-grandparents' children are still alive, people who are the siblings of my grandmother who passed when my mother was nine so that would've been in 1959, 1961 I'm sorry, and they're--those two youngest are still alive and in fact they've, in some ways, broken the curse because prior to their getting to their seventies, no other relatives of that lineage had survived that long.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying that on the level of your grandmother, that those siblings--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Were, were the ones that?
Speaker 2: They, they nearly--all of them died tragically.  One died of carbon monoxide poisoning, fell asleep in a garage.  That's, that's what I mean in terms, yeah so one sibling gets struck by lightning, one sibling who dies of carbon monoxide poisoning, one sibling who dies in a bathtub, at in his mid-fifties.  One sibling who dies of drug addiction, so this sort of curse.  One died of AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] at a time when AIDS was still not yet a very visible--I won't say it wasn't invisible.  We're still figuring out the disease course and what it meant.  So, he died in 1987, he was a military veteran, was a fairly, openly gay person.  He wasn't effeminate in that sense, but as a child I remember going to his home for holidays and he and his partner would host and make meals and we were not, you know we didn't think anything of it, he was a wonderful person, Vincent Gavin.
Speaker 1: Gavin is the?
Speaker 2: Gavin is the family, family name.
Speaker 1: Family name, okay so that was your mother's maiden name before--no, you said Satterfield.
Speaker 2: Well, she was the child's--you know she was--her father, she took her father's name Satterfield, but Gavin was her grandfather's name, my great-grandfather's name and that was the name that traces back to the Mississippi plantation owner who served in the Confederacy, and of course they are of Irish ancestry, so President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and I share that in common (laughter).
Speaker 1: You know there's a lot you know we find in the archives.  There's a lot of the Irish--I mean very predominant throughout that, I think they were a lot of the overseers, right?
Speaker 2: A lot of the overseers but also there was a lot of, in, in a perfect America they would've shared a lot of the social milieu of being essentially the backbone of America's laboring classes.  So, there was a lot of intimacy and proximity for people of Irish ancestry and African Americans, both North and South and it was precisely the manipulation and imposition of racial ideology that worked constantly to separate those communities so that they'd be at each other's throats rather than working together.
Story_ID: 522154
Speaker 1: What did she [Muhammad's mother, Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] talk about and did she ever describe her growing up, her growing up in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: She did but, but she--I mean my mother's a kind of a glass is always half full person, so despite the fact that she can be very strong willed and fighting for herself and for others--I'll give you an example.  There were times when I perceived racial slights as a child, as a young teenager sort of finding my racial consciousness and she would say to me all the time, "How do you know that the person's racist?  The person could just be ignorant."  And, for her this idea of ignorance was a way of transcending something that I think in the end probably made her more uncomfortable than say, it would make me.  That for her there were just rude, ignorant people in the world and it didn't matter whether it was about race or racism, it just mattered that there's a way to deal with ignorant and rude people which she was very good at.  So, she, she didn't bring a lot of racial analysis and critique to the story.  She didn't talk about where she was on the day that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was shot or when Martin Luther King came to Chicago and participated in the anti-racism housing marches, particularly on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  She was just young enough to not necessarily be fully invested, but she was the kind of person that really wanted to keep her head down.  She had very powerful images of being successful in her and so she focused.  She also talked about and this takes us out of the big context in a very intimate way.  She was the kind of person who would go in the closet and play with paper dolls from Spiegels [Spiegel Inc.] and Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] catalogues.  So, she had a way of creating space for herself in, in crowded homes where her siblings were older and she didn't have the kind of idyllic circumstances of a nuclear family, there were lots of relatives always around.  I have one aunt, she didn't die so tragically but I describe her as a blues woman.  She had a lot of husbands, drank a lot, cursed out people, owned a bar, could sing and perform.  So, these were sort of the circumstances that my mother would often try to carve out space for herself.  So, I think in some ways she pushed away some of the ways in which a lot of people of that generation were thinking about: what's gonna be my role in this moment?  Who am I gonna be in a very rapidly changing America?  I mean she was eighteen, or sixteen at the time that the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968 came out, which you could imagine a sixteen-year old like my own [Gibran Muhammad] might be really involved, might be paying attention and listening, and might be completely detached, and I think my mother was somewhere kind of between kind of attached and observing.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, 'cause you described your parents as you know just at the tail end of the baby boom generation.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 522155
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father.  Okay, give his name and a birthdate and what you know about his background (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Sure, so his name is [HistoryMaker] Ozier Muhammad, O-Z-I-E-R.  He was born October 8, 1950 and grew up in Chicago [Illinois].  His mother [Eleanor Paschal Muhammad] was from Georgia and his father [Nathanial Muhammad] was born I believe in Michigan, but also might have come from Georgia, but he definitely grew up in, in Detroit [Michigan] where the Nation of Islam was first founded.  My grandfather is about ninety, so he's still with us and my father grew up to a gigantic family with--he was one of ten and he was the second oldest son and I'm not sure if he is the third or second child, but he was very much a part of the Nation of Islam.  It was his formative experience.  He went to the University of Islam [Muhammad University of Islam, Chicago, Illinois] to be educated, talks about having taken some classes from his Uncle Wallace [Wallace Muhammad] who became Imam Warith Deen Mohammed, a very prominent member of a, sort of newly growing Sunni Islamic community that he lead after the Nation of Islam changed power from Elijah Muhammad to Louis Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], but I think the thing that makes my dad's story particular is of all of his siblings, he found his calling pretty early in life and as a late teenager started working as an assistant to a studio photographer on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] not too far from the home base of the Nation, basically a mile east of where they lived in Chatham [Chicago, Illinois].  He grew up, my father grew up on 82nd [Street] and St. Lawrence [Avenue] and this studio was like on 83rd [Street] and Dorchester [Avenue] or Blackstone [Avenue].  So, once he started working in that space he decided that he wanted to be a photographer.  He went to college and I think maybe one or two of his siblings eventually went to college, but my father went at the age when people eventually go to college at least as one imagines, so maybe nineteen he went to Columbia College [Columbia College Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], studied journalism and photography and graduated, started working at Ebony and Jet magazine and launched his career with people like Vandell Cobb and Bill Rhoden [William C. Rhoden] who just retired from The New York Times, also [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett was there.  I mean it was a powerhouse as you well know back in 1974 when he joined.  I have distinct memories of going to work with him and just meeting Mr. Bennett who handed me a copy of 'Before the Mayflower' ['Before the Mayflower: A History of Black America,' Lerone Bennett, Jr.] with a signed signature.  My father was probably a little more of hippie than my mom [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl], sort of more counter-culturalist.  Thinking about his background as a child of the Nation and then thinking about a changing world, I think he had a much greater racial consciousness than my mom and very-well read, very actively engaged in current events.  Eventually, as he moved from Ebony, Jet to The Charlotte Observer to Newsday on Long Island [New York], began to travel the world, so in terms of my sense of my father by the time I was ten years old, he was incredibly focused on everything happening in the world, in the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] years, anti-apartheid struggles, he eventually covered the famine in Ethiopia in 1985 for which he won a Pulitzer [Pulitzer Prize].  He took me to museums all of the time.  He challenged me to think about the big picture all of the time.  He exposed me to everyday events by taking me along with him to cover, particularly by the time he got to New York [New York], everything from sporting events to Ed Koch mayoral press conferences.  So, I definitely attribute my father's own sense of wanting to be a journalist and to be engaged and active and learned, and not in the way that--my mother was an educator, she was certainly learned, but this was a different kind of interest and engagement with the picture that my dad passed on to me, and he's that way to this day.  He reads voraciously, blogs, continues to cover things.  He went to the Republication National Convention in Cleveland [Ohio], not as a paid employee, but as a curious person to cover it in case something happened.  Of course, there weren't protests there and certainly talked about why that is, but that's, that's the dad that I remember, very fond of him, like my mother, but he, you know he pushed me more than my mom to find a, a significant purpose in life.  I'll give you a good example.  When I decided to leave public accounting to go to graduate school [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], my mother said, "Well, why do you want to be a teacher, you're not gonna make any money.  You know that's a terrible idea, I was a teacher," you know.  In her mind, she thought I could be much more as measured by a career as a business person, and what that might mean in terms of my financial future.  My father said, "That's wonderful," you know, "How can I help?"  So, you have a sense of the differences.
Story_ID: 522156
Speaker 1: How did he [Muhammad's father, HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad]--did he talk about growing up and some of his--you know his coming, sort of coming into himself?  Did he share any of that because he came, you know--go on, sorry?
Speaker 2: Yes, well not as much as you would think.  I mean I think families always have these quiet spaces, these I don't want to call them dark corners but maybe they're less lit corners of their lives and so the thing that I think he talked about in terms of growing up as the grandson of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.  He had, he had difficult relationships with his father.  I think he experienced some frustrations with how his father treated both his mom [Eleanor Paschal Muhammad] and the kids and even to this day I sense that there's a there, there.  I don't want to overstate the case, we haven't talked about it so much directly but I--from a very young age, I could pick up that he and his father weren't that close and apparently my grandfather was not a nice person a lot of the time.  He mellowed over his years and I knew him as a kind of small, charming, quiet guy, but that's not who my father thinks of his father.
Speaker 1: Your father's--he, he--what is his name?  Is it, it is?
Speaker 2: My father's Ozier, my grandfather's Nathaniel Muhammad [Nathaniel Muhammad, Sr.], yeah.  So, what that means is his relationship to the Nation of Islam was always a little bit complicated.  I think that there was a golden era for my father and his older brother.  The younger siblings I don't think benefited as much but, because my father was old enough during this golden age and I would describe it in my mind at least, I can't pin the exact date, but sometime probably between 1968 and 1975 when, when Elijah Muhammad passed, there was just money and they--my mother's [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] brother described the moment when my father and his brother Nadar [Nadar Muhammad], who's his oldest sibling got these Mach 1 cars that were, I think they were Lincolns but they were fast, the equivalent of a Ford Mustang, but I, I'm not sure of the make, but they were you know hot rod cars and each one had a different color and apparently, my father had all-white interior.  So, it was the kind of thing that on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] this was a big deal.  I mean you could think about in the 1980s what it would mean to see a young person in a late-model Mercedes-Benz.  Well, a lot of people think, "Well, the person's a drug dealer."  In this case, this was just the largesse of my great-grandfather at that time at the height of the Nation of Islam, but my father came to see the relationship of that money and his benefit as somehow a kind of a mark against the Nation, because as he got older he started to think about, where'd the money come from?  And the money came from very hard working black people who tithed to the Nation, and so those--that's one of the stories that he told me which was a really a story of regret.
Story_ID: 522157
Speaker 1: He also followed his Uncle Wallace [Wallace Muhammad] who became Warith Deen [Warith Deen Mohammed] even at a, as a teenager he's the person who married my parents [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl and HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] and that was a big deal because there was a schism within the Nation [Nation of Islam] between my great uncle and my great-grandfather.  My great uncle had been excommunicated for a period of years, and--
Speaker 2: Your great uncle is--?
Speaker 1: Is Warith Deen or birth name Wallace Muhammad.  So, the fact that my father aligned with him and admired him, and really looked up to him meant that the relationship that my father had to his own father and to his grandfather was more ambivalent as he got older than would've been true for other siblings who were just sort of you know being obedient children.
Speaker 2: So his father went with--Nathan, Nathaniel [Nathaniel Muhammad, Sr.] went, he went on the Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] side then (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, eventually this is while Elijah [Elijah Muhammad] was still alive.  Once my great-grandfather passed, it--actually, the entire family left the Nation, and that was both a combination I think of the winning arguments of my Uncle Wallace, Imam Warith Deen, who had by that time was starting to build a real infrastructure of Sunni mosques that were dominated by African Americans all over the country, including very much on the East Coast.  So, I think he won the argument, my great uncle, but I also think money conflicts between the Nation and the children and Farrakhan also soiled or sullied the relationship.
Speaker 2: Did you hear a lot of that growing up at all, you know or over time about you know all--the conflict and all of that because they became more Sunni, it was more of the Sunni side of it, Islam, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, not so much, I mean part of it is that my mother, unlike some of the other spouses in relationship, more or less never converted and my father, my parents divorced when I was just shy of three, so I had a tenuous relationship to the Nation, and of course, my father's own ambivalent relationship that he wasn't--not only was he no longer practicing under the tenants of the Nation of Islam, he was practicing as a Sunni Muslim well into the 1980s but he also left Chicago [Illinois] where I was still growing up with my mom, so I would see him in the summertime.  So, there were many ways in which my exposure to some of the inside conflict was very limited, and I will say that my grandfather divorced my grandmother [Eleanor Paschal Muhammad] sometime I think in the mid-1970s.  By 1977 certainly left, moved to Kansas City [Missouri], I think he also had some troubles with the law.  It was devastating to my grandmother, she at the time was really only raising her youngest children.  Everyone else had left the house, but that was two girls and they're about twelve years older than me, and they, one was in college, one was in high school and my, my grandmother suffered emotionally because her entire life had been a very full, rich life and everything was changing at this time, including losing her husband and my grandmother eventually settled into a new routine and went on to live a long life and passed in her early eighties.
Story_ID: 522158
Speaker 1: --This concert-promotion business, so like you think in the abstract like this is a very strict household but it turns out that my, my [paternal] grandmother [Eleanor Paschal Muhammad] loved R&B.  She loved the Sam Cookes of the day, and because my grandfather [Nathaniel Muhammad, Sr.] had all kind of business interest from bakeries to cleaners to concert promotions, Brother Herbert [Jabir Herbert Muhammad] was representing Muhammad Ali it turns out there was a lot of kind of fast, you know fast living.  I, I don't know quite how to put it but the entertainment world was one phone call away from my father's [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] household.  So, I think those were the fun times, but I think that was as you know he's probably indicating, a conflict between the moral precepts and the reality.  So, in some ways the exposure may have led him to say, there's a bigger world out there.
Speaker 2: Right, and then he talked also about Raymond Sharrieff.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, sure.
Speaker 2: You know who he said was like the chief of staff (laughter) of the Nation of Islam, and then how his son I think or, or--
Speaker 1: Hasan.
Speaker 2: Hasan.
Speaker 1: Hasan Sharif.
Speaker 2: Really saved him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know and would come and pick him up and take him places and I think, you know you get a sense of a very contemplative person, you know who--.  Um-hm, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's a good word for my dad, yes and he still is.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  You get a sense about that.
Story_ID: 522159
Speaker 1: So, let me ask you, so how did your parents [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl and HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] meet?
Speaker 2: From what I know they met as teenagers.  I don't know the actual date stories.  It's funny, you ask such a simple question.  So, I don't know the exact circumstances of their meeting but I do know that they lived in the same neighborhood, so my mother's essential childhood home was half a mile away from my father's.
Speaker 1: And what neighborhood was that?
Speaker 2: They grew up in Chatham [Chicago, Illinois], yeah so between the Dan Ryan [Expressway] on the west and Cottage Grove [Avenue] on the east along 83rd Street.
Speaker 1: So Chatham is--was very middle class at that point?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yep, and although my father went to the University of Islam [Muhammad University of Islam, Chicago, Illinois], my mother went to a neighborhood school called Dixon [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], right at 83rd and St. Lawrence [Avenue] which was literally across the street from my father's childhood home.  So, so they met as part of a neighborhood milieu and began dating as a late teenager.  My mother married at nineteen, my father was twenty-one and I think they dated for a couple of years.  I recall that same fancy car with the white interior story of my father being incredibly meticulous, something that I inherited (laughter), both for the good and for the bad, but incredibly meticulous and my mother who was always a bit irreverent got into his car with, with apparently animal feces on the bottom of her shoe (laughter) and I know this story because a cousin of hers, who's a second cousin to me, his name is Brian [ph.] was just a few years younger than my mom, and she was keeping up with them.  So, the three of them jumped into my dad's car, my mom's got dog poop on her shoes (laughter) and the description of my father's reaction to her getting into his car with this stuff on her shoe is priceless.  So, they were kids you know they were kids at that point and I think in part their youth also made the marriage a little bit premature, but you know my mom was pregnant and it was the right thing to do, and the thing I'll say about those two kids who got married and had me is that they were incredibly mature as adults and so to this day, and I say this not because, and I've said it enough that sort of violates the family secrecy.  So, this is for real they have never argued in front of me to this day and every decision that needs to be made on my behalf, I mean even through my early childhood years as I, you know was old enough to hear and to pay attention.  They figured out how to do it amicably and to this day they exchange greeting cards.  My mother will stay with him and his wife [Lisa Redd Muhammad] if she's in town and wants to hang out in New York [New York] since I live in New Jersey and I've benefitted greatly, essentially from two people who decided that the relationship wasn't going to work but who both had a vested interest in their childhood--their child growing up into a healthy person and so I like to say I got the best of both of them.
Speaker 1: That, that--I mean that is mature because a lot of adults can't handle that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 522160
Speaker 1: You know I'm sort of struck, I have to say this before we, sort of, go on.  I'm struck by the stories on both sides, like it's the Nation of Islam story, and this white Confederate--
Speaker 2: I know (laughter).
Speaker 1: --on the other, in one bloodstream, I mean you know coming together and it's almost very American, in a very--you know 'cause you don't hear talk of that, but that happens more than we talk about.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, and Elijah Muhammad was a very fair skinned man.  He married a very dark skinned woman [Clara Muhammad].  So, in many ways both of my great-grandfathers were people who carried white blood in their veins, one [Henry Gavin] from Mississippi, one from Georgia.  One went off and established a very anti-racist, separatist organization and the other one lived a kind of typical black life in the midst of a black community striving to do better for themselves.  It's really fascinating and I often say it, because people often discount the complexity of history.  If we all started from our own individual lives and family stories that we have, we'd be better historians because we'd recognize in a microcosm that really is the raw material of history, and so rather than saying, "Of course you would go on to be the director of the Schomburg Center [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], the most important research archive dedicated to black history, you're Elijah Muhammad's great-grandson."   And I say, "Well, my other great-great-great-grandfather [Robert Henry (ph.)] might disagree because he was a Mississippi plantation owner."  So, it's very complicated when you think about, what does it mean to see linearity in one's legacy, rather than the indeterminacy and in some ways the chance?  Now, I will say obviously, my father's [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] particular relationship to the Nation, his particular interest in the world, planted in me something that maybe another child didn't get, even my own cousins for example, and there's no question that his own relationship to thinking about the world came by way of both being in the Nation as well as his own Uncle Wallace [Wallace Muhammad; Warith Deen Mohammed] who was essentially rejecting the parochialism and the separatism of the Nation.  So, there is a relationship, there's a there, there, and just for the record I must say the greatest gift my mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] gave me as both an educator and a human being, was her compassion of--for poor people.  She never forgot what it was like to struggle, even amidst people who loved her and cared for her.  I mean she was never in foster care or never abandoned.  Her relatives took care of her once she lost her mother.  Her father was not much in the picture for much of her childhood, but that experience including eating mayonnaise and ketchup sandwiches which she describes.  One story that she used to tell me was you know that she would say to herself, "When I make it, when I have a great job and I have all the money that I need, that I'm gonna buy all the bacon I can eat and make BLTs [bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches]," and sure enough she did that.  Of course, it drove me crazy because having some exposure to the Nation, I despised pork, don't eat it to this day (laughter), but that sense of want and the sense of not having meant that she always looked out for people who struggled and she was tailor-made for being an educator, not just because she wanted to teach, but because she did everything we want our teachers to do.  To see inside of a child, to look beyond the surface and to care deeply about everything in their lives aside from their grades to their home life to their particular needs on any given day.
Speaker 1: So, you know your---so, your parents like they're, they're young parents (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, very young.
Speaker 1: And, and so the thing that--I know your father talked in his interview about [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Being a seminal moment, and him--you know coming into the Nation of Islam and photographing and seeing those photographs in Life magazine and how profound an experience it had on him, and then the Mike Wallace, he talked a lot about the, you know the hate that he taught (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The interview with Malcom X.
Speaker 1: So, he talked about that but he said he just was, that was of interest to him, but I'd like to know, so, you--'cause he first went to what is now--he went to a community college [Southeast Junior College; Olive-Harvey College, Chicago, Illinois] before going to, to Columbia [Columbia College Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 522161
Speaker 1: My question is, what is your earliest memory of growing up?  You know because three years--you don't remember age three (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't remember my parents [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl and HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] together.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, the earliest memories I have are of a particular place.  We lived at 69th [Street] and Oglesby [Avenue], and I, I remember the building, I can see it as visibly today as it's still standing.  There is a park across the street.  I actually went to the nursery school that's adjacent to the park [Hasan Playlot Park, Chicago, Illinois] that abuts South Shore Drive at 69th Street.  Back then it was called Toddle Inn or Toddler's Inn [ph.].  We lived on the third floor, it was a walk-up, and I remember my bedroom.  It was a gigantic bedroom, I was an only child in a fairly sizeable third-floor apartment flat, and as you know those--you have one half of the building that runs front to back and so I think there were two bedrooms, but large front living room, a little sun room--I remember that place well.  Those are my earliest memories, but I also remember it just being my mom and me, but I remember my father picking me up on weekends, and at whatever point that--I mean I'm sure it started right away, but my earliest memories are of him coming on a Friday after work.  I'd pack my bag, get in the car and he lived on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois] at the time and we'd go to this little apartment.  He had a dog, the only dog I ever had because my mother was definitely afraid of dogs, but those are my earliest memories, being in that particular place.  My mom was a teacher; she often let me skip school to go to work with her.  All I had to do was feign the slightest illness and she, she (laughter) would take me with her.  I was a good student, so on any given day for me missing class meant absolutely nothing but I was a momma's boy.  There is no question about it, I mean I wanted to be with my mother and she tells these stories that the relationship of being a mother's boy as an only child growing up to a single parent meant that at any moment she wanted to do something without me as a huge problem to the point where I was notorious for refusing to let her leave.  So, she'd say drop me off at a friend's house or a relative's house to go out 'cause she was in her twenties at the time that she was divorced, and, and I would scream, cry, wouldn't let her leave.  Finally, when she separated herself and got out of the house, I would cry myself to sleep, oftentimes never removing my coat, and people just got to know this about me.  They just said, "Well, he'll be all right and maybe he'll wake up and eat something.  If not, he'll be here when you get back (laughter)."  So, it seems hard to believe 'cause I don't feel like I'm that person to this day, but that was--and maybe if there was a psychologist trying to put all these pieces together say that I had abandonment issues because of my father's departure.  So, even though I can't remember together, obviously, I experienced him and they were together for those early formative years, but.
Speaker 1: And then you had a close relationship with her, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But it may be that you were afraid like you said that, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd already lost one parent so you know I don't wanna lose this one.
Story_ID: 522162
Speaker 1: So 69th [Street] and Oglesby [Avenue] like you said is South Shore that's near South Shore Country Club [South Shore Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And all of that, so, can you share memories of growing up in, in the house and can you share some memories, but I also want--let's, let's start with--can you tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: So, I, I have to say this 'cause it's the first thing that came to mind--ham hocks (laughter).  Yeah as a smell and I'll tell you why because one legacy of being Elijah Muhammad's great-grandson, again, was the indoctrination about pork.  So, I remember two things very vividly to this day.  One, the smell of anything smoked, and this was a world without eating turkey bacon, or turkey products.  I mean, there was turkey at Thanksgiving, but no other byproducts.  So, the smell of ham hocks was a distinct smell during holiday time where I had to be out on the lookout for any evidence that vegetable or macaroni and cheese or anything had been polluted with pork, so much so that, I mean I was neurotic about it.  If there was--if someone was cooking and they were stirring a pot of ham hocks and used the same fork or spoon to turn something cooking in another pot, I wouldn't eat it.   I mean if one pan had been used to fry bacon and it hadn't been sufficiently cleaned--I'm not sure I would have eaten it if I had seen it anyway.  I might have been suspect that it hadn't--all the grease from the bacon hadn't been removed.  So, the smell of pork and ham hocks in particular, which is something my mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] continued to make through my childhood, even though I didn't eat it, sticks out.  One quick story, and I remember this like yesterday.  I was probably four because I had to be old enough to have memory, but my mother was preparing breakfast and she made bacon and just as she set it on the table, I said, "I'm not eating that," and she said, "Oh, yes you are."  I said, "No, I'm not."  "Yes you are," and we went back and forth like this, and she realized that she couldn't make me eat it and that was the last time she ever cooked pork for me, and she never tried to fool me, she never tried to convince me that I was missing out on something, but she did continue to cook in the household.  So, because I was so vigilant about not eating pork, any smell of pork even to this day reminds me of my childhood, because it's something (laughter) I was always watching out for.  Also, the Nation of Islam had published a book 'How to Eat to Live' [Elijah Muhammad] and in the book, is an image of a person who ate a lot of pork.  So, the person's face had a nose that turned up like a, a pig's snout, and it was an illustration of course, but I remember sitting on public transportation, maybe seven or eight years old and scanning the faces of the black riders on the bus looking for the pork eaters (laughter).  And, it finally, you know something that was very distinct to my childhood, I loved taking things apart.  So, any electronic that I could get my hands on, particularly if it was broken, but sometimes even if it was half broken or not working quite right.  I was fascinated by mechanics and electronics and wanting to see how things worked on the inside, literally taking them apart and I did that my entire childhood, eventually working at a computer store [Hyde Park Computers, Chicago, Illinois] where I got to actually build computers by the time I was twelve.
Story_ID: 522163
Speaker 1: What sounds then?  Do you know sound?
Speaker 2: Music, music--so I, earliest memories of sounds or music, my mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] to this day loves music.  She played music all the time.  I think it was comfort food for her, being a divorcee, being a being a single mother, she did eventually date much later and remarried [Darryl Earl], but my mother played music all the time and my father [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] was a huge music fan.  He, he listened to jazz, my mother listened to R&B.  I spent more time with her, but in both spaces, there was always music.  My father took me to music concerts, to the Village Vanguard [New York, New York], the Blue Note [Blue Note Jazz Club, New York, New York].  I saw Broadway shows, 'Jelly's Last Jam' [George C. Wolfe], 'Sophisticated Ladies,' as a child.  So, on both sides I was always, always, always listening to music and one of the earliest album covers I remember.  I remember really three, 'cause they immediately come to mind, Parliament-Funkadelic's album cover.  I remember it just--'Honey,' Ohio Players, for obvious reasons as a child (laughter), and, and Larry Graham's probably only real hit album ['One In a Million You'], all red, his face looking with a big white brim on the cover.  So, yeah music I have to admit, particularly R&B was a big part of my childhood.
Story_ID: 522164
Speaker 1: And I wanna go back to the, the bacon and the pork.  So, you're growing up with your mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl], but you have the attributes of your father [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad], you--I mean or the Nation [Nation of Islam], so where is that fitting?  How is that having more impact?  Is it your mother's--father's indoctrination?  I mean, I'm just trying to under--?
Speaker 2: It's a good question, yeah, so there's a missing chapter in this story.  So, dad's gone and dad leaves Chicago [Illinois] by the time I'm seven.  So, the window of time in between essentially three and seven, I'm spending weekends with him.  He's also not really in the Nation at this time.  I mean, he's a Muslim, he's praying but he's lost his commitment to the Nation of Islam's teachings.  My mother is never in it and is eating pork, so the missing, missing link is that I spent most of my time outside of school with my father's relatives.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: So, my mother worked and was incredibly--at the time that I was--those years, my single digit years, not only did my mother teach by day, she was getting a master's degree in education at night.  So, she was burning the candle.  So, up until I was about nine years old, I lived part-time with my father's brother, Nathaniel [Nathaniel Muhammad, Jr.], his older brother, essentially Monday through Friday went to school with his children, his wife Ella [Ella Muhammad], my aunt was my surrogate mother and they were very much in the Nation, and it was a picture of Elijah Muhammad on the wall in the living room.  My older cousin, Khalid [ph.], who's five years older than me was old enough to know his great-grandfather [Elijah Muhammad] and therefore had a connection and an attachment to the Nation, so he had an influence on me as a close cousin and they practiced the teachings of the Nation.  So, that's where the influence came from.  So, there was no pork in that household and you know we didn't use Crest toothpaste, you couldn't eat Twinkie bars, I mean there was a long list of things that had pork by-products in them.  So, my understanding of what not to do and how to live came by way of that experience which didn't really end until I was about nine years old.
Speaker 1: Are you saying Crest toothpaste has pork by-products?
Speaker 2: Well, back then that was the story.  Who knows?  I mean I haven't bothered to look it up, but as a child you had to be very clear about what even kinds of toothpaste you could put in your mouth.
Speaker 1: Well you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wouldn't be surprised because there are all sorts of weird ways in which you know pork products holds certain things together--like chicken sausage today is oftentimes in pork casements because it's a better way to hold the sausage even though what's inside of the casement is all chicken.
Speaker 1: That is fascinating, 'cause you think about the--that's really health, health conscious (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure, absolutely.
Speaker 1: I mean because Twinkies you can just let them sit.  I grew up on Twinkies.  You can let them sit they'll atrophy, I mean they're totally--I don't know what they're made of.  So.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father's brother's family.
Speaker 1: So she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) With whom I was incred- I'll give you one quick story to show you how close I was to, to them.  On a Mother's Day when I was about seven years old, as is true today, children make their moms their cards at school, they bring them home and this is what you give to your mother as a present, 'cause you've made it at school for her.  Well, my mother came to pick me up Mother's Day weekend on a Friday afternoon, and I had already given my aunt her Mother's Day card to which when I saw my mother and was reminded that she was my mom, I literally said, "I'm so sorry I forgot you were mother."  Now, I didn't mean it as a way to say--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --to make her feel bad or anything, it was a genuine mistake because I was very close to my aunt.  I mean she was very loving, very nurturing.  She, she made me feel that I was part of her household so it was only natural that I made this card.  I was excited, I gave it to her.
Story_ID: 522165
Speaker 1: But you know--but that's also interesting that you know that she had that very strong relationship--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --with your father's [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] family, you know with the family.  So, that never got broken in that way (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Never got broken, no.
Speaker 1: And very formative, 'cause I wa-
Speaker 2: And all of--so my father had four, five sisters and I, they're all my aunts, I know them to this day.  One has passed, but they, they treated my mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] like a sister.  They love my mother, they were very fond of her.  So, even though my mother never really adopted the Nation's [Nation of Islam] teachings and becoming a Muslim, they didn't hold that against her.  So, they, they and I was, and partly if they--if my mother didn't have a child with whom they were spending a lot of time with, it's possible that, that relationship would have atrophied.  She was no longer married to their brother, so you know why stay in touch?  But my father's sisters all took turns babysitting me and spending a lot of time with me.  So, and even my grandmother's [Eleanor Paschal Muhammad] household I'd spend it--I would go to my grandmother's house where my father grew up, I went to the same school [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] my mother went to.  The same school that was across the street from my father's at 82nd and St. Lawrence--83rd [Street] and St. Lawrence [Avenue] and I would go to my grandmother's house even though my mother was paying a babysitter to take care of me after school.  I was supposed to walk to Mrs. White's [ph.] house which was two blocks down Rhodes [Avenue], and instead I would walk a half a block across the street, knock on my grandmother's door and she'd say "Oh, baby come in," and she would call my mom and say, "Khalil [HistoryMaker Khalil Gibran Muhammad]," or K.G. was my nickname, "K.G. is here."  So, I can't discount the proximity and intimacy I had with my father's side of the family even though he wasn't around, his mother, his siblings and his nieces and nephews were all very nurturing and took care of me.
Story_ID: 522166
Speaker 1: So, from a religious standpoint how are you--what is your exposure?  Is your mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] in the church?  Are you, you know, what, what--? I'm just trying to underst- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  So you, so the analogy that I often use is that my father [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] and his siblings' relationship to the Nation [Nation of Islam] is often, not unlike preacher's children.  So, they're sort of, of it, but not necessarily in it, and in that way, I would say all of my paternal relatives haven't--have a--varying degrees of ambivalence to religion, some less than others, my father on the extreme.  And, so I picked up on that.  I mean it was clear as a child that, that where god mattered his name was Allah, but it wasn't--these were not pious people for the most part, and whatever piety they might have had I think was broken by virtue of the dissolution of the Nation as they understood it.  The most pious person was of course my Uncle Wallace [Wallace Muhammad; Warith Deen Mohammed] and his children and some of his brothers and sisters were much more pious than my grandfather [Nathaniel Muhammad, Sr.] and his children.  My mother's side were not really religious people.  They were at best, Easter Christians.  They, you know, so the old saying C and E Christians, we didn't even go to church on Christmas (laughter), so we did go to church on Easter and it was in mind as much about brunch and new suit or new clothes than it was anything else and they became more, sort of the broader family became more actively engaged in going to church and Christianity in my teen years, and I became a Christian at eighteen.  I became saved and in college [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I was a sophomore in college and I have been a pretty good churchgoing Christian ever since.
Speaker 1: So what faith or religion or--?
Speaker 2: I, so I joined a Congregationalist church at the time, and that was a--in some ways a product of (laughter), product of my father's third wife's family in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] where I was in college and I became very close to them and they received me like one of their own, and they were pious people and went to church all the time.  So, I would go over their place, we'd go to church on Sunday and that's the church I joined.  It's also true that I started dating a freshman when I was a sophomore in college and she was very religious and so that relationship was predicated on my--us being quote unquote, equally yoked, a phrase I didn't know until dating her.  So essentially, she required in some ways that, that I be a man of God, in particular a Christian, so between her and some of my other relative's sort of finding the church, that was the circumstance that brought me into the church.  I preferred A.M.E. [American Methodist Episcopal], one of my closest college friends was the son of an A.M.E. preacher.  So, when I was in Philadelphia, in college but even after college when I lived there, I would attend A.M.E. churches and volunteer my time to mentor some of the young people in those churches.
Story_ID: 522167
Speaker 1: Later, when my family, Stephanie [Stephanie Lawson-Muhammad] and I--so, so before I go, go to that when I came to Chicago [Illinois] at twenty-two, before I went back to graduate or go to graduate school [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] and come back to New Jersey, this is 1994.  This was really the continuation of my exposure to church when I was eighteen in college [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] when I became saved, and this a point at which I start to make these choices on my own.  So, my mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] was not a churchgoer, but some of her nieces and nephews had started to go to church.  The churches I went to were Apostolic Church of God [Chicago, Illinois], [HistoryMaker] Bishop Arthur Brazier's church, and eventually Trinity [Trinity United Church of Christ, Chicago, Illinois] under Jeremiah Wright [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr.], and Jerimiah Wright's church at the time was probably the most compelling church experience I'd ever had, particularly I was at that age in graduate school where sort of his prophetic tradition and critique gelled with what I was learning as a graduate student at the time and I would come back to Chicago during the summers at that time and I actually started taking my girlfriend, who is now my wife to that church.  She was not a native Chicagoan, so she didn't really have a strong church tradition in Chicago.  She did as a Baptist in, in the South in Florida.  So, when she through me started going to that church, even after I left, she was continuing to go to Trinity because I went back to New Jersey, she was still living in Chicago, and finally once we got married we eventually joined a Baptist church in New Jersey.  We left New Jersey, we moved to Indiana and became very much A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] and were very active in that church until we left.
Story_ID: 522168
Speaker 1: Tell me where you go to elementary school.  You're going to Dixon [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], is it--?
Speaker 2: I went to Dixon until I was in sixth grade and--
Speaker 1: What are you like as a little boy, though?  I mean, you know I the--when your mother's [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] leaving the temper tantrum you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --but what are you like and what's going on in your?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I was an incredibly curious kid.  I, I liked to read but I'm not obsessive about reading.  I like to explore as I described taking apart these electronics.  I'm a total conversationalist so, and that some of this I only know because my parents have told me stories a thousand times, but at the youngest of age I was an early reader and early speaker.  So, my mom brags that she taught me how to read at two, it's not verifiable, but I was an early reader, you know.  We'll just say that and I did skip a grade.  I didn't go to kindergarten, I entered school to go to first.  I went from pre-school to first grade although there was a law on the books in Illinois that five-year olds could not attend full day school.  I don't know where the law came from, but that was the law.  Which meant that at my elementary school, at Dixon I went to first grade in the morning from nine until noon.  Noon was all-school lunch time and recess, from one o'clock to three o'clock, I went to the kindergarten classroom as a kindergarten helper, and that was the way to split the difference because I was no longer in classroom instruction, but I was essentially being babysat by the kindergartener--the kindergarten teacher and a lot of the time, I really was a helper.  I could already read; I mean kindergarten is the time when you're supposed to read, but my mother said, "Look, this kid can read, why would he waste his time in kindergarten?"  So, I often took naps in the afternoon as well because I wasn't--I was young and kindergarteners didn't go the whole day so the point being that I was always interested in talking.  My mom says that I would speak to strangers.  You know we'd--she'd take me to the playground, I'd be swinging in the swings.  Some adult would come up with their kid and I'd strike up a conversation with the adult rather than the kid 'cause the kid wasn't talking but the adult was.  So, that part I think is very much formative to my personality being outgoing, being engaging.
Story_ID: 522169
Speaker 1: I learned pretty early on, by seventh grade, that I had a, a gift for elocution, and that was somewhat by accident.  I went to--I left Dixon [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] to go to Morgan Park High School [Chicago, Illinois] for a gifted program.  There were I think three or four in the city.  Kenwood [Kenwood Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] had one, it was one of the early ones.  Whitney Young [Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, Chicago, Illinois] had one, of course that is where the first lady [Michelle Obama] went to school.  Lane Tech [Lane Technical College Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois] on the North Side and Morgan Park, and these were all sort of geographically located, north, west, near south and far South Side.  So, I couldn't go to Kenwood because by the time I was applying to these programs where my mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] was, I lived in the neighborhood, I was a neighborhood kid.  So, often these schools sought racial and geographic diversity, but to Morgan Park I lived far away.  Long and short, I'm in this advanced program for so-called gifted kids.  By seventh grade I'm essentially taking algebra, freshman English--I think those were the two--and biology.  By eighth grade here I'm taking sophomore English, geometry, whatever the next offering is, chemistry or something.  So, the point is by the time you got to high school as a freshman, you already had two years potentially of credits beneath your belt which simply opened up your schedule to take lots of AP [advanced placement] or to finish high school early.  So, in that context I thrived--I, very self-motivated, very outgoing but back to this elocution, our seventh grade class had a speech contest and I guess it was to get us to learn how to speak publicly so I signed up for it and I remember to this day in the bathroom in my apartment.  By this time, we lived in Hyde Park in Regents Park on Lake Shore Drive.  I was practicing a speech, a campaign speech that Adlai Stevenson [Adlai Stevenson II] had given who was an Illinois senator [sic.] in the 1950s who ran for president and I didn't know that much about Adlai Stevenson.  I have no idea how I came upon this speech, maybe a teacher recommended it, but of all the people to practice a speech for a black kid growing up on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois], what a strange choice.  In any case, I won the speech contest and I must've made such an impression on the teachers that a year later when it was time to pick the valedictorian speech, speaker, I was selected even though I was not the valedictorian, and of course, Vickie Samuels [ph.], who was the valedictorian (laughter) was not happy about that, but they wanted to represent the class well and so they put me in that position even though I did not have the highest GPA [grade point average] in the class.  I was obviously, somewhere in the top ten or twenty of my class, but by the standards of who gets to be valedictorian I was not so.  So, that's a lot about sort of how my personality was.
Story_ID: 522170
Speaker 1: I was very active in terms of sports.  I started playing tennis at nine because my father [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] started taking me out during my summers.  He lived in Jamaica, Queens [New York] at the time.  He'd wake me up at six thirty in the morning and take me to Cunningham Park [Queens, New York], where he'd feed me balls, teach me how to play and we'd be back by seven thirty and he'd be off to work.  Sometimes I'd go with him, and sometimes I didn't, but he and my mom [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] had played as a couple and tennis was very popular amongst that generation of African Americans, primarily because of Arthur Ashe, not unlike Tiger Woods' influence on African Americans today.  So, everybody you know who was aspiring middle class or solidly middle class or upper income were playing tennis and I never put my racket down until I went to college [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], still play to this day.  Loved it, it's about part of being sort of self-directed and driven and curious.  I also had a huge appetite for money.  I just liked having it, I've wanted to save it, I liked spending it so, I was a little bit of a hustler as a kid.
Speaker 2: In what way?
Speaker 1: Well, I was the kid and I don't think kids do this much anymore, but I was a kid who you might run into at a gas station who would ask you if they could pump your gas (laughter).  And, so this is a concept that neither of my parents would ever have approved of.  They did not know that I was doing this, but my mom tells the story that early on when people would ask me you know, "What do you wanna be when you grow up?"  Rather than saying some kind of professional, I would say a gas station attendant and the reason why I wanted to be a gas station attendant is because back they pulled out gigantic wads of money and I thought well, if they have all of that money then that's what I want to be.  My interest in getting some of that money also led me into door-to-door sales at a young age.  So, by the time we moved to Regents Park [Chicago, Illinois] which is a thirty-three story, twenty apartments on each floor.  A gigantic apartment complex with two twin buildings, so lots of potential customers, I was the kid who would show up on, at your doorstep, knock, knock, knock, "Who is it?"  "Ma'am I'm here to offer you an opportunity to buy greeting cards or candy."  And so (laughter) I was selling greeting cards and candies to my neighbor and most of them went along and, so, I, I sold lots of stuff and when you turned in the sales you could get one or two things, a prize based on the total amount of sales or money.  You know some small commission or a percentage of your sales.  My mom tells the story of course, that one year I lost the list of people to whom I'd sold all the stuff and we did a pretty good job of reconstructing the list 'cause we kind of knew where people lived and which floor and which apartment, but some people we didn't and we would see them on the elevator and they'd say "Hey, kid where's my," (laughter) "where's my stuff--?"

Speaker 1: That desire to save, I remember opening my first bank account.  I was very young eight or nine, my mom [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] gave me a weekly allowance, led me to be interested in an opportunity at twelve when a small business owner, a guy who had given me a part-time or substitute tennis lesson at the local health club where I was taking wintertime group lessons; he wasn't my primary instructor but he was a sub.  Saw me on the street with another friend and said, "Hey, guys you wanna make a little money?  I'm opening a business soon. I could use some help cleaning up the place."  I'm twelve years old, it's right there on 53rd [Street] and Harper [Court] where Hyde Park Computers [Chicago, Illinois] was for a long time across the street from Benneton [United Colors of Benneton] and Starbucks, now it's a restaurant, but he bought the place.  It was an African clothing store and was renovating it to turn it into a computer store and this was 1984.  Now, why does that matter?  Because 1984 is the year that Apple essentially invented the personal computer; that was the first Macintosh.  IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] had long been in the game but most of their sales were corporate sales of mainframe computers.  So, the IBM PC market was just getting started but not quite where it would be and most people, vast majority of people did not own computers at the time.  So, I started that day or the next day literally taking out trash, breaking down boxes.  I started painting the ceiling on a tall ladder as the tiniest person in the place.  I never left that establishment until I went to college [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] more than five years later, and I did just about everything you could do there from helping to open the store and doing small tasks all over the place to building the furniture.  Once we opened the store, we had to build computers, I built those machines, they were all custom-built at the time.  I was the lead sales person.  My joke is that I was kind of a Doogie Howser of the establishment, the Neil Patrick Harris '80s [1980s] sitcom ['Doogie Howser, M.D.'] of him being a fifteen-year old doctor and the magic of this moment was that he opened the store in the community to serve the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and a very vibrant middle class and professional community, so everyone was a sitting duck, because most people had no relationship, tangible relationship to personal computers.  A lot of people had, had worked on a terminal at some point at work for one reason or another and even in seventh grade [at Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] I remember we learned mainframe computing and some light programming because that was becoming part of an educational experience, but every person that walked in that store--if I walked up to 'em as a twelve or thirteen-year and said, "Hey, are you interested in personal computers?" They'd say, "Yeah, well show me something."  So, I would show them Word Perfect, something we don't use much anymore, it was before Microsoft Word and the screen would come to life.  I would type a few sentences, bold the text, center it, the kinds of things that you know you couldn't really do easily on a typewriter or even a word processor.  Hit print and it was like a miracle for people.  It was magic and so those computes were flying out of there like hot cakes, and I was one of the lead salesmen precisely it was my age that was so compelling because these things could be intimidating you know.  "How'd you do that?"  "Well, if he can learn to do it, surely I can teach myself."  So, I, I stayed there, I sold, I became assistant manager, I was the bookkeeper, I was the payroll clerk.  I made daily deposits, I opened the store with a buddy of mine all by myself on Mondays which was the day we traditionally close 'cause we had Saturday hours, but the owner who became a mentor and a very good friend trusted me enough as a fifteen-year old to open the store and to close it on the same day, and that experience not only fueled my interest in making money.  I made lots of money as an employee, but also fueled my interest in being a business person because I was having this formative experience.  I had a mentor who was a small business owner.
Speaker 2: And his name again?
Speaker 1: His name was Jonathan Schuman [ph.], Jewish kid from Edison, New Jersey who went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] to become of all things--wait for it, a historian (laughter).  He drops out of the Ph.D. program in history at the University of Chicago because he'd inherited some money from his grandparents who were fairly well-to-do and decided to open this business store--I mean this computing store and so in the end he becomes a business person, and influences me but I end up shifting to history to finish the work that he didn't complete.
Story_ID: 522172
Speaker 1: Did you ever think of science?  And the only reason I say that, we've interviewed a lot of scientists and the whole description of tearing things apart and putting them back together again and so were you good, so did you think of that as--was there every any interest in science?
Speaker 2: I think there probably was but, a couple of things.  I didn't do very well in chemistry (laughter), I think I averaged with a C average.  I had a hard time in chemistry.  That was the only science I ever had a hard time in.  I think the business was so much more compelling than science just as a means of making a living.  I also didn't have any exposure really to anyone in the medical field or who was a scientist and in the way in which I was so much overexposed to business and you know kids really shouldn't be working at twelve so I was paid completely off the books.  So, in a way that I was overexposed to business.  I was underexposed to someone in the professional sciences.  Now, there was a way in which these two things worked together and that is to emphasize my appetite for building and taking things apart was absolutely fed through computers.  I mean, I could build a computer from scratch, not a circuit boards so let me--these were all pre-manufactured products that went inside of another unit, but in, in my ability at that age which was unusual for most children, most young people to understand memory, storage, computing and general software, DOS operating systems [disk operating system], even some light programming was in its own way a kind of engineering practice that I was very comfortable with and actually enjoyed.  Now, I will say that how I think as a historian, and ultimately my interest in history is another way of taking things apart and putting them back together again.
Speaker 1: No, I'm, I'm fascinated by that and I also know that Hyde Park, Hyde Park Computers [Chicago, Illinois] was the place.
Speaker 2: It was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The place.
Speaker 2: It was a major deal at that time.  So, if anyone at that point and this is for posterity's sake 'cause who knows what the world will be in our now-Internet age and I'll be a post-Internet age, whatever that will look like.  This was a time before the Internet.  So, the idea that you actually lived in a world without computers for most people, that it wasn't a household appliance, it wasn't something we take for granted.  This was the moment to see it go from essentially nothing in our households to everything.
Story_ID: 522173
Speaker 1: So your mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl], 'cause the distance between where you live, which is a nice building [Regents Park, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That is huge.
Speaker 2: It's still there today.
Speaker 1: No, it's still (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And she lives there today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That building is viewed as--I mean it's kept itself up, it's the place that people--I think there are pools, aren't there swimming pools I the building?
Speaker 2: There was a swimming a long--no, yeah of course, yeah, no I take that back. Yes, it used to be in a different location.  Yeah, there's a swimming pool, a health club, there's a restaurant.  One quick story, [HistoryMaker] James Earl Jones, was staying there--no, I guess it wasn't James Earl Jones, his father, Robert.
Speaker 1: Robert Earl Jones.
Speaker 2: Robert Earl Jones was performing in a play at the Goodman Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] and I've always had--no one's tested this, but I--essentially, I say I have a photographic memory.  So, I am, I can recognize faces across age, so if you showed me a picture--if someone showed me a picture of you as a small girl, I might recognize you.  Maybe more so than the average person.  So, I recognized Robert Earl Jones, I'm not quite sure how I recognized him, but I recognized him and I said aren't you James Earl Jones' father and he looked down at me, a gigantic man.  I was a little kid, not just in age, but in size.  Looks down at me and he says, "Yes, I am," and we struck up a conversation.  We talked for about twenty minutes.  I remember it as distinct today.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I was maybe ten or eleven, I was very young, and I had met his more, his more, in a sense famous son at the time but he was incredibly pleasant, but that's who I was.  I was the kid who would recognize someone and rather than say, "Oh, look," or just get a signature, we had a conversation.  Now, I say this because the building was often home to those kinds of people, to entertainers and stars and actors when they needed temporary housing, a little more comfortable than a hotel and a little bit off the beaten path and so Robert, I remember Robert Earl Jones, [HistoryMaker] Malcolm-Jamal Warner stayed in the building at some point during my childhood.  There, there might have been others, but those two in particular stand out.
Speaker 1: That's some, that's somewhat extraordinary.
Speaker 2: It is pretty cool (laughter).
Speaker 1: I mean 'cause not a lot of people know his father and I was even telling him yesterday that I had heard some rumors of his father you know in Chicago [Illinois], so anyway.
Story_ID: 522174
Speaker 1: What else is forming you though as a young person in terms of music or the world at large?  What are--what is forming you in your you know j- 'cause this is hip hop, right?
Speaker 2: This is hip hop, but this is a confession so I was not a hip hop head (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I figured, I figured you weren't because you're doing all these other things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I was, and I actually have regrets because I envy my generation, people my age who are in their early forties and hip-hop turned forty a few years ago, so, in a sense it is the moment that marks my generation as a Gen-Xer as opposed to Motown for baby boomers and I was into pop music.  So, in some ways (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, what, what--
Speaker 2: --I was exposed to jazz on the one hand and R&B certainly with my mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl], and I enjoyed both, but I listened to--probably my favorite artist as a child was Phil Collins (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I listened to Madonna, I listened to Duran Duran.  Some groups you know that perhaps many people wouldn't know about today, Culture Club, all of that music which was essentially pop music of the '80s [1980s], a lot of big hair, men in make-up, not quite punk, but the look was different.  It was the music that I--was my music.  It was what I enjoyed.  Now, what's interesting about that, but I was surrounded by people who were into rap.  So, I had a cousin who was deejaying parties when deejaying parties was a new thing.  He had this entire setup in his basement, it was a big deal.  I remember seeing Kurtis Blow at a small bar or cabaret place in 1979 just off of 79th [Street] and Stony Island [Avenue], you know White Castle is there on the corner and just north of White Castle there, and I remember my closest friend in high school [Kenwood Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], a guy named Ben Austen [ph.], we became best buds, we're still buddies today.  He, he was a hip-hop head so he was listening to Boogie Down Productions, and Tupac [Tupac Shakur] and all the music of the late '80s [1980s] early '90s [1990s], he was dressing in hip-hop fashion.  He had a gold chain, I didn't, and he was a white Jewish kid, or Jewish kid.  So, it was a study in contrast.  I was more nerdy, Ben and I never took class together.  I was all in honors, and besides being in honors classes, I was also kind of two years ahead of all of my peers because of that experience.  So, I was more like in appearance a kind of a Carlton Banks to a Will Smith even though my--I didn't, I wasn't corny in that way, but I definitely was, you know I worked all the time, five days a week.  I was in school, I was a very good student.  I had a sport and I had you know all these interests.
Speaker 1: And your sport was?
Speaker 2: My sport was tennis.
Speaker 1: So, tennis, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Which is a different sport too in a way you know it's--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's a different--right, it's a different sport too.
Story_ID: 522175
Speaker 1: I wanted to play tennis, I mean so I wanted to play basketball in seventh grade but my mom [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] said no because I was bused to the school far away and if I had practice I would have to take the public bus back home and this was the you know, crack [crack cocaine] '80s [1980s] so you know concern about public safety and fear of crimes, always part of my childhood, and very much a part of my mother thinking about me.
Speaker 2: But not, not the Chicago [Illinois] of today where she would be even, she wouldn't even let you out of her sight in some respects?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there's a kind of irony and contradiction.  That Chicago was definitely more violent, but I still had more freedom.  Today's Chicago is safer but there, the anxieties and fear of crime is I would argue greater.
Speaker 2: Oh, wait you're saying that Chicago, that Chicago you grew up in was more violent?
Speaker 1: Oh, sure by just statistically in the aggregate.
Speaker 2: Oh, no people say--I've heard a judge, who was a judge say that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's a fact.
Speaker 2: That numbers, but I mean he also said that this is uncontrolled violence, you know he said.
Speaker 1: So, there's something to be said about the nature of the violence has changed, and there's a lot of reasons for that, but the way that it expresses itself means that there's more unpredictable, innocent bystander violence, meaning that people who have nothing to do with whatever is actually going on are ending up dead as opposed to then where it was a little bit more gang focused and therefore if you kind of navigated your spaces smartly, you could kind of stay away from it.  Today, the fear is that you could just be walking down the street like Dwyane Wade's cousin [Nykea Aldridge] and pushing your stroller with your kid in it and end up dead, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That right.  That's right.
Story_ID: 522176
Speaker 1: I do need to ask the question about your, your name and if ever anyone asked you about your name or that it wasn't relevant or even your mother.  Your mother has Muhammad in her name?
Speaker 2: Only because she kept her married name.
Speaker 1: I see. Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was a Satterfield and became a Muhammad and kept her name.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.
Speaker 2: Because it was a name--she never discarded the name so her, essentially her entire professional life was defined by being Kimberly Muhammad [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl].
Speaker 1: Okay, and then the other thing that is--but did people ask you about your name?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, so, so because I have Khalil Gibran, even before the question about Muhammad, early on teachers would ask me you know, "Were you named for the Prophet?  Do you know who the prophet is?  Do you know who the Lebanese poet is?"  And I would say, "Yes."  My seventh-grade teacher gave me a copy of 'The Prophet' [Kahlil Gibran] for the first time as a, as a graduation gift.  Actually, she was my seventh and eighth grade teacher.  So, people often took--were curious about, "Who named you?"  And, "How did you get that name?"  And, "Where'd that name come from?"  When the Muhammad was thrown in, there was often a question of, "Well, did you--did you adopt the name?"  So, the idea that I was born into this name was very unusual for people you know who encountered me in the 1970s when this was still a bit new.
Speaker 1: And people were adopting?
Speaker 2: And people were adopting names.  So, that then led to conversation like, "Oh, you're the Nation of Islam, oh, wow. Well, how--?"  So, between a very--it turns out the aunt who I gave the Mother's Day card to was the person who suggested my name, and my parents said, "That's a great idea."  And.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Ella, Ella Muhammad.
Speaker 1: Ella Muhammad, okay.
Speaker 2: And she's, she's wonderful.  She's still with us and I'm still close to her.
Story_ID: 522177
Speaker 1: I have one more follow-up that explains something that, that is important, quickly.  The young man who became my best friend who was more into hip-hop as a Jewish kid than I was, his father was a professor at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], retired about five, ten years ago.  He was a historian, and one year during one of Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] infamous strikes he was so concerned about his son not being well educated at the local public school because he could have very well sent his two sons to lab schools, but he was committed to public education and so his kids went to Ray [William H. Ray Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], and then to Kenwood [Kenwood Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], but because of the strike and this would've been about 1987, it lasted through the entire month of September.  So, by, maybe the first week of September when it was clear that negotiations weren't proceeding, he threatened to take Ben [Ben Austen (ph.)] out of Kenwood, put him in lab unless Ben and I agreed to four hours of study every day, which he made up a curriculum.  So, he sent us to Regenstein Library [Joseph Regenstein Library] at the University of Chicago, and our job was to read.  We ended up reading a book called 'The Crucial Decade' ['The Crucial Decade: America 1945-1955'] by William Golden [sic. Eric F. Goldman].  I think that's the author's name and to write the term paper based on our readings, and I distinctly remember sitting in the stacks with Ben and you know we would play and giggle and be silly, but we'd also would read, and I remember writing my paper and turning it in to him and I remember him giving me praise and positive feedback on it, but it was one of those things where I was exposed to history.  I mean his reading was a monograph, it wasn't, it was nothing that you would ever read in high school, but for the fact that a history professor, he was an Africanist rather than a U.S. historian, but would give to a fifteen-year old in high school.
Speaker 2: His father was an Africanist?
Speaker 1: He's an Africanist, Ralph Austen [Ralph A. Austen] is his name, now he's Jewish but his field was particularly East Africa and Cameroon in particular.  So, that experience mattered because later in college [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] when I was thinking about making a career change I talked to him about going to graduate school and he was very much a mentor and the shift that I made away from a career in business to a career in academia.  So, who knows what you know how to fully measure the fact that, that experience and exposure to him.  I do know that the only AP [advanced placement] class that I actually took in high school was an AP U.S. history class and I passed it and got credit for it in college, so on and so forth.
Speaker 2: So, did he ever ask you about your Nation of Islam connection or did he know of it?
Speaker 1: I'm sure he knew of it.
Speaker 2: He knew of it, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Either it was a question or it came up in conversation.  Everyone knew.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean, it was--it wasn't a secret.
Story_ID: 522178
Speaker 1: So when do you get to Kenwood [Kenwood Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] from Morgan Park [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois], 'cause the last thing you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My freshman year.
Speaker 1: So, okay so you went to Morgan Park until and then you, then you went to Kenwood?
Speaker 2: That's right and the only difference was that I was in a special program for seventh and eighth graders, and I might have stayed there as most of my peers did, but because Kenwood was a very good public school and it was a neighborhood school, I could to Kenwood as a freshman.  I couldn't go as a seventh grader.
Speaker 1: You know what I find interesting is that there was a time when we interview at the age that we interview people, you're much younger, they--people were passed, you know they would pass grades but this is not as common.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That you know, but I think--is it because your mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] also worked for CPS [Chicago Public Schools] and she also maybe could help navigate (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think so, yeah.  I mean there was a test, so you had to pass the test, but I think she knew the right people to call and people could put in a good word and so things definitely happened, although it worked against her on two occasions.  Once she tried to take--and it tells you a little bit about the time because she was a black woman teaching in public education at a time when the teaching ranks of black women was growing significantly.  I mean even to this day it's still not--it's not over represented 80 percent of public teachers across America are still white, but at the time my mother was, was starting to be part, she was part of a cohort of educated, college educated teachers in the public school system around the country and this was a desegregated time so this is early 1970s.  She was teaching at a North Side [Chicago, Illinois] school as a black woman with predominately white students.  She wanted me to go to that school, and she worked out a deal with principal at that school to allow me to come.  The principal said okay you know like--yes, and so to the point of it being an earlier time when you could pass grades and there was a lot of discretion in the system, this happened, guess who objected?  The parents.  So, the parents challenged my right to be a student there and essentially said you know, "He doesn't live in our neighborhood, he can't go to school here."
Speaker 1: So what school is that?
Speaker 2: I can't remember the school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay,
Speaker 2: Yeah but it was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But that's when you were younger?
Speaker 2: That's when I would have been at Dixon [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], so maybe I was in second or third grade.  I think that's important because it, it not only puts us back into a Chicago [Illinois] that's incredibly segregated.  I mean I'm describing this sort of idyllic childhood, but it's a cocoon because inside of that segregated space you know, black people are working for black people.  Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] is, is also exceptional by this time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because it is a kind of a racially integrated community that is very unusual for the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And really probably at that point still, unusual for the whole city.
Speaker 2: I think so, and arguably one of the few places like Teaneck, New Jersey for example or Montclair [New Jersey] that are pretty exceptional in general.  It's not a suburb, it's a neighborhood but some of those suburban communities also stand out for the willingness of, of oftentimes the kind of plurality of Jews to live in integrated communities with African Americans (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 522179
Speaker 1: Are you aware of like the--well, when you're young the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] years or after, I mean are you hearing (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm starting, yes--so, the best example of this comes from when my father [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] was in New York [New York] working for Newsday I was even more engaged in worldly events and coming of age, and I wrote an article that was published in Newsday in a column that they had where I critiqued the air traffic controllers or I critique Reagan's firing of the air traffic controllers, and I drew--to this day I can still see the image of the airplane in the tower that I drew that accompanied the article.  So, it was my first op-ed in a newspaper.  So, yes, I was thinking about the world, I wrote a piece that was published on the Falkland Islands controversy.  So, I wouldn't say I was overly journalistic as a child, but I also took interests in things that caught my attention and for one reason or another was compelled to write about it.
Story_ID: 522180
Speaker 1: I mean maybe it's the '90s [1990s] that there's just money, I mean--you know there was money flowing at one point like that's why we ended up with no money (laughter).  It's a little later, maybe but like where there's money, you know there's money, everything is you know, how fancy can it be?  I--this is really, this is the '80s [1980s] and you know there's--
Speaker 2: Gold chains got bigger and bigger.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Cars got fancier.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean, in many ways that first generation of post-civil rights, so if you think about 1980 as a kind of generational milestone.  So, if you had been a teenager in the Civil Rights Movement, now you were an adult, and if you were fortunate to have benefitted from the opening up of various institutions, either in higher education or in Corporate America for the people, black people in particular were seeing the kind of opportunity and money that their parents had never experienced.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Even the difference between southern and northern experiences, although my, my parents [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl and HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] were both second generation, many others weren't.  So, to come from the South and land in a place like Chicago [Illinois], whether it was civil service work or corporate work and to have a, a legitimate four-year degree, really was a big, big deal and for the children to be witness to their parent's success.  So, here I was, the child of two professionals which I can say on both sides of my family, no other cousin had that.  The closest thing is I had a cousin who had two parents who were police officers, but my father's oldest brother [Nathaniel Muhammad, Jr.] whose family I stayed with, and when I say he construction worker.  A few others became nurses and teachers but you know it was very unusual to have a very successful father working for major newspapers and a mother who had a very healthy career in the school system.  She--again, she moved from the classroom to administration at some point.
Speaker 1: Which is very secure and you know teachers were also, you know viewed as a pillar of--
Speaker 2: That's right and, and guaranteed pension plans (laughter).
Speaker 1: And guaranteed pension plans, which we're fighting over now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When we all--. Right, yes.  So yes, I'd say 1980s were formative in terms of the air that everyone was breathing and the way that sort of some of the lessons handed down, I think.
Story_ID: 522181
Speaker 1: And maybe my experience was a little bit distinct because I had a father [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] who was a little bit of an outlier in terms of his own consciousness, but--
Speaker 2: So, can you talk about that a little bit because you've referenced that?
Speaker 1: Well I just mean, I, I said it earlier to the extent that he was reading very widely, he was reading the left in particular both literature and journalism and he was going to meet--the first time I went to the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York], Deb Willis [HistoryMaker Deborah Willis] tells this story because she remembers it.  Now, I don't really--I remember being there, I don't remember her, but she describes me as this pint-sized kid who was maybe nine or ten and some--I think it was her show, it was up and that's the kind of experience I had thirty years ago that maybe now is more formative to children, but then you had to be a little bit avant-garde, maybe avant-garde is too strong a saying, but you had to be conscious, right.  You had to say, "The Studio is an important place," right.  It's not the place it is today, it had--you had to seek these places out or the South Shore art center [South Shore Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois], places where very thoughtful, engaged conscious black people had invested in, my father was doing that as part of childhood, so I had that exposure.  But for people I went to college with, I went to the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Ivy League school--I'd say most of my peer group.  The vast majority of my peer group they didn't have that counter-balance.  So, they went to college and expected to come out as professionals and expected to make lots of money.  They, they were far more successful financially than most of their parents.  Occasionally, you had the child of a doctor or the child of a lawyer, I mean they--those people were there, but most of them their parents were preachers or teachers or maybe at best mid-level managers.  I mean there, there--it skewed at least college educated, but the kids were gonna go on to be investment bankers and definitely to be physicians and definitely to be lawyers, and that's who they are today.  The guys I lived with college, of the three of them, two of them are managing directors, one in investment bank, the other one in a consulting firm.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: And I was the one that was angry most of the time when there was a reason to be (laughter), when there was a reason to be angry about something having to do with racism, you know, in that mix I was the first one to say, "We gotta do something about this."

Speaker 1: Let's go back.  How do you get to the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] from Chicago [Illinois]?  So, what--?
Speaker 2: Pretty, pretty simple thing, so Penn came and recruited at my school [Kenwood Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], and I was exposed to the university through the recruitment person and they handed out some promotional literature.  Penn had one thing going for it in a way that the other three schools I applied to, so I applied to essentially one safety, and then three reach schools.  Well, really two reach schools, one middling school, University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] which was a safety, the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] which was kind of the middle school, Northwestern [Northwestern University] in Evanston [Illinois] and Penn.  So, you think about leaving home, I wasn't thinking about going very far.  Penn was an outlier, and the reason why Penn was an outlier was one, I was exposed to it and two, my father [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] lived in New York [New York], and so I thought if I went to Penn I'd be close to my dad.  Penn also had an early admissions process and a minority recruitment weekend.  So, they were investing at the time and this was a big deal in the mid-'80s [1980s] in terms of increasing enrollment, the kinds of conversations we're having now about race on campus.  That minority weekend blew me away, I mean like I went to step shows, I stayed with a couple of seniors who were the coolest guys on earth.  I enjoyed class, I thought the campus was beautiful, plus my father had just married someone [Lisa Redd Muhammad] who was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and she had lots of family in there.  So, when I got into Penn it--I--it was the only place I wanted to go.
Speaker 1: So, that--this is 1989?
Speaker 2: I matriculated in 1989, that's right.
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-nine [1989] so, tell me--
Speaker 2: This is a funny story, it might furrow some brows depending who's watching this one day, but it does show you a little bit of how affirmative action--it wasn't the earliest days but it was a decade within which affirmative action in higher ed [higher education] was still establishing itself.  So, at the University of Michigan, a public state school that could be a little bit more discriminating against out-of-state students sent me a waitlist when I applied.  I got into Illinois, I got into Northwestern, but Michigan sent me a waitlist.  When I reviewed the notice of being waitlisted, I noticed that they had me down as white so it was obviously a mistake.  I sent back a note saying I was African American and within two weeks I got into the University of Michigan (laughter).  I didn't end up going, but that tells you something about the times, and how the schools were really thinking about you know, what can we do in a tangible way to increase the percentage of minority students?  So, Penn had minority recruitment weekend which was a way of saying, "We're gonna fly you to campus and show you a good time," which, that's all I needed.  Michigan got a hold of a student who they thought maybe, you know isn't so exceptional in terms of our pool of white candidates, but as a black candidate we want this kid, so.
Story_ID: 522183
Speaker 1: Who are the people that you meet there?  And, you know I was sort of interested in your description about the parents of the children, because there, maybe there now you find a different you know type of thing?  That they're professional, maybe they're going to private schools, so we're still in this transitional period in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think so, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what is, what is the student body like, and--?
Speaker 2: At the time?
Speaker 1: At the time.
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's mixed.  So, you have a small number I think of first-generation college students.  I was not one of them, both my parents [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl and HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] had gone to school, but maybe in some ways you had a mixture of maybe one parent in the household had gone to college and another parent hadn't, and then maybe the other extreme you had two very successful professional parents.  Maybe one's a doctor, one's a lawyer, kind of the Huxtable situation.  I would put that on the sort far end of the bell curve.  So, I think most of these kids were kids who were sort of one and a half generation, first generation college, maybe one parent had gone to college, often maybe even single parent who was raising their children and had a chance to do something for their kid that they didn't have, which was to go away.  I mean just being away for most of these kids was a big deal I think, and my peer group in particular, most of us had come from other places.  We were not local Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] children going to Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And I would say that it, that we were--Penn was a little bit of a party school as an Ivy.  So, I think it wasn't a culture like the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] which is notorious for having you know a very academically-focused culture.  Penn was a kind of fun school and there were fraternities on campus, I joined one as a freshman, a lot of places, particularly HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] wouldn't even allow, don't allow freshman to, to become part of a fraternity (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  So, which, which fraternity?
Speaker 2: I am a Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], so I joined in 19--spring of 1990 and that was a big, big part of my college experience.  It gave me some leadership training, there was a lot of mentoring, both good and bad mentoring from (laughter) the big brothers, but they took seriously the idea of scholarship and service to, to the community.  So, we visited nursing homes, we did a scholarship ball, we took pride in our appearance and our, sort of the way that we carried ourselves.  They took seriously that we needed to do well in school, and those guys who were my big brothers at the time were anywhere from two to five, ten years older than me.  A lot of those guys are really successful.
Speaker 1: Like--
Speaker 2: Most of them in the business and consulting world, lawyers.
Story_ID: 522184
Speaker 1: Give some examples of people?
Speaker 2: By name or--?
Speaker 1: By name (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, so Valentino Carlotti, for example is very successful.  He was not my, he didn't go to Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and I didn't know him at the time, but he's good friends with a guy named Jose Tavarez, and I don't know which firm Jose works for, but Jose is very successful financially and he's the senior person at some bank and Valentino and Jose run in those same circles.  I have, my closest friend is an ear, nose and throat surgeon in Houston [Texas] from college, Garfield Johnson, very successful and I remember the day--he was actually the son of a physician to give you an example.  His father was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] preacher, OBGYN [obstetrics and gynecology], and his mother was a school teacher from, from the Detroit [Michigan] area and he--so, he was a little bit of the exception in this instance, he was from Bloomfield, Michigan [Bloomfield Hills, Michigan], like you know who's from Bloomfield, Michigan.  Now, the black woman in 'Hamilton' ['Hamilton: An American Musical,' Lin Manuel-Miranda], who won the Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre], Renee [Renee Elise Goldsberry], I've forgotten Renee's last name, she was a high school classmate at Cranbrook [Cranbrook Schools] in Bloomfield Hills [Michigan], which is the same community that Romney [Mitt Romney] went to.  So, so there was that, that sort of pocket that I think was on the far right of the bell curve, but he's successful.  I mentioned two of my roommates are managing directors, so I don't, I didn't have--I don't think any of my Penn classmates became famous unlike R. Kelly who went to Kenwood [Kenwood Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] (laughter), famous and infamous.  So, maybe I'm missing somebody but I don't think anyone has sort of celebrity status who I went to school with, but, but a lot of those folks are incredibly successful.
Speaker 1: So, you at this point in time that you're there, what is the, what percentage are the, is the African American population and then all (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One thing, one quick thing: John Legend.  Now, John Legend didn't go there when I went there, but he came a little bit after me, so that--he's probably of that milieu (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was--
Speaker 2: And this neat thing about John Legend which is a little bit of a Penn story, he went into management consulting right after college which many people don't know.  He worked at a firm in Boston [Massachusetts].  He had always had his music career on the side and had been performing in churches to make money, he'd sort of been the music minister at a number of churches in the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] area, but as he tells it, I've talked to him about this, he says that--I said, "Why'd you go to Penn, it's not particularly know for music?"  He said, "Well I had the music thing."  Like he'd grown up a Pentecostalist community and he was playing all for the church as young as five or whatever and so from a performance standpoint, by the time he went to college he didn't need to--he didn't need anything more in terms of music education.  He wanted to round out his education so that he'd have another career if the music thing didn't work out, and so that was, that's the kind of thing that Penn provided.  Wharton School of Business [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was there, I mean this was, this was the culture of Penn in that way.  Even Donald Trump [President Donald John Trump] went to Penn in the 1980s, so it was a place for the children of--striving or professional parents who wanted to send their kids to a place where they, you know they could get an education and, and succeed.
Story_ID: 522185
Speaker 1: Was that at the point, because now students are able to come into the business school almost immediately?
Speaker 2: They, they had that then so--
Speaker 1: Now, how did you choose economics?
Speaker 2: Because I didn't know much about the Wharton School of Business [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for an undergraduate at the time so I picked a major that was closest to giving me a general business education.
Speaker 1: And was that--there's a program that Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] has now that's a summer program that brings students in for business training and but maybe it wasn't, it didn't exist at that time.  I, I want to--so, what about the East Coast influence?  I know you've been spending summers in New York [New York], so that's not unusual to you, but was there a difference?  Were--a lot of the students were more East Coast focused, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, was that any difference from you know, your coming in from the Midwest, and?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I mean it's definitely true that a lot of kids I went to school with were from New Jersey, from New York City.  Of my three roommates, one was born in Newark [New Jersey], one was born in Ridgewood, New Jersey and the other one was essentially born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], but by two or three grew up in Staten Island, New York.  So, no question that the East Coast was the most represented in terms of the community of students that I was part of.  I would say that music mattered so rap was definitely--so the culture of rap was even more intense and prominent, the kind of music and the way people partied was a little bit different than Chicago [Illinois].  So, Chicago's tradition, the one that then formed my high school [Kenwood Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] years, was house music and although hip-hop was in the air and was becoming prominent, we had this house music that was not replicated most other places, and in that sense, even something like stepping which you well know what it is but that was not a tradition.  So, I grew up stepping with my mom [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] and my aunts and even by the time I was of dating age you know, you'd go to an oldies, but goodies party or even a lounge on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and everyone would break out and start stepping. None of that was happening on the East Coast.  So, I'd say the culture of music and partying was definitely distinctive on the East Coast.  And then some of the, some of the networks of, of sort of social climbing were different.  I came to learn that more after college than I did then but there were many more kids who were the children of Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] communities on the East Coast and in terms of my relationship to my peers and that was true for my set in Chicago.
Story_ID: 522186
Speaker 1: Tell me about the water buffalo incident?
Speaker 2: Well, that--
Speaker 1: That's, that's your, that's by your what, junior year?
Speaker 2: It starts my--
Speaker 1: Sophomore?
Speaker 2: I wanna say it starts my, my senior year, pretty sure it starts the senior year.  So, in January the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] are celebrating their Founder's Day.  They are finishing up with a ceremony in the courtyard, which is a high-rise courtyard, so sort of one part of campus has three high rises that form a courtyard and of course, you can imagine in, in a situation like this with these tall buildings all forming a kind of circle, voices carry.  So, they're singing in the tradition of their chapter, and someone, many people raised their windows and start telling them to shut up, you're loud, you know you're being rude or whatever, in addition to other kinds of racial epithets someone yells, "Shut up, you water buffalo."  So, they happened to notice the apartment where the comment had come from and got on the elevator, two of them, got on the elevator, went to the apartment, knocked on the door, "Are you the one who called us water buffalo?"  "Yes, I am," and (makes noise)--the whole thing took off from there.  Now, it turns out my relationship to this is because one of those two students was my girlfriend, the same girlfriend who said we need to be equally yoked.  So (laughter), so you can imagine that I had a vested interest in this.  This was a big deal for her and she, unlike me at the time, was far more racially conscious and she happened to be an aspiring historian.  So, she had been a history major, she's come there to study history, she was studying with [HistoryMaker] Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, and she was the one always sort of bringing another layer of analysis to our experience and conversations that even I wasn't engaged in, so, so when this happened you know I cared a lot it and followed it closely.  There wasn't a lot to do for students like me.  I mean she was involved in a lot in terms of meetings with the university administration and the back-and-forth between the student Eden Jacobowitz's First Amendment rights, members of the law school came to his--so, it was really a right, left First Amendment versus safe spaces debate going on at Penn's [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] campus in light of this epithet.  Now, of course the defense that he mounted was that as a Jewish student it was a Yiddish phrase to refer to rowdy or boisterous behavior hence water buffalo.  They read it through the lens of America's racial history of the animalization of black bodies and that's where the issue stalemated.
Story_ID: 522187
Speaker 1: Eventually, the black students on campus decided to mount a protest which was related but not directly to the water buffalo incident because a local columnist [Gregory Pavlik] at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] my junior year had written in a newspaper called The Daily Pennsylvanian, which was our student newspaper, a couple of columns, he was an op-ed columnist for the paper--the first criticized the annual celebration of the Martin Luther King holiday [Martin Luther King, Jr. Day].  Now, why this is meaningful in hindsight is because it was roughly 1991, it was probably January of 1991 and the water buffalo incident happened--no, it would've been January of '92 [1992], water buffalo incident January of '93 [1992] 'cause I graduated in May.  So January of '92 [1992] the, and I could be a whole year off on this, so if I am that's okay, memory is tricky, but what happened is that he published this piece ['Rethinking the King Holiday,' Gregory Pavlik] criticizing Martin Luther King holiday celebration as un-American and Penn at the time was just institutionalizing its annual celebration of the King holiday because the federal law passed in '87 [sic. 1983] so, of course it took institutions to figure out like well you know, are we gonna have the day off?  Particularly private institutions.  Are we gonna take the day off?  If we're not gonna take the day off, are we gonna require this, are we gonna require that, are we gonna bring in speakers?  Everything we take for granted today, looking back thirty years later about how to celebrate Dr. King's holiday then was brand new.  So, he writes this attack, he calls Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] un-American, says he's a Communist, says he wanted to take white people's money away from them to give it to black people, and throws in anti-affirmative action remarks with reference to, to black students being on campus and there being a dirty little secret about them being unqualified to be there.  He writes about a series of incidents that happened that he saw as a double standard where some white fraternities had gotten in trouble for hazing and other kinds of behavior on campus where some black fraternities had not gotten in trouble and you know we can talk about the details, but that was essentially the argument.  So essentially he was rendering illegitimate both the affirmative action policies of the university, the annual celebration of King, of a person who essentially hated America and was anti-white and he followed that up with a February column that called Malcolm X a hatemonger and an ex-pimp in reference to my great-grandfather, Elijah Muhammad.  So, I took it personally at this point, and this for me was the first moment when I really saw clearly that my physical presence in this space was under attack, was being questioned.
Story_ID: 522188
Speaker 1: Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] had established during my freshman year a hate speech code which was controversial, it had been adopted by the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] had, had a similar controversy.  You also have to remember that Penn had had preceding racial controversies, Conrad Muhammad [Conrad Tillard] who went on from Penn to be the head of temple No. 7 [Mosque No. 7; Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York] of the Nation of Islam was a student at Penn in the mid-1980s.  He brought as a student, Khalid Muhammad [Khalid Abdul Muhammad] to campus who was an incredibly controversial figure and there they were also testing the hate--the free speech policies although it worked a little bit in reverse because here was a controversial figure who was nationally known to be anti-white and an anti-Semitic and to preach hate is now being protected by the black students to come and speak truth to power around race issues at Penn's campus.  So all this came before me, they were--Conrad was gone by the time I came.  He left in '88 [1988], I came in the fall of 1989, but there was--all of this was part of the zeitgeist of the University of Pennsylvania at the time.  So, when, when Penn adopted this hate speech policy which was essentially meant to protect anybody from hate speech, and it was meant to be a personal attack when someone uses the n-word against another student or makes a denigrating comment to a Jewish student or et cetera.  I evoked the hate speech policy in reference to the maligning of my great-grandfather [Elijah Muhammad] vis-a-vis Malcolm X in the column by the student [Gregory Pavlik] and got thirty other students to file a petition to bring the columnist up on hate speech charges.  Now, I was naive in the sense that we want to protect journalists' right, even if we disagree with him to their opinion when they're writing opinion pieces, but I was nineteen years old at the time and I felt that I was in a hostile environment and this was the only way I knew how to do it in a productive way.  We also reached out to a local, to the student newspaper [The Daily Pennsylvanian] and asked to have an op-ed column as a response to what the student had written, and we sat down with the editors for a couple of hours, two or three students and me and they refused and said you know, "All we will do is publish a letter to the editor" as we took as disrespect, and we took that as a diminution of our, of our voice because they were not equal placement, and that letter did run 202 members of the black faculty administrative staff and students of the University of Pennsylvania did write and publish this piece, and essentially the case against the columnist was winding its way through the administrative policies and they had no idea what to do.  Now, this is very important because at one point I got a call from an officer in the office and she said, "Well, we're thinking about setting up a debate between you and the columnist to work out the merits of his argument and your argument, and it'll be a teachable moment for the rest of the campus."  I was terrified, absolutely terrified because I at this point had probably taken one U.S. history class on the South.  I think I had taken a few black studies classes, but I was no expert.  I was not a columnist or a journalist.  I wasn't thinking about these ideas in any intentional way.  I was studying economics for crying out loud, so I felt vulnerable and I felt like I would lose and I never wanted to feel that way ever again, so fast forward later I decided to go to graduate school.  It was a kind of born-again experience for me, but in the meantime the stuff at Penn was then exacerbated by two, two things, one the water buffalo incident, but also the acquittal of Rodney King's--the people who beat him, the police officers who beat him, and the black students essentially spontaneously that evening mounted a protest to march from the Du Bois College House [W.E.B. Du Bois College House, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which was both a specific home for African American students and international students from there to downtown Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to Center City and we're gonna walk down the middle street which we did do, but as we gathered several white students opened their windows again, in this similar courtyard and started yelling racial epithets out at us.
Story_ID: 522189
Speaker 1: So, the hostility for, for black students was coming in many different directions, and by the end of all of that, two ways in which the story ends.  One, the water buffalo incident is being debated nationally, the president of Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Sheldon Hackney, who was a southern historian and went on to head the National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH] was up for [U.S.] Senate confirmation.  He had been nominated by Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and when all of this was going on, at the height of the controversies around free speech and the newspapers, free speech for students in being able to speak in spite of these hate speech policies that you know, the kind of things the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] is saying now that they were not going to protect any safe space, it's college, get over it.  Penn had taken an affirmative position that it was gonna create safe spaces and there was tremendous backlash coming in many directions and the president was taking heat for this.  So, because this was all being debated in the news, he was--his Senate confirmation was gonna be threatened by the fact that maybe he doesn't believe in free speech, and maybe he won't protect artists in terms of being the right person for the job.  That mattered because it put a lot of pressure on the administrators to do something to the students who had been involved in all this activity and the final straw of it that essentially broke the proverbial back was the BSU, the Black Student Union, wanted to organize because it had never been resolved what happened to the columnist [Gregory Pavlik].  So, they organized a protest which included confiscating the entire run of The Daily Pennsylvanian on a given day.  So, every location where the newspaper, fourteen thousand copies, were to be dropped off, somebody was there at that moment to take them away and to leave in their place a protest note to say, "We the African American students and the University of Pennsylvania today are expressing our disappointment with the editorial practices of The Daily Pennsylvanian which has created a hostile environment on this campus with students," blah, blah, blah and, "we have taken the papers today."  I, participated in that, although I did not organize it and I was taken into custody by a zealous university police officer who got the call that people were stealing the newspapers, and he stopped me, wanted to take me into custody to which I got into a series of conversations and said, "What are you arresting me for?  What crime did I commit?"  He would not answer the questions, I refused to go into custody.  He eventually hit me with a baton across my leg to which I buckled, my hands dropped, he put the cuffs on me, put me in the back of the police car along with another student who was a freshman.  I was a senior at the time, who had already agreed to go by, to go away quietly.  We go to the local campus jail which is an extension of the Philadelphia Police Department.  It's mass confusion on campus, other students are now being taken into custody, there's calls from everywhere.  They don't know what's going on.  They see a bunch of black students who they assume are West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] people who have penetrated the campus and they don't know why these people are here.  We're dressed in black.  Eventually someone puts two and two together and realize that we're students and we're engaging in a protest, and the chief of police who was in the station at the time essentially releases everyone and has a conversation with me because now black students have now arrived to the jail--to the station and protest, saying, "Release Khalil [HistoryMaker Khalil Gibran Muhammad], release the other student," which they did do and I went to the University of Pennsylvania hospital [Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] to be examined for injuries.  That then led to a legal battle between the cop who was ultimately put on some form of administrative leave and the university.
Story_ID: 522190
Speaker 1: So, the university is now in a legal dispute with the Fraternal Order of Police who are representing the interests of the police officer who hit me.  So, I get a call from the university's general counsel's office saying that, "There's likely to be arbitration between the police officer and the university and you are our witness so we need to meet with you in order to talk about what happened to you so we can go into this arbitration."  'Cause essentially the cop was trying to clear his name and to his--have his rights restored and the university was trying to defend its actions.  In the meantime, it's in the, it's the spring of 1993.  The water buffalo thing is now in Jet magazine, it's still winding its way, Sheldon Hackney is still being debated as to whether he should go on to the NEH [National Endowment for the Humanities] and it's graduation weekend.  So, I appear literally on the front page of The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia's [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] main newspaper on the day that my mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] gets off a plane for my graduation and I surprised her by walking by a newspaper stand, buying a paper and saying, "Here, I want you to have this," and she's like, "There you are."  I'm featured in a cover store on the newspaper with a student Gregory Pavlik who had initiated the columns and my story's told in response to all the things that had been going on.  Essentially, it was our story that was in microcosm this big story, including the water buffalo incident.  In the meantime, like within hours I go back to my apartment.  I have a message on the machine and it says--this is a university official, I can't remember the name. "You need to call this number right now, we're concerned you might not graduate this weekend."  Because again, the university was getting tremendous pressure to punish the students who had participated in the newspaper confiscation, as both a form of theft, and also a violation of the free speech rights of the journalists.  So, I immediately called a black administrator who had been a counselor through much of this and I said, "This is what happened," and he says, "You don't worry about a thing, I will take care of this."  And sure enough, within a matter of hours, I got a call back and said, "Enjoy your graduation."  And, guess who the speaker was for graduation?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] (laughter), talk about--so, you know thinking about the early years of sort of having my father's [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] seeds planted but not necessarily being totally engaged in the big picture, being a child of the '80s [1980s] and being more focused on material acquisition and financial success, all of that went out the window at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] by--
Speaker 2: By the end?
Speaker 1: By the end, by the end I was a completely different person and completely unsatisfied with the career I was heading into and how I thought about my place in the world and had a huge appetite of for wanting to be smarter, that moment of Gregory Pavlik and the potential debate with the student and fearing that I might embarrass myself or my people because I didn't know my own history well enough.  All of that came to the fore in this moment and Hillary Clinton was even for my, for my--Hillary and Bill [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] for my generation at that moment was a big deal, 'cause we'd just come off of the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] years and, and George Bush, the father [President George Herbert Walker Bush].  So, that was the--Hillary and Bill were the first presidents that I could identify with as a young adult.  I graduated at--I think I'd just turned twenty.
Speaker 2: I thought twenty-one?
Speaker 1: No, I'd just turned twenty-one at graduation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, my birthday is April 27th, so if you--a couple of weeks before.  So, that was for me the first moment of a presidency that I thought, I need to care about this.  I remember voting for Bill Clinton, he was the first president I voted for and to have Hillary at the graduation in the midst of all of this, I can't remember her speech to this day, but I wouldn't be surprised if I went back to the transcript that she was, she spoke to some of the issues that were going on, 'cause Penn was a hotbed and a hot mess, so it's no way she didn't come to that campus and not make some reference to what was going on.
Speaker 2: So who was the, who was the professor or black administrator that called and got things all worked out?
Speaker 1: Harold Haskins is the name of a black administrator who was a big, big deal, but I don't remember if--there were a couple of people.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But one person whose name is not known but whose family history is a big deal, perhaps my most important advisor by the time I became a junior in all of these things was a man named Howard Stevenson [Howard C. Stevenson] who is an education professor, he's a psychologist at the graduate school of education at Penn and his brother is [HistoryMaker] Bryan Stevenson.
Story_ID: 522191
Speaker 1: So you do, you barely grad- I mean you, so your mother [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl], everybody's upset.  What about your father [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad], is he there at graduation (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure absolutely.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So everybody's there and you get through and you--I wanna--who are you spending summers, up until this point, were you still in New York [New York] at?
Speaker 2: I was up--I was in New York every summer until I was about fifteen, I was--you know until you know when you get to be that age.
Speaker 1: But in college [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] where are you spending the summer?
Speaker 2: In college, I'm going home.
Speaker 1: You're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because I'm spending holidays and long weekends in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I'm seeing my dad a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All during the year, it's the reverse in some ways.
Speaker 1: I see, so what were you working during those summers?
Speaker 2: I was, I, I with my mom generally was able to get me a job working at the board of education in some administrative role.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, so you--how do you--the other thing before I go into DeLoitte [Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited] is and that training program is what about Reverend Jackson's [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] election because this is also around that time.  Does that have any impact?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: No impact.
Speaker 2: A little bit, yeah 1984 was the first time.
Speaker 1: Right and then 1988.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-eight [1988], so I remember 1988 better than 1984 but it didn't register.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think it might have registered for some, a very small percentage of my peers, but I was sixteen and the same way that I say that my mom's relationship to the Civil Rights Movement as a sixteen-year old in 1968 it still it's hard to put that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on a kid.
Story_ID: 522192
Speaker 1: There is one last story at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] that matters because it affects how I think about grad school, and that is the arbitration.  So, Penn had called for the arbitration.  I show up at the arbitration and by this time, this is maybe in June, so I graduated in May.  This like June or July.  I show up for the arbitration, I'm dressed like this.  I've now started working at Deloitte and Touche [Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited].  I don't look like some crazy, you know radical Muslim kid who hates white people (laughter), I look like an Ivy League-educated college graduate who happens to be African American, and the lawyer who was representing the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police] for this police officer is clearly trying to bait me in such a way as to show some very angry personality traits that would have justified the officer's actions, and the lawyer had prepped me enough to say, "He's going to do everything he can to get under your skin, so just keep cool," which is exactly what I did.  But this matters because this, this planted a seed in me that never went away.  In his attempt to frustrate me, you know he was saying well you know, "You did this and you did that," and, I said, "No, no," so I gave my version against his version.  I never lost my cool and so at best we just had different versions of the events but that wasn't gonna work for him, he needed, he needed not only the facts to line up on his side, but he also needed emotion to line up on his side.  So, at one point he loses it and he says, "You should have a record," and he meant a criminal record, and I'm, I'm not exaggerating because he could not, there was nothing there.  I had never been arrested--even that I was not fingerprinted.  I was taken--I was detained essentially, handcuffed and detained but never processed.  So, what he wanted was to be able to besmirch my character in such a way that just having some kind of record on me would've proven the point that I was the bad person or that I had a flaw, or that you know some other version of me was there that day which legitimized the police officer's behavior but not this guy who's now been coached and has made up and has this fancy suit on.  It was so despicable, not only did they lose the case, but the police officer afterwards apologized to me.  And it was the first time that he and I'd had a conversation.  We didn't have a conversation the first time, it was a shouting match, but essentially it was the first time that we'd had any communication since the incident and he apologized to me.  And he said, "I'm really sorry for all of this," and I said, "I accept your apology," and I never looked back.  But when that lawyer said, "You should have a record," I knew--I completely understood what it meant to live in a world--at that moment, I hadn't thought about this before.  Rodney King had started my thinking, but for me personally for that lawyer to say that meant oh I'd be less than, I'd be easy.  You know you'd have your own version of me and it'd be a lot easier for you to say whatever you wanted to say about and minimize my experience.
Speaker 2: So, who apologized to you?  What that the admini- the (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The police officer who hit me with baton.
Speaker 2: The police officer--oh, so the police officer apologized to you?
Speaker 1: That's right, it was an arbi-, a judge, as the arbitrator.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: The lawyer, the police officer, Penn's lawyer and me, two and two.
Speaker 2: So, but Penn's lawyer was the one who was out, really--I mean he's the one who said, "You should've had a record?"
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Who, who said?
Speaker 1: Penn's lawyer was representing Penn.
Speaker 2: Penn, or representing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Penn's interests were for me to be the person that I was.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Which was to be a, a smart kind who was, who cared about the, the school and who engaged in a protest.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not a criminal who the cops saw and the cop justifiably took under arrest.
Speaker 2: Okay, and then.
Speaker 1: So, it was the FOP lawyer, the Fraternal Order of Police lawyer who got frustrated and yelled, "You should have a record," because then that's easy right.  Oh, you know it's like Rudolph Giuliani [Rudy Giuliani], he was no choir boy, we killed him, an unarmed man who was stopped by the police and then justifies it because he'd had a juvenile record at some point in the past.  That was the context in which this man blurted this out.
Speaker 2: Oh I see, but the police officer comes back and apologizes?
Speaker 1: And the police officer, being now embarrassed by the despicable behavior of the man who is supposed to represent him, apologizes to me because he realizes--he probably realized it shortly after the dust settled and the whole thing was playing out that like, how was I supposed to know this kid was some, you know, soon to be a college graduate at Penn, on his way to a stuffy public accounting firm, who was doing what college students do, right?  Which is to figure out how to make a difference in the world.
Story_ID: 522193
Speaker 1: How did you decide to go into this program though?
Speaker 2: It wasn't a program, I just--
Speaker 1: You got hired by Deloitte?
Speaker 2: I got hired by Deloitte and Touche [Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited], yeah so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because you're an economics major?
Speaker 2: I'm an economics major and it was kind of the last gasp of a career in business.  I'd have a short stint--the summer before at Prudential [The Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc.] in Newark [New Jersey] where I commuted from my father's [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] Harlem [New York, New York] apartment, and I was working on the trade floor.  I was bored to tears; I wrote poetry the whole summer.  I didn't learn much of anything and thought I don't wanna work in an environment like this, but my formative experiences as a bookkeeper at the computer store [Hyde Park Computers, Chicago, Illinois] when I was a teenager.  I thought well I'm pretty good at accounting, so let me try that.  I went into my senior year, I took two accounting classes [at University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], talked myself into a job at Deloitte and Touche simply by schmoozing one of the recruiters.  He had just run the New York Marathon [New York City Marathon], he was limping.  I said, "Hey, did you just run a marathon?"  He said, "Yes, how did you know?"  I said, "Oh I could tell, you know, you're sitting gingerly," and he talked about the marathon the whole time, which was great for me because I didn't--I wasn't much of an accountant at that time.  You had to sit for the CPA [certified public accountant], you needed eight credits or thirty-two hours, you know I had two.  So, he went and talked to a partner at the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] office who said--I don't know what he said, but by the time I got in that guy's office, he asked me a couple of questions and basically said, "You're hired."  So, I had to agree to take a bunch of accounting classes and in the meantime my head was spinning around the world and I decided that I was going to stay there just as long as I could and figure how to get to graduate school, but I talked myself into the job.
Speaker 1: So you already knew that graduate school was--and what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: By the time I got to Deloitte I pretty much knew I was not going to have a career in accounting.  What, what sealed it was two weeks of training and I thought, this is not gonna keep my attention (laughter).  I was falling asleep--I mean here I am, I guess I was twenty-one years old, I was also a fairly self-directed, motivated person.  So, the fact that I was falling asleep during training, I thought, I can't succeed in this environment.  So, I said I'm gonna go to grad school.  That's when I reached out to my best friend's father [Ralph A. Austen], starting have a conversation him.  I needed to sit for the GRE [Graduate Record Examination].  I had only taken a couple of history classes, so I wasn't well suited for figuring that out.  So, it took me twenty-two months to shift, I actually went onto take more accounting classes, but because I had a plan I got the Philadelphia office to agree to transfer me to Chicago [Illinois] for no other reason that I could live at home and save money while working.  Of course, they didn't know that's why I was going to Chicago.  They thought they were supporting my career.  Went to the Chicago office, stayed at home, saved money.  Took the GRE and quit in July of 1995 to matriculate at Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] in September.
Story_ID: 522194
Speaker 1: So, what programs did you look at when you were applying you know--
Speaker 2: For graduate school.
Speaker 1: For graduate school.
Speaker 2: I applied to a lot of the CIC [Committee on Institutional Cooperation; Big Ten Academic Alliance] schools which is a consortium in the Midwest, Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and several other schools like Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] was part of that, right?
Speaker 2: I also applied to Rutgers, Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], NYU [New York University, New York, New York], Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and then a couple of UC [University of California] schools.  So, I applied to about twelve schools.  I got into five of them, Ohio State, Rutgers, Columbia, NYU and UC Riverside [University of California, Riverside, Riverside, California].
Speaker 1: So, what made you make the decision?
Speaker 2: So, I, I ended up settling on either Rutgers or the UC Riverside, and the primary factors at this point were two mentors, Sterling Stuckey at the University of California Riverside, or [HistoryMaker] David Levering Lewis at Rutgers University and one other thing mattered coming back to the big picture.  In the negotiation, because graduate schools often, you know they pay for your education, tuition is covered and you receive a stipend.  So, there's some negotiation you can have, how big of a stipend, how guaranteed the funding, how many years, it is four years or five years, six years, all of this.  So, I was going back and forth with the two of them over the package and I one point I asked the administrator at UC Riverside, I said, "Where is the money coming from?"  Because California had just passed its anti-affirmative action proposition, and I decided once I got word that it was money bound up in diversity that I did not want to go to a California school where my funding might be killed by the legislation because of affirmative action.  So, I might have ended up going to Rutgers anyway but that was definitely a factor and it was a big hit against UC Riverside (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 522195
Speaker 1: So how did you find this, because this is totally different this type of training, the humanities are different from economics and a lot of times your peers would've been on more of a humanities track coming in.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Just like my girlfriend was a history major and she went on to go to Duke University [Durham, North Carolina] and graduated with a Ph.D. long before I did.  So, I, I had the advantage of a mentor and my best friend's father [Ralph A. Austen] who was a very successful full professor at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  I also was able to talk to Cornel West, I'd met him at some point in, in between leaving Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and working at Deloitte and Touche [Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited] because 'Race Matters' [Cornel West] came out I think in 1993 or '92 [1992] something like that.  So, the sort of emergence of the black public intellectual was also part of my new consciousness and curiosity so I started, not a lot, but I would go to public talks and addresses where people like Cornel West were and I'd even truly reach out to him like students reached out to me and said, "I met you at so-and-so," and you know, "Would you mind talking to me about a future career?"  I figured it out, I figured it out and the shift to history was also because the one thing about economics that I really enjoyed was economic history and macroeconomics, so even though I was an econ major, I was less interested in the math, than I was in the theories and the history that informed the theories.  So, I had a little peek into history through that experience, aside from the fact that I was an AP U.S. history student and had been exposed in high school [Kenwood Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] to what my best friend's father had shown us.
Speaker 1: And it's interesting that you would talk about the emergence of the public intellectual which is--this is the time that Skip Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] is building the department at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Right, and, and then you talk about [HistoryMaker] David Levering Lewis, who was a force in his own right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But that he's building this department and there's a, this big attention he's building this dream team.
Speaker 2: He's building a dream team, and for David he'd just won the Pulitzer [Pulitzer Prize] on the first volume of the Du Bois book ['W.E.B. Du Bois: Biography of a Race, 1868-1919,' David Levering Lewis], so he was already well established but with that achievement he moved to another stratosphere, and Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] at the time was absolutely interested in building a cohort, not only of graduate students who could work with David Lewis and Deborah Gray White, they were the two pillars of the African American studies focus at Rutgers in the history department, not African American studies all within history.  They also brought in a significant cohort of junior faculty to round out the program.  In many ways, Rutgers' history department for the study of African American history in the mid-1990s was the number one program in the country.  You had Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], you had Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and to some degree Harvard, maybe Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] because it had long been established as a bastion of study for the history of slavery, but Rutgers was the up and coming, it was the upshot the Young Turk and it was because of David's presence there and the investment by the university in giving him a wide berth and Deborah Gray White to recruit.
Speaker 1: Was Clem Price [Clement Alexander Price] there at that point?
Speaker 2: Clem Price was at Rutgers but on a different campus.
Speaker 1: On a different--okay, he was.
Speaker 2: But he was a resource that the university was very adept at lifting up and many of the students who ended up in New Brunswick [New Jersey] had also come from Newark [New Jersey] from a master's [degree] program of which Clem was the star in that program.   They didn't have a Ph.D. program at Rutgers Newark [Rutgers University-Newark, Newark, New Jersey] but they did have a master's program (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 522196
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, you met Stephanie [Muhammad's wife, Stephanie Lawson-Muhammad] when?
Speaker 2: I met Stephanie in 1995 just before I went to Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey].  I was living in Chicago [Illinois], she had just left Michigan and was working at Motorola [Motorola, Inc.] in Schaumburg, Illinois.  We met at a bar.
Speaker 1: And you met her, so she stayed in Chicago when you went to Rutgers, right is that, that's (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, so she--we didn't start dating until a year later, so that--in 1996 when we started dating she stayed for another year and then in 1997, which was my third year of graduate school, she moved to New Jersey and changed jobs.  She left Motorola and started working for Lucent Technologies [Lucent Technologies, Inc.].
Story_ID: 522197
Speaker 1: Now, what is your interest, who--so, what when you--what area are you deciding?  I mean what is your subject of your doctoral thesis and what are you deciding that you want to research?
Speaker 2: So, at, at the time I was interested in black northern experiences.  I'd been exposed to the Great Migration in, in college and always found it one of the most interesting chapters in African American history.  So, when I applied to graduate school I mentioned in studying the migration.  I wasn't quite sure what dimensions of it I would study.  It just so happens that Rodney King had always--had already been kind of something I was thing about in my experience with the lawyer at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or representing the police officer in a newspaper incident, and then O.J. Simpson was on trial.  So, by the time I was a first year graduate student, and reading three books a week and totally immersed in U.S. history, O.J. Simpson is literally on the television in the living room, because my roommate was a more advanced student and he would take breaks and watch two hours of the trial in the middle of the day.  So, all of the issues that swirled around that case and critiques of the criminal justice system often from white perspectives that it had failed, that it let a murderer off the hook, stuck me as totally bizarre, and--
Speaker 1: When the final verdict comes through (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When the final verdict, dissonant with--but it was happening even before the final verdict, not the murderer off the hook, but the critique of Johnnie Cochran and his dream team and the appearance that the deck was stacked against or it's stacked against the prosecution that the jury was too black and favorable to O.J. Simpson and all of that began to reinforce what was a latent interest in the criminal justice system and that's pretty much all it took.  I started to read voraciously the history of the South and criminal justice.  I started to look for similar stories, so there's convict leasing and chain gangs in the South, what is there in the North?  I started looking for books and basically very few existed.  There are a lot of books about early penitentiaries.  There are books about policing of European immigrants, the Irish in particular, but there was almost nothing written about black experiences in northern criminal justice systems, during the Great Migration period.  One book I found, I read it many, many times, highlighted every page of it, and that was really the touchstone for my thesis and in being able to respond to that book and what I saw as filling in a huge gap in the African American story.
Speaker 1: And what book was that?
Speaker 2: A book called 'Roots of Violence in Black Philadelphia' ['Roots of Violence in Black Philadelphia, 1860-1900,' Roger Lane].  It's a late 19th century study and it has a complicated argument, but it essentially said that in the early days after slavery, black people migrated to places like Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], joined an already free black population and although they tried to fully integrate themselves, white Philadelphians were often hostile to them and their labor participation fell and crime became a kind of culture or way of life, which was another repackaging of the culture of poverty thesis which was very popular from the late 1960s into the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s], and this historian essentially argued that all of the current day problems of violence of gangs, of underground economies with drugs or poverty, go--went back to this era because ultimately even though whites had kept people out of the labor market, black people had given way to their own worst habits and pathologies, and I found the argument unsatisfying to say the least, because it essentially said that racism was not a problem in the 20th century; it was black culture that was the problem.  That something had happened a long time ago, but black people had a chance to correct that and they choose not to.
Speaker 1: So you came into this then to prove that, that author wrong in some respects?
Speaker 2: Oh, big time, but every good dissertation is a response to something that is, that is meaty enough for a researcher to dig into and the truth is if he had been right, I would've had to write a dissertation to confirm his findings, but there was enough counter-evidence to suggest that he was wrong.  I mean that's in a sense how scientists work.  One scientist makes a finding, establishes protocols for how to discover the finding, another scientist is trying to make their bone says, "Well, I'm gonna test those findings," and sometimes they come out and say, "You know what, it turns out So-and-So was right," sometimes they say, "Absolutely not."  So, now we should drink red wine every day 'cause it's good for the heart.  So, there is a bit of science in, at least in the way one thinks about taking on these research projects and I was absolutely, I mean I was like you know really thirsty for challenging this author's arguments and the archival record held up to scrutiny, thank goodness.
Story_ID: 522198
Speaker 1: So where did you do your research?
Speaker 2: In terms of the archival work?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Mostly in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], it was a city I knew very well, the author [Roger Lane] had written about that city, so in order to essentially test those findings, the best place for me to do most of the archival work was in Philadelphia.  I did a little bit of work--well, I did a fair amount of work at the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.], in looking at national records like the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], National Urban League and a few others, and I used the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture [New York, New York].  So, those were the three primary.
Speaker 1: Who else is influencing you at this point, because I think of [HistoryMaker] David Levering Lewis, I did not know that connection. I think because he's also on the Higher Education Advisory Board [for The HistoryMakers] and he really, he's a biographer.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You know, so, but who, who also is influencing you that you're looking at and--?
Speaker 2: Not, not too many other people. I mean partly because what the work that I was doing was not an established field.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So, there was no 'The New Jim Crow' ['The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,' Michelle Alexander], no new book on Attica ['Blood in the Water: The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy,' Heather Ann Thompson], I mean in a sense, no--the landscape of historical literature on the criminal justice system from the perspective of African American experiences was not a robust field.  The, the one exception to that is that there was still new work being done on southern chain gangs and convict leasing, so the work of a Douglas Blackmon for example, 'Slavery by Another Name' ['Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II,' Douglas A. Blackmon] came out five years after I wrote my dissertation, but from my perspective that was a continuation of a lot of work that had been going on for twenty or thirty years.  People were not writing about northern experiences or even national ones.  So, David was really the most influential person and his influence was primarily as an intellectual historian.  He helped me understand how to study ideas and how to connect ideas to historical figures in real world events which is what 'The Condemnation' ['The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America,' Khalil Gibran Muhammad] does as a book, and Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] obviously looms large in that early study because Du Bois was the most prominent person in the early 20th century to address this issue of northern black criminal justice experiences.
Speaker 1: So, you--so, really this is, you're doing this work between 1998, ninety- and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Started in '95 [1995], finished in '03 [2003].
Speaker 1: O'three [2003], okay.
Speaker 2: And the dissertation stuff starts in about '97 [1997], '98 [1998].
Speaker 1: I see, okay.
Story_ID: 522199
Speaker 1: Then what are you thinking career wise at that point, you know because (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I was, I wanted to be a professor, absolutely.  I had worked in Corporate America, I knew what it was like to be in cubicles and stuffy office environments and I wanted to be, I wanted to have the flexibility of teaching and then being wherever I wanted to be.  I could a read a book on a bench.  I used to walk when I was in Indiana, literally I would go to the track field and I would read a book walking the track, helped me stay awake and I got exercise and it was pleasant outdoors.  So, yeah, that, for me that was the most, that was the ideal job and I was grateful that circumstances had allowed me to put myself in a position to have that.
Speaker 1: So, Indiana, so did you go through the--you know how the--is it the American Historical Association [AHA], the conference where a lot of the hiring is done?
Speaker 2: The meat market?
Speaker 1: The meat market.
Speaker 2: As we call it?
Speaker 1: Where there are not a lot of minorities in those meat markets.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know the AHA annual conference is the first stop on an interview process for most people, and yeah, I had interviews there.  The year that I got hired by Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] was actually the second year that I was on the market.  The first year I was on the market--actually, it was the third year I was on the market.  The first year I was on the market, I did the AHA and I got a--my only offer came from Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, and I was fortunate because although I might have taken that job, not that it's a terrible school, but it was primarily a teaching job.  I think it was a three/three load, rather than a research one which is what I wanted, I got a post-doc through the Mellon Foundation [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation] to study race, crime and justice at the Vera Institute of Justice, the New York City [New York, New York] think tank and criminal reform agency, and that allowed me to postpone my job search by up to two years and by the--and actually Indiana came after me that year and interviewed with them at the AHA, they were a little late to the market, but long and short, I did go back on the market the next year and I got the job in Indiana and came a year later after I finished the second year of my post-doc.
Speaker 1: And, what was the arrangement then--and you said in terms of teaching, you said, you mentioned something about three and three before, or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, well sure, at Marist it was going to be a three, three teaching load.  At Indiana, it was a two-two which is traditional for a research one universities, with that thinking being that a person is in the classroom only so much because they need to be able to research and write.
Speaker 1: Right, so you, now you start there in 2004--
Story_ID: 522200
Speaker 1: By this time also you're, during--you're, you're becoming prolific in terms of your offspring too?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes. Yeah so, I'm in graduate school [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], so Stephanie [Muhammad's wife, Stephanie Lawson-Muhammad] had moved to New Jersey.  We married a year later and--because I had young parents [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl and HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad], I had always imagined that I would have children fairly young and Stephanie was fine with that.  She's also almost three years older than me, so in terms of the timing of things it lined up nicely.  I was married at twenty-five, our firstborn was--came when she turned twenty-eight--no, she was thirty, I was twenty-eight.  So, that was number one, and the funny thing about that is I had--he was born the end of June and I had just finished the first chapter of my dissertation, which was a big deal.  Then we knew we would have another child, except she came a little earlier than we had anticipated.  So, twenty-two months later, Jordan [Jordan Muhammad] was born.
Speaker 1: So, the first was Gibran [Gibran Muhammad]?
Speaker 2: Gibran (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Gibran, I'm sorry (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes so he's now sixteen, he was born in 2000, twenty-two months later Jordan who is now fourteen was born in '02 [2002] and I'd just finished the fourth chapter of my dissertation, and with each pregnancy was a kind of imposed deadline because the, obviously, the weeks and months following childbirth is a very busy time, and it's hard to be productive.  So, these became motivations to finish up work, and then after she was there I was also a--the digression for me, I was primary caregiver part-time with the help of a babysitter who would come in but because I was a graduate student and dissertating at the time, I generally could be home for the afternoons when the babysitter would leave, and that was true for both Jordan and Gibran for their first couple of years.  Then I finished in '03 [2003], we were in New York [New York] for those two years.  I got the job in Indiana and lo and behold my first semester at Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], Stephanie's pregnant--we are pregnant with number three which ultimately also had a silver lining, which is she was born in the spring, in June, June 1 and that fall following her birthday, Stephanie took off three months in September, the university released me from teaching duties for the entire semester and so I ended up having research leave, a teaching leave to take care of our third, Justice [Justice Muhammad] who's now ten, from her three months to seven months, and then we put her in childcare after that.  So, each of my children in their own way contributed to you know significant moments of productivity for me.
Speaker 1: And Stephanie is doing what at this point?
Speaker 2: Stephanie is a consultant with Accenture [Accenture PLC] after just under twenty years in telecommunications for Motorola [Motorola, Inc.], Lucent [Lucent Technologies, Inc.] and then she spent ten years at Verizon Wireless [Verizon Communications, Inc.].
Speaker 1: And so, and is there any meaning to your third daughter's name, Justice?
Speaker 2: No, but, it fits well.  So, we, in some strange way unlike, a little bit like George Foreman but not quite, you know he named all his kids George, we like the (sound) sound, so it's Gibran, Jordan, and after two to be honest we thought we were done, we said, "Ah, you know two's a lot, we're busy people."  She had a career, I had a career so we thought we were done.  We also couldn't settle on a third name.  We both were fans of Jeremiah Wright [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr.] and we played with Jeremiah, but that still felt a little Old Testament so, we didn't have a name for her, we were in denial that we were pregnant anyway, and about seven months in at a doctor's office we heard a parent refer to their child as Justice and we thought, that's, it, that's the name.  We didn't tell the parent that, but that's how we came upon the name.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).

Speaker 1: So how did you enjoy Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], because this is where your--wait a minute, you teach at Indiana how long?
Speaker 2: Six years.
Speaker 1: Six years, okay 'cause Indiana has the largest black film and music archives?
Speaker 2: That's right, Michael Martin runs it.  It's an amazing, an amazing archive.
Speaker 1: So, what can--how do you describe your time there?
Speaker 2: Amazingly productive, educational, I grew as a person; I grew as a scholar.
Speaker 1: What do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the whitest place on earth I'd ever lived, and as a college town in south central Indiana, and hour north of Kentucky, you know east from nowhere, and west to somewhere not so important, it just was a place that was very unfamiliar to me.  I had been a big city kid, grown up in Chicago [Illinois], spent summers in New York City, Queens [New York].  Dad [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] lived in Fort Greene, Brooklyn [New York] at the height of the hip-hop era and Spike Lee's store [Spike's Joint, Brooklyn, New York] was down the street in Fort Greene, so this is the world I knew, and then having gone to school [University of Pennsylvania] in west Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I didn't know what it meant to be surrounded by farm land and people who thought Bloomington, Indiana was the big city.  Not long after we moved in we, we had a refrigerator repairman come to fix the refrigerator we'd just inherited from the previous owners and he knew we were new 'cause we just moved in, but he also knew we were new 'cause there weren't a lot of black people.  The town had 4 percent black population.  I'd say the university population of faculty was the professional class for the community, then there were the students and there--Bloomington had a long population--presence of blacks in the domestic community of town, so there was a working class community that lived there too, but all of it amounted to a community that was almost 90 percent white.  So, here we are in this fairly new subdivision, almost a brand-new home, and he's not used to coming to fix black folks' refrigerators and the fact that he doesn't live in Bloomington, so we were 4 percent.  Where he came from was probably you know, no percent black (laughter).  So, so he says basically, "What brings you to town?" and, "How do you like living in the big city?"  Now, that doesn't tell you something about living in Bloomington, Indiana, which was a town of seventy thousand without the college population counted.  We would go to local eateries, many of them franchises like Panera [Panera Bread] or this and people would look at us like exotic specimens.  Most of it out of sheer innocence, just because, you know they knew there were black athletes there, they knew there were students, but they didn't see the faculty classes that often.  It was hit or miss, 'cause we just weren't that visible, and I must say over the six years that we were there, our family was very visible.  We were out.  We went out; our kids were not quiet.  They made their presence known, so even if you saw a black person in your peripheral vision, you didn't just see them, you just didn't see the Muhammads in your peripheral vision, you heard the Muhammads in your peripheral vision.
Story_ID: 522202
Speaker 1: One example is my--Justice [Muhammad's daughter, Justice Muhammad], one of her experiences in Bloomington [Indiana] was kind of coming to a racial consciousness.  She's at a deli counter where Stephanie [Muhammad's wife, Stephanie Lawson-Muhammad] is getting lunch meat.  She's about two and a half, three years old and she looks up and she sees all these white people and she's like, all of a sudden, she's like, "White people, white people, white people.  Everywhere I look there's white people," and says this out loud (laughter).  So, and you know the deli clerk laughed just like you would expect.  It was kind of like, "Well, I guess she has a point there."  My other daughter Jordan [Jordan Muhammad] when she was a similar, she had started taking in the history of the Civil Rights Movement, they both were things she learned at school, also things that we covered at home and things that we watched on television and then as now, was never shy about teaching my kids this history because I thought the sooner they learned it, the sooner they'll work through it and the better off they'll be.  They won't be like me going to college and sort of hit with a ton of books, bricks across the head.  So, she's processing all the stuff she learns.  A woman is helping Stephanie out the grocery store by saying, "Hey, I see your hands are full, can I help you push this cart?"  And she says, "Sure."  Justice is sitting in the--Jordan, my middle one is sitting in the thing and she looks up and she looks at her mom, she says, "Why is this white lady helping us?  White people don't like black people (laughter)."  So, it was, it was fascinating for all of us.  We joined, we became members of an A.M.E. [American Methodist Episcopal] church.  It was a tiny church with great history, Bethel Bloomington [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Bloomington, Indiana], named for Mother Bethel [Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  A wonderful tradition of preaching, but it was struggling, financially it was struggling.  On any given Sunday, there might be no more than seventy-five people at the church, so when the Muhammads showed up, we turned it out.  Stephanie read the announcements, Jordan was a stewardess, I sang in the choir, and in a sense if we weren't in church on Sunday, it was noticeable.  It wasn't that--obviously, there were many other people contributing to the life of the church, and Stephanie, unlike many families in that town, maybe there might be one faculty member in the family and a stay-at-home person or administrator, Stephanie was working as a manager at Verizon Wireless [Verizon Communications, Inc.] in Indianapolis [Indiana], so she had a very professional job.  We contributed significantly to fundraising campaigns for the church.  Our kids played music, I started playing--we would show up on Christmas morning for the church, a tradition that we started there that I'd never had growing up and we probably represented 30 percent of the attendance on Christmas morning, because there were never more than about fifteen people and we were five so (laughter).  So, Bloomington was just so special in that sense.  My experience on campus [at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] in terms of the support from the department--the, the university had some trouble retaining black faculty, particularly in the history department.  A black woman had preceded my time there and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was her name?
Speaker 1: Her name was Chana Kai Lee.  She essentially had experiences with white football players who questioned her credentials, who were hostile to her in the classroom and it became a major issue, a university-wide issue, it was reported in the newspaper, and she left the university on account of it.  The person who came behind her didn't really feel like it was a good fit, and eventually his wife basically put an ultimatum down and said, "We can't stay here," and so they left and that's what created the space for me to come in.  So, it was a confluence I think of the department within the university making an extra special effort to get it right with me.  I was actually recruited by one of the faculty members who was a white guy who did African American history and they, they definitely looked out for me.  They made it a very nurturing place and people took interest in my work and I think it was easy for, for people to connect with me because I had this family.  So, wife and three kids and we just, we just sort of, we let our hair down and we dug in and we made Bloomington home for those six years.  We knew we would leave and I used to joke that you won't find me in a pine box in any funeral--in any cemeteries around here 'cause it just seemed like the middle of nowhere in terms of like the long-term, but it was a very nurturing place.
Story_ID: 522203
Speaker 1: But the book ['The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America,' Khalil Gibran Muhammad] comes out when you are really about ready to leave [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], right?
Speaker 2: Correct, so as is true for most academics on tenure track at research ones, when your book comes out is a good time to go on the market, even if you wanna stay, it's a chance to renegotiate your salary and other benefits, research accounts, and it's a time--a chance to leave, it's sort of the way the market works.  So, the book comes out in January of 2010.  I begin to fill out my tenure dossier that spring, and it's due in the summer.  So January's the book, by late August I have to turn in all of the requirements for tenure, but in the meantime between January with the book's arrival, and turning in my tenure case, I get a call from a headhunter that June in my office saying that the Schomburg Center [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] is looking for a new director and do you know anyone who might be interested and I said, "Well, let me give it some thought," and hung up, but then I was confused because something else the headhunter said was confusing.  So, I called her back and I said, "Are you asking me if I'm interested in the job or are you asking me if I might know someone who's interested in the job?"  And she says, "Oh, I'm sorry, I was asking if you were interested in the job."  And I said, "Oh, okay.  Yes," and that's, that's what began processing this.
Speaker 1: Hold on a second, let's just hold, I gotta get a--I did something here with this.  So, so that was--so how have your--wait, okay.  How had your name come up though?
Speaker 2: Well, I learned later that [HistoryMaker] David Levering Lewis and his wife, Ruth Ann Stewart, who you may know through Donald Stewart.  Ruth Ann had worked at the Schomburg for ten years, from roughly 1979, 1980 and they had been consulted by the firm to propose some names, and my--they gave my name.  David knew me well enough as his former student that I was you know capable of representing the institution as an historian and Ruth Ann knew me well enough as a person to be able to manage the affairs of the institution administratively, so that's how I got on the list.
Speaker 1: This is a huge job. No, when you think about it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Absolutely, and I had, I didn't have the slightest clue how big it was.  I had no reason to know.  I mean (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean it's a hu- when I think about that--
Story_ID: 522204
Speaker 1: Now, how had you enjoyed the classroom?  Can we--?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I mean, how were you as a teacher 'cause sometimes people like, you know they like the research and writing, but they don't like the teaching, so you know?
Speaker 2: I like the teaching, but it was never where I put all of my or you know--I'll answer it a slightly different way.  For research one universities, your success is measured by three standards: research, teaching and service, and teaching is not meant to be the number one priority and neither was it for me.  So, I taught, I think competently.  I had a gift for engaging my students, but the amount of work I might have done to prepare lectures, to do imagine workshop--not workshops, but group exercises, to even do a more thorough job in grading and giving my students feedback, I would grade myself a B minus for that.  I just, I just didn't schedule the time to put in it because I knew that at the end of the day, if I were an amazing teacher and I didn't write good book, I would not get tenure.  So.
Speaker 1: So, you put your time into research and writing?
Speaker 2: I put my time in research and writing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, the writing--of the book ['The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America,' Khalil Gibran Muhammad], how--because you know as in most cases, a lot of the research that you do during the doctoral period--
Speaker 2: I'm so--
Story_ID: 522205
Speaker 1: I was saying that you know in the, in the research that you were doing, because the research formed the book ['The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America,' Khalil Gibran Muhammad] so, in the process of writing the book, what else do you learn?
Speaker 2: About the subject matter?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, a couple of things happened, the experience at the Vera Institute of Justice [New York, New York] was a very hands-on, practical exposure to clinicians working on the ground to change the criminal justice system.  Whereas, my entire exposure to this history was vis-a-vis a distance past, and my personal connection to it was through high-profile news stories.  I was not very well experienced with people actually doing the work of either reform or of criminal justice practices, law enforcement or prosecutors or whatever.  So, Vera brought me into that world over a two-year period, and even though I was really, mostly there to do my own work even as a historian, I was in community with all these people.  Some of the first consent decrees I remember my colleagues were working on a consent decree evaluation to see if Seattle's [Seattle, Washington] police department was in compliance with the consent agreement.  They were putting out those reports.  So, I'm hearing so much of the conversation that now is much more sophisticated and widely shared and known in 2016 than was true in 2004 and 2005 when I was at Vera.  So, I brought those insights into my book which were not in, in the dissertation.  I couldn't have done it and one of the biggest insights is really a criticism and the criticism was that the shortcomings of white liberals in really attacking the root causes of criminality became much more apparent to me in the historical actors, because of my experiences at Vera, than it did when I approached it from the position of a historian looking at the past.
Speaker 1: What do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: I, I saw the limits of what well-intentioned, thoughtful people could bring to bear on an issue when I some ways they had their own ambivalence about, why do these people commit so much crime?  So, there, there's a really interesting history of liberal critiques of excessive punishment, at the same time liberal acceptance of cultural pathology arguments.  So you can be mad at the lynch mob but support the intervention or the need for an intervention, meaning you know the bad guy deserves to be punished, just not strung up on a tree and dismembered and set apart.  Or the problem of drug economies in the 1980s grows out of broken homes and cultural pathologies, but we shouldn't have a war on drugs or if police officers are gonna go in an make an arrest, they should be respectful and they should work with the community.  And I started to see that there were limits to the environmental structural critique directed towards blacks coming out of the liberal space of the Vera Institute that was quite different than the liberal critiques against the system when it was white Europeans, when it was the Irish, when it was the Italians, when it was the Jews, or Polish Catholics from the early days.  That--they were far more critical of the system's failures to address the humanity of those European-descendant immigrants than they were to address the systems of impact on African Americans.  It was true in the ei- in the 1910s in Chicago [Illinois], and it turned out it was true in New York City [New York, New York] in 2010.
Story_ID: 522206
Speaker 1: So, when did you start looking at lynching?  When did you start looking at that in the earl- my question is, why is the, the--I wanna say the teens [1910s], you know the--where--why does that historical period become so important?
Speaker 2: Because it's the moment when our modern systems are built, everything.  So, the, the penitentiary is innovated at this time, it, it had lived in a--the first penitentiary is the late 18th century and across the 1900s, prisons are being built all over the place, but there's a new approach to what's called penal management that, that begins in the 1910s and '20s [1920s] and it's what people today casually refer to as rehabilitation.  So, the prison is going to be a site for actually job training, for exposure to the arts.  There are baseball diamonds built behind prison walls in the 1930s.  Major movie theaters built studio--not studios--auditoriums for film screenings in the 1930s because they've got this captive audience of young men and they want to make gangster films, so they figure if we can test the film with these guys, then we know we'll have a winner.  That's the era of rehabilitation, and that happens really beginning in the 1920s.  It's also true that a lot--the civil service reform that takes the politics out of policing, where police officers are just strong-arm men for local politicians and machine politicians who are trying to muscle people to the polls happens in the 1920s.  The juvenile justice system begins in 1899 in Chicago [Illinois], social work is established.  Playgrounds are established not just as pastoral places inside of these concrete jungles, but actually are meant to be crime preventative.  The idea being that if you can create a safe, supervised place for young people to play after school, they won't get into trouble.  So, everything that we take for granted today in terms of the modern infrastructure of social welfare, social work, recreation itself, how it's managed, even policing and prisons themselves are all born in this early period we call the Progressive Era.
Speaker 1: So, that's what I find very interesting about your research and your presentations, which I think you're excellent, as I had told you, but I found it just fascinating the, the comparison and the difference in the treatment, you know between the white community who are--what were they referred to you said?
Speaker 2: A great army of unfortunates.
Speaker 1: Unfortunates, that's right.
Speaker 2: No, it's powerful and no one had ever looked at it 'til me.  This is where I will take some credit for doing something a little bit differently.  So, the book ['Roots of Violence in Black Philadelphia, 1860-1900,' Roger Lane] I referred to earlier, Roger Lane did compare immigrants and blacks.  So, he's not--I wasn't the first to do that, but no one had done it in the 20th century, and that's--well, I can't say that either.  People had done it in comparison to housing, education and labor, but they hadn't done it in criminal justice.
Story_ID: 522207
Speaker 1: So, when I started to say, "Okay, what's the equivalent of convict leasing and chain gangs or the southern sheriff in Chicago [Illinois] in 1910?"  Because the heart of the Jim Crow period is happening in the same time that I'm looking at Chicago.  So, that's a fair question, what does it look like to be a, a criminal suspect, a black criminal suspect in a place like Chicago in 1910?  It wasn't an easy question to answer.  Most of the literature didn't look for the answer.  Most of the literature said, "What does it mean to be an Italian immigrant, and be a criminal suspect in 1910?"  Or a Jewish immigrant, or an Irish immigrant?  That was the question that's shaped the field, and I said, "Well, let's put black people in the story."  Most people had looked at, had ignored black experiences because the population at the turn of the 20th century in Chicago was 2 percent black, was 4 percent by 1910.  It wasn't until the Great Migration era that it begins to approach 10 percent and now things begin to change which is partly why I was interested in the story, but you needed it before so you could understand the after, and so it turned out that policing was the dominant face of racial resistance to black mobility in housing, and jobs.  Police officers really expressed the communal will of whites in keeping blacks out of their spaces.  Now, black--whites also did a fair amount of vigilante violence which is why we had all these race riots, but most people hadn't studied policing in relation to those race riots in the way that I did because, I, I was looking for, who is enforcing the social norms of these transition communities because of the presence of black people?  That's one part of the story, and that would make sense to people.  I could have just finished with that story, but then I said, "Well, now there's all this criminalizing rhetoric."  These migrants are assumed to be ignore, uncouth, rowdy, criminally minded, and I said, "Where have I heard this before?  Oh, I've heard this before when they refer to the Italians, and the Irish, but that's in a different literature.  Those are different people talking about different groups."  So, I had to put the two together and then I noticed the double standard.  I actually noticed that it was some of the same people who would say one thing in reference to the immigrants, Jane Addams for example, would talk about the needs of the immigrant, the need for police reform, the structural ways in which consumer culture and, and industrial work, worked against the family unit.  So, girls for example not only needed to work to bring home wages but they were exposed to these immoral habits like you know wanting to wear make-up and go out and dress fancy.  She had a very robust critique of society in general to explain higher rates of prostitution or immorality, criminality amongst white men and women, but Jane Addams didn't apply the same insight when it came to black people, even in Chicago.  And so, I couldn't see that until I was willing to study closely the experiences of European-descended immigrants in Chicago on their own terms.  And if it--if I was only looking for black people in much of Jane Addams' work, I would've missed all of that.  I would've said, "Oh, well this book isn't about black people, well I don't need to read that."  But it turned out the real headline was the double standard.  The real headline is like, oh, these people have high rates of criminality, high rates of violence, high rates of poverty, many of them have dysfunctional households, and what's the story?  The story is that the system is rigged against them.  The story is that the economy doesn't work for them.  The story is that as immigrants they are discriminated against and that explains their higher rates of criminality or their difficult family lives and so what are we gonna do?  We're gonna get in there and do something about it.  When it came to African Americans, the same people would say, "Oh, these people used to be slaves, it's so sad, but because they used to be slaves, they're not very smart.  They're not very moral, they have some things to work out and until they work it out on their own, we can't really help these people."
Story_ID: 522208
Speaker 1: How much attention does the book ['The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America,' Khalil Gibran Muhammad] get at the time? 'Cause you get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Initially?
Speaker 1: Initially, 'cause you get a lot of attention.
Speaker 2: Before Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: But--yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, is that the--yes, so, before Schomburg it got more attention than the average academic text, but not nearly the attention it got after I had the title and the visibility of the Schomburg post.  So, a couple of examples, I was doing a small number of speaking engagements just by virtue of my own outreach and a little bit of publicity by Harvard University Press [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and it was because in part the book was so unusual.  So, by word of mouth people would say, "You know I stumbled upon this book or somebody told me about it or I heard about this guy, you should bring him."  So, word of mouth worked to my advantage in the early days.  I also knew the host of a radio program vis-a-vis a friend, Hugh Hamilton, who had a radio program on WBAI New York [WBAI Radio, New York, New York], and Hugh put me on the radio station and interviewed me about it and the interview went so well he said, "Man, I'm gonna have you back," and he did and that led to a few other things and including a speaking engagement at Hue-Man Bookstore [Hue-Man Bookstore and Cafe, New York, New York], which until it closed a few years ago, was the most prominent black bookstore in Harlem [New York, New York], and probably in black New York [New York] more generally.  Just to tell a quick story, this is three months even before I even got a call from a headhunter, I show up at Hue-Man Bookstore, David Lewis [HistoryMaker David Levering Lewis] is there, my mom [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl] happens to be in town, other extended family, because who knows how long this is gonna last, and I'm in New York and it's a big deal.  There was a line out the door to come hear me speak that day, and again this is in a--Michelle Alexander's 'The New Jim Crow' ['The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,' Michelle Alexander] had just been published three or four months before.  So, there had been some reviews, some news about it, but it wasn't what it would become.  It was too early for that.  Our books were separated by just a few months in terms of publication dates.  So, the reason those folks came out was one, the topic, two my name was compelling, 'cause I think in interviews people found out who I was and that kind of always got people interested, and three because I'd been on the radio they heard me, and so they said, "Oh, well you know, he's been on New York radio, you know this guy's gonna be in touch at Hue-Man Bookstore, let's come check him out."  So, I would say that the book had some legs in the beginning just on its own merits, but nothing like what it would become.
Story_ID: 522209
Speaker 1: --Greater appreciation for how what we might call applied history can help, not only answer some difficult questions, but also help us avoid repeating mistakes, and Sherrilyn [HistoryMaker Sherrilyn Ifill] is unique in this way because she herself is a historian who has written [in 'On the Courthouse Lawn: Confronting the Legacy of Lynching in the Twenty-first Century,' Sherrilyn Ifill] about lynching as a memory reconstructing what happened and also Reconstruction how people remembered it.  So, she has a particular relationship with the importance of the past and the work that she does.
Speaker 2: It's exciting for someone like myself to see you know this coming together in a way, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, I'll even say that it's--you could also say that my appointment to the Harvard Kennedy School [John F. Kennedy School of Government, Cambridge, Massachusetts] is also a symptom of this trend.  Harvard's Kennedy School had historically had essentially one proper historian on its roster of 120 faculty with 200 folks overall who do various kinds of teaching from adjuncts and lecturers.  So, think about that, I mean it's a school of government, focused on public policy and very applied research and engagement with policymakers, and other NGO [non-governmental organization] actors; no historians except one.  So, the person who is the senior historian on the search committee that brought me on board has been actively changing the paradigm and now there are six historians at the Kennedy School, covering everything from international relations, military history, voting history.  Leah Wright Rigueur who is a, an increasingly prominent pundit or intellectual on the history of black Republicanism has been featured extensively.  She's there at the Kennedy School, she's African American.  So, so too--I mean you also think about this, I'm the third tenured person to ever be appointed to the Kennedy School, black person, to ever be appointed to the Kennedy School, and the previous two, one was an economist named Glenn Loury [Glenn C. Loury] from Chicago [Illinois] and the other is Bill Wilson [William Julius Wilson], who is a university professor, which means that although he has an appointment with the Kennedy School, he's you know he's not really necessarily in the Kennedy School.  His appointment exceeds that, so the fact that if you were thinking about the school of government as a place to bring in the third black tenure senior professor and make it a historian.  Now, you could argue like, "Man, we sure wasted an opportunity here" (laughter).  In the way that people often think of history is not something that has practical implications, but it is part of an effort to say you know, "Many of us who do social science have been doing this for a long time and maybe we need some other ways to think about this work."
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's important because otherwise you keep repeating things, and not even understanding things from that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can do brilliant in your own space and not realize you're not the first person to be brilliant in your own space.
Speaker 2: And I like the also the interdisciplinary approach which the Kennedy School is known for.
Story_ID: 522210
Speaker 1: Going back to this, so you get this call you know and you realize the headhunter is talking about you.  You've already had this--which I didn't know about your, you know the book ['The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America,' Khalil Gibran Muhammad] signing at the bookstore where there--
Speaker 2: In Harlem at Hue-Man's [Hue-Man Bookstore and Cafe, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: In Hue-Man where you have a line around--which is very--I mean that's--
Speaker 2: Margas [sic. Marva Allen] who's the previous owner she said she had never miscalculated this badly ever before 'cause she didn't have enough books and she was hitting herself in the head.  She said, "I've done this so many times, this has never happened."
Speaker 1: That's--so, so what--how do you end up even thinking about this and what is the interview process like and?
Speaker 2: I thought about it as a learning experience too, to be honest with you.  I just you know sort of going back to that same precocious, curious kid who likes taking things apart, I thought, "Oh, I'll learn something, right.  What, what do I have to lose by going through the process?"  So, the next step I think we had a brief phone call which was really a set up for a video interview and about a month later I went to Indianapolis [Indiana] to a special--you know Skype and that sort of thing, wasn't quite where it is now, so, I had to go to a dedicated space and did video conferencing.  I only interviewed with the headhunter, she was the partner or the principal in the search firm.  It went very well and then I started having a conversation with Stephanie [Muhammad's wife, Stephanie Lawson-Muhammad] and my father [HistoryMaker Ozier Muhammad] who was still in New York [New York], even my mom [Kimberly Muhammad-Earl], but more particularly my dad since we might be moving to New York.  And it was kind of like what if, a series of what ifs.  That August, which was maybe a couple of weeks after the interview and more or less still in the early phase of the process, at least from my vantage point, I visited the Schomburg Center [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] with my family, very discretely.  I didn't know anybody there anyway, and they certain wouldn't of know who I was, but the point was to go there and it's like, "Oh, look at--."  I'd been there as a researcher, a few times, and even to attend conferences.  So, it wasn't the first time that I'd been there, but certainly my family hadn't been there, and we weren't New Yorkers so.  It's not like I felt bad about it either.  We walk in, we see the place, we're like, "Wow, this is a big deal," and Howard at the time his, his--he was outgoing, so there was a.
Speaker 1: This is [HistoryMaker] Howard Dodson?
Speaker 2: Howard Dodson; there was an exhibition up called What-- 'What's Up at The Schomburg?' ['What's Up at The Schomburg? A 25 Year Retrospective'] something with a 25 in it, it was a tribute to his 25 years at the Schomburg Center and it was kind of a celebration of the work he'd done and lot of pictures, mostly pictures from programming events and things that had happened, but we walked through that space and it started with a little shout-out to earlier director, Lawrence Reddick [Lawrence D. Reddick], Schomburg.  We saw Jean Blackwell Hutson but it was mostly about Howard, and I saw Governor Cuomo [Andrew Cuomo], Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton], George Pataki, Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel], all in these pictures with Howard Dodson, and I'm looking at this stuff thinking like, "I have to get to know these people?"  I mean it just, it blew me away, and only really reinforced in my mind that this whole job was a longshot anyway, 'cause who was I (laughter), right you know?  Been plucked out of an eight by eight cubicle, out of a cinder block office in Indiana.  This was not my future.  But lo and behold I received a call about another interview, and I came into New York for that and I sat around the table with Skip Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] convening with Gordon Davis [HistoryMaker Gordon J. Davis], the two coord- coach heirs, Eric Foner, the Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] historian, Ray McGuire [HistoryMaker Raymond J. McGuire] the banker and art collector and head of the Studio [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] board, Asia Schomburg, great granddaughter of Arturo Schomburg and Kathy Rayner [Katharine J. Rayner] who's a board member for the New York Public Library [New York, New York] made up the folks interviewing me and I took the approach, just be you.  So, whatever question they asked I answered it, and I had no reason to try to pretend I was any more qualified than the job that I was.  When asked about administrative experience, I talked about some of the community work I'd done at Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana].  I talked about administering classes to graduate students, and I talked about having been a public accountant, and having audited clients representing many multiple industries from banking to health care, to manufacturing to real estate, which I did do for two years in that capacity, and I figured you know, I did a good job, but who knows, right?  They must, they must have people.  I actually thought that Sylviane Diouf, the curator, writer, author, scholar when I looked from the outside who's warehouse I could--she should get the job.  She's smart, she's done great work--who else could succeed Howard Dodson?  It turned out my intuition was right on one hand.  She had replaced Bobbie Yancy [Roberta Yancy] when Bobbie, Howard's number two had retired, she'd run their programing and exhibition area, but I didn't realize her personality, and her personality wasn't suited for the kind of outward work and external relations work that is required of the job and so she said, "I don't really want to do this kind of work," and she was never interested in that job.
Story_ID: 522211
Speaker 1: How do you get a notice of the job and who, and do you get in the, in the wi- who else you're competing against?
Speaker 2: I knew a couple of candidates, one of whom happened to be one of my closest friends.  I'll leave his business off camera, but--so I knew about that and I knew about another candidate, Molefi Asante [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante] because it was covered in the press.  So, I had some vague sense of what kinds of candidate they were interested in but I knew I was very different from Molefi Asante.  So, it, it wasn't clear who the other people were who would be like him.  I've sense learned you know, I know all of, who those people were in hindsight, but at the time the next step was a second interview with a smaller version of that committee over, over lunch in Columbus Circle at a place called Gabriel's [Gabriel's Bar and Restaurant, New York, New York] and that was interesting because--oh, Calvin Butts [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Calvin O. Butts] was the other person but he wasn't at the first interview, he came to the second one.  It was kind of a hazing session, oh, and [HistoryMaker] Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] was in the first and--no, he missed the first interview, he was in the second one.  I could reconstruct who was in the first one, but that wasn't the whole committee.  So, Darren came to the second one, Calvin Butts came, Gordon [HistoryMaker Gordon J. Davis], my future boss whose name is Ann Thornton, Ray McGuire [HistoryMaker Raymond J. McGuire], and Kathy Rayner [Katharine J. Rayner], that was the second group and it was much more casual.  It felt like a set-up where they would--it was deliberately meant to disarm my guard and to get me to just be very free and I was conscious of this probably because I pledged in a fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] to be honest, it was a lot of mental you know, most of the abuse was actually not physical, but mental.  So, I picked up on it in the banter and exchange and did a little of baiting to see where I would go with things.  One example is that Reverend Butts asked me if he were walking by the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], and the NYPD [New York City Police Department] jumped out their cars and started beating on him, what would I do?  Which I thought was the most peculiar question in the world, in a room full of adults.  It just seemed like a very unusual, unlikely thing to happen.  So, I paused and I thought and said, "Um," are they thinking like, wanna get in and start beating up the cops?  Like, well that's not my personality and I said, "I have to represent the interest of the Schomburg so I said as the head of the Schomburg I would call the police and explain what was going on and certainly call attention to this injustice, but--," and I just kind of left it at that, like what else am I supposed to do?  But I, it was that kind of environment where, one hand the questions could be very disarming, almost to the point where you might be overly familiar, and the next second you'd have to answer a question like that, which I thought, what a strange question to ask someone.  But, I knew by then that I was one of two, I'd been informed.  So, by the time that interviewed happened, I knew I had a fifty-fifty chance of getting the job and then emotionally things started to change because this was very real and I could be the next director of the Schomburg.  I mean it's not like I still knew the job any better than I had before, but I certainly had a more keen sense that they saw something in me that they thought was compelling enough to get me to this point.
Story_ID: 522212
Speaker 1: So, what is interesting--so, you--this is the--other thing is Howard [HistoryMaker Howard Dodson] has been in this job for--
Speaker 2: Twenty, at that time about twenty-five, twenty-six years, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Twenty-five years, and he had built his, his own--I don't want to say fiefdom, but it's--the own legacy you know 'cause he had brought in people like [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, and James Baldwin into the collection [of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York].  So, all those things are happening, and but you come in with a lot of notoriety, your announcement, the announcement of your appointment comes with a lot of press, and so tell me what you come into?
Speaker 2: In terms of showing up at the job?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  I mean what, yeah when you come into the position, what do you come into?
Speaker 2: Well, there's the inside and there's the outside, and those are not the same.  So, the outside part is I immediately come into a world of black movers and shakers.  And by that, I mean--so I was represented by [HistoryMaker] Terrie Williams, who is perhaps the leading black publicist, certainly has a long list of clients she's worked with over the years.  That was special in and of itself because immediately she's connecting me to people and singing my praises and telling them how brilliant and great I am.  I mean she didn't know me from a can of paint, but that's her job as a publicist.  I mean she knew I had written a book ['The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America,' Khalil Gibran Muhammad], and she was impressed, but most of it was just kind of you know aspirational praise, but it, it automatically opened me up to the realities that people took seriously the job I had, and so Avery Brooks was calling, he had worked with Howard over the years.  He was in a little bit of failing health at the time, but he was calling to welcome me and to offer his support to anything I might need.  I had a closed-door meeting with Al Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton] in his Midtown office, after hours just the two of us.  No one was in the whole office suite except him and me and a cleaning person who was working in other rooms.  So, it was that, it was the scale that to go from essentially you know having--
Speaker 1: Obscurity, really.
Speaker 2: Yeah, not only obscurity but also very few people would care anything about what I thought or did in any context up to that point.  I mean they might find it a curiosity that was Elijah Muhammad's great-grandson and that might spark you know a five-minute conversation, but otherwise you know I would just come off as an interesting, smart young man.  Now, all of a sudden, I'm being invited to--[HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor invites me to her and Kephra's [HistoryMaker Khephra Burns] home to meet [HistoryMaker] Carmen De Lavallade, and to welcome a whole another group of dancers, who are just performing off-Broadway.  It was a lot, in January, several months before I started, Howard had his final gala and I'm on stage with Ashford and Simpson [Nickolas Ashford and HistoryMaker Valerie Simpson] before Ashford passed a couple of years ago. I'm backstage with Cicely Tyson who is giving me a hug and wishing me well (laughter).  It's crazy, and Stephanie [Stephanie Lawson-Muhammad] you know, I mean I have a beautiful wife, you know we had a strong, healthy relationship, and so we're processing this together and people are looking at us like we are the first family, like a mini version of the first family, it was, it was fascinating, it was fascinating.
Speaker 1: But that's like a whirlwind, like you, like you're looking at this exhibit ['What's Up at The Schomburg? A 25 Year Retrospective'] you know (laughter), of twenty-five years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I got it in July and in January I almost stayed with Ashford and Simpson.
Speaker 1: So I mean, I'm just saying 'cause I was actually at Howard's, at the twenty-fifth, you know that's--
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah, yeah, George Faison [HistoryMaker George W. Faison].  I mean it's just, it was other worldly for me.
Story_ID: 522213
Speaker 1: But you're also being put front and center as the next coming, as there're other young people you know who are in position.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You're meeting those too, you know, [HistoryMaker] Thelma Golden.  I mean you've got a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was already established but the perfect example is [HistoryMaker] Robert Battle and Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] because his appointment and mine are separated by just a matter of weeks, I came to know him because [HistoryMaker] Tavis Smiley interviewed both of us in a joint episode for his show ['The Tavis Smiley Show'].  We weren't actually in studio at the same time but the show aired with, "Let's meet the two new directors of these historical black cultural institutions, Robert Battle and Khalil Muhammad [HistoryMaker Khalil Gibran Muhammad]."  Yes, it was, it was a moment for, for kind of--I don't know if it's been sustained, but it certainly was a moment for this feeling of a generational transfer of power.  That finally now, there are new heads and leaders emerging in the cultural arena at least who we ought to get to know and pay attention to.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ben Jealous [Benjamin Jealous] had just, you know he had been elected as the youngest.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Before us, but only by basically two years in '09 [2009].  So, you know the youngest leader of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in its history.
Speaker 1: Well, there's also a focus on Harlem [New York, New York] and the change in Harlem as--you know that had started some--you know years before especially some people say after Clinton's arrival here.
Speaker 2: And [HistoryMaker] Marcus Samuelsson who's my age, maybe Marcus is a couple years older (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Marcus is investing.
Speaker 2: He had just started to--and Red Rooster [Red Rooster Harlem, New York, New York] was, had just opened.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: A few months before I arrived in Harlem.
Speaker 1: So, I'm just--so, there's this perception and there's an attention to the new, you know the new leaders in that way.  So, and a lot of visibility, press visibility, and also expectation.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 522214
Speaker 1: That's the public face, what about behind?
Speaker 2: Behind, wow (laughter).  So, all right I mean so, so the good part that helped a lot was that I was appointed in, let's just say the beginning of November, I didn't arrive until the end of July.  So, there was a long transition period between the news of my coming and my actual arrival and, in the meantime, because I was an academic and essentially had you know some flexibility, I mean in some ways I neglected my students my last semester at Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], but between November and July I was coming to New York City [New York, New York] two times a month, sometimes more for various reasons.  Some for specific meetings that were set up by Howard [HistoryMaker Howard Dodson] and the library more generally to understand processes.  Some to meet people like Al Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton], it just depended on whatever it was.  Some--I was elected to Crain's Forty under 40 business magazine which was the library's doing.  They nominated me and I was selected and so I had to come just for a photo shoot.  Same thing happened with The Network Journal, African American business journal, Forty under 40, so I had to come in for that.  So, for one reason or another I was coming in and I was spending time with Howard getting to know the staff and getting to know the colleagues at 42nd Street.  So, I had a lot of experience coming in the door just from that exposure, and it definitely made me feel more confident, but there's nothing like showing up in a place like that the first day.  Howard's, gone, you've got an assistant who's looking at you like you know, "What do you want me to do?"  (Laughter)  Phones ringing, there's mail that's already shown up months before I actually arrived, she hands me an envelope full of invoices that needed to be signed and dated so they could be processed, because Howard had been gone for a couple of weeks or a week or he hadn't--you know there was just stuff to do and people needed to move on with their work and they needed my input and I must say that one of the first things I said I'm gonna change here is I said, "I'm not signing every invoice, every single day that comes into this building."  Howard had a different management style, it was more top down, and as a consequence of that he was approving everything, and I said, "I don't wanna have to approve everything.  If you bought the paper you can approve it or your manager can approve it.  Don't send me this stuff," and eventually that's how it worked and so early on that was my lesson, and the other thing I'd say in terms of the Harlem [New York, New York] community, it was very obvious to me that people needed to get to know me.  That they had a great sense of propriety over the institution [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York].  They cared deeply about the institution and they did not know me.  They were willing to give me a wide berth because of my family heritage.  I think the fact that I had written a book ['The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America,' Khalil Gibran Muhammad] that was so explicitly about racism and wasn't some soft weird, squishy academic take on things that they wouldn't know what my politics were.  That helped.  Some word of mouth helped because people had seen me at Hue-Man [Hue-Man Bookstore and Cafe, New York, New York] and/or heard me on the radio [WBAI Radio, New York, New York] and they came into embrace me, but mostly the onus was on me to prove myself worthy of the job and that's been--that meant spending a tremendous amount of time, effort and energy, visible, on the street, in the lobby, taking meetings with whomever asked for one.
Story_ID: 522215
Speaker 1: I mean the first year I was there, Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson] I was meeting with people, I mean three, four times, back-to-back, meetings that were lasting an hour each.  A lot of people who had unfinished business with Howard [HistoryMaker Howard Dodson] and who had been waiting for somebody to show up who could green light whatever vision they had of the future with the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] at the center of it.  Artists who had performed there, Larry Neal, the jazz trombonist who had done some work with Howard, met with me in Indiana even before I came.  He happened to come there for something, knew I was the new Schomburg director and was putting in his dibs for coming back to the Schomburg.  So, I also learned through all these meetings how much power there was in using the resources that I had at my disposal in a way that would curry friendship and favor.  Which also was scary because I could see very easily and very early on how favoritism could lead to corruption.  That you can hire people, you can bring 'em in as consultants.  You can you know pick people to be on your stage or have exhibitions in ways that was not meritocratic or even fair, and I decided very early on that I did not want an administration, I did not want my time to be associated with picking winners and losers.  So, I tried to establish some protocols very early on.  I created a little bit more distance between myself and the decision-making around those sorts of things.  I mean I was always part of it, but I had--I hired someone right away who was my Bobbie [Roberta Yancy] and I gave her more discretion.  So, whether it being sort of me making decisions, and her executing, I gave her the freedom to, to run programs and to run exhibitions, and we worked together, it wasn't like that, but it was a way for someone else other than me to be the front person saying yes or nay, because what I , what was clear is that with all of the community stakeholders who had a claim on the Schomburg, it was clear that people understood that if you want something to happen, you go to the director.  You ask for a meeting with the director.  You talk to the director.  So (laughter), that's why the phone was flying off the hook.  That's why I had all these meetings and most of those meetings you know I listened carefully.  I got to know the person, but I wasn't--I didn't say, "Yes, you could do that," because one I realized I didn't have enough resources just to say yes to everything, and two, I realized that, that if I had no intermediary then it was--at some point I was going to do this for somebody who I wasn't willing to do that for and why was that, and someone could easily come back and say, "Well, he's so and so to this person, he didn't let me do that."  And I didn't want that.
Story_ID: 522216
Speaker 1: I also realized that all that church that I'd had as an adult, all those experiences were incredibly helpful to me, because it helped me understand black culture in a way that you can't learn in the history book, and that your family is helpful, certainly.  I had a black, very grounded family but you know it wasn't a southern family, it was a northern family.  It wasn't a Harlem [New York, New York] family, it was a Chicago [Illinois] family.  It wasn't a particularly religious family, and so the church, all those experiences cumulatively from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to Indiana and even to New Jersey, where two of my kids were christened gave me a bigger plate to work from, in a broader sense of the archetypes of black folk that were coming in through our doors, and I also realized that the best analogy for being the director of the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] was being pastor of a church.  And for me the job was to identify the existing culture and then to change it.  To shift people away from thinking that this is a church community, where there are orthodoxies, where there's protocols, where the pastor has final, you know the pastor always has final say, the first and last say and even deliberation.  That the power is top down, that the pastor is surrounded by a group of surrogates, you know who take special power in their own position and relationship to that authority and do, do the church's business.  I didn't want any of that, I wanted to be frank, a more traditional, corporate management culture without the bad of corporate management culture, but I wanted more decision making to be in the hands of managers.  I wanted them to have better information to make better decisions.  I wanted to hold them accountable for those decisions, and I wanted them to become the face of the institution, so that when people came calling, "I want to do a program."  "There's a manager of programs, that's the person you should talk to."  "I wanted to do an exhibition."  "There's the manager of exhibitions."  "I want to do education," whatever.  Whatever the case, there's a person to talk to that.  I managed those people and they come to me and we talk about those things and we, you know we make difficult decisions about this or that, but that's the person you talk to, but it took a while to get there.
Speaker 2: Well it's hard when you come behind someone who has been in a position so long, I mean, period (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right. Yeah.
Story_ID: 522217
Speaker 1: Weren't you also in the midst of a capital campaign [at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York]?  Wasn't that also part of it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, so when I came in what I w- what I inherited was a major renovation project.  So, Howard [HistoryMaker Howard Dodson] had, had put in place a two-phase renovation.  The first phase had been finished in 2007, the second phase was pending and it was roughly a $10 million job and mostly included renovations to our HVAC units, and an addition of--a two-story addition where a gift shop and a conference room would be added to the building, as well as some landscaping.  So, it was important, but that's what it was. I inherited this, it was a big deal because all of a sudden, I'm having to make decisions about fabric on the wall, (laughter) you know, this unit which is a premium unit versus that unit which is good, and it's like good, better, best kind of thing that contractors come up with.  Landscaping design whether the benches were gonna be friendly to the homeless or anti-homeless, all kind of things. And what do I know?  I'm from Indiana, but it was clear that everyone is looking at--to me and saying "Dr. Muhammad [HistoryMaker Khalil Gibran Muhammad], what do you think?"  (Laughter) So it didn't take me long to realize that was my job and so I'd, you know I I'd use the information in front of me, asked good questions and made decisions.
Story_ID: 522218
Speaker 1: Who is your kitchen cabinet?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have much of a kitchen cabinet then which was a major challenge from the beginning.  Howard [HistoryMaker Howard Dodson] worked with Bobbie [Roberta Yancy], they were a twosome, and Bobbie had retired before Howard left.  So, I was left with no one.  There was no one in what you would consider senior leadership--I'm sorry, I take that back.  I'm thinking only of the program space, on the library side Diana Lachatanere was the number two person at the time. So, in the absence of Bobbie, Diana became really number two and Diana was more or less number three with the three of them, and the curators had a lot of responsibility, but they didn't have a much decision-making as you might think, and Diana had inherited decision making over the years, really late in her career there.  She hadn't always been in that position, but, it wasn't--I think what I really want to capture is there really wasn't a culture of senior management.  There was a culture of decision making which was top down and limited to a few people, but there wasn't a culture where generally mangers have regular meetings, talk about challenges, even when they don't--they're not widely shared.  So, one of the things I learned early on is how important communication and information is.  What did that mean practically speaking?  It meant establishing bimonthly, all staff meetings which the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] didn't have.  It meant establishing a management team structure.  It meant a level of communicative redundancy that would socialize people to think about the work at the center beyond their own particular silos, and I remember how difficult it was for example getting people to put agenda items on our meetings list.  They said, "Well, we already talked about that."  I said, "Yes, you and I talked about but the rest of the library doesn't know what that is.  This is really for people to hear what you're doing, and that's important," and they would get it and the next month they'd be like, "I don't have anything to add."  I'd say, "Well did you--have you shared your new educational initiative?"  "No, we talked about that."  I'd say, "No, we talked about that, but the rest of the library doesn't know about it."  So, it took a long, a couple of years really to re-socialize the place where people to have a stake in what the library was doing, the Schomburg was doing in general, not just you know the manuscript division, or the photo and prints division or the program space and that really was about meetings on top of meetings, and you know it wasn't overly oppressive, but we had a lot more meetings regularly scheduled.
Speaker 1: So, how large was the staff?
Speaker 2: When I left the staff was eighty-five--
Speaker 1: And when you came?
Speaker 2: --and I grew a management team of six people from really one.  Diana was the person I inherited and it grew to six.
Speaker 1: So how long did it take you to grow to this--you know a couple, couple (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It took three and a half years to get there, yeah, about three and a half.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it takes time to build a bench.
Speaker 2: It does, and one that is stable and one you can trust and, that the work is happening, yeah.
Story_ID: 522219
Speaker 1: I wanna state like how are you managing all of this?  Like, people have very definite ideas about the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], very opinionated about the Schomburg and what it represents.  People who liked Howard's [HistoryMaker Howard Dodson] administration or were very--and people were like, no. How are you, and then you have them in--how are you managing all that?
Speaker 2: Well, it didn't--it wasn't obvious out of the gate but when I talked about not picking winners and losers and not having the appearance of carrying about this group of people and not caring about that group of people which split in a thousand directions, because it split generationally between, you know often between sort of baby boom, Gen X [Generation X] and even millennial.  It wasn't just two generations, there were actually really three.  Between--across, across class, between elites, wannabe elites, to community activists and people who would rather be homeless rather than live in a home, which I had a whole experience with that.  So, and then you had you know, very Harlem [New York, New York].  You know, "I'm a native Harlemite and that means something different from these newcomers," to kind of the parochialism of New Yorkers in general, who many of who don't travel and think, "Why else would you go anywhere, including to New Jersey?"  And then the cultural politics from the pan-Africanist to the black nationalists, to people who you know felt that they had always been ignored and they had a long list of grievances that the Schomburg had not asked for their art, or had not asked for their papers, or Howard didn't put them on stage at the prime of their career.  It was just a lot, so I took the approach that the only way to appear not to be picking winners and losers is to make space for everybody.  Make space for everybody.  Like, what is black culture?  It's everything, and in that sense the only thing I had to do was to figure out where we were weak because Howard had a decent cross section of those things, but he was definitely more invested in scholarship and, and shoring up the institution's reputation as a place of learning for scholars, not even for learning for kids, learning for scholars, and he was producing encyclopedias and books and web resources.  Well, in some ways I felt like we don't have to focus in that area, because we're pretty solid there.  We're known for that, the scholars are gonna find us.  It's not like I have to hang a sign on the door that says you know, "We support scholarship."  People understood that.  Where I thought I could broaden the reach, while maintaining a place for everybody at the table, even if the seats got shuffled a bit was generally younger audiences, from you know as far as I was concerned between five and forty-five, there was a huge opportunity to, to either introduce the Schomburg to folks for the first time or re-introduce them to the Schomburg for the first time.  And in that space, there were some obvious things to do which was to bring talent that spoke to those audiences.  And that talent was often unfamiliar to the Abyssinian Baptist Church [New York, New York] community which were major supporters and you know, essentially the church ladies had grown accustomed to coming over to the Schomburg for various programs that had interest to them and two of them in particular are two of--are two wonderful people who supported me from day one, but I can see them right now, I'm bad with names.  They'll kill me when they see this and say, "How could you forget us?"  But, they were best buds and they'd come to everything, but unlike some people they rode out everything, because they were interested in what I was doing there to bring in these new--newer audiences.
Story_ID: 522220
Speaker 1: So, you know I often mention this but Chimamanda Adichie [Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie] had never been to the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], the Nigerian-born novelist and most recently of 'Americanah.'  She came for a wide-ranging discussion on literature and of which I was a part of.  We got to meet each other, we exchanged--we jousted on stage a little bit in front of a live audience--the place was packed.  People were just falling each other, and a cultural organization called Vee le Jolie [ph.] out of Lyon, France was the person--people who curated it, we just were the venue, but anyway I made contact with her.  I said, "Hey would you come back for something?"  She said, "Absolutely."  My program team went into action, they paired her with Zadie Smith, the British, the Afro-British novelist and the place just exploded with enthusiasm, but exploded with enthusiasm with young people, not just young people, young people of the diaspora.  So, it was the perfect intersection of something that Howard [HistoryMaker Howard Dodson] had managed to do well with an older generation, but these new African immigrant children, and often second generation in America, or first generation Americans were a different group than the African American community and the first generation that came of age in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s].  So, that was a perfect example of a little bit of the old and a lot of the new.  By the way, we started live streaming, and live streaming also satisfied the appetite of a broader range of stakeholders, because a lot of people just couldn't get to the Schomburg, and so nationally, our reach grew just through platform.  For example, I haven't looked in a while but Zadie Smith and Chimamanda Adichie's conversation that was recorded, no different than watching an episode of Bill Moyers or 'The Actors Studio' ['Inside the Actors Studio'], 130,000 people had watched it within a month of them appearing on our stage.  Now, we haven't come anywhere close to that number since then, but that was a kind of two and a half, three-year end sign that we were doing the right thing, that people were responding, and so we continue to invest in new talents, meaning identify people who would appeal to younger audiences, and at the same time create space for people who were more traditionally part of our stakeholder community to still enjoy the Schomburg.  So, it was more about green lighting a little bit of everything, rather than making the tough choice that we weren't gonna do this anymore, 'cause we were gonna do that.
Story_ID: 522221
Speaker 1: The one thing I'll say I added to our programming space, and to some degree exhibitions but more programming, was just the social justice, racial justice work because of my particular research field and my experience or time at Vera [Vera Institute of Justice, New York, New York], I was just more connected to people who were in a not-profit arena doing advocacy work around these issues.
Speaker 2: Well, and then the time, like it's like perfect timing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who knew?
Speaker 2: I mean, who knew?
Speaker 1: I mean I say this and this to me encapsulates perfectly on top of everything we talked about, about my lack of experience, my naivete about the real scope and scale of the work.  Imagine coming into the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] in 2011 which just so happens to be the 150th year of the start of the Civil War, which just so happens to be the 50th year of sort of a series of civil rights' anniversaries that are coming freedom, the Freedom Rides.  The sit-in movement had just been memorialized the year before, but you've got the March on Washington, the Freedom Rides, a series of events, Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965]; all that is coming up.  And it just so happens that in the middle of remembering the past, and commemorating these significant milestones, you've got a racial justice movement breaking out right under your watch.  So, it could've been a lot quieter there over the last five years were it not for this historical moment.  I mean if I had come in say between 2006 and 2011, it would've been a very different experience.  There wouldn't have been all that civil rights memorialization of the 50th and it wouldn't have been a racial justice movement because the sparks had not been set yet.
Speaker 2: And a focus on policing too.
Speaker 1: And a focus on policing, which again married, really serendipitously my research to this big moment.  So, what that meant it I was always balancing people who were interested in me, Khalil [HistoryMaker Khalil Gibran Muhammad] the scholar versus Khalil the Schomburg director, and, and in many cases those things were inseparable but if I were to tally the number of speaking engagements that I did during those five years, I'd say maybe, maybe a third to 40 percent were local to New York and New Jersey and they ran the gamut.  The local ones tended to be more Schomburg focused but maybe only still 30 percent, 70 percent still being, "We want you to talk about your book ['The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America,' Khalil Gibran Muhammad]."  Externally, I'd say of the engagements I did, probably 10 percent were Schomburg related, 90 percent my scholarship, but in both cases, both locally and nationally, and I traveled, I mean I didn't do a lot of international travel but I'd been coast-to-coast at least a hundred universities in those five years.  There was always a convergence of people who knew the Schomburg because they were part of his research alumni network.  You know someone come up to me in African American studies and say hey you know, "Thanks for coming to our campus.  The students read your book, they're really interested and you should know that I couldn't have written my dissertation or I couldn't have written my book without the Schomburg Center."  Or, I would go you know so the University of Louisville [Louisville, Kentucky], I went to give a talk there.  Someone come out to me who's local to Louisville, Kentucky and they say, "I've been a long-time Schomburg member, thank you for coming to Louisville.  It's wonderful to meet you in person."  So, it was a sort of virtuous circle.  Every time I was out on the road for one reason or another, it enhanced the visibility of the Schomburg Center because people associated my presence with an, an outreach effort that extended its reach and got people reconnected to the Schomburg.

Speaker 1: So, in many ways Howard [HistoryMaker Howard Dodson] had been there--he had become iconic because of who he brought, and the stability he bought.  I even forgot, until recently, who preceded Howard 'cause--Haizlip?
Speaker 2: No, Ellis didn't precede Howard.  They were contemp- Howard essentially hired Ellis Haizlip (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, see someone--okay, I thought so.  So, who preceded Howard?
Speaker 2: A woman named Jean Blackwell Hutson.
Speaker 1: Hutson, oh so, okay who was legendary.
Speaker 2: She was legendary, right.
Speaker 1: I mean lots--she's mentioned in our archives a tremendous amount, and then--
Speaker 2: Now, just for the record, the official record, a man named Wendell Wray [Wendell L. Wray] actually succeeded Jean Blackwell Hutson but he had a very short controversial tenure, it lasted a couple of years, if that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and why was his tenure controversial?
Speaker 2: For a number of reasons, one, I think Ms. Hutson's shadow loomed larger than any person could figure out how to get from under at that time.  She was still alive and she was spending time at Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] and it was hard.  Two, he had a certain kind of politics that didn't work for the Schomburg and he was, he was an integrationist in the sense that he was trying to overcorrect.  This would be, I mean I didn't know him so I don't want to say this as it's my--often to critique, but my read on the situation is that he was trying to overcorrect in terms of making the place seem friendlier to white people and it just didn't work and the timing was not quite right.  And Howard, who turned out to have come from spaces where he was very comfortable working with white administrators, was more adept at being able to navigate those competing social milieus.
Speaker 1: 'Cause Howard had spent time at the NEH [National Endowment for the Humanities], I mean he had a strong administrative--but he was coming out of a strong black arts movement.
Speaker 2: That's right, so he could speak both languages, and I think this gentleman just--and I think it was just gonna be hard for anyone.  The difference I think between Ms. Hutson and her successor versus Howard and me, was Howard and I just simply--we clicked you know, whether it was purely the generosity of his spirit or his deep concern for the Schomburg's future that he made himself available.  It could be both.
Speaker 1: I think both because Howard is really the reason we're around and he was, and I consider it both generosity and spirit and you know I say I found myself here at the Schomburg like, like thousands of other people.
Story_ID: 522223
Speaker 1: But you could have been here [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] for as long as he was here.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yes.
Speaker 1: You could've.  Because he actually leaves town you know and goes to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  He leaves, so there's not a Jean Hutson [Jean Blackwell Hutson] you know looming over (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, he handed over the ranks, definitely.
Speaker 1: And, and, and I think you know it was available to you if you had questions or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, but, so what happened?  I mean because you could've been--you literally could've been here.
Speaker 2: Twenty-five years, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean you could have easily, because people--I mean at least the percent--you know it's all the things that you came in with.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know and the energy coming in which represented the next generation, as.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, I would say that I took the job under the terms that I would not be there for longer than ten years, and in fact I told the search committee during the second interview just as we broke up, when I had not been offered the job, when I very clearly could've talked myself out of the job offer.  That they should know that I would not stay longer than ten years.
Speaker 1: But you were here less than ten years?
Speaker 2: That's true but I'm saying I think it's important.
Speaker 1: To know.
Speaker 2: Because in my head, this was never gonna be longer than ten years.
Speaker 1: I see, and see Howard [HistoryMaker Howard Dodson] said he wasn't gonna be long, he thought he was gonna be there a few years and look, it ended up, so that's the--you know.
Speaker 2: So, here's the thing, I--a couple of things that really helped, maybe three things.  I think the first is that I just wasn't built to want to be anywhere that long, I mean remember the precocious, curious kid who likes to take things apart?  So, I figured my learning curve would flatten out after so long.  That, as a practical matter, I would get bored with the job, so I just figured that ten years would probably be the maximum.  I figured, one it was principal for me to let them know because I was coming behind a person who had been there for twenty-five years and practically speaking it made me feel morally--it sat better with my morals to admit something without feeling like I was selling them something that they didn't realize that they were buying which was like some guy who comes and goes.  So, that, that was real for me.  Ten years was gonna be it.  Now, I could've changed my mind and got in there and thought, man, this is terrific, but I think I also learned that the amount of work it took for me to win over a significant amount of supporters internally which was really hard and externally, I thought, "It's really easy to get comfortable after a while" because once you've work that hard, once you knocked on every door selling greeting cards and candy, just like I'd done before, at some point you know people get used to you and their expectations you know settle down to normal expectations.  Your own sense of accomplishments, you know you sort of rest on some legacy laurels.  I think Howard had a couple of significant runs in terms of twenty-five years, like you know he didn't do what I'm describing in a sense, he had an early stint, then he built the auditorium, then he had another major renovation, so in some ways I admire him for the longevity and commitment to the work.  For me, I started to think to myself that, I'm giving them my best, like it doesn't get any better than this.  Do you understand what I mean?  And I think that's why for me coming back to the timing of those anniversaries and the racial justice movement and my own work, it's like--when was it gonna--I mean, it's not like I was gonna end up writing another book--I, that was another problem.  That's the third reason, but even before I say more about that.
Speaker 1: Because you didn't have the time?
Speaker 2: I didn't have the time. Like when, when was it gonna get even more busy?  Do you understand what I mean by that?  Like I never had a quiet moment.  In Howard's defense, I'll say that he started out with a much quieter moment, and it's not to say that it wasn't not busy, it just wasn't the place that it became.  He didn't have the auditorium, he didn't have the expectations on the scale that I had them.  There wasn't national media as much there was local and black media.  So, if you think about what it means to be on social media--I mean our Twitter followers went from two thousand to fifty thousand while I was there.  Whatever it is we can verify it but it, it grew exponentially.  I remember we were counting them, like I remember I was on a board.  In fact, it was even lower, it was in the thousands, like 1,273 Twitter followers.  So, if you think the pace of information, the shifts in social media marketing, we went from very little social media.  We, we didn't have a Facebook page, we didn't send a biweekly email newsletter to announce what we were doing.  So much of what today is essential to success, there was no live stream reaching all those people, happened in those five years, and so there's not gonna be another Internet breakthrough (laughter) in my time.
Story_ID: 522224
Speaker 1: We grew programming, you know.  This is a little bit tricky to explain, but I'll do the best I can.  If you read The New York Times article of my coming ['Historian Will Direct Schomburg Center in Harlem,' Felicia R. Lee], Howard's [HistoryMaker Howard Dodson] attendance record is quoted as 120,000 people who come annually.  And that was the best number they had at the time.  They changed the record, they changed how they count.  They went from manual to automatic.  So, my automatic counts grew from Howard's number to 250,000 my first year.  The second year the 250,000 grew to 360 [360,000] and remained over 300,000 over the remaining time I was there.  So, there was some significant growth.  It was hard to say exactly 'cause the way of accounting floor changed, but the bottom line is, I probably wasn't gonna see 600,000 people coming in the doors, maybe even 500,000.  So, what you're starting to hear is that it was hard for me to conceptualize growth for the center over a reasonable amount of time within those ten years.  The thing that I recognized is essentially, I had probably given them my best ideas, and I was gonna need some quiet time to figure out something else and that was gonna be whatever.  Two, that the next best thing for the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], going forward, was an expansion.  Because we're doing a renovation, not an expansion.  The Schomburg is literally bursting at the seams in terms of its capacity to store its collections and to have proper classroom, exhibition space for all the great work it does, I mean we do well with what we have, but we could expand.  What museum or institution doesn't expand?  So, it's not as if that's a bad thing, it doesn't make me a bad person or unrealistic to say the Schomburg needs to expand.  The Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] is about to tear down and totally expand, but guess what?  Those are not gonna happen within the next five years, so that pushes me outside of my ten year plan, which means that if I were going to motivate myself to do the quote, unquote, next big thing, for the Schomburg, it was gonna mean making basically a fifteen to twenty-five year commitment, and were I at the end of my productive life as a scholar, then that would've been a wonderful fifteen to twenty-five years to take on, but I wasn't.  And so, it--I had been battling all of this time the pangs and regrets of not having the kind of time it takes to understand, study and write about a problem, and I've done a little bit of it and I tried to balance those interests as best I could, but I also realized that the window for my life as a scholar was gonna close fairly soon.  Maybe I could've squeezed two more years out, but at some point, people would not think, Khalil [HistoryMaker Khalil Gibran Muhammad] wrote an amazing book ['The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America,' Khalil Gibran Muhammad].  His work is very relevant to scholarship and advocacy.  You know there are graduate students--there are people going to grad school right now I can say with a fair amount of conceit who are there to study something because they heard me speak or they read my book.  Now, I'm not saying that's a hundred people, it might not even be ten, but there's some out there who are doing that, and my desire to be in community with those people is significant, and once I put that into the equation and I think I have to stay here for fifteen to twenty-five to build a new building, or to take possession of the one next door, to actually do something meaningful here, over those next few years, it was time to go.
Speaker 2: So you really, you--it's extremely important to you that you be a scholar.
Speaker 1: It's extremely important for me to have a platform, an opportunity to be engaged as a scholar and to write as a scholar.  What I am not wedded to is the life of a permanent scholar, which is precisely why I was willing to leave tenure on the table at Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] which most people thought was insanity because--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --at the time when the academic labor market is terrible, I mean truly terrible.
Speaker 2: Terrible, right.
Speaker 1: At one point they thought the baby boomers would retire and there would be space for people like me.  It turns out that when baby boomers retire, they eliminate the line, and you know tenure, may be in its last throes, who knows, but it doesn't look good, especially in humanities.  So, that was already known when I left and you know a lot of really great peers of mine were like, "Man, you're crazy.  Like what made you make that decision?"  Well, I did it because I'm torn between these two selves, the curious self who wants to take things apart and study them, and the advocacy self who wants to do something.  The Schomburg gave me both for a time.  I was taking apart the challenges of running the place like, how does this work?  At the same time, I had a platform for advocacy and engagement around a broad set of issues, but once I no longer could take things apart in my work, which to be frank, I was starting to lose--you know the learning curve was starting to move like this.  The only way I can get that back up is to change jobs or to go back into the scholarship mode full time where I'm actually deconstructing and pulling apart the past.
Story_ID: 522225
Speaker 1: So, w- was there ever the possibility and maybe that you could have had someone managing, you know like, you know and then you be the scholar, public historian [at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I--
Speaker 2: So, yes.  This, this was one possibility and it was very much part of the strategy of retention that the New York Public Library [New York, New York] used to try to keep me, but the problem is that as much I changed the management culture, and to some degree the public culture, remember the church metaphor, the pastor is the person you talk to?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: People were never gonna fully value the perspective of a number two who was really running the place.  It was gonna--so, I moved the needle from being you know being very flat, where there was almost only, there was almost only an expectation that I would make all the decisions and be the person you talk to, to somewhere in between where I could be more strategic and taking on meetings and, and giving face to people with genuine needs to talk to me, but I wasn't gonna get here.
Speaker 1: Well, who--?
Speaker 2: It's not the culture of the place, it's not the expectation of people and it breeds--what it breeds.  The downside on that end of the spectrum where you've got a basically a person running the place and you're a figurehead, 'cause you're doing other things, it breeds a sense of resentment, both internally and if people begin to think that you're just--that you don't really care about them or the institutions, that you're too busy doing other things, and, and I didn't wanna try that out.  I could, I could see that, that's what lives on the other side of the balance that I tried to strike and I figured it's not in my interest to try that out to be honest with you, and the fact is you know that you still have responsibilities.  So, even if, even if you got a really talented person, I'm still on the phone or on email making decisions and troubleshooting and I can only make the right decision or choose a path that I could live with if I'm--have some proximity to the issues, but the further away I go, the less proximity to the issue, but the responsibility of decision making and consequence never go away.
Story_ID: 522226
Speaker 1: So, you know I need to ask who Bobbie's last name was?
Speaker 2: Yancy.
Speaker 1: Yancy.
Speaker 2: Roberta Yancy.
Speaker 1: And who were the people that you brought in, that, you know--who became your management team?
Speaker 2: Sure, so in the last version of the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] leadership, the most significant contributor or the person I brought in is a guy named Alvin Starks who carried the title of director of strategic initiatives and essentially, he managed a fund-raising branch and communications and programming.  I also brought in a new director of operations, a woman named Kena Mayberry to fill out an existing team of staff that I inherited, but promoted.  So, part of my leadership team was a significant amount of internal promotion and increasing responsibility and decision making for people and then a few new people.
Speaker 1: And what did you learn about managing, too?  You know because I think there are lot of African American institutions that need new leadership or are, or you know the leadership has gotten older, so there's this--you know where someone's been in place and someone's coming in.  The--like when I saw it when I was at Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater].  I wanted to cry because it just, you know it looks smooth.  It's this beautiful building, you know I mean just, but that was grown, it's home grown sort of more like that you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, I would say in terms of black institutions, in terms of leadership challenges and transformation, I think the thing that sticks out in my head most is the level of need in our communities.  The desire for voice to be seen and heard.  It's real, it is so real.  So, that manifests itself in all sorts of ways.  Not, not only with your user base, people who are using your institution's resources, but also with your own staff.  The sense of being at a place where the leadership is black, even though--Schomburg is unique, the, the ownership and ultimate management of the Schomburg sits with a predominately white leadership at 42nd Street with the board and president and his team, but you know it's one degree removed for most of the staff.  So, you're, you are managing not only what's right in front of you, the thing, the issue, the personnel concern, but you're also managing vulnerabilities and a sense of an additional obligation that we have one to the other because we know that the world is a hostile place and we know that we shouldn't treat each other this way or that we should treat each other that way, and that's very difficult.  Not only it is real and authentic, but it can get in the way of making tough decisions about you know, what should you be doing?  How should you be doing it?  Is this place the right place for you?  Is it a good fit?  What assumptions do you have about me just because I happened to be black that actually don't fit your assumptions?  And I think the thing you have to do most clearly in these situations is meet people where they are.  Communicate as much as possible and be very candid and frank with people about how they're succeeding and treat people with the kind of dignity and clarity that ultimately people will value.  They may not value it the first time around, maybe not even the second time and maybe never and when it's never, those people have to go, but you can work with people who come to see you as a genuine person.  I, I've had to absorb a lot of criticisms internally of being a little bit aloof, not, you know not as engaging or interested or cool or familiar.  I mean Howard [HistoryMaker Howard Dodson] had definitely cultivated a sense of family and familiarity with his team, and to be honest because of age, because I have a family I feel like the arc of Howard's time at forty-six is different at thirty-eight when I come there and I've got a ten-year old, an eight-year old and a four-year old.  So, there was only so much I could give to work.  It was still work in the end, I mean as much as I love the Schomburg, it was still a job.  So in that sense I had to create the healthy distance so that people would respect my management decisions and at the same time not expect me to be their best friend or to measure my commitment to the place or to them by how familiar we were with the other, and frankly I think some people never quite appreciated that, but I think people respected it in the end because they saw the evidence that one, I'm genuinely an interested person.  Two, I treat people the same, and three we got a lot of great work done, so you know what more could you want?
Story_ID: 522227
Speaker 1: So, where are you now?
Speaker 2: I'm at the Harvard Kennedy School [John F. Kennedy School of Government, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I'll be starting actually next week.  I have the title of professor of history, race and public policy.  It's a tenured position, it requires me to teach up to three classes a year, with the expectation that I will be a senior leader of the faculty of the school helping students of all kinds who are interested in doing public service work, either in the government sector, in non-profits and even in the private sector.  These are mostly master students getting degrees in public policy and public administration.  And the match with me really is about bringing in someone with real experience running a non-profit in the most important iconic black community in America, a person who has written extensively about the history of social and public policies that impact our community, and marrying those two so that we produce future non-profit leaders who take history seriously first and foremost, who take the black public sphere of history, I'm sorry black public sphere seriously as well.  Meaning that history is not just what happened to black people it's also what black people have done and their ideas and their debates and their differences about very important issues which often get flattened out in policy-making circles which are overwhelmingly absent in most cases of the black public sphere, and even when black people show up in those spaces they tend to be researchers offering evidence of this or that, tend to be underrepresented and so what do we ought to do about this research?  What are we to make of it?  And, although as a historian I'll always have a healthy degree of distance from that actual, "Here are the solutions that have been tested that we ought to do," although I'm increasingly, certainly expected to have some contribution to that.  The point is to lift up the black people who may be invisible in those spaces who do have those solutions in mind, who can say from experience and from their own research perspectives that, actually this is what works in our community.  I'll give you a really good example.  Ivory Toldson is a young man who worked under the White House education initiative [White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities], David Johns and Ivory worked together, Ivory doing work around, actually Ivory was covering HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], David Johns was covering sort of excellence in black achievement [White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans] et cetera in black education.  Well, Ivory is a policy researcher.  He looks at the achievement gap and he studies it from various angles and I think he's, he has, he has an insight that is totally underrepresented in the world of education reform, and I'm grateful that he had the chance that he had to do some policy application work and I hope he continues to do it, but his insight is simply this, that we often study the achievement gap from a kind of aggregate level analysis of how whites do on standardized tests versus how blacks do on standardized tests, creating on various levels kind of a twenty-point achievement gap.  But wouldn't it be more interesting to, and the assumption being that, that achievement gap represents some kind of poor performance on the black side.  The truth is that the performance is writ large, that whites on these same tests are not doing well on average either, something like 40 percent of white school children read on grade level at eighth grade, as compared to 20 percent of black children.  So, I mean yes, there's an achievement gap, but neither one doing pretty well.  Ivory says that, "If we want to perhaps get at some things that will work better for black children, might we explore comparing the achievement gap between high achievers than black low achievers."  So, what works for black children who actually succeed?  Rather than perpetuating another kind of insidious stereotype which is that all whites generally do well and blacks do less well, which is also not true, because we also don't talk about the achievement gap between on average, I mean it's out there, but it doesn't drive policy discourse, which is Asian American students in the aggregate, generally do better than their white counterparts, and we're not losing a lot of sleep over that.  In fact, in many ways you could argue that the model-minority myth works to the detriment of Asian Americans by caricaturing them into these very stiff, sterile, non-creative, non-imaginative people who are very good at taking tests and very good at following orders, but they don't have those soft human capital skills that help, that makes leadership possible.  So, all of this is the kind of insight that someone like Ivory Toldson brings to policy circles, but Ivory Toldson's not very well represented in the circles that the Kennedy School represents, and so because I care about what Ivory Toldson thinks, my job in part of the Kennedy School is to teach students to pay attention to people like that, not to let the soft bigotry of their stance that Ivory Toldson might not be an important person, get in the way of their accessing his research because he happens to be at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], instead of Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts].

Speaker 2: Well it's because I have little patience for being ineffective.  So, and also has little patience for self-deceit.  So, what does that mean practically speaking?  Part of being at the Kennedy School [John F. Kennedy School of Government, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in particular, is to see from my own vantage point, how can an elite institution help black people?  Because I've never been in an elite institution, I don't know.  I mean I can read about it from other people's perspectives.  I can sort of look at the choices that Skip [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] has made in his capacity, but I'm not Skip and I don't agree with all the choices that Skip has made, you know and this is not a critique, it's just we're different people.  So, for the things that matter to me personally, for the things that I wanna make better in the world, for the contribution that I want to make, here's my chance to try out a different kind of institution.  I've already worked in a black space [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], although complicated by a white institution [New York Public Library, New York, New York] that's ultimately responsible for it.  Now I have a chance to go--I mean if I can't imagine higher education working in the way I think is effective, then maybe there's not--maybe higher education isn't the space to do the work that I wanna to leave as my legacy, but I can't know that unless I do this.

Speaker 1: What do you want to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I want to be part of raising consciousness and educating everybody, all of Americans and immigrants too, about these histories that I think have been erased, elided, ignored, debased and the same way that [HistoryMaker] Bryan Stevenson is absolutely committed to seeing the role of history in transforming American culture and society around issues of race and the example that he uses is that you can't go to Berlin [Germany] without stepping on a historical marker to pay tribute to victims of the Holocaust and that the relationship of that, the visibility of the physical landscape of the past is absolutely essential though to Germany's understanding of Syrian immigrants, absolutely essential as I learned on a trip two summers ago for a week in Germany of several parts of the country to see how they treat prisoners, that the criminal justice system is far more humane, even when a third of the prison system dominated by foreign, by foreigners as they call 'em, they don't track race, but they generally are of Arab descent or eastern European descent.  These policy outcomes are themselves a reflection of much greater sensitivity to the country's past, or what I would argue is evidence of a much higher rate of historical literacy.  What passes in this country for our policies and political discourse often caters to, as my mother [Kimberly Satterfield Muhammad] once said, "Ignorant people."  That it's precisely the under-education of Americans that make possible the reproduction of polices of intolerance, of inequality because in--we could have a debate but Americans are not very well educated about their past.  They think they know they know past.  There is a difference between being exposed to history, being inundated with historical narratives, and having the critical capacity to discern the quality of evidence and the relationship of the evidence of that interpretation, and we do a terrible job of that in this county, at every level of educational system with the exception of college and graduate school.  So, call me naive, but on some basic level I was built for this, you know my capacity to engage people in an oral manner allows me to reach into places that some people can't and I'm hoping that just as Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] worked in this way, I hope that I can be even more effective at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] with a bigger reach, even internationally, but it remains to be seen whether that happens.  I can tell you this much if it doesn't work, I'll be moving on.  When and where that happens, what it looks like, who knows, but I'm fundamentally committed to having a legacy that said, "He gave it his best effort, he used his talents, his God-given gifts to whatever extent they exist in the service of transformation and good.  He wanted to make the world a better place," and I believe in that.

Speaker 1: Just one more question.
Speaker 2: Man, I thought that was the perfect end point.
Speaker 1: Okay, it is a perfect endpoint.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: It is.  It is a perfect endpoint but I wa- I do want to ask you your hopes and concerns for the black community, especially when you know the things that you say you wanna do--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --is exactly the America we live in.  I mean ignorance is just totally, I mean frighteningly--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --prevalent all over the place.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so one thing that I have done is I have joined the advisory board of Cure Violence, which is run out of Chicago [Illinois] by a man named Gary Slutkin, and he was an epidemiologist because partly what I wanna do is bring my historical expertise to bear on an organization that is trying to do the right thing, and in a context, particularly Chicago, where there is often a lot of hand wringing, and resignation to the notion that there's no way out of this, that we can't fix it, that nobody's talking about this and nobody cares about the black people who kill the black people as opposed to when the police do it.  Sometimes I feel like it's really just either the myopia of people who refuse to see what's in front of them or they just don't know any better.  So, remember I referred to self-deceit, so partly my job in supporting Cure Violence is I have a pretty good bullhorn.  I don't have quite the bully pulpit I had at the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], but Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] is not a bad thing (laughter), nothing to sneeze at.  So, partly what I wanna do is to be inside of an organization and to actually help lift up the work--that yeah, there are people on the ground, not only in Chicago, but in New York [New York] and I've met with them, they're in the Bronx [New York].  They're called SOS, Saving our Streets [sic. Save Our Streets South Bronx, Bronx, New York], and they're incredibly hard working, thoughtful people.  Many come from that community and are committed to saving lives in the community and are succeeding.  The group in the Bronx hasn't had a shooting death in several years, which means that we're not paying attention to black people for putting their lives on the line to make our communities safe.  All we hear about is when it doesn't, when, when the intervention doesn't happen with the interruption, but the truth is as I said some time ago, Chicago is a safer place.  Again, if we measure it by the bodies lying cold in the street, and that's the end of the story.  So, we want fewer, and fewer bodies in those streets.  We want fewer and fewer shootings and I want to be part of that solution, but I want to be part of the solution in a way that I know how to do that, which is I'm not going to be an interrupter, but I am going to be an educator, so I'm gonna figure out how to help those interrupters feel better about what they do.  I'm gonna help the people that they help through them have a bigger sense of the world we live in, and I'm gonna help the board members and the stakeholders of Cure Violence and any other organization like that have a sense of the history that they walk in so that they don't repeat some of the mistakes that people like Jane Addams had made in the past, who was not a bad person, she just didn't do as much as she could have to save black lives a hundred years ago.
