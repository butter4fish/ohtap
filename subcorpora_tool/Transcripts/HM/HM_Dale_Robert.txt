Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace that group?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, on my mother's side not, not very much; I knew my grandmother and, and that's about the extent of it on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Now, do they have a family history of always being in Memphis?
Speaker 2: They moved, I think, from Greenwood, Mississippi to Memphis.
Speaker 1: Great.  Yeah, Greenwood, Mississippi has a lotta history there; like the--like it was founded by Greenwood LeFlore, a Choctaw Indian.
Speaker 2: Oh, is that right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: I learned something today (laughter).
Speaker 1: All the LeFlores from Mississippi are somehow related to Greenwood in some way.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: But are there any stories about why the family migrated from Greenwood to Memphis?
Speaker 2: None that I'm aware of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you know what your grandmother did for a living, or--
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they lived in the town--inside the, the city limits of Memphis, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you know if they were like farmers in Greenwood way back when?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I don't know anything about what happened in Greenwood.
Speaker 1: Now, was this a family that was big on education or, or--
Speaker 2: No, there was no evidence of that.  No one, no one had a college degree, so no.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, do you know where the name Dale comes from?
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother talk about growing up in Memphis?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't, she was rather quiet about all of that; she didn't discuss it, you know.  Even when I asked her, she didn't talk about it that much.
Speaker 1: Do you have an impression of what, what she thought of Memphis in terms of a place--as being a place to live, or about the race relations in Memphis or any of that?
Speaker 2: Well, I can tell you she had two sisters and two brothers, and she moved out of Memphis to Chicago [Illinois] and left them there at an early age, so I guess, for me, that's an indication that she really didn't like it at all.
Speaker 1: Her general--your general impression is that she, she was anxious to get out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Absolutely.
Story_ID: 168611
Speaker 1: Now, did she [Jessie Dale] have relatives in Chicago [Illinois] or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, she had relatives; the Laceys [ph.] were relatives on her grandmother's side.
Speaker 1: Now, was she a teenager when she moved to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so--pretty close to it; outta high school, maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, she did go to high school in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: You know where she went?  Went to Manassas [High School, Memphis, Tennessee] or, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I don't have the slightest idea.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  Well--now, what did your mother do when she got to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: She went to work for her uncle in his grocery store on 45th [Street] near Vincennes [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what was her uncle's name?
Speaker 2: Ben--Uncle Ben.  Ben Lacey, I believe.
Speaker 1: Ben Lacey?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He had a brother named John--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we called him Uncle John.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your Uncle Ben Lacey had a store at 41st and Vincennes?
Speaker 2: Forty-fifth.
Speaker 1: Forty-fifth--okay; 45th and Vincennes, all right.  Now I don't know about, you know--it sounds like a big deal to me when somebody has a store.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a big deal, it was a big deal; but, but, you know, I never thought twice about it because I didn't know it was a big deal when I was a kid; it was just a store where my mother worked, so--
Speaker 1: Is there, is there a story about your uncle and you can tell us--
Speaker 2: Not that I know.
Speaker 1: --how he got started.
Speaker 2: I wish I knew; maybe I used to know, but I don't remember now how he got started.
Speaker 1: Well, that's quite a--so did he serve as kinda like a surrogate father for your mother in some ways, or--
Speaker 2: I would think so--right--yeah--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --'cause she was a single, a single mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 168612
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell us something about your mother's [Jessie Dale] personality?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy (laughter).  You know, my mother always fooled me; I'm still findin' out things about her.  But she was a--dependin' on who you ask, but she was a--she was a pleasant person unless you mess with her, you know; you didn't mess with my mother 'cause she didn't take any mess.  You know, she was friendly, you know, liked to have fun, liked to party, liked to give parties, very intelligent, you know; I think very in--very insightful.  She was the kinda person that, that didn't tell you about--a lot, but created an environment where you could learn it just from being in it and observing it and thinkin' about the situation, and so, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did she have any special talents or gifts?  Could she sing, or--
Speaker 2: Her special talent was baking, and so she was known as the maker of great cakes, and I still have her recipe, you know.  So people ask me all the time to make cakes, but I'm busy right now so I don't make any.  But that was her talent and that was--that somebody told me that's--that was her way of showing her love and appreciation for people, by baking them cakes--chocolate, checkerboard, German chocolate, coconut, as well as apple and peach cobbler.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, we may be able to take a break and (laughter)--but--now, was she a member of one of the local churches here?
Speaker 2: No, she was not a member of any church that I'm aware of.
Speaker 1: It seemed like the bake sale committee would love to have her.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they would have.  But no, she, she didn't do the church thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 168613
Speaker 1: All right, okay. Now, can you give us your father's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Charles McDearmon, C-H-A-R-L-E-S, M-C-capital D-E-A-R-M-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what's his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Man!  He was born in, I think, Dyer, Tennessee, and I really don't know his date of birth.
Speaker 1: That's D-Y-E-R?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he older than your mother [Jessie Dale]?
Speaker 2: I think they may have been about the same age.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Born about 1919?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that group?
Speaker 2: Well, my father's mother and father lived here in Chicago [Illinois] on, I think, 46th Place, just east of King Drive; they lived in, in a kitchenette because he worked at the steel mill, so that's why they lived here.  But they owned property in Dyer, Tennessee, so that's where they went on vacations and that's where they eventually went when he retired.  But for years, you know, they lived in a little kitchenette on 46th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So those are your, your grandparents.
Speaker 2: Grandparents--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Now, did your father have any--or your grandparents have any stories of what life was like in Dyer, and why they left the property in Dyer?
Speaker 2: No, not that I can really recall.  You know, they had children, so I think they came up here to be able to make money.  I think they probably came up with the early part of the Great Migration--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to get a job where they could make a decent--decent money.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I was just thinking, since they had property there, you know, and--you know, a lotta people who were sharecroppers and didn't own anything came up, but somebody with property you would think they'd wanna stay and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --deal with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Couldn't make any money--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, did your father talk about growing up at all?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't spend a lotta time together 'cause he and my mother weren't together, so I saw him, you know, when he would--he didn't live in Chicago, so I would see him when he'd come to town to visit his parents or his sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--so he did come around and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay--which is good.  What do you know about your father in terms of--did he have a chance to finish school here?
Speaker 2: Well, he eventually--he went into the [U.S.] Army--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --right before I was born, and--as the story goes, anyway.  And he--and I don't really know what happened in terms of his life and career after that, but when I caught back up with him again, he lived in New York in a place called Nanuet, New York, and he was a--he did a lotta foster care, he and his wife, but he also had purchased property in Jackson, Tennessee, and that's eventually where he retired, or semi-retired.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But he, he eventually went back to school and, and got, got his undergrad[uate] degree and then got a master's degree.
Speaker 1: Emm.  Okay.
Speaker 2: He was inspired by me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well that's interesting--the father inspired by the son.  What did he get his degrees in?
Speaker 2: I think his, his undergrad was in education, and his master's was in counseling.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--now, now, did he have any special talents or abilities that you know of?
Speaker 2: No, not that I know of.
Speaker 1: It seemed like, you know--
Speaker 2: Talking, probably (laughter)--if that counts.
Speaker 1: He had the focus and capacity to go back to school, and--
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, that's, that's saying something.
Story_ID: 168614
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there a story about how your parents [Charles McDearmon and Jessie Dale] met?
Speaker 2: Boy, let me think about that.  I'm not sure, I--I don't--you know, I really don't recall.  I'm sure I was told the story, but at this point I don't really recall.  They were both livin' in Chicago [Illinois] at the time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so it wasn't something that started in Tennessee, for example.  And they may have met in that store because, as I said, the store is on 45th [Street] and my father's parents lived on 46th [Steet]--who knows?
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Is there any story about why they, they broke up, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, they--well, as he tells the story, when she got pregnant with me by him, she never told him, so--I don't know why, but he--when he went off to the [U.S.] Army, he didn't know that she was pregnant with me, so I think--you know, I don't--so I don't know, I guess that distance and time, you know, was the breakup--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --far as I know.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 168615
Speaker 1: Do you have any--well, when you look at their--at your parents' [Charles McDearmon and Jessie Dale] personalities and--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --you did get a chance to know your father--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --fairly well, you know.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: When you look at their personalities and their talents and the things they do and--who you, who you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Man, that's a good question.  I think I--it's a little bit of, little bit of both because they had a--I think they had a--some important traits in common--determination, toughness, so--and I think I have some of that.  My father was a talker--I'm not, so I certainly didn't take after him in that.  You know, I think it's probably fifty-fifty, really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some from both; I don't think any--either one of 'em dominates.
Story_ID: 168616
Speaker 1: Now do you have any other siblings?
Speaker 2: I have an older brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: He's, he's about, four years older than me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, he lives here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Jerome--Jerome A. Dale.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You want me to spell that, right?  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  Why, is it a odd-spelling of Jerome?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  J-E-R-O-M-E (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--O-M-E, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--
Story_ID: 168617
Speaker 1: So--well, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Man!  Yeah, you know, I have a few.  I lived at 502 East 37th Street which was diagonally right across from Matton [ph.] Park at 37th and Rhodes, and right across the street from Altgeld Gardens, as it was known when it existed.  And so just, you know, fond memories of playin' on the sidewalk up and down the street, playin' softball over in Matton Park and gettin' the wind knocked outta me one time.
Speaker 1: What--ball hit you in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, ball hit me in the stomach, yeah, and goin' to Doc Tyson's for Cherry Cokes, which was right on 37th Street there.  Those--you know, those kinds of things, and the, the--that was on the cheery side; on the other side, you know, the, the Jew merchant comin' by the house to collect the money every week or every two weeks from my mother.  You know, I just, just--for whatever reason, I just hated that, you know.  So that's a memory that I have that I, you know, that's just not pleasant, but I remember it, you know.  Hmm?
Speaker 1: Did they have like a bad attitude, sort of, when they came by, or--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was like six, seven, eight, nine, so I don't know if I was qualified to determine whether that was a bad attitude; I just had this sense that it was, it was not the way it should be, you know, and that this was somethin' special for, for black folks, you know; I just had that sense.  And, you know, I guess I knew enough to know, well, why couldn't she send the money in, or why did he have to come by ever week with, you know--had this big, I guess--I don't know what you would call it--a credit card/debit card, where they would write down, you know, the money you paid.  So, you know--that kinda stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would, would other bill collectors come by the house, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was like two or three; I even remember some of 'em name (laughter).  But, you know, later on I learned that what, what they were givin' her was somethin' that, you know, white businesses wouldn't give her, and that was credit, so--and that's, you know, that's the way it had to be back then because the stores downtown weren't givin' black folks credit.  So if you wanted to buy somethin' on credit, that's what you had to do, and they had a series of like warehouse stores; you would go to the store and pick out what you wanted, and then the salesman would ask you who your--well I don't--I forget what they called 'em--let's say salesmen, and you'd tell him, you know, Eninberg [ph.] or, or Jack, or whoever it was, and then they'd mark it down, and that was the end of it and, you know, the stuff would get delivered--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and they'd come around collectin' their money, so--
Story_ID: 168618
Speaker 1: So, now it's mostly--that's a traditional Jewish neighborhood, right?--and--back in the day.
Speaker 2: Jewish neigh--no, that was a black neighborhood.
Speaker 1: No, in--where you grew up; that was--that had been a Jewish neighborhood (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, I don't know; when I moved there, it was all black.
Speaker 1: You mean on 37th [Street]
Speaker 2: --down near Matton Park and all.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We're talkin' what--Forty-eight [1948]?  Forty-eight--1948, Forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Fifty [1950].
Speaker 2: All right.  That's--the, the theater was still over there, right?  The Oak--
Speaker 1: On, on South Park, yeah--two of 'em.
Speaker 2: Not the Regal; I'm not talking about
Speaker 1: --No, Oakwood and Kenwood, I think it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.  The Abraham Lincoln Center, I guess, would have been over there, or close by?
Speaker 1: That, I don't know; I don't recall the Abraham Lincoln Center.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I really don't think it was there.
Speaker 2: You know, you know, the Center for the Study--the City Studies is now--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that--in those days it was the Abraham Lincoln Center.
Speaker 1: Oh, was it?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--(Inaudible response).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, well we didn't go that far, you know; we were just little kids.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We barely got off the block--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so that woulda been a long way for us.
Story_ID: 168619
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up in that, in that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we were--we came along at an age when black folks didn't have television, you know, so we, we, you know, did a lotta things together, both in the house and outside the house; kids get together on the block and, you know, and play and have a lotta fun.  You know, everybody was your friend and neighbor and, you know, everybody kinda like stuck together 'cause we were all in the, in the same shape, in the same condition, you know, and, and so it was just, for me, normal growin' up, you know?  When, when somebody finally got a TV on the block, that was a really big deal, you know.  We had radio; we used to listen to the fights, 'specially Joe Louis--so that was it.
Speaker 1: So, did most everybody have a radio when you were growing up, I mean in those days?
Speaker 2: I don't even recall--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, and then some folks didn't even have iceboxes, and I mean iceboxes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, with ice delivered to them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, the block-a ice--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--you all had a radio, right? Is that--
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have a radio.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, the TV, I guess, around 1950-one, two [1951], [1952]?  Yeah.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--One [1951], I wanna say, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Do you remember when you all got your first TV, or--
Speaker 2: No, I really don't (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. All right.
Story_ID: 168620
Speaker 1: Okay, so, let's see.  Now, where did you go--where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to--I started school at Corpus Christi [Catholic Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  My mother [Jessie Dale] was Catholic, I guess, so we were baptized Catholics, and me and my brother went to Corpus Christi which was, and still is, on 49th [Street] and King Drive.  'Course we lived on 37th [Street] and Rhodes [Avenue], so we took the bus or walked, dependin' on what the weather was like, so--and we went there until I was in the fourth grade, and then we moved, at that point, to 64th [Street] and Kenwood [Avenue].  You know, we transferred to St. Cyril [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], which was at 64th and Blackstone [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, the interesting thing about us goin' to Corpus Christi is that Holy Angels [Catholic School] was right at 39th Street, and we were at 37th, but they were--they discriminated on the basis of color, and we were too dark to go there, so we went to Corpus Christi.
Speaker 1: So what--you're saying that it wasn't just race, it was color.
Speaker 2: Right, because there were--you know, all the kids that went there at that time were--well, most of 'em were colored--what they called colored back then; so, no, it wasn't that kinda racism, it was--I don't know what you'd call it.  It was color bias--complexion bias.
Speaker 1: So--well, that's a--that's interesting 'cause we--you know, that's even unusual in Chicago in some ways, I guess, for those days, to do that; I mean, you know, to discriminate on the base of skin color?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, if you were lighter skin, you could go to Holy Angels--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and if you were too dar--did they actually tell you that? --That you were too dark, or was it
Speaker 2: My mother, you know--we figured that out--
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: --you know, me and my brother [Jerome Dale] did, but my mother kinda hinted, hinted around it.
Speaker 1: So, it's something that wasn't an official policy but something that
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Evidently not, evidently not.
Speaker 1: --but it was operational anyway.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Emm, that's something.  Now, did you have any--so you went from Corpus Christi to St. Cyril.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were in--so, your mother--did she really--you say she didn't really go to church or anything--
Speaker 2: (Inaudible response).
Speaker 1: --but she was--she considered herself a Catholic.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she considered herself a Catholic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--you know, as I grow older, I figured out--I call her a, a functional Catholic.  I think she was a Catholic because back then your, your children couldn't go to the school unless they were Catholic--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so I think she was a Catholic for the purposes of getting us the best education she could afford.
Speaker 1: Well, that's a--you know, then and now, it's a tremendous sacrifice for people to pay tuition--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --for their children.  So, she was really dedicated to education
Speaker 2: --Education, right.
Speaker 1: So, did you and your brother end up going to Corpus Christi?
Speaker 2: Right, we went there at the same time, and we both transferred to St. Cyril at the same--together.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, when, when you were growing up, were you aware that your mother was sacrificing, you know, money to--
Speaker 2: No, we never really thought about it, you know; we, we obviously knew that--all of our friends in the neighborhood went to [James R.] Doolittle [Jr. Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], and we went to the other school, but I, I don't think beyond that we gave it much thought.
Speaker 1: Do you have any sense now, when you look back on what Doolittle--what kind of a school Doolittle was?  Was it a good school or a bad school, or rough, or--
Speaker 2: It was, as our friends describe it--you know, it was, it was rough, but they never talked about it in terms of good or bad because as, as kids, they didn't know if it were good or bad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 168621
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about Corpus Christi [Catholic Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  Did you like school when you were going to school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't have a problem with school, you know; I did well in school.  I had fun in school so, you know, it was okay.  I didn't, I didn't ever mind going; never wanted to stay home, so I guess you would say that, you know, I enjoyed school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: Man!  Did I have a favorite subject--I don't recall havin' a favorite subject; maybe in grammar school--maybe reading or spelling may have been one of my favorite subjects 'cause I recall doin' well in that, but other than that, you know, I did well in all of 'em, so I guess they were all my favorites the way I look at it now anyway.  So, you know, I was really young when I went to Corpus Christi so, you know, I don't remember, you know, a whole lotta detail about it, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--You started off when you were about five or six?
Speaker 2: Yeah, five, in kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in 1948 I guess, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right; me and my brother [Jerome Dale] went there together every day, and our mother [Jessie Dale] gave us money to take the bus, and if the weather was nice, we would walk and my brother would take my money (laughter), or we--one of us would--he would sneak me on the bus and, you know, then he would take my three cents or nickel, or whatever it was, you know, and our mother never knew about it, 'til years later, that we were either walking or sneaking on the bus whenever we could--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause you know they had island on [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] Drive, both sides of the street, so we would just walk down that island; it was grass all the way, so it was just fun time goin' to school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right in the middle of the boulevard.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah.  So--but, you know, I talked about my mother and how she would just put you in situations and, and let you observe things and see what was happening?  Well, when we, when we transferred from Corpus Christi to St. Cyril [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], she said, "Well, I have to go over to the school and find out if they accept colored children."  So, you know, I got upset with my mother because, you know, these were Catholics and they didn't care about anything like that.  And so she took me to school with her when she went to meet with the principal, and so she asked the principal, "Do you accept colored children?"  And so I didn't say anything but I was just so upset about that until a second later, the principal said, "Well, I have to check with Father Williams," who was over the parish.  And so I said, "Wow," you know, so it was a--that's the way she operated, you know.  So I got to observe for myself that it was an issue, so--
Speaker 1: So you didn't get in and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, we, yeah, we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So you were one of the few black children in the school?
Speaker 2: It was, it was two there--two or three there when we arrived, and--yeah, it was about that, so me and my brother was maybe the fifth and sixth or--third--I don't know, but it was a, a couple of females and a guy, as I recall.
Speaker 1: You were clearly in the minority.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, we were clearly in the minority.
Speaker 1: St. Cyril was located on--
Speaker 2: 64th [Street] and Blackstone [Avenue]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: In, in those days, I guess, was that neighborhood considered a white neighborhood then?
Speaker 2: It was an integrated neighborhood mostly, but mostly white, yeah it's--you know, it's kinda funny, but my two best friends, you know, in that neighborhood, was a white guy by the name of John Bolin [ph.], and a Japanese guy by the name of Glenn Catura [ph.], and we did--went everywhere together; we did everything together--played sports, went to the show--all that kinda stuff.  I mean that's the--that was the makeup of the neighborhood, and back then we didn't think much about it, you know; we just did stuff together.
Speaker 1: Now, was that considered Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] then, or was that--
Speaker 2: I--yeah, I guess so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, back then, as a kid, I--it wasn't into all-a-that (laughter);
Speaker 1: --No, nobody--
Speaker 2: that's just where I lived (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 168622
Speaker 1: So, so, you know, I--so that was a lesson for me in terms of the, the, the Catholics, you know, and their racism.  And there were--you know, as I went through school, it were--there were other examples, you know, like being called, "You people," and all that kinda stuff.  And then when I graduated, they had historically--they were connected with Mount Carmel High School [Chicago, Illinois] and Loretta [ph.] Academy for Girls; Mount Carmel was all boys, Loretta was all girls, and the top male student had always gotten a scholarship to Mount Carmel, and the top female had always gotten a scholarship to Loretta.  Well, when I graduated, that was the first time the top male student was black, and it was the first time that no scholarship was awarded, and to, and to kinda show you how that kinda thing worked, the top female student was black, and so they gave--and the second-ranked female student was also black, so they gave two scholarships to the black girls to go to Loretta, but didn't give me a scholarship to go to Mount Carmel.  So, I mean the, the--and, you know, the way you look at how they deal with black men versus black women today has been around for, for decades, and that was an example of it back in 1957 when I graduated.
Speaker 2: Now that's, that's something.
Speaker 1: That's your Catholics (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, so was, was your expectation to go to Mount Carmel anyway?
Speaker 1: I mean that was--yeah, it was, it was my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That's the natural flow, right?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--It was natural because I knew--I was the top male student and I knew I would get the scholarship 'cause that's the way it had always been, but my brother [Jerome Dale] ahead of me, he had gone to CVS [Chicago Vocational School], and so I had also thought about goin' to CVS.  And so when I didn't get the scholarship, that's where I went; I went to CVS.
Speaker 2: Emm.  That's, that's terrible.  So, did your mother [Jessie Dale] raise any protest about that, or did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Not that I recall.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She may have done it privately, but as I re--I'm not aware of it if it happened.
Story_ID: 168623
Speaker 1: So you went to CVS [Chicago Vocational School, Chicago, Illinois] now.  Well, how do you like C-- this is the first public school, I guess--
Speaker 2: For me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in your life.  How--what did you--what was CVS like in fifty-seven [1957]?
Speaker 2: In '57 [1957], CVS was a dangerous, racist place.  They had no black folks in authority, no black administrators, no black teachers, and only about eight to ten percent of the student body of 4,000 was black, and, and it was a dangerous place because if the white kids--it was a huge building, and if they caught you back in a deserted part of the buildin', they would beat your butt, so you had to be careful.  I mean it really kind of affected classes that you took because you didn't wanna be stuck back there in one-a those wings late in the day when there's nobody else around.
Speaker 1: Yeah, CVS was a--some sort of a remnant of a project to teach people how to build airplane engines or something?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a naval facility before it was a high school, and then it was also--I think Chicago Teachers College [Chicago, Illinois] was located there, so when it became a high school, the Teachers College still maintained part of the building for a while, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So it was a huge edifice--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --unbelievable for a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)-- And I wanted to major in, in aviation mechanics, but I wasn't goin' back there in the aviation part at 10th and 11th period.  You know, regular school was like first through ninth period, but I wasn't goin' back there at 10th and 11th so, you know, I majored in printing instead, and, you know, that was a very racist situation because the unions were affiliated with CVS because it was a vocational school--one of the few places where printers were being trained, or where students were bein' trained to be printers.  Many of the white kids got summer jobs, and of course jobs after graduation, but none of the black kids.  And I distinctly remember--I think his name--his last name was Love, but I think his first name was Danny.  I mean he was outstanding in, in that printing field, and we thought for sure he would get a job, but he didn't get a job either, so--that's the way it was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, that's a
Speaker 2: --back in '61 [1961], 1960, '61 [1961] at CVS.
Speaker 1: And yeah, those, those are a lotta things to consider for a high school student trying--just trying to learn--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, where not to be in a building and--
Speaker 2: And what not--which bus not to get on because all the buses would be lined up in front of the school because it wasn't a neighborhood school, it was a vocational school, so you had children from all over the city that attended, and you made--had to make sure you got on the bus with the black students, 'cause if you got on the bus with the white students, again, you'd get your butt beat.  So it was, it was, it was that kinda place--back then.
Speaker 1: Now, were there any particular teachers or, or--that emerged as mentors, or
Speaker 2: --Mentors?  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --or--I guess not, huh?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --There were some that emerged as destroyers, but (laughter)--for black kids, but I don't know of a single one that any of us thought was a mentor.  I mean they just didn't care for us because we were like the first wave, and you know how that is, and--you know--and I came out--it was--I just had fun, you know; I lost interest in academics 'cause the first thing that happened in my freshman year--everything they were teaching, I'd already had it in elementary school, so I immediately lost interest; I was bored, so that's, that's when I started, you know, cutting classes, not payin' attention, just doin' enough to get by with a, with a--I forget what it was--G; they had E, G, C, or somethin', I forget; but, you know, just enough to get by and pass, and have fun; but as each semester went on, it got worse and worse, because I needed to be learning some things for the next class, so as it turns out, I barely made it outta there, so--and I had to go to summer school every summer to have enough credits to graduate on time, but I was determined to graduate on time, and so there were 480 in the graduating class, and I was number 476 (laughter), so you can see (laughter), you know, I was having fun.  Even in my senior year, I got suspended for ten days for, you know, playin' hooky and bein' at a party with some girls, and the neighbors saw us and called the police, and it was a big mess, but--so--you know, so that was, that was high school.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Story_ID: 168624
Speaker 1: --When you were getting ready to come out, you were, you were determined to graduate on time, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what really found it difficult to focus on, you know, in high school.  What, what were your prospects?  What were you thinking you were gonna do when you, when you graduated?  You think college, or the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: College never entered my mind--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no.  And quite frankly, the military never entered my mind; I was just gon' get a job, you know, 'cause there were jobs back then--factory jobs that paid what we called good money back then.  So, I wasn't really thinkin' about it, so what I ended up doin'--my mother [Jessie Dale] worked at the post office, and so she suggested that I go to work at the post office, but I didn't wanna work at the post office because far as I was concerned, they worked too hard, you know?  And you had odd hours; when you started off at the post office, you had night shift, split shift, you know; and you were usually in the mail room liftin' heavy bags and all that kinda stuff, and I wasn't into that, you know, so I went to work for the Social Security Administration [SSA] at the Payment Center, which was located at that time at 165 North Canal [Street], which was Randolph [Street] and Canal.  And so at that time, the post office may have been paying $6.00 an hour--six or seven dollars an hour, which at that--back then was a good hourly rate, but Social Security was only payin' like $3.75 an hour, but I still picked Social Security 'cause I just didn't wanna work as hard as they worked at the Post office.  So, I did that, and then I--there was another guy that worked there with me, he had graduated from--a Catholic high school; I don't, I don't remember which one, but he was at the Payment Center with me so he thought about--start talkin' about goin' into the military, so we would go visit the recruiters; he wanted to be in the [U.S.] Marines, so I knew I didn't wanna be in the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] the same reason I didn't wanna work at the post office--it was too hard (laughter).  So I checked out the [U.S.] Air Force, and so we eventually both went in.  He went in the Marines and I went in the Air Force--that was in February of '62 [1962].  But my motivation was to get outta the cold weather because back then I lived on 83rd Street, and so we had to take the, the bus to 50--they didn't have a Dan Ryan back then--Expressway, so we took the 80--I took the bus from 83rd to 59th, and then we transferred to the elevated train; took that down to Randolph and then we had to transfer to another bus to go west to Canal; in this time of year, that was rough.  And so I decided to join the Air Force because they had basic training in San Antonio, Texas, and I knew it was warm, so that was my motivation.  And so on February the 15th, 1962, that was my official enlistment date.  We flew all night, and got into San Antonio the next morning.  We left at Midnight--left Chicago at Midnight, made a stop in Kansas, somewhere in Kansas, and picked up some more recruits, and landed that mornin' about 8:00 in San Antonio.  They picked us up on a bus, and by the time we got to the base, the sun was shining, and I looked out the bus window and the drill sergeant was waiting on us and he had short sleeves on, so I knew I had made the right decision (laughter).  So, that's how I ended up in the Air Force.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you like the Air Force?  I mean it sound--sound like--I mean your, your--I mean your, your, your wisdom is being rewarded, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  The Air Force was--I liked life outside of the service; in other words, when I got permanently stationed, you could live off base, and I had a--like basically a 8 to 4:30 Monday through Friday job.  I was a dental assistant, and so I had a girlfriend and lived off base, and so life was good, you know.  I had a little car, but I didn't like the military; I just didn't--I didn't like the structure of it, they didn't respect intelligence, they respected rank, and it--you know, so, if you didn't have the rank, you didn't have any say-so; you--you know, you just couldn't show that you could think.  And so that's the way I went through.  I went through four years, and only got one promotion in four years.  So (laughter)--so, we weren't a good mix.  And so, you know, a lotta, lotta, lotta the black guys re-enlisted because back then, if you were black, 'course, a lotta instances, the best job you were gonna get, and the fairest situation racially that you were gonna experience, so it enticed a lotta folks to re-enlist.
Speaker 1: Was that your experience?  Was it a fair situation, for the most part?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I would think so just, just from observing things around me.  I couldn't really go by me, because I just wasn't with the program, so-to-speak, and--
Speaker 1: --Now, you--
Story_ID: 168625
Speaker 1: You went to--through high school and, and even, you know, now that you're in the [U.S.] Air Force, I mean, through, through the, I guess, the most active part of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.  Did, did, did your family, you know, like take special note of that?  I mean did, did people talk about it?  I mean you and your mother [Jessie Dale] and your brother [Jerome Dale] talk about it at home--what was goin' on with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and--
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't at home during that period.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean when you were in high school and you--all the way through
Speaker 2: --No, it wasn't--I really--there really wasn't anything goin' on in high school; I graduated in '57 [1957] from grammar school--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --so, I don't recall
Speaker 1: --Now, from '57 [1957] to '62 [1962] and that's the
Speaker 2: --Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--the era of the Montgomery [Alabama] Bus Boycott and Little Rock [Nine] stuff was goin' on--all this stuff was goin' on then.
Speaker 2: --Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I was
Speaker 1: --The whole--with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] in, in Mississippi, all--I mean it was on the news and
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, I re--I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Did y'all discuss any of that at home?
Speaker 2: Not that I recall, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't discuss that at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I really kinda--I kinda missed that back--at that point in my life.  But I caught up, though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 168626
Speaker 1: So the [U.S.] military [U.S. Air Force] for me was just a four-year experience.  And in, and in terms of re-enlistin', or even bein' in there, the fact that you could go to jail for missing work let me know that it was not the place for me to be, you know?  (Laughter).  It was just illogical and made no, no sense to me, but that's the way it was, you know.  You didn't go to work, you got an Article 15.  I mean worse come to worse?  No, you could get kicked out.  So, it just--you know--it wasn't the place for me.  And back then, you didn't have any black officers, so all of your people in authority were still white for the most part.
Speaker 2: How did you decide on becoming a dental assistant?
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know--I don't recall the process but, you know, they give you these tests and they have needs, and so I ended up in, in medical, and I think because of a need.  And within medical there are a lotta different categories of things that you could do, and I think I determined that bein' a dental assistant was the, the best one because you didn't have to wear your military uniform, you wore whites--medical whites, you know; I liked that.  The dental clinic wasn't open on weekends, so I knew I didn't have to work on weekends because it was staffed with all officers who were the dentists.  And so I think that's how I decided on, on the dental thing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It just seemed like the, the easiest or the, the best way for me--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and so that's, that's how that happened.
Speaker 2: So you're thinking [ph.] these decisions out based on, you know, a different criteria that you come up with as important--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  You know, I knew I wasn't in there forever--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and so I just wanted to, you know, make it through with the minimum amount of hassle, so that was it.  And it, and it, it did result in that; it was a, it was really an easy four years, it was a fun four years, I didn't get to see the world; I was stationed in Amarillo, Texas the entire time that I was on permanent status.  The first six months, I was in training--you know, basic training--and then in advanced training, and then specific training to be a dental assistant, which took me to Montgomery, Ala--Alabama for the final training to be a dental assistant and, you know, so--I really wasn't applyin' myself so, you know, we would sneak off base at night and go to town.  Montgomery, Alabama had two black colleges full of beautiful black girls (laughter), and so we would go there on the weekend, but of course, we weren't allowed to leave base durin' the week, so we would sneak out in somebody's truck, go to town and, and party.  And so, while I was in town partyin', my classmates were back at the base studying, and what I didn't know is that you got your assign--your permanent assignments based upon your rank in class, so if you were number one, you got first choice of all the possible assignments--Japan, Germany, Hawaii, Illinois--anywhere; so, I was near the bottom.  I think I was third from the bottom, and the only thing left when I--when it was my turn, was Turkey, Mississippi and Amarillo, Texas.  And I asked the major about Turkey--how did they feel about Negroes over there, and he, he said he had to check (laughter), so that eliminated Turkey.  And in Mississippi, they had--I was told, anyway, that they had signs on the lawn, "Dogs and Niggers stay off the grass."  So that eliminated Mississippi.  So that's how I ended up in Amarillo, Texas.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, so you spent like, you know, the balance of your, your military career as a dental assistant.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 168627
Speaker 1: You came out of the [U.S.] military [U.S. Air Force] in, in what?  In 1960--
Speaker 2: --Nineteen, six--February of sixty--1966.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what did you decide to do then?
Speaker 2: I went back to work at Social Security Administration [SSA].  As a federal employee, I still, you know, I still had my job in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So you came back to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right.  I didn't have a plan--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, while I was in the military, I had, I had met my future wife [Ottie Andre Bryant], and so I got out in February, and we got married, you know, shortly thereaft--thereafter and we lived in Chicago, and that, that winter happened to be the worst winter in the history of Chicago--the winter of '66 [1966], '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, there was probably the worst snow storm in Chicago history that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That was it; that was the one.
Speaker 1: Do you have a story about that snow storm?  Were you in it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah; I was at work when it, when it first hit, and I remember I had to walk--I think we--at, at that time I lived on 81st [Street] and Drexel [Avenue], and I remember having to walk from 63rd [Street] and State Street, because that's as far as you could get and, you know--so it was--and the snow, I think, was fifteen inches high--three feet; I mean it was just ridiculous, and I promised myself never again, because by--having been in Amarillo, Texas, I knew it could be warm in the winter time because it would be--sometimes it would be eighty in December in Amarillo.  So I said I didn't have to take this, and so I told my wife we were movin' to Arizona--Phoenix, Arizona, and she asked me did I--had I ever been there, and I lied and told her, "Yeah, I was stationed there when I was in the [U.S.] Air Force."  But that was a lie, obviously, 'cause I'd been stationed in Amarillo, Texas.  And so, you know, she agreed to the move, and as it turns out, she knew people in Phoenix, Arizona because she had graduated from Tennessee State University [Nashville Tennessee] and she had soros [ph.] there--fraterni--sorority sisters.  And so that's, that's where we went.  And, again, I had my federal employment so I was able to transfer my job, and I worked at the Veterans Administration in Phoenix, and my wife worked for a, a job training organization called Opportunities Industrialization Center, which was founded by Reverend Dr. Leon Sullivan.  And so, by her working in that environment, professional environment, with a lotta folks that had graduated from college and all that, I associated with, with all those folks.  And of course--and her--'course her soros were married, and their husbands were electrical engineers that worked at Motorola, and I associated with them.  So, just from bein' around them, I concluded, "Hell, these, these folks aren't any smarter than I am, so if they can get, get through college, I can, too."  So, that was my first really--period when I thought about goin' to college; prior to that, you know, I didn't--it just wasn't on my radar--for whatever reason; it just wasn't.  So--and then I met a guy that was at Arizona State [University, Phoenix, Arizona]--Dr.--he's now Dr. Joseph Parham.  He said, "Well, why don't you come out here?  I'll get you money."  And he bugged me every time he saw me.  So--I get emotional about it, you know.  So, he kept his promise.  I came there, he got me grants, he got me low-interest loans, scholarships, so I ended up makin' more money in school than I was working at the Veterans Administration--considerably more.  Plus, I had the GI Bill, which was worth, back then--I forget now--$1200 a month or somethin' like that.  So I was doin'--financially, I was doin' better--we were doin' better than we'd ever been doin', and I wasn't even workin'--just goin' to school, you know.  So, that kinda worked out okay.  And, 'course, I had another child, so I had two children at that time.  I didn't go to college until I was twenty-five, of course, 'cause I'd been in the military and done all that stuff.  So--
Speaker 1: That's something.  So, when you look back on it, that, that experience of, of bein' a top student in, in St. Cyril's [Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois] and not gettin' rewarded for it all, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --may have just taken you completely off the course for a long time, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think--yeah; in retrospect, you'd have to say that because, you know, you'd have to believe had I gone to Mount Carmel [High School, Chicago, Illinois], I woulda maintained the good study habits and all-a that, and I woulda graduated from there and, and college would have been on my radar.  But the other way you have to look at it is during that period, the Vietnam War flared up, and the fact that I had just coincidentally joined the Air Force right before the draft, came a couple-a years later, meant that I never--you know, I didn't have to serve in, in combat, as many, many of my classmates and friends did.  And so it was just--you know, so when you look back at it in the whole, everything worked out fine, you know--when you look at where I am now, you know.  So-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 168628
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were telling us about Joe.  What's his full name again?
Speaker 2: Joseph Parham.
Speaker 1: Joseph Parham.
Speaker 2: Yeah, from Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I--so when I knew him, he was, he was workin' on his master's degree in, in sociology.  He came to Arizona State University [Phoenix, Arizona] on a football scholarship, and so he, he brought a lotta people from Michigan to Arizona State so--'cause he was always encouraging them to come out there and get in college; he could help 'em get in and, and get money.  So that's what he did, and he was doin' the same thing for me, but I didn't know about all his other history.  And so one day--I majored in business, so I was talkin' to my business advisor because I wanted to make a course change at the beginnin' of the semester, and so I asked--and the advisor has to approve it; so, my advisor told me he wouldn't approve of the course change, and in fact, he said, "You're not the caliber for business.  Why don't you major in sociology?"  So I said--so I thanked him and I picked up my materials and I just left his office, and I knew then he would remain my advisor, but I never talked to him again.  So, the rest of my school years, whenever I needed my advisor to sign somethin', I would just forge his signature and did what I wanted to do.  And, of course, I--you know, I stayed in my major of business.  And so, a few years later, I was talkin' to Joe Parham and tellin' him about this story.  He said, "Well, you know, when I came to Arizona State, I was a business major, too."  And he said, "They told me the same thing--get outta business 'cause you're not cut out for it and why don't you major in sociology?"  And he was sayin' he was, you know, he wasn't mature like I was when I came to college; he was 18 years old--19; he didn't know any better, so that's what he did and that's how he ended up in, in sociology, but it was a--it was obviously a thing that at least this professor was doing--was getting black kids to not go into business--not major in business, and so I just, you know, I just found that very interesting, and so it was (laughter)--
Story_ID: 168629
Speaker 1: So, then when I graduated from Arizona State [University, Phoenix, Arizona], I ended up at, at Stanford Business School [Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California], and that was just coincidental.  I was walkin' across campus one day, and this black guy walked up to me and he says, "I'm lookin' for the Dean of Students Office, and I'm lost; can you tell me where it is?"  So I gave him directions, so he asked me, "Is there--what are you majoring in?"  I said, "I'm majorin' in business."  He said, "What year are you in?"  I said, "I'm a junior."  He said, "Have you ever thought about goin' to graduate school?"  I said, "No."  I said, "You know, I have a, a job offer--a standing job offer to go to work for Procter and Gamble [Company] in sales when I graduate."  I'm married, got two kids, I'm gettin' ready to go to work; never thought about graduate school.  So then he told me he was from Stanford University, and he was on campus, in fact, to recruit black students and Latino students to apply at the business school.  He said, "Well, why don't you apply?"  I said, "Sure," you know.  So they sent me all the materials and, and I applied.  So I also applied at the University of Washington and at the University of Southern Cal [California].  And the--in the course, you had the--what they call the GMAT test, Graduate Management Admission Test, and so they suggested that you take a course to prepare for the test.  Well, I was both arrogant, cocky and naive, and my attitude was, 'Hell, I go to school every day; if I don't know this stuff by now, takin' a course is not gonna help me.'  So I didn't (laughter), I didn't take the course (laughter); I went ahead and took the test.  So, I mean, I did okay, but obviously I found out after the fact that I coulda done better had I taken the, taken the, taken the course.  But it was just fortunate that I made it, you know, I made it through anyway.  And so I got accepted at the University of Washington, I got accepted at Stanford.  Southern Cal's program you had to have a business sponsor from the community where you went to school and, and lived, and because of my civil rights activities, I was just well-known, and I couldn't get a, a business sponsor, so I--so Southern Cal didn't offer me admission, so I ended up goin' to Stanford; I wasn't goin' to Southern Cal anyway (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, so what year is this when you entered [ph.] Stanford?
Speaker 1: Seventy-One [1971], 1971, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That is, that is a fortuitous thing; if you just walkin' across the campus and you bump into the person.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 168630
Speaker 1: --Yeah, and, you know, my, my entire--so you were talk--we were talkin' about the Civil Rights Movement and my involvement in it; I got involved when I got back from the [U.S.] military.  I had a, a good friend--we had both went to St. Cyril [Catholic School] together; he had graduated a year ahead of me.  He had gotten a scholarship to Gordon Tech High School [formerly Gordon Technical High School, later DePaul College Prep, Chicago, Illinois] to play basketball, which he didn't accept--he went to CVS [Chicago Vocational School].  And when I graduated, I was--had been the starting guard, so I also got a scholarship to Gordon Tech to play basketball, but I turned it down because Gordon Tech was all-white, and it was about two hours by bus from where I lived, so--so anyway, he was--when I came outta the military, he had started an organization and I--Black--Black Organizing Committee, or something like that.  No, it was OBU--Organization for Black Unity was the name of the organization.
Speaker 2: That's the student (unclear)
Speaker 1: --No, this was just--yeah, this is here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: In Chicago, okay.
Speaker 1: Yes; he was livin' here when I got back from the military, and so I joined the organization and we spent a lotta time over on Blackstone [Avenue]--65th [Street], sixty--in that area talkin' to the young kids who were involved in gangs, and mostly what they were doin' at that time was extorting businesses along 67th Street over there and, you know, I don't guess maybe doin' a little--not much of drugs at that time at all, just fighting and all that kinda stuff.
Speaker 2: And asking the businesses for protection money or something to keep--
Speaker 1: --Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: --their windows from being busted out, or something happening to them, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and just, you know, raising havoc in the community.  And so he--you know, his, his mission was to work with these kids and show them a better way, and so that's, that's what we did; we would just go over there and talk to them.  And so when I moved to Arizona that, that ended, but that was my first--wasn't my first exposure as a civilian, I guess you might say, and so--
Speaker 2: Can you remember who else was active over there in those days?  I, I don't know--I know--was Oscar Brown, Jr. working with the Blackstone Rangers [later known as Black P. Stone Nation or the El Rukns] then, or--
Speaker 1: --Yeah, he, he may have been, but, you know, we weren't--you know, we weren't connected to any church or any civil rights organization, no funding--nothin' like that; just a, a few brothers workin', you know, face-to-face one-on-one with those young kids.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you weren't associated with the Afro Arts Theater or any of that--any of that stuff going on?
Speaker 1: No, no, none of that, none of that.  So--but my, my college years was where I really became involved in the movement, you know.  We didn't have a, a black student union at Arizona State when I got there, and so it was, it was a guy workin' on his PhD [degree] by the name of Levy Jones; he started the organization and was its first president and, and I was a membership chairman, and he was grooming me to, to take over, so the next school year, I became the, the president of the organization.  And, you know, we did some things on the, on the campus to make some changes in terms of curriculum, in terms of funding for black student activities, and really just in terms of working with black students and helpin' them do better by providing tutoring and all that kinda thing.  So, that was my first exposure, you know--having fights with the Mormons, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 168631
Speaker 1: The Mormons were on campus?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah; you have a large Mormon contingency in Arizona, and they have a lotta power and influence in that area, and of course we, you know, we considered them racist based upon their, their doctrine, and so we had demonstrations against them when the football team came to play, or the basketball team.  And so they, they invited us up to the campus at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, to show us that they were not racists, and so I went, and a Latino student went, and we spent the weekend up there and so we went around and visited different professors, and we spent time with some students in the student union and, you know, did the, did the thing, and they, you know, they did everything they could to show us that they were not racist.  But, I did a lot of interviews with the professors and, you know, they may not have considered themselves racist, but based on the interviews I did, you know, I concluded that they were racist, based upon the things they said, which I recorded on tape.  And I wrote a, a paper on it, and that paper got published in the student paper in that community as a--really a four-part series.  So, it was, it was very interesting, so--and, and one-a the things I learned early on is, you know, not to jump when they put a microphone in front-a you.  And so there was a radio station that wanted me to come on; they wanted to interview me about my article that the paper had published about what was goin' on at Brigham Young, and so I asked 'em, "Well, how long was the radio program?"  They said, "Fifteen minutes."  So I said, "No, thank you" (laughter), because I knew what would happen, you know; they'd do all the talking, chop me up, and the program would be over.  And then I had an offer to come on a different show with Senator Barry Goldwater, and I turned that down, and people couldn't believe it.  "You have a chance to be on air with a U.S. Senator and, you know, you're not gonna take it?"  I say, "Nope, I'm not gonna take it because it's a set-up."  So, you know, and I just learned that from observin' a lotta other black folks that were gettin' in front-a the microphone, getting in front of the camera, and they were gettin' a, a job done on 'em, so I wasn't, you know, I wasn't interested in that.  So, so it was just about--you know, so they were doin' it for exposure, to get their name and face out there, and I just wasn't interested in that, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Barry Goldwater is a arch-conservative, I guess-first--
Speaker 2: --Yep.  U.S. Senator from Arizona.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 168632
Speaker 1: What was the name of your black student organization? What was it called? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Black Liberation Organizational Committee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Most of your black student unions were called that, the Black Student Union, but for some reason, we called ours the Black Liberation Organizational Committee--BLOC.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were, were you able to get any black courses on campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.  We got--they didn't have any kinda black studies curriculum or courses, or anything like that.  We started out with some courses in African history--African American history, some black courses in education, and eventually they got--they didn't get a whole department, but I don't know what you'd call it, but they had a, they had a curriculum.  They brought in some black professors as a result of some of the things that we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we, we, you know, we made some changes.
Story_ID: 168633
Speaker 1: All right.  So, so did your whole family move with you to Stanford--I mean to California when you went to Stanford [Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California]?
Speaker 2: My, my wife?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--your whole--yeah.  Wife and children.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, my wife and chil--oh, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and we lived in East Palo Alto, California, which was ninety-eight percent black, and I was the only black student in the program--in the graduate school that lived in East Palo Alto; all the rest of them either lived on campus, or in Palo Alto, which was, which was all white.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's East Palo Alto that's black, and--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was, that was just where we wanted to live, and they had a, they had a, a school out there that we put our son in--Nairobi Day School, which was one of the--founded by Gertrude Wilks [ph.], which was one of the first privately-owned African-centered schools in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was Nairobi like a member of the Council for Independent Black Institutions [an organization started in Buffalo, New York in 1972 to promote African-centered curricula in pre-school and elementary education], and that sort of thing in those days--I mean--or had it--
Speaker 2: I--you know, I don't really know--
Speaker 1: It sounds like it might--very well could have been.
Speaker 2: --if the organization even existed, you know; we're talkin' 1971.
Speaker 1: This is a independent black school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the--now, I know you've had a long involvement in the independent black schools (unclear).
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: What was the--what was Nairobi Day School like, in terms of its cultural atmosphere and curriculum, et cetera?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a, it was a African-centered curriculum.  We did the morning rituals.  And I say, I say 'we' because I actually taught there; I taught a economics course to sixth graders, so I was a part of the faculty while I was in school at, at Stanford, and of course my son was a stu--was a student there.  We start off with the mornin' rituals and sing the Black National Anthem, and had the red, black and green [a reference to the Pan-African, a.k.a Black Liberation, Flag] flying, so it was a--it was the real deal, I guess you might say, and you know, it was always a struggle to, you know, get the parents to pay the tuition and try to raise money, and so what they--one of the things they did was formed an affiliation with the public school in East Palo Alto, and so part of the deal was that--we offered various courses that they didn't offer at the public school and the students could come to our school, take the courses, and the public school system would pay Nairobi Day School for those students, so it was a way to generate income.
Speaker 1: Were these like culture-specific courses, or--
Speaker 2: --No, not necessarily; like my, my economics course--they didn't teach that in the public school.  And I don't know--I don't remember any of the other courses, but it was just--it was so funny in a, in a way because I had like five students from the public school that enrolled in my course, and eventually, and when I say eventually, within four weeks, they had all dropped the course.  And so I was really bothered by it because I was sayin', "Well, what did I do wrong?"  Because I'm thinkin' 'We're losin' revenue because of somethin' I did wrong.'  So I was--and so Miss Wilks tol' me say, "No, you didn't do anything wrong; you had a, a course syllabus (laughter), you know; they don't have that in public school.  You had homework that you were giving students, you had reading assignments."  She said, "You were trying to teach them, and you were insisting that they do the work."  And she said, "Unfortunately, Bob, in our public schools, that is just not happening any longer.  And once they found out that they actually had to do work, they weren't interested anymore; they thought this was just a trip off campus, and that they could come over here, pick up some credits and, and that was it."  So, you know, I'd really kinda been away from public school so I really didn't realize just how bad it was, and we're talkin' seventy-one [1971].  So, that was a-
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --eye-opener for me.
Story_ID: 168634
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was the course work like at Stanford [Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  It was rough (laughter); it was tough, even if you were a brilliant student.  So if you were like me when I was not a brilliant student by any means, it was, it was rough.  It was--they were on the quarter system, and I'd never been exposed to the quarter system; I'd always--at Arizona State [University, Phoenix, Arizona] we were on a semester system, so you could start off slow, pick up speed, and do okay by the end of the, end of the semester.  But at the quarter system, I looked up one day and it was time for mid-terms, and this was like three weeks (laughter) into the quarter, and I had barely cracked a book.  I was just operating on what I'd done in undergrad school and, and they had the--the way the program was set up, they were off--we were out of school every Wednesday, so every Wednesday, I would go up to San Francisco [California] and hang out and have myself a good time until mid--that mid-term came, then I figured the purpose--the reason that they were not having classes on Wednesdays so you could get your butt in the library and study.  So it was--it started off rough, but it, you know, it was, it was okay.  It never got easy, of course.  It was a very challenging curriculum, and they said that they were teaching us for something that would be happening twenty years out, as opposed to what was goin' on right now in terms of business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Julieanna [Richardson, Founder of The HistoryMakers] was asking earlier, before we started, you knew Mandy Michael Hall?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Who is he, and--
Speaker 2: Well, Mike Hall was a--he was a student at the business school; he was in the class of '73 [1973], so he came in a year after I did.  And so we were, we were friends, you know; we were both--had--were--had some similar kinda ways, if you will, you know; we, we were from poor backgrounds, not rich, and we weren't highfalutin; we were just regular folks, no airs, so we kinda gravitated to each other even though we were in different years, and we formed a friendship.  So, I came back to Chicago [Illinois] and went to work in television.  When he graduated, he went to New York, to White Plains [New York], to work for one of the food manufacturers.  And so we--so we didn't really talk to each other, so he eventually came to Chicago to come to work for Leo Burnett [an advertising agency], maybe six years later, and so we, you know we, you know, re-formed our friendship and, and that's it.  But it was, you know, it was, it was nothing--it was just friendship; it wasn't anything political, social, or anything like that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But how many other black students were there?
Speaker 2: In my class, it was fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And to my knowledge, they've never had that many black students in one class since (laughter).
Story_ID: 168635
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did--was there any, any professors there that were necessarily a--I mean special--that took a special interest in you, or that you remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but ironically, it wasn't in the business school.  After I got there, I decided--my, my emphasis was marketing, so most of the jobs in marketing were at the Procter and Gambles [Procter and Gamble Company] and the General Mills [General Mills, Inc.] and places like that, and so I decided that I didn't want a career selling soap--marketing soap, and so I decided on a second ma--a second master's degree, so I enrolled in the School of Communications and went to work on a master's degree in communications, and so one of the professors over there, Harry Brightrose [ph.], was somebody that took an interest in me beyond, you know, the professor thing.  So--but in the, but in--in the business school, that wasn't happening.  We had one black professor when I was there, and he was in Human Behavior, I guess.  So Professor Brightrose was somebody like that.  So, when I started lookin' for a job, I had--I interviewed on the business side; I had 'bout four different job offers, but on the broadcast side--on the communications side, 'course I didn't get any interviews, I didn't have any job offers, and so I had to reach, reach out to all the broadcast companies--ABC [American Broadcasting Company], NBC [National Broadcasting Company], CBS [formerly the Columbia Broadcasting System], Cox [Broadcasting Corporation], Kaiser [Kaiser Broadcasting Corporation]--all of them; had to write them letters.  And so one of the companies that I--I did get one offer from one broadcast company and that was Cox, which is no longer around, but they were out of Atlanta.  So, one of the comp--one of the other companies I wrote was Kaiser Broadcasting, and they sent me back a form letter saying, "Thanks, but no thanks;" they didn't have anything.  So, one day, Professor Brightrose asked me how was my job search coming, and I told him that it wasn't coming well at all, in terms of communications opportunities.  He says, "Well, I have a good friend at Kaiser Broadcasting; he's the president, his name is Dick Block."  He said, "Write him a letter."  I said, "I already did."  So he said, "What happened?"  I said, "I got a form letter back saying 'No thanks.'"  He said, "Well, write him again, and this time tell him that you have talked with Professor Brighhtrose and you were interested--you--that you knew that they were interested in hiring qualified minorities."  And so I said, "Okay, I'll do that."  But it really--it pissed me off, you know, 'cause here I am with two master's degrees from Stanford University, and I still gotta have this white man to help me get a job; shoulda been able to get it based upon what I had done.  So, I had attitude when I wrote the letter; the letter was about four sentences long, and it just simply said, "Dear Mr. Block, Professor Brightrose suggested I write you."  I gave my credentials, told him, "and he says your company is interested in hiring qualified minorities."  One paragraph, four sentences.  Sent it off (laughter); the letter couldn't have hardly gotten there, and my phone rang and it was Dick Block's--the president's assistant, saying they were so excited to get my letter.  I didn't bother to tell him I had sent a, a letter previously that they had, you know, rejected; I didn't even tell her that (laughter).  So, they were excited to get the letter and they would love to meet me, and when could I come to Oakland [California]?  So I went up there and I interviewed with Mr. Block and I interviewed with someone else, and so they said, "Well, we have a company opening up"--I mean "a station we're buying in Chicago [Illinois], and it opens up in July, and the general manager of that station will be coming out here in a month or so, and we would like for you to interview with him."  So, I said, "Great."  So that did happen, and I went and I interviewed with the guy that was gonna be general manager of--which was Channel 32 here in Chicago, now owned by Fox [Fox Broadcasting Company].  And I thought the interview went, went well, and so I didn't hear anything from him for a few weeks, then one morning about six a.m., my phone at home rang, and my wife answered it and she said, "It's for you."  And I asked her, I said, "Who is it?"  She said, "I don't know."  So I picked up the phone and I said, "Hello."  And this guy started talkin'.  He said, "We can offer you a job as a trainee, you'll be in training six months.  If you don't cut the mustard after six months, you're fired, and the job pays $800.00 a month.  Do you want it or not?"  Well, by then, I've figured out who I'm talking to.  He never said, "Hello," he never introduced himself, and he made me an offer that he knew I would refuse because starting salary for MBAs back then was fifty percent more than that, and you weren't in any six-month training program where you would get fired.  So it was just a ridiculous offer, and I accepted it because that's what I wanted.  You know, I wanted to be in broadcasting, and I wanted to be in either New York or Chicago.  So, so I said, "I'll take it."  And then it was just silence on the other end of the phone (laughter).  So after, you know, a period of time, he said, "Great.  See you in Chicago on July fifth at nine o'clock."  And that was it (laughter).
Speaker 1: This is 1970--
Speaker 2: Three [1973].
Speaker 1: --three.
Story_ID: 168636
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-three [1973], Kaiser Broadcasting [Corporation], okay.  So, they, they just opened up Channel 32 as a, as a independent UHF [ultra high frequency] station?
Speaker 2: No, it was already open; it was owned by Field Communications, the same people that own Marshall Field [Marshall Field and Company].
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right, okay.
Speaker 2: They purchased it from Field Communications.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what were things like?
Speaker 2: It was just like he said (laughter).  I was in training, but got none (laughter).  And, you know, the, the--
Speaker 1: --Well, how were you treat--well, just kinda walk us through it--your first day in office--what your expectations were, and what happened.
Speaker 2: I didn't know what to expect, you know, so I, I showed up, I showed up like he said.  I got there early, and so he did;  he came out and greet me and he called in the sales manager--guy by the name of Frank; I can't remember his last name--nice enough guy.  And so they showed me where my cubicle was, and told me what I would have to do was go out and find customers, you know--people who wanted to advertise on television.  There were no training procedure, no training manual, no training program--nothing like that.  So, I just had to watch the other guys and pick up--talk to them and learn stuff from them, and by me being--having marketing emphasis, I was able to go out and make cold calls and make sales because I could talk to the, to the companies about helping them with their marketing, as opposed to tryin' to convince them to advertise on television.  So, I was pretty successful, and so I wanted to come out--I was doin' well enough where I wanted to come outta training after three months because I wasn't getting any commissions.  So I woulda been makin' more had I been on straight commission, but other folks was gettin' my commission--the sales managers--so they weren't anxious to see me come outta training.  But what they did, they gave me a couple of advertising agencies as my clients, so now I don't have to all--do all cold calls.  But the clients they gave me weren't spending any money at that time, so as, as things would happen, two of the clients they gave me were about to start spendin' a lotta money on what we call direct response television advertising back then.  Eicoff Advertising [later A. Eicoff & Company] was one of the first agents--advertising agencies to engage in that, and so we--so anyway, by the time I was ready to come out of training at the fifth month, they were ready to start advertising spending money with me--it was two agencies--and so I told him, "Well, let's hold off."  And I didn't tell the company that I had these two agencies, each ready to spend a million dollars with me.  And so they finally let me outta training, told me I was on a straight commission, on my own, and the next day I walked in with two million dollars' worth of business and became the top salesman in the office for the next year.  And so then I got promoted to national sales; same thing happened--became the top salesman in the office and like the second top salesman in the--national salesman in the company.  The number one salesman in the company was also a black guy; he was in Detroit [Michigan].
Story_ID: 168637
Speaker 1: All right. Now, tell us now--you just told us some drama about how you really got started in business, and what did the--what did Kaiser [Broadcasting Corporation] think when you brought in a couple million dollars?  You know--I mean, I mean, had you done it prior to the internship running out, it would have been theirs, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, as it was, you maintained the share of it.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  Well, I mean they were elated; they were, they were definitely astonished.  They certainly didn't expect that from me.  I was the new guy on the block, and far as they knew, I didn't know much, so I mean they were really surprised.
Speaker 1: Now, were you also the guy they didn't talk to, or didn't share any information with?
Speaker 2: No, no, we--no, they talked--the sales guys talked to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah; they were, they were helpful and they were, they were friendly, so it wasn't, it wasn't like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's just that nobody was interested in seein' me come outta training (laughter), so--but you, you have to recall at that point, everyone was a new employee because you had new ownership, so it didn't matter how long they had actually been there, to these owners they were like Day One just like me.  And in fact, they may have seen me as havin' an advantage because I was the only one among them that had in fact been hired by the new owners, so I mean that coulda been part-a the reason that things--I mean there wasn't a lotta friction.
Speaker 1: Now, were there many other of the interns who had professional training at, you know, the school like Stanford [Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California] or someplace?
Speaker 2: Well, no, there were no other interns; I mean I was it.
Speaker 1: You were the only intern.
Speaker 2: Right, but there was no--there was nobody there with a MBA [degree] --from anywhere.  I mean back then, MBA was a new phenomena [ph.], especially a black one; but even white ones, it was just a relatively new concept in business, and so one of the things they advised us on is not to go to work for a company that doesn't have any MBAs 'cause they'll bring you in there and prove they don't need any MBAs (laughter).  So I was in a position where they didn't have any MBAs and, you know, no black folks, so--
Speaker 1: So they, they wanna minimize the impact of a MBA to maintain their own (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I think so, I think that's the--that's what the thinking was.  But I mean it worked out, it worked out okay.  And so, I just wanted to share with you how I ended up leaving there.  The, the, the progression up the ranks--up the ladder, rather, is from the local salesman, which is where I started, to a national salesman, which is the position I got promoted to, and then from national salesman, you become a local sales manager at one of the company's own stations, and Kaiser owned six stations--Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco and a few other markets.  And so, when a position came open for a local sales manager, I figured that I was probably one of the best qualified people for the position, not only in terms of my sales performance, but in terms of my education, so I applied for a, a position and I didn't get it--no problem; it's the first time I had tried.  Maybe a little later--maybe four months later, another opportunity came up; they were lookin' for a local sales manager, I applied for that one; didn't get it--thought I should have, but no problem.  And so then, the, the vice president of sales, who was based in New York [New York], came in to Chicago [Illinois] just to visit me, and he told me not to apply for any more local sales manager's positions, that they would tell me when to apply, and so he left and went back to New York.  Well, as fate would have it, three months later, the position of local sales manager came open here in Chicago at the station where I started.  Well, obviously, I was the most qualified for the position in terms of my sales performance, my education, and I knew the market because I'd been workin' in the market.  And so I ignored his advice and I applied for the position anyway, and so they, they brought in a, a black woman he knew in New York, and made her the local sales manager.  She stayed about six months and either turned into an alcoholic, or maybe she was one when she came here; but in any event, they shipped her out, and then they went ahead and hired the white guy that they had wanted to hire all along.  So, therefore, they had, you know, avoided the discrimination lawsuit.  But of course, we just were on bad terms at that time, so we negotiated my exit, and so I went ahead and started my own business, even though I had a job offer makin' twice as much money as I had been makin' at Kaiser.  WLS-TV offered me a position as a, as a account executive and I, I decided not to take because I decided I would only get fired again because it's just the nature of the business, I guess.  So I went into business for myself, started a marketing, marketing consulting firm, did that for a couple of years.
Story_ID: 168638
Speaker 1: So, so is this the beginning of R.J. Dale and Associates?
Speaker 2: It's like the preliminary to R.J. Dale.  This was a--this wasn't an advertising agency, this just a consulting firm, and I did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--What did you call it?
Speaker 2: It was called R.J. Dale Marketing Consultants.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so we did work for the Small Business Administration [SBA], the [U.S.] Department of Commerce, and some--a few manufacturers.  And then a, a recession came along, and 'course one of the first things they start cutting is outside consultants, and so I lost some of the business I had had, so--but there was a young guy at Vince Cullers Advertising [later Vince Cullers Group], which was one-a my clients who, every time I'd go up there, he'd say, "We oughta start our own agency."  And I really wasn't interested in starting an advertising agency, and even when I--when I'd see him on the street, he'd say the same thing; it got to the point where I hated to see him coming.  But then when the recession hit, my contracts dropped, and I saw him one day, he said, "We oughta start"--I said, "That's right; let's start our own agency."  And so we started the agency, and it was called Adworks, initially.  And our first client was Bachelor Quarters Men's Clothing Store.
Speaker 1: Now, now, what is the name of--says Adworks?
Speaker 2: A-D-W-O-R-K-S.
Speaker 1: And what year is this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen Seventy-Nine [1979].
Speaker 1: Nineteen Seventy-Nine [1979], okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And our, and our first client was a company that had been one of my clients as an SBA [Small Business Administration] consultant, Bachelor Quarters Men's Clothing Store.  Leonard Williams was the owner there, and he hired us as the, as the agency.  And then I--Illinois Service Federal Savings and Loans [Illinois Service Federal Savings and Loan Association] was our, our second client.  And then we got a big break when Luster Products [Luster Products, Inc.] hired us as their agency; they were just starting to make a move in the black hair care industry, and they hired us as their agency, and we were together fourteen great years.  The company grew by leaps and bounds, and the size of our contract with them grew every year.  It, it was--at the end, it was about eight times more than when we first started, so that was a good relationship.  And the thing I really loved about that relationship was that in my mind, it was the ideal model for black folks.  You had a black-owned company that hires a black-owned advertising agency, and that agency applies its expertise to help that black company grow.  And I saw that as a model that should have been duplicated as a way for us to begin to grow larger businesses, because what you really have now is black agencies with a lotta skills, but we sell them all to white corporations and we make millions upon millions of dollars for those white corporations based upon our skill set.  So, I believe that if we took that same skill set and went to work for black companies who are at one level, need to get to a higher level, that we could, we could do some serious growth for black-owned companies.
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Story_ID: 168639
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to--when you started, you know, Chicago [Illinois] was like one of the hubs of black ad agencies, you know, for black ad agencies, and I--correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the number one was Barbara Proctor [President of Proctor & Gardener Advertising], then--
Speaker 2: --When you say, "number one," what do you mean?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was the--had a number one black ad agency--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --making the most money.
Speaker 2: Emm.
Speaker 1: Barbara Proctor, [HM Thomas J.] Burrell, I guess, Vince Cullers--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: You know, Vince was a pioneer--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, so did--were you aware of all that history when you were trying to get started?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was very well-aware of it because Vince Cullers Advertising was one of my--one of R.J. Dale Marketing Consultants' clients, and we worked with them on getting new business.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a close relationship with Vince?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought it was pretty close, yeah; we, we talked a lot and all-a that.  And there was another agency out of Minneapolis, Minnesota--Zebra, started by a guy by the name of Tom Tipton, and he got his start based on a relationship with Hubert Humphrey, and they were also one of our clients.  So, by bein' inside of these two black agencies, I guess that inspired me to, to really eventually start, start the agency.
Speaker 1: Do you have any personal reflections of Vince Cullers?  We--I know we, we missed interviewing him.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: He now passed.
Speaker 2: Vince, Vince Cullers was a, a brilliant, creative guy.  I mean he was a, a writer and a art director; I mean he came up with some unbelievable copy--words, and some unbelievable visuals that helped a lotta companies, including Johnson Products, really move ahead.  He was a--he was a, he was a, he was a tough guy, and by that I mean he didn't succumb to the kinda pressures that the industry, white-controlled industry, put on him in terms of how he should be, and what he should do; he was his own man, and he, he stuck to his principles, and that's one of the things that kept him from really bein' huge, because he was a man of principle, and he believed in what he was doing, and he was very black-conscious, which was really unusual for black folks in business.  They were, they were business people first, and black folks secondarily, but their main focus, generally speaking, was about making money.  But that's not where Vince was coming from; Vince was about improving the, the, the condition of, of black folks through advertising--that's by the images he put out there, the words he put out there.  So he was, he was very insistent with his clients that he wasn't gonna do anything that was derogatory toward black folks or demeaning, or insulting to them.  All of his stuff had to be very positive, had to have a message wrapped up in it; and so that's, that's the kinda guy he was.  And he was probably the number one reason so many black folks ended up in this business, because there weren't many places to go, but one of the places you knew you could go and work was Vince Cullers Advertising.  So he had a lotta black folks that went through his agency that worked there for some period of time, including my partner, including me, including Tom Burrell, and a whole host of folks that are in this industry; a lot of 'em spent time at Vince Cullers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so that's his--that's his legacy.  He built the black advertising industry.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta see the image of him sitting behind his desk with the red, black and green flag behind
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was unusual.  You would never guess that.  I mean, if you didn't know it was there, you would miss it.  But Vince Cullers, I think his primary clients were Sears and--oh, now I can't think of who--
Speaker 2: Kent [cigarettes]--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --Cigarettes.  'Course Johnson Products when they first got going, and--oh, Kellogg Cereals.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And, you know, with Burrell had--he, he wound up with McDonald's and Coca-Cola, two huge advertisers.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Barbara Proctor had Quaker.
Story_ID: 168640
Speaker 1: But, but as you were saying, the black ad agencies were working mostly with big white corporations and not so much with the black corporations.
Speaker 2: Yeah--well, only, because that's who had the budgets to do advertising.  There weren't that many black companies around that had, that had the big budgets to do national advertising I'm talkin' about, so, you know, if you wanted to be in the business and survive and grow, that's the client you had to have, were the big white clients.  And we were all specializing and communicating with the African American or black consumer in helping those companies get more black customers.
Speaker 1: So, did, did you see a niche in the, in the market going after Luster Products and, and savings and loan people and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --Well, the niche that--I--you, you really couldn't call it a niche.  What I saw was that there weren't many black-owned advertising agencies, and there were a lotta corporations out there that could benefit from the services we provided, but didn't yet have a black agency, so I just saw a growing market that--and there was room for other companies.  So, beyond that initially, there really, there really wasn't a niche; it was just basically an opportunity--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: and--but, you know, it never--it had never developed into what it should have been and could have been, and that's primarily due to, to racism.  The, the big corporations just would not use us to the extent that they could have in ter--in terms of reachin' out to black folks and anybody else, because one-a the things about the black-owned agencies is the people that work in those agencies are classically trained in marketing and advertising--going to some of the best schools in the country; most of them had previously worked for some of the best agencies in the country, so they were all, including ours, capable of doin' any kinda work.  We could, you know, advertise to white people, black people, but we never got an opportunity or a chance to do the bigger pieces of business which was advertising, to what they call the general market--euphemism for white--the white market.  And so that has stunted the growth of all black-owned agencies, and we all believe that any of us would be ten times bigger than we are, were it not for racism.
Story_ID: 168641
Speaker 1: You came at this a little different from some of the other people.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: [HM Thomas J.] Tom Burrell, I think, was an artist, and so was Vince Cullers at--when they started, basically.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Business as a side, you know vocation.  And you--you're a straight-up businessman.
Speaker 2: Well, even--it was even more different than that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They all had worked for an advertising agency at some points in their career; I never worked for an advertising agency.  'Course--and like you said, I'm not a copywriter or an art director, so I didn't--I just had the marketing skills, and I really didn't have a classic marketing background.  A classic marketing background was having worked for, for a corporation in the marketing department as a brand or product manager or a, or a marketing manager, or something like that.  I had--I didn't any of that, so I'm a guy that started an agency with no background in the business, you know (laughter)--naively.
Speaker 1: Well, you just had your partner from Cullers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, well, he was--he--yeah--no, he really didn't; he just worked only at Cullers, and he was like part-time, doin' this and that, but his, his--he was a creative, but Vince used him mostly in production.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, who, who is this?  Can you tell us who he is?
Speaker 2: Bernard Boswell.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  So, what is your--I guess once you, you got yourself established, I mean how is your--so, so did you have to like bridge some kind of a gap yourself, in terms of like what you knew when you started and what you needed to know?
Speaker 2: Well, no, not really.  I had to find the people that already knew (laughter), and that's the way the ad business is, you know.  As you get business, you go out and find the people that have the expertise to handle that kinda business, and that, that's what I did.  You know, as we grew, I brought on people that were proficient in these various areas, you know--production, creative, media--whatever was required.  So, even as I sit here today, I'm not an expert on anything in the advertising business; I'm a, I'm a general manager.  I'm a business--like, like you say, I'm a businessman and--that's been blessed with some leadership skills, of course, 'cause you, you have to have that, and the ability to work with people and, you know, for the most part, get along with people--not all the time (laughter), but, you know.  And, so--yeah, and, you know, I don't have a problem with that; I don't have that kinda ego.  So in my agency today, you know, I probably know less than anybody about various aspects of the advertising business, but it doesn't, it doesn't bother me.  I'm not, I'm not tryin' to know that kinda stuff; I'm trying to figure out how to get new business, so I have to deal with the external environment and the politics of this thing, and the racism of it, and how to work through all of that and still get business, and still remain true to my blackness, so--you know.
Story_ID: 168642
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, who would you consider--you talkin' about Luster [Products] and some of the other clients.  So, who would you consider to be your, I guess, the top clientele, I guess, for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--You mean over all my years, or now?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess--yeah, as you reflect over it, I guess, you know, what's, goin' on now, too.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, without a doubt, Luster Products was a, was a crown jewel of R.J. Dale Advertising; at least for me, and at least in terms of revenue, they were our biggest client.  And that's--and as I was sayin', that's what I was so, so proud of, that they, they were our biggest client, and we, we really did a lotta good work for them and they grew and we grew, and that's, that's what I loved about that, so it, it really kinda goes beyond anything else because it was two black companies that came together and made something happen that benefited both companies.  So that's what talk--that's what I mean when I talk about that's--that, I think, is the model that we're gonna have to begin to look at, as a people, to grow our own companies, and for these, these companies that are at some middle level.  If they're serious about goin' to the next level, they have to look at these professionally-run marketing communications companies that can help them get there; they just have to do that.  Black companies, been my experience, has this tendency to wanna do their own marketing and their own public relations and their own advertising
Speaker 1: Ed [Edward] Gardner who founded Brainstorm Communications.
Speaker 2: --Right--started his own; so, it's just--you know, it worked for him for a while, but I mean they--these companies just have to realize when you--when they look at these big corporations that could have their own in-house advertising agency but they don't.  Billion dollar--multi-billion dollar companies--Walmart, just for an example--huge company; they have numerous outside agencies, but for some reason these black companies, when they get at this certain level, they think they can do it themselves.  I think they under-estimate the power and the complexity of marketing, and as a result, it really gets them in trouble in terms of their ability to grow their business.
Story_ID: 168643
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's the biggest white clients you've had; I mean in terms of, you know, white people's (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, the biggest is the Illinois Lottery--I guess you'd call them white; it's the State of Illinois (laughter).  But they're a, they're a five-year, hundred million dollar client that, that we, that we won back in 19--excuse me, not 19--2004, really, and so we've had a--we've had a lotta challenges with that account, but we, we've helped make the state a lotta money.  When we took over as the advertising agency, they had, they had had ten years of flat sales; no increase in sales for ten consecutive years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when was that?
Speaker 2: What years were those?
Speaker 1: Yeah, when they--no, the year that you, you all took over?
Speaker 2: Oh, we took over in February of 2004 on a
Speaker 1: --Okay, the 10 years previous to that, they had flat
Speaker 2: --Flat sales, yeah; not basically, flat sales.
Speaker 1: --'94' [1994] to 2004 it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, when, when we became the advertising agency in that first year, they had a eight percent sales increase, and then the next year they had another eight percent sales increase over the previous year, and that's the way it's been going and, you know, we're really proud of that because what it once again proves is what the black-owned agencies have been saying, is that we can do general market work as well as the white-owned agencies if only given the opportunity, so--and, and, and this proves it, and there's no debate about it because in all--the, the lottery, when we came on board, was about to celebrate its thirtieth anniversary.  Well, for its entire history, it had had large white advertising agencies, and so then we came along and were--was able to accomplish what we accomplished.  So nobody can say that we can't do as well as or better than these big white agencies.
Speaker 1: So, what was the promotional hook, I guess, that, that increased the sales for the Illinois Lottery?  I mean when you look back on it, what do you think it was?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a, it was a coupla things.  Number one, it was our strategic approach.  Good advertising starts off with good marketing strategy, so that was, that was the first piece; and then layered on top-a that, the hook, if you will, was our creative idea, and our idea was to utilize Bernie Mac for the television advertising because he's a native Chicago and Illinoisan, a well-known comedian and, you know, movie star; everybody knew him, regardless of race.  And also, to come up with a new slogan, and the, the slogan we developed was, "Have a ball."  So that was our hook, if you will, which helped us win the business on a permanent basis, starting July first, 2004.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 168644
Speaker 1: That was well-known.  I mean--I think people, most people, are familiar with those campaigns.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they were extremely successful from a financial point of view.  And if you stop to think about the financial state of the State of Illinois, then the kinda money that we've helped generate for the state since we've been on the business is significant to the state.  But we haven't been given the recognition I think we're due for that accomplishment, so you're talkin' about a, a, a department, the Lottery, which is now generating two billion dollars a year in gross revenue--up almost six hundred million from where it was when we came on the business.  That's, that's a lotta money comin' to a state that's strapped for money that--and it wasn't happening before, so--and we've had a lotta other challenges with that account.  We were audited five times, and these audits were--went on simultaneously, and they, they really set a precedent by or--by auditing us for the year that we were currently in.  You know, most audits take place after the year closes out, but in our case, they were auditing 204 [ph.] in 204, they were auditing 205 in '05 [2005], and they were auditing '03 [2003] in '03 [2003].
Speaker 1: Do you--would you think that that's some kind of harassment?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  That's an under-statement--yes, yes, I would consider it that--right.  It was, it was, it was somethin' that was happening on a coupla levels.  I think that some people--racism--they just didn't wanna see a black agency with the account.  On a political level, I think there were some people inside the administration that had made promises to some other agency that they would get this particular account, and that didn't happen so they--those folks were about tryin' to take it from us so they could give it to who they had promised it to.  And I think and in terms of some of the media, the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun Times were just all over us, and I think in the case of the Sun Times, they were doin' the bidding for some other agency or clients.  Advertising agencies is who places advertising in these papers, so I think they were tryin' to look out for them by puttin' pressure on the governor to fire us, and from the Chicago Tribune's point of view, I think they were tryin' to put pressure on the, on the governor to make him look bad to maybe make it easier for a Republican to beat him when he ran for office again.  So you had this thing goin' on on these, on these different levels, but all those, all those folks that were massed against us were, you know, singular in their focus--take the account from them.  And it has not, it has not stopped.  You know, just very recently, they--we had option years but they, they said that we weren't entitled to our fifth year on our contract, and so we had to fight about that.  So, it's a--it's been a, a, a, a struggle the entire time, and we really haven't been profitable on the account.  We had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend ourselves against all these audits.  We had to hire outside attorneys, we had to hire forensic accounting experts, and we had to put more people on staff to handle the demand for all the records that they were asking for.  So it was a very costly situation.
Story_ID: 168645
Speaker 1: Okay--anything more about that?  Now, this--the lottery--we were talking about the problematic contract (unclear) Illinois [State] Lottery.
Speaker 2: Well, the, the really, the really big piece is we took over as the interim agency in February, 2004.  The big white agency, they were being compensated at a certain level, so 'course we assumed, and rightfully so, that since we were gonna be doin' the same work that they were doin', we would be comp--we would be compensated at that same level, but when we submitted our proposal, we were told that that was too much, and that if they were gonna give us the business, they would have to quote "show some savings," so we were forced; if we wanted to get the business--forced and pressured into working for 22 percent less than the white agency that we had just taken over for.  So when you're dealin' in millions a-dollars, that's a significant amount of money.  And so if you, if you kinda take that twenty percent less each year, multiply it by five years, you're talkin' about a significant amount of money that we have been denied because they discriminated against us in terms of compensation.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, too.  You were talking about, before we broke on the last tape, about the legal fees to--and the, and the additional fees to provide people--to actually provide the records keeping--to provide the auditors with, with material.  Can you write those kind of expenses off at the end of the year?
Speaker 2: Write-off is one of my favorite--hated words (laugher), you know?  It's, it's just so misleading; it's still cash out the door.  But yeah, if you--the people that you hire, all of those are expenses of doin' business, and they, they do go in the expense line, and they do get deducted before, you know, you, you pay your taxes on your profits.  But in terms of cash flow, it kills you; it's still money that you have to pay, that you had not anticipated payin', and you really haven't generated any revenue that could be connected to those expenses.  You know, most of, most of your expenses are connected to some business that you have that's generating revenue, so--but in this case, that wasn't the case.  So it was a, it was just a drain on our cash.
Story_ID: 168646
Speaker 1: What does the picture look like right now, for R.J. Dale Advertising?
Speaker 2: The picture looks great.  I mean, the future that we have before us just looks real exciting because of some, some planning that we've done.  I believe, I believe in havin' a plan, and I, I believe that some things are gonna go wrong and so you better have your plan, and there's a lotta things you can't count on that you think you can; primarily, a lotta business from these white corporations.  This business has changed so much in that the black-owned agency is fast becomin' obsolete.  These big white agencies have, have started their own black agencies, and those that haven't started a black agency, many of those have purchased an, an existing black agency.  And so what you now have is these corporations when they want a black agency, they look to one that's owned or controlled by a white agency, and so the independent black agency is having an extremely difficult time, and that's not changing.  And I think things like multi-cultural marketing, or multi-cultural advertising is really just a smoke screen to get rid of black agencies and Latino agencies all together, 'cause once you sell everybody on this multi-cultural concept, then you don't need all these different agencies, you just need one that does multi-cultural, and guess who that happens to be?  The big white agency.  So that's what it's--it's not something that's coming, it's something that has arrived, and we're feeling the effects of it, and so diversity, you know, goes in that same category.  And so it's just, it's--the, the outlook for the future of black--independently black-owned agencies is not good at all, and so we believe that the agency that's gonna survive is one that has a plan that doesn't rely strictly on that.  And so that's why we have begun to look for black companies who can afford to pay us; we're--we don't expect to make off of them what we'd, we'd make off one of these large white companies, but we do expect to handle their business at a profit, and grow as their--as we hope their business grow.  And we're, we're lookin' at things outside of the country, we're lookin' at business in non-traditional areas, and so, and so we're having some success there.
Speaker 1: What would be a non-traditional area (unclear).
Speaker 2: A non-traditional area would be a company that doesn't--that's marketing something but not necessarily a product or a brand; they may be marketing an idea or, or, you know, something like that.  The--and there are companies--there are Internet-based companies, and we have several clients that are Internet-based companies, and so, of course, when you're an Internets company, you can market to the world.  So--and we're also involved with a company that's about to, to start doing business in Africa, so we're--you know, so that's another thing that we're lookin' at.
Story_ID: 168647
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, have you ever been involved with any political advertisers?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  We have done--we were the African American agency for Jim Edgar when he ran for governor--no, the, the first one--the first political advertising we ever did was for Jim Thompson the last time he ran for governor.  We did his newsletter for him, we did a, a media, a media plan, and some other things for him, even though he was, he wasn't in any danger of losing the election; he wanted to garner more black votes than any, than any Republican had ever done.  So Jerry Blakemore, who was the deputy governor under Jim Thompson, hired us to do some work on behalf of the campaign.  So that was our first foray into political advertising.
Speaker 1: I think I remember the--shaking hands with Jim Thompson in front of a Jewel Grand Bazaar, you know, back in the '70s [1970s]--late '70s [1970s]
Speaker 2: --Yep, you
Speaker 1: --which is, you know, I think it is the only white governor of Illinois I've ever, ever shaken hands with, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, he was governor for many years; I think he did four terms or five terms.  And then we did the campaign for Jim Edgar when he ran for governor, and then when he ran for re-election, we did that campaign.  Of course, you know, those were all winners.  And then we handled the campaign, the black segment, for George Ryan when he ran for governor, and of course he won.  So that's the extent of our political advertising.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't have anything--did you have--I--seems like you had something to do with the [Mayor Harold] Washington campaign, but I'm not sure.  I mean I--is it, am I thinking wrong?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have anything to do with the Washington campaign in terms of advertising--no.
Story_ID: 168648
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now, if you could?
Speaker 2: Boy, that's a good question (laughter).  I don't, I don't think so; I mean I, I just--because everything I did was me and, you know, I didn't do it for any reason other than that, you know.  I was just always myself, and so I don't think I could--if I wanted to, I couldn't do it differently because it wouldn't be me.  And where I am today is a, is a pretty good place to be if you compare me to all of--for example, all of the other black folks, and white for that matter, that have tried to start advertising agencies or started them, and are no longer in business, or if you compare me to all black businesses, well--with, with the average life of three to five years, we've been around twenty-six years.  And, so, you know, any way I look at it, you know, I've done, I've done well, and--I coulda done a lot better, there's no doubt about that, but that woulda been somebody else; that wouldn't have been me--speakin' my--speakin' out, speakin' my mind, standin' up for black folks when I could, speakin' out against wrongs, 'specially done by people in power, 'specially white folks when I thought they were wrong--that was me.  So all that has affected how much business we were able to do, but I couldn't do it any differently, you know; it would just--it would be somebody else, it wouldn't be Bob [Robert] Dale.  So I wouldn't, I wouldn't do a thing differently.  And you know what I always tell people when we get to complainin' a little bit?  I said, "You know"--and I'm talkin' about with other black business folks who are doin' well.  I said, "People would give their right arm to be where we are."  So, when you consider the entire black race in America, people like me are right up on the top in terms of business success, and monetary success, and fulfilment of dreams and all-a that, so--hey, it's been a great ride and it's not even close to over, you know?  The things that we have on the drawin' board now, are just, you know, gonna be huge--fantastic--and I just can't wait (laughter).

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Aw, man!  I only have one, and that is that we get in our right mind.  You know, I believe that all the, all the problems we have, and all the things that we go through, they're not problems, they're symptoms of a problem, and the problem is we are not in our right minds; we don't know who we are, we have no direction because of that, we don't appreciate our history, our accomplishments, our culture, our brilliance; we don't know any of that so we don't appreciate any of that, and we don't behave like all of that is a part of us.  So, the one thing that I'm, you know, most interested in is a proper education for black folks, and for me that would be a African-centered education where we learn who we are.  I mean it's just, it's just, in my opinion, ridiculous--the many programs that we start up based on the wrong premise, and most of 'em are based on the wrong premise because they're not African-centered; they don't recognize who we are, and how great we are, and that we are, we are the original man, you know?  Everything that's--science, medicine, all of that started with us; I mean that's our, that's our legacy.  And so, you know, what you have today is a school system--private, public, doesn't matter--that teaches black, black folks a European-centered curriculum, which is to say that the world, the universe, where everything that happens of importance, revolves around the European--white people.  And that's, and that's--so when you stop to think, 'Who are our great philosophers?'  They'll name you somebody white.  Who are our great authors?  They'll name you Michelangelo.  Who are our great writers?  They'll name you somebody white because that's what we've been taught--all of us, but especially black folks.  For white folks it's good because it gives them a sense of accomplishment, greatness, superiority.  For us it's bad; it gives us a, a, a sense of a lack of accomplishment, no history to speak of, no accomplishments that are really worth anything, and a feeling of inferiority, because if you've got someone feelin' superior, they can't be that unless there's somebody feelin' inferior, and that somebody is us because of the curriculum that we have labored under every since we've been in this country.  And so I, I hold all of our leadership responsible for that because I believe there are many black folks in leadership positions that know better; they know that the mess we're getting in these schools is destroying us, holdin' us back, keepin' us from being as great as we could be.  But they go along with the program for gains--selfish, monetary gains, egotistical reasons, to have fame and fortune--one or the other, or both.  And so you can't--and I tell people all the time, I said, "You know, today's fourth-grader is tomorrow's adult."  A fourth-grader is about nine or ten years old; ten years--they're an adult.  So we need to start dealin' with our children in elementary school, in pre-school even, so they'll learn who we are, how great we are, what we're capable of, who our enemies are, and how they work against us.  And, and, and 'til that happen, we'll be doin' what I hear Reverend [Jesse] Jackson say so many times, and I wonder why in the hell he's not getting it if he keeps saying it, and that is, "What we're dealin' with today we were dealin' with forty years ago," or some quote.  They'll make a quote and they say, "You would, you would think that's a quote from today, but that was said by so-and-so fifty years ago."  Well, damn it!  What do you--do you hear yourself?  So what that should tell us is that the programs that we're operating on are ineffective if we're at the same place today that we were forty and fifty years ago and, you know, it's gonna keep goin' on as long as we're subjected to our European-centered education because it, it teaches us to be subservient, to have no self-confidence, to in fact hate ourselves, and it's--and they don't have to say it.  And a unfortunate thing today is they don't--white people don't even have to be around; they can turn the school system over to black folks, the head of a school over to black folks; as long as they're operating with that European-centered curriculum, it's gonna be there.  I mean I have noticed--I mean I've been in, in many groups where I'll, I'll raise the topic.  Nobody wants to talk about it.  It's like I've never said anything.  When I start talking about a African-centered curriculum, everybody gets quiet, and I understand why, because nobody wants to--nobody that's tryin' to be a leader, tryin' to be rich, tryin' to be successful in business, wants to be connected to that kinda philosophy because they know that is the white man's, the European's, key to controlling us, and if we all of a sudden all start talking about getting rid of that control by havin' our own African-centered curriculum, then they know that they've got problems comin' down the road, and these black leaders know that so they don't wanna touch it.  And so they keep on with this farce that, that they're perpetrating on our people.  The masses of black folks don't have the benefit of the education that these in--you know, intelligent, educated, well-read people have, and I'm talkin' about ministers, I'm talkin' about civil rights leaders, I'm talkin' about educators, I'm talkin' about journalists.  All those categories know--somebody in those groups know.  I can't tell you how many times, right here in Chicago [Illinois], I have talked to black communicators who have the means and the audience to tell the story--they won't touch it; they will not touch it.

Speaker 1: Now, now, were you close to [HM Lutrelle] Lu Palmer?
Speaker 2: No, I was not close to Lu Palmer.  I knew Lu Palmer but I was not close to Lu Palmer.
Speaker 1: He was, he was a journalist (unclear).  This was one of his issues (unclear)
Speaker 2: --Right, right.  Well, you know, he was an exception?  Well, you know, you saw what happened to him, you know.  He had to make his own way, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: His advertisers left him.
Speaker 2: Right, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Now, you had a--now you're--what you're saying is not only philosophy, but you've, you've served on the boards of black schools--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --(Unclear), and I don't know some of your other activities, but do you wanna tell us about some of volunteer activities?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I've, I've been Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Institute of Positive Education [Chicago, Illinois] for a number of years; that's an institution founded by Haki Madhubuti [formerly Don L. Lee]; his wife, Safisha Madhubuti [formerly Carol L. Lee], and Soyini Walton and a, a coupla other folks, some many, many--over 40 years ago, and so that's, that's an institution that's been dedicated to teaching folks from a African-centered point of view.  It started out with a pre-school, New Concept Development Center [Inc. Chicago, Illinois], and then we went to--and then they had a, a elementary school that only went up to the third or fourth grade; I don't remember--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --which is the school my son attended.  And then they went on and made a eighth grade and they changed the name to New Concept School [Chicago, Illinois].  And then, when it really got tough raising money, we became a chartered school but with the understanding among ourselves that it wasn't gonna change a thing.  We would remain a charter school as long as we were allowed--not allowed, but as long as nobody tried to make us change the way we did things educationally--and nobody has.  And so we now have, we have a total of four schools; we have the pre-school, we have Betty Shabazz Elementary School [Betty Shabazz International Charter School, Chicago, Illinois], we have DuSable Leadership Academy [Chicago, Illinois], which is a high school, and we have--Oh, God, what is her name?  The major educator that we named a sch--we have a middle school that we named aft--Barbara Sizemore [Barbara A. Sizemore Academy of Betty Shabazz International Charter School, Chicago, Illinois]--we have a school named after Barbara Sizemore.  So, yeah, it's--so it's, it's more than a philosophy; it's, it's just a belief that I have, and I'm, I'm, I'm convinced that if we had started--if we had done this in earnest twenty-five years ago, we'd be so much better off today, and I think black folks just--we just don't seem to have the ability to do long-range thinking; we think every, every problem we tackle it's gotta be solvable in the next six months to two years, and we think that--we think that there are people that can help us that really can't--like the president of the United States (laughter), you know, like the governor of the state, like the mayor; you know, we think all these people are part of a solution for us, but they're not.  The solution for us is us, bein' in our right minds, and then, you know, we can deal with all-a this.  It's--it kinda reminds me of tryin' to build a house starting with the second story--leavin' out the foundation and expectin' that house to stand strong and, you know, and last; we're missin' the foundation, you know.  So after that--so, yeah, a African-centered education is, is more than just a more than just a dream for me, it's more than just talk; it's somethin' that I do and believe in and, you know, while I understand that we can't, tomorrow, just change everything, but we can certainly take steps like weekend school, like summer school, and then just begin to grow it from, from, from that.  And as we, as we take over the politics in these big cities, to the extent that we can influence legislation, well let's have charter schools but let's make them African-centered schools so they serve our purposes and our needs, both short and long-term.  So--that's my story and I'm sticking to it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 168651
Speaker 1: What today, when you look back on everything you've done, would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: What I just said.  My legacy is not in business because there have been so many that have done so much more than I have in terms of business.  My legacy is how I've worked in, in African-centered education, and it's not over, you know?  It's like said, I've got some big things on the drawing board that's gonna cause my legacy to be re-written so it's, it's--you know, it's not over, by any means.
Speaker 1: --Well, what are some of the big things that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I'm not--I can't, I can't (laughter)--I can't talk about them yet, but it's a--I can tell you generally, it's a, it's a, a connection between Africa and black America that me and some more folks are, are fashioning, putting together, where you got organiza--same organization on both continents workin' together, both in the non-profit arena and the for-profit arena.
Story_ID: 168652
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, tell us a little bit about your family.  Now, you have three sons?
Speaker 2: I have four sons (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Four sons.
Speaker 2: --I have three by my first wife [Ottie Andre Bryant], and I'm--guess it would be my adopted son--my fourth son through marriage--through my last marriage; I've been married four times, so I--it's not a record, but that's pretty good (laughter).  And my oldest son graduated from Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and he has four children--two boys and two girls.  And the, the next two, Yusef [Yusef Dale]--the oldest, is about forty--forty-one, I think.
Speaker 1: That's Condo [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Condo [Dale], right--who went to New Concept School [Chicago, Illinois].  And then Yusef, who also--Yusef went to Blyden Center for Creative Development [Chicago, Illinois], which is a African-centered school as you know, and he is, he is--he graduated from the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign, Illinois] with a undergraduate degree in finance, and a law degree, and he now is Assistant U.S. Attorney for Illinois, and my--Kareem [Dale] is about thirty-two.  He also--he graduated from the University of Illinois with a, a undergrad degree in advertising, a MBA degree, and a law degree, and he's now in private practice--has his own law firm.  And my fourth son is a sophomore, majoring in construction management at Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama], and I have my wife Kathy [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who is also in business for herself, so she runs a in-home day care, so--been doin' that for twenty years.
Story_ID: 168653
Speaker 1: So when people ask me--well, I think you may have even asked me, "Well, what is the, the--what really got you moving in this direction?"  And I tell people, "It was the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, teachin' us to do for self."  And, you know, and that's it, you know.  I think everything he said was true; people now know it was true, they know he was right, but, you know, it's almost like it doesn't matter.  Black folks don't acknowledge him--excuse me --don't give him credit, you know, for all that he put out there for us.  But everything he told us, as it turns out, we see now, was right, you know.  We don't, we don't grow our own food, we don't have our own hospitals, we don't make our own clothes, you know?  We don't do anything for ourselves.  But he, he showed us the way; we just wouldn't follow.  We wouldn't follow him in his organization, or we wouldn't follow his example independent of his organization, so we find ourselves where we are today--in piss-poor shape, as a, as a collective.
Speaker 2: Now, is there anything else that--is there anything I have not asked, we need to deal with, before I ask my last question?
Speaker 1: I don't know; you've asked a lotta questions (laughter).  I can't think of it--excuse me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But go ahead, I can't think of it--go ahead.
Speaker 2: Well, just a follow-up on that question (unclear).  Were you ever a member of the Nation of Islam?
Speaker 1: No; I was close to the Nation, but I was, I was not a member.  I became involved with the Nation of Islam when I lived in Phoenix, Arizona because the Honorable Elijah Muhammad's home was right around the corner from my home.
Speaker 2: Well, now, that's a home that he frequented because of his respiratory condition, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he--it was warm, that's all I know (laughter).  But it's, it's--that could be--yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --The respiratory condition, according to what I've read--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --required him to spend a great portion of the year outside of the city of Chicago [Illinois] and in Phoenix--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --where he breathed better.
Speaker 1: Right.  So he lived--he had a home in south Phoenix, and they had a, they had a restaurant there, which I frequented, and they had the, the mosque there, and so I became friends with the, with the minister there, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--So you actually met him and were able to--
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.  And so--and all, all that.  And I was the Arizona correspondent for Muhammad Speaks without [ph.] the Final Call newspaper.  Back then it was Muhammad Speaks.  And I did a number of stories--had byline on a number of stories comin' outta, outta Phoenix, for the paper.  And the organization that--the organization I was tellin' you about, the on-campus Black Liberation Organizational Committee, our version of the black student union, we had several members that joined the Nation, comin' out of our organization.  So, you know, I was, I was close to it, I--you know, did a lotta things with it, but just didn't join.
Story_ID: 168654
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as somebody that always tried to help black people; that loved black people--period.
Speaker 1: All right.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
