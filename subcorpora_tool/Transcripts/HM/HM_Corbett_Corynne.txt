Story_ID: 95493
Speaker 1: So we're going to start out by--we do what we are called life oral history interviews, so I'd like to first start out by having you tell me about your father.  I don't have your questionnaire, so I'm not--
Speaker 2: So my father's name was James Blake Corbett, and he was born here in New York City [New York], but his family was from both Virginia and, and Virginia--his family is from Virginia and North Carolina.  His father [George Corbett] died before he was born, and his mother [Hattie Corbett], his name was James Blake but when he was born, his mother wanted to name him "J.B." as a custom in the south, just to name somebody by initials.  But he was born in Harlem Hospital [now Harlem Hospital Center] and my grandmother was told that she had to give him initials.  So she--I mean give him a name to go with the initials.  So she called, she called him James Blake, but she never actually called him Jim, James, Jimmy or any of those names; she only called him J.B.
Speaker 1: So did he--do you know how far back, how far back on his side of the family do you know?
Speaker 2: On his side of the family, I actually brought with me the marriage certificate of his grandparents.  So it is from 1894.
Speaker 1: And do you know the history, were they from--I mean on--is it his paternal or maternal?
Speaker 2: Maternal.
Speaker 1: Maternal.
Speaker 2: And they were in--they were from Northampton County, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And there's a lot of information from people who--from a genealogical perspective who came from North Carolina.  It's the best place-- state to really come from if you're black.  But do you know, did he tell you--are there any stories more that you know about your family, your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: From, from being in North Carolina?  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95494
Speaker 1: Can you describe your father [James Blake Corbett], though, and did he share any stories of his growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  My father was like a big teddy bear.  Six foot two, with a baritone voice.  He worked at Spofford Juvenile Detention Center, which is a very place here in New York [New York City, New York] which is for juvenile offenders or--so he was well known even though we grew up in Queens and lived in Queens, throughout our neighborhood, as someone not to mess with and don't mess with his three daughters either.  Because if they got in trouble, they saw my father when they got there.  He was all--he had three daughters, he had only sisters and nieces.  And he grew up at the--he grew up in a house with his mother [Hattie Corbett], his grandmother, his sisters, and his two nieces, which he actually helped to raise.  And one uncle lived there as well.
Speaker 1: Now did he--what is the name of the detention center, can you spell it?
Speaker 2: Spofford, S-P-O-F-F-O-R-D.  It's in the South Bronx in New York.  He grew up in Brooklyn.  He was born in Harlem Hospital, he grew up in Brooklyn and he--the uncle that lived with them was a minister, an unmarried minister.  And one of the stories my father likes to tell is that Uncle James, his name was James Gay, Reverend James Gay, had always dated hairstylists, hair dressers because on Wednesdays and Saturdays, or Tuesdays, during the week on the weekend --those women would come over and do all the women in the house's hair, so the hair was done for church.  So my father had a thing about hair.  All through our lives.  He might come up to you and say, and whisper to you, "Do you need a few dollars to get your hair done?"  If your hair didn't look right.  So he really was--that stuck with him that he, you know your hair should look a certain way.
Speaker 1: Well that was the influence of having women all, all around him too.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The influence is that he, that, the, the two things that impacted him I think from living in that house was not only hair, but cooking.  So he was very famous for saying "I'm gonna put a pot on" because that's what his mother and his grandmother said.  And he would throw like amazing dishes together from leftovers or just from you know from his imagination.  He was a meticulous, meticulous cook, and also in his presentation.
Speaker 1: So now how would you describe him?  You said he was like a big teddy bear. But--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --what was his personality like and--
Speaker 2: He's very, very outgoing.  He was, he was the secretary, he was the president of his local union.  He was the secretary of DC 37 [District Council 37], I'd say for 15 or 20 years and he was the international vice president.  Very much involved in community and civil rights, but he was also a sports fanatic.  Like--so he was the kind of man who valued his friends and his family.  Actually we saw, when we were very young, more of his family, I mean of--more of his friends than we did of his family.  And he also made sure that his daughters knew a lot about sports.  So he would do, he did a lot of activities with us.  We went to track meets, we went to drum and bugle corps performances and that kind of thing.  We did a lot of family activities, but he did things one-on-one with his daughters.
Speaker 1: So you were all daddy's girls.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Story_ID: 95495
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you--his [James Blake Corbett] union activities--do you know much about them or do you remember hearing much about them?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I, I--well I remember we went to Hawaii when I was in junior high school for one of the conventions.  He was very involved and he went to the March on Washington [sic, Poor People's Campaign] and I remember that he came back with a poster.  So it was the march in '68 [1968] cause that's was when I was in elementary school.  And my sister [Cassandra Corbett] wrote on it.  And we had show and tell in the school.  I took it to school and my younger sister wrote on it and she said this is [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s phone number is what she wrote on there.  But he was very, very involved in rights for--civil rights and, and human rights in general.  And he also--sorry, what was the question?
Speaker 1: No, I was asking about the union activities.
Speaker 2: The union activities.  He did a lot with people who got in trouble at work, especially with the, with the, with the local; with the people who--on the job making sure that people were able to maintain their jobs, follow the rules and represented them when they, when they were in trouble and had some issues with work.  And he worked a lot with Victor Gotbaum, who was a very known, he was the president of DC 37 for a long time.  And with Lillian Roberts, who is still around right now.
Speaker 1: Those were both people very active in, in the union movement around here.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and minority representation of the union movement.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So do you know who the unions were controlled by here?  Was there any ethnic group that was mainly in the leadership in the unions?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  You know in, in Chicago [Illinois] where we're from, a lot--sometimes Irish, sometimes Polish that were, you know, in charge of the unions.
Speaker 2: I don't think that was the case here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95496
Speaker 1: So your mother.  Can you give her name and--
Speaker 2: My mother's name was LaVerne Henderson Corbett.  And she was born also here in New York [New York City, New York] in, in--I think she was born in Queens, but she was raised in Harlem.  And her parents were--
Speaker 1: Do you know around what year she was born?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1930.  My, my dad was born in 1927.  And her parents were--my grandmother was Mildred Henderson Jones, Mildred Jones Henderson and Sydney Henderson.  And my grandfather was the manager at the Harlem YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  And my grandmother was a--was started as a maid at a Madison Avenue hair salon, and worked her way up to hair stylist.  So my mother was the first to graduate from--she was an only child, but she was the first in the Jones line to graduate from college.
Speaker 1: Where did she go?
Speaker 2: She went to Hunter College [New York City, New York].  She was in the Who's Who of College Students.  She majored in romance languages, so she was fluent in Spanish and in French.
Story_ID: 95497
Speaker 1: Did she--so how did your parents [LaVerne Henderson Corbett and James Blake Corbett] meet?
Speaker 2: My par--my mother was a, a member of Delta Sigma Theta [Sorority].  My dad was an Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], he went to Brooklyn College [New York City, New York].  And they met at a party.  They were both involved with other people.  And they started to date and they were supposed to only date for a little while and they decided on the day that they--they said they were gonna date for a month.  And, and when the month ended, they decided they didn't want to break up.  So my father was engaged.  He went back and broke up--they were both engaged to other people and they broke up with those people.
Speaker 1: So that's--and they stayed together all that time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Forty-six years, till both of their deaths, they stayed together.
Speaker 1: [Unclear] to be.  So are they both--have they both passed away?
Speaker 2: Yes, they have.
Speaker 1: They have, okay.
Speaker 2: Eleven months apart.  They're very, very much in love.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95498
Speaker 1: So tell me your, your siblings.  You mentioned that they're all girls.  So where do you fit in the birth order?
Speaker 2: I'm the middle child.  But can I tell you a story about the intersection of my two families first?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so my--as I said my grand, my grandmother [Mildred Jones Henderson] was from Norfolk, Virginia, my mother's mother.  And while my father's mother [Hattie Corbett] grew--was born in North Carolina, she also was in Norfolk, Virginia.  My grandmothers was the oldest of eleven children.
Speaker 1: This is on your mother's side.
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, my mother's mother.  And she was the oldest of eleven children and her father's name was William Pelton Jones.  And he was--he had a--he was known in Norfolk cause he had a lot of kids.  And his wife died.  So when my parents, when my grandparents met each other, they met at my mother's mother's house.  And my father's mother got up to go use the restroom and when she passed my grandmother's bedroom she saw a picture of my great-grandfather.  And she came back to the table and she said to my dad, "J.B. what's that picture of Mr. Jones doing here?  That's Mr. Jones from Norfolk.  That's the man who's wife died and left him with all those kids."  And it turned out that she knew my, my family.  He said well that's, that's LaVerne's grandfather.
Speaker 1: So she--your grandmother, or your great-grand--your grandmother knew the--your, your father's family.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Wow, from North Carolina.
Speaker 2: From, from Norfolk.
Speaker 1: From Norfolk.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95499
Speaker 1: And on my father, and on my mother's [LaVerne Henderson Corbett] side of the family, I not only know--my grandmother [Mildred Jones Henderson] was very, very sure that we knew who everyone was in the family.  So she spent time telling us about not only her siblings, but life in Norfolk [Virginia] and who her parents were and her grandparents.
Speaker 2: So can you describe--can you talk about that?
Speaker 1: Yes.  So my mother's [sic, grandmother's] parents were William Pelton Jones and Anna Taylor Jones.  My fa--and so I know the paternity of--the paternal line.  Papa, we called William Pelton Jones "Papa," his parents were Hardy Jones and Indiana Jones.  And her mother's name was Lucy Haller [ph.].  So it goes, goes back.  So my--so they called her Grandma Indy and all of her sisters, all Grandma Indy's sisters were named after states.  So Missouri, Georgia, etc.
Speaker 2: So how far back are we talking?
Speaker 1: Eighteen sixty [1860].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Around there.
Speaker 2: So right, right, right before the end of slavery.  Okay and they're all in--from North Carolina.
Speaker 1: No, they're, they're all were in Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 2: You did say Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 1: All in Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they, the family stayed in Norfolk until my grandmother died, my grandmother Anna died, great-grandmother Anna Taylor Jones died.  She had my grandmother Mildred, Ferdinand, these are the surviving children, Ferdinand, Mack, Bill, Lois, Imogene [ph.], Delma and Velmar, and then she died in childbirth.  And then he came up here and married another woman, had more kids.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But the--they came to New York when my mother, my grandmother was a teenager.
Speaker 2: Do you know what year?
Speaker 1: In the '20s [1920's].
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenties [1920's].
Speaker 1: In the 1920s they came up.  My grandmother was born about 1905.
Story_ID: 95500
Speaker 1: Okay, so what--how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother [LaVerne Henderson Corbett] was elegant and unusual in terms of her style.  A little bit of a force of nature.  But very, very fine taste for the daughter of a maid and, and she had one of my cousins, one of her cousins that, that she would think of--she would see something in a magazine or in, in--for look at any, any kind of fashion thing, like it, and then sew it.  So she always had very, very refined taste.  My grandmother [Mildred Jones Henderson] had refined taste as well.  One--my godmother said my grandmother was one of the first people that she met that had lounging outfits, like in--so she would come home from work and she would put on another outfit in order to entertain guests.  This is in Harlem.  And my godmother said she had never seen anything like this before.  And my mother continued that tradition.
Speaker 1: Let's see.  But you're--this is the grandmother who also ended up working in the salon, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she worked in a salon on Madison Avenue, which was a white salon so she, she started out as a maid and then she got her license started washing and then she started doing hair.  And one, and one of the Kennedys came to that salon, was one of, one of the regulars.  And then there was also a woman from the New York Times who came there often.  And every year she gave my grandmother as a tip, press passes to Radio City [Music Hall].  So one of our regular family outings was the day after Christmas we would go to Radio City and my grandmother would walk right up--we never--I never knew about a line at Radio City.  She would just walk up to the front and show the passes and then we would just walk in.
Speaker 1: So do you know the name of the salon that she worked at?
Speaker 2: I, I don't even remember the woman's name, the person she worked for was named Nancy, but I don't know the name of the salon. I've looked for it.
Story_ID: 95501
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's, let's go back to your sisters.  And so you're the second, you're the middle.
Speaker 2: Middle.
Speaker 1: So who--what are the names on--
Speaker 2: We have three C's, Carolyn, Corynne and Cassandra.
Speaker 1: There are a lot of--some states on one side and C's on the other.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so can you tell me what your earliest memory of growing up is?
Speaker 2: I remember--I think I'm--one of my earliest memories is, is going to preschool and being really, really afraid.  And holding onto my father's [James Blake Corbett] legs cause he was so big and tall like, and not wanting to let go.  It was Mrs. Eastman's School, that was the name of the preschool.  And I did not want him to leave.  I was just terrified.
Speaker 1: Well that happens when you're little--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --It's a big world--
Story_ID: 95502
Speaker 1: So did you--can you talk about where you live, your family lived and can you describe the, you know, the block or the--
Speaker 2: Sure.  I--we lived in the same house my whole life.  So my parents [LaVerne Henderson Corbett and James Blake Corbett] bought the house with--my parents when they got married moved to Brooklyn [New York City, New York].  My mother was from Harlem and my father was from Brooklyn, they moved to Brooklyn.  And my sister Carolyn [Corbett] was born while they lived in Brooklyn.  And when they were pregnant with me, they bought a house in St. Albans, Queens.  My grandfather [Sydney Henderson] actually lived about three or four blocks away.  My grandparents separated shortly after my parents were married.  This was my mother's parents.  And he and his new wife bought a house in St. Albans.  So I--my mother became familiar with the neighborhood from that and they looked for a house and they found a house, a Cape Cod-style house, on--in St. Albans.  It was on--it was--the address was 18882 120th Road.  And it was the corner of a house on the block that had two dead ends, it was a really short block.  We lived in the middle section and to our right was a shorter half block with a dead end.  And then at the very end of the other, other--next block, there was a dead end as well.  And it was a really great experience growing up there.  I'm still friends with people from that block today.  There were some core families on the block that we--
Speaker 1: And you said--
Speaker 2: Core families.  The core families on the block.  So there were--and it was--there was almost like a, a, not a hierarchy, but the politics of who played with who on the block.  When we were very young, our babysitter was in the middle part of the block towards the end, so we played down there.  And then, then we moved to a babysitter that was like literally across the street.  And we played with the people on the other end.  It was--we played outside a lot, like double-dutch, that was really--a lot of double-dutch, a lot of hide and go seek and those kinds of things.  A lot of adventures; we rode our bikes around.  And we did a lot of walking.  So the church was within walking distance.
Speaker 1: And the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Presbyterian Church of St. Albans.  And our elementary school was half a block away, that was P.S. 15 Queens [Jackie Robinson School].  And so we did a lot of walking.  And one of the things we liked to do as, as children was--it was the, the block that the church was on, was across 120th Avenue.  But on the other side of that block, the block had a little hill.  So we loved to ride our block, ride our bikes down the hill.  It was a big, it was a big activity with a lot of friends.
Speaker 1: So who were some of the names of the people?  Who were--what did they do and the people who lived on the block, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had--on the far end, the Mazes [ph.] and Mr. Maze was a schoolteacher.  Mrs. Maze was a, a, a college professor, but she also when we were young ran a camp, a camp called Minisink [ph.].  But we actually didn't go to that camp, we went to a different camp.  There on the other side of the street there was a, a good friend of mine named Natalie McFall [ph.], and we were in elementary school together.  We started out in grade school, but both my sister Carolyn and I got skipped twice in element--skipped in elementary school and skipped in junior high school.  So the people I started out with I didn't actually end up with, the people my age.  There were the Henrys, who Mrs. Henry was our babysitter for, for a time and she had four children, four sons and three daughters that she took in that were foster daughters, that--they're still our family to this day.  And the Mazes had five boys.  So those were our brothers.  We only--we were the sisters to the, to the families that had no brothers.  And across the street from us there was a man called Mr. Alexander.  And he fixed everybody's bikes.  That was, that was--he, he had these--sat out on his front steps and he fixed people's bikes.  And he was kind of like the, the, the guard of 120th Road.  But before that, the, the man to the right of us on the opposite corner, his name was Mr. Garrison, he moved away when I was six or seven.  But he taught us how to do cartwheels, cartwheels in his grass.  So I will always remember him.
Story_ID: 95503
Speaker 1: So talk about family life.  What was life like within the household?
Speaker 2: On Sundays, except for during football season, my dad [James Blake Corbett] always cooked.  My mom [LaVerne Henderson Corbett] worked--my mom was a teacher, but she was also taught ESL [English as a Second Language] in the evenings.  So she had to juggle the children--us as well as her second job.  But she did fun stuff like make at the end of the course, make paella, which we got to help her make and eat in the house.  We, we did a lot of adventurous things, I mean, compared to our, compared to our neighbors.  We did a lot of museums in Manhattan. We ventured out.  My mother was from Harlem [New York City, New York].  She didn't see the value of always staying in Queens.  So we spent a lot of time in, in Harlem and Manhattan going to the museums, going to concerts.  I remember that my parents knew--my mother always knew where something was happening.  She'd even find the, the free concerts.  And James Brown did a free concert in St. Albans Park, which is now known as Attersley Park, and we went to that.  We, we did those kinds of things.  We when we were very young, went to, to Sunday school and everything by ourselves.  When we got older, we went to church as a family.  But very young we went to church by ourselves.  We did--we played--Carolyn and I played instruments.  Carolyn played the violin.
Speaker 1: Carolyn's your oldest sister.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Carolyn played the violin.  I played the clarinet.
Story_ID: 95504
Speaker 1: And a funny story is that my father's [James Blake Corbett] uncle, Uncle James [Gay] the minister, didn't like the fact that I played the clarinet because I might get into jazz and he thought that was sinful.  And, and on big holi--on specific holidays, we were on call to go to Uncle James's church.  His church was Greater Mount Pleasant [Baptist Church] in Brooklyn [New York City, New York].  And since Uncle James never married, he would send us dresses to wear.  He would pick out--he would call my mother [LaVerne Henderson Corbett], get our, get our sizes and send our dresses to wear.  And we'd come in, come to the church and my first experience at a Baptist church as a child is he would say I see my nephew's here.  Stand up and tell the people why you're late.  So my father was very, very good in a pinch.  He'd say "Well, you know three girls, a wife, I can get dressed really quickly, but you know the women take time.  You know, don't they look gorgeous?"  And Uncle James would, he would--I think he was trying to embarrass my father, but my father always won the people over to his side.  So, so we were always--for Easter or Christmas service or anything like that, we were always called or called for at Uncle James's church.
Speaker 2: So your family internally may not have been a church going family as much.
Speaker 1: Well the reason that my parents didn't go to church when we were young is because they had to go to church all the time when they were young.  So Uncle James--my father lived in the house with Uncle James.  And what I failed to mention is that Papa [William Pelton Jones], my mother's grandma--grandfather, was also a minister.  They went to church a lot.  And when they got married, they went to church as well.  But when they had us, they took a few breaks, they took a few years off.  So it was not "you must go to church, you must do these things."  But we did end up going to church-run camps, as--which was really interesting.
Speaker 2: And so were these Baptist church run camps?
Speaker 1: No.  We were Presbyterian.  We went to--the churches we--I mean the, the camps we ended up going to were--let me back up.  My mother had--since my mother was a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], she had some lifelong friends from Delta.  My two--my godmother Millicent Butler, and she met actually in kindergarten.  And then they re-met in college.  And she also had three children.  And we were like stair steps in terms of age.  So wherever we went to camp, we all went together with the exception of the oldest two, who didn't.  But the four of us all went to the same camps.  So they would--my mom and her sorority sisters would figure out--and her other friend Madeline Arrington, would figure--she had two daughters--where they were sending the girls for the most part.  So we all went as a group to these camps.
Speaker 2: So these were Presbyterian camps, or you don't, not sure?
Speaker 1: No, it was, it was Episcopal.  We went to Incarnation Camp [Essex, Connecticut].  We went to white camps.
Speaker 2: That's-- I was going to ask you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we went to white camps.
Speaker 2: Okay, so they, they were mixed.
Speaker 1: They were mixed camps.
Speaker 2: In--integrated camps.
Speaker 1: They were integrated camps and there must have been some kind of Hunter [Hunter College in New York City, New York]/Delta pipeline.  Because when we got there, the other black kids that we met on visiting day, all our parents knew each other.  And one of my friends, her name is Susan Benjamin, she lived in New Rochelle [New York].  And her parents, when they came for visiting day, there was different--I guess on visiting day, were--took them out to eat.  Took her and her brother out to eat.  But my parents brought food, and so did all the other friends and we all ate together.  So I didn't know until after camp was over, Susan Benjamin called me up and said our mothers went to Hunter together, they're sorority sisters.  And that's when, that's when we knew the thread was that everybody knew--all the black people knew each other at that camp.
Speaker 2: St. Albans is a well-known area though, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, and James Brown lived--when he did the, the, the, the concert, he actually lived around--like three blocks away from that park.
Story_ID: 95505
Speaker 1: I was asking about St. Albans [Queens, New York].
Speaker 2: Yes, St. Albans, yeah it was one of the first communities that, that black middle class could live in and buy a house.  And when my parents bought the house, they bought it from a white family.
Speaker 1: So tell me about--so we were talking about church.  So everybody was in Presbyterian church, or was it--I thought you mentioned Baptist.
Speaker 2: We went to Uncle James [Gay]--my father [James Blake Corbett] grew up Baptist, my mother [LaVerne Henderson Corbett] grew up Episcopal, no Methodist.  So they went to a Presbyterian church as a compromise when they got married.
Speaker 1: So when you--I want to understand.  If you could take me back to that time and you tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of your childhood.
Speaker 2: Is, is it on now?  Smothered chicken.  My dad made this--it's smothered chicken in the grill in the backyard.  Really, really bring me back home.  My dad had this orange-red grill and he would cook, he would marinate his ribs and then cook them on there.
Story_ID: 95506
Speaker 1: He [James Blake Corbett] had this red-orange grill which he cooked his ribs on.  And it was--it, it was like great anticipation when he, when he cooked the ribs.  But the smothered chicken, it was really, really rich and the gravy was just really thick.  He'd marinate that chicken and he used self-rising flour and a little bit of wine.  And he got from the bodegas in the Bronx [New York City, New York] he would bring home behul [ph.], which is an orange powder that makes the rice yellow.  So he'd make a big pot of yellow rice with the behul and all his spices.  And he was all so meticulous about onions.  So he had always had onions prepped before any meal.  He'd chop them real--I mean he'd slice them very, very thinly and then beautifully laid them into a container.  Present--presentation was everything for him.  So he loved to do that.  The other thing that brings back memories, all these things would come into play when my, my parents every holiday--the Saturday after Christmas we'd have a big party with their friends, not for, not for the kids.  But we were allowed to stay up to help with the food and to help like set up the food and to greet the guests till about--till my father's friend Uncle Peewee got there, then we had to go to bed.  And so we got to see all of their friends and this party was like legendary.  They had all their friends from all their different walks of life.  From college, from growing up, from, from the neighborhood, all mixed together in the basement.  And every year one of my father's friends would have too much to drink and fall down the stairs.  And the food was prepared in the kitchen, but in the back of the, the basement, there was a, a room.  They had the--in the front there was a bar set up.  There was a built-in bar and then in the back room where the washer and dryer was, was where they'd set up the tables, the food all those smothered--I mean black beans and ribs and all kinds of things.  She never made collard greens cause she didn't want to clean them.  My mother [LaVerne Henderson Corbett] was very modern in that way.  And so we'd get to set stuff up and we'd set up the napkins so that they were set up and my mother had a certain way she wanted the napkins tied together.  Napkins with the utensils put together a certain way and the way the basket set out.  So that was our job.  And then our other job was to greet everyone who came in, take their coats, and things like that.  And Uncle Peewee was one of my dad's friends and he was a cop, but he also owned a bar.  So he would be the last, one of the last guests to arrive to the party cause he had to wait for the bar to close.  And he would--we'd wait for him because it was a lot of fun.  So he would come into the house with like balloons on his head, like a balloon animal or something like that and he was really, really loud.  So we'd get all excited.  And after he'd get there, my parents would say Uncle Peewee's here.  So that--time for you to go bed.  So it was really a good--when we were growing up, my father didn't see a lot--I mean his mother [Hattie Corbett] died when I think the same year I was born [1961].  And his sister died--his sister and one of the nieces died maybe before I was ten.  So we didn't see a lot of his side of the family, with the exception of Uncle James [Gay].  And, and some of his cousins.  So his friends were a big part of our growing up.  And he had a, a bunch of friends from Brooklyn [New York City, New York] where he grew up.  And they were all our uncles, Jacko [ph.], Uncle Renard, Uncle Joe.  So all these people came to the party, but on some Sundays growing up, we would go to Hollis, that neighboring community, to Uncle Jacko's mother's house where all the kids would hang out while the dads watched football.  And in the summertime they would have cookouts.  So it was a lot of fun.  And one of the times when we were sharing a bicycle, we were all supposed to ride around the block and I decided to go beyond the block and I got lost.  And I didn't know the address.  All I knew was it was 111-11 and I didn't know the street.  And they had to come out and find me cause I didn't know where I was.  I must have been like seven or eight.  I thought I was doing something, I said oh, if I just ride around, I get to keep the bike a little longer.  And the funny thing was so Uncle Jacko and his mother, Mama Alma [ph.], lived right next door to Uncle Peewee and his family.  So we saw them also.  So there would be fifteen kids running around.  So it was--it would be Uncle Renard's three, two daughters and daughter--he had four kids all told.  And then their cousins, three of them.  Uncle Peewee had like five kids.  And we would just run around that neighborhood, it was really a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 95507
Speaker 1: So I want to go back--so those are sights.  What about smells?
Speaker 2: Besides the chicken.  The smell of hair burning, getting, getting our hair straightened.  My grandmother [Mildred Jones Henderson] used to actually come and do that.  My mother [LaVerne Henderson Corbett] did the hairstyles.  My dad [James Blake Corbett] actually did some of the hairstyles too at night.  And I remember that my mother wouldn't let the babysitter do our hair because she didn't want rubber bands in our hair, very, very consistent.  But I remember also the feel of the, the curlers made of paper and the, the rolling--getting our hair curled in the paper rollers as well.  But the smell of burning hair in the basement as we were sitting in getting--and the feeling that we just wanted to scrunch up when you're getting your hair straightened.  And the smell of Vitapointe.  One of the biggest smells is Jergens lotion.  My grandmother's house smelled like Jergens lotion.  And I actually bought some recently cause I wanted that feeling.  And the taste of, and the taste and the, the, the feel of Crystal Mint Lifesavers cause my grandmother was a smoker.  So when she stopped smoking, she allways had Crystal Mint Lifesavers in her bag.  So those two together.  I went to try to find some Crystal Mint Lifesavers recently and I don't think they make them anymore.
Speaker 1: And sounds?
Speaker 2: My father's booming voice.  He had a really, really, really deep voice.  And laughter, whole lot of laughter.  But the way the door sounds when it's slammed.  We lived in a, a, a Cape Cod [style house] but first I would say eight or nine years of my life we had tenants upstairs.  And so the doors--so the front door opened into a hallway and the tenants could go upstairs.  And the door, the doors into our house made a distinct, like a clicking sound when you closed them; the wood of the door.  But also the sound of our doorbell.  It's just coming back to me that in that hallway were, were the chimes of the doorbell and hearing the way that it sounded.  And the sound of an old telephone in the kitchen cause we had--it was on the kitchen wall.  So when we thought we were having a private conversation, we'd stretch the cord into the living room and lie, lie down on the couch.
Story_ID: 95508
Speaker 1: So there, there are a couple of things.  So the first--in addition when we weren't being called, summoned to Uncle James' for something.  It was very rarely Christmas when we were sum--it was, it was, it wasn't always Christmas.  Mostly Uncle James [Gay] called us for Easter.  Thanksgiving and Christmas were either--we spent Thanksgivings with the Butlers, my mother's [LaVerne Henderson Corbett] best friend, our godmother.  And so they had three kids and we--so we'd go to Brooklyn [New York City, New York] to their house.  And, and do Thanksgiving there.  And we would go before that Uncle Buddy was Aunt Olson's [ph.] husband and my dad [James Blake Corbett] would take all--we'd meet in Manhattan at Thanksgiving Day Parade.  And what I remember is being so cold and my dad would rub--take our hands into his and rub them and blow on them.  And then afterward he had a friend who lived on the Upper West Side and he would always give my dad the key so we could go to his house and have hot chocolate.  And if Thanksgiving was at our house, it gave my mother the, the freedom to cook in peace.  So she'd love [unclear] the parade.  So, so Thanksgivings with the Butlers.  But Christmas was a very much of a, a Jones thing.  So when my grand--so my grandmother [Mildred Jones Henderson] would come from Manhattan and she would--she lived in--before my mother got married, my grandparents moved to the Riverton [Houses].  And--which is a very well-known housing complex which was built for blacks because there was Stuyvesant Town [Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village] downtown was built for soldiers after the war, but they wouldn't let blacks in.  So they built one uptown in Harlem.  So my, my grandparents lived there.  And my grandmother would take the No. 1 bus down to midtown and then take the subway to Queens and my father would pick her up.  And after we opened our gifts at our house, my mother, my grandmother would get on the phone and call her brother Ferdinand who lived in--Uncle Ferdinand first lived walking distance from our house in, in St. Albans on National Boulevard, and then he moved to Cambria Heights which was maybe 15 minutes away where we had to drive.  She would call Ferdinand up because she didn't believe holidays were a holiday unless you saw your family, your whole family.  And so we then gather up at Uncle Ferdinand's house and see Uncle Ferdinand, his children, grandchildren and whoever else stopped by.  My grandmother had a two bedroom apartment in Harlem, but she was the matriarch after Papa [William Pelton Jones] died.  And if she said come, everyone came.  And there was a, a saying among the siblings, "keep the family together."  Not only know who the family is, but keep the family together, so know who the family is, spend time with your family.  So as a result, I went to high school [August Martin High School] with my cousins.  My sister [Cassandra Corbett] went to law school, to, to co--one--she went to college, one of my cousins followed her there, they were--and then they went to law school and they were roommates.  And they still talk every day.  So we have the same call best cousin.  You know and we have a best friend, right, we all have best cousins as well.  And so we, we did that.  And then after my grandmother died and Uncle Ferdinand died, his wife Aunt Esta [ph.], moved to Connecticut.  So there was one part of the family lived in Connecticut and everybody else lived in Queens, and they had to drive every Christmas to New York to see the rest of the family.  And once Uncle Ferdinand died, Aunt Esta moved to Connecticut, my mom's cousin Elaine said "I'm taking Christmas to Connecticut."  So we began the journey to Connecticut, which we still do to this day.  I mean we either do Connecticut or Maryland, which her son tried to take, hijack Christmas and she took it back.
Story_ID: 95509
Speaker 1: So you're, you're talking about a very strong family.
Speaker 2: Very, very strong.
Speaker 1: Okay, and activities centered really around the family.
Speaker 2: Activities centered around the family and, and social life as well.  We did a lot together, and we still continue to do a lot together.  It was-- that keep the family together.  One time I was standing at the bus stop and waiting to, I don't even know where I was going to go, Uncle Ferdinand drove by and I must have been like 20, I was in college, 20, picked me up and drove, was driving to--and he turned around and he said "Have you seen Val, your cousin Val lately?"  And I said, "No, I haven't talked to Val in-" "Keep the family together Corynne, keep the family together."  And they were very, very adamant about that, like maybe cause they lost their mother [Hattie Corbett] so young they had to stick together.  They--Aunt Lois, one of the sisters, lived in North Carolina.  She was a minister and she was married to a minister, so she was never there for the holidays.  So when she came, it was like a special occasion.  So that's what my grandmother [Mildred Jones Henderson] would call the command performance, everyone come cause Aunt Lois was coming.  But sometimes we got Aunt Lois to ourselves and the thing that we did with her was play jacks on the floor.  She was amazing.  She would get down on the floor and play jacks and she had--both she and my grandmother had this very, very sweet, light voices.  "Okay, girls, we're gonna play jacks now."  And so we did those kinds of things.  And my grandmother also liked to do her recitation, they all--I mean from that era, loved to recite their poetry and whatever remembrances they had.  So they did a lot of that to entertain us as well.
Story_ID: 95510
Speaker 1: So you, can you describe--tell me what schools you went to. So elementary was at P.S. 15 [P.S. 15 Jackie Robinson School, Queens, New York].
Speaker 2: P.S. 15 and then for intermediate school I went to I.S. 59 [I.S. 59 Springfield Gardens, Queens, New York], both in Queens [New York City, New York].  And then for high school I went to August Martin High School.  Those three were in Queens.  And then for college, I went to Pratt Institute in Brooklyn [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: So tell me what you were like as a young person.
Speaker 2: Really, extremely shy.  Maybe because I was--like work was easy for me.  I never studied for anything until I got to college.  Hadn't studied for anything, I would just walk in and take a test and get 100.  Never had to think about anything.  And read a whole lot of books, very artistic also as well.  One of my, one of my mom's cousins, I call her my aunt because my mom [LaVerne Henderson Corbett] was an only child but Uncle Ferdinand's four children, at one point they--my, my grandparents [Mildred Jones Henderson and Sydney Henderson] and Uncle Ferdinand and his wife all lived together, so my mom grew up with some of her cousins practically as siblings.  So Anna, my mother's cousin, would say "I don't know, LaVerne have you guys on the floor and you would just draw all over everything."  So I was, I was very artistic as well.  I loved painting and drawing and writing.  But I was painfully shy.  Especially because I got skipped in the second--I skipped the third grade and went to the fourth grade and then people were older.  Then I would--from there till sixteen I was always, always the younger one.  So I think in high school I saw, I mean junior high school is like a blur because I don't think I have any friends from junior high school, was pretty much invisible.
Speaker 1: Because you were so shy.
Speaker 2: I was really shy.
Speaker 1: Now what, what grade were you first skipped you said?
Speaker 2: I skipped the third grade, so I--
Speaker 1: Third grade, so you were--that--so you were born in 1961, so in third grade you would--maybe eight.
Speaker 2: And then I'm in the fourth grade then.
Speaker 1: Okay, so and then you got skipped.
Speaker 2: Then I was in SP, so I skipped the eighth grade.  So I was in--so I went from seventh to ninth grade.
Speaker 1: So why were they skipping you like that?
Speaker 2: Because they didn't--I guess they didn't--there was no A Better Chance or Prep for Prep, or anything like that, to identify high achievers and put them in more challenging programs then.  Or we didn't know about them.  And so since we, both my sister and I, cause Carolyn paved the way.  Carolyn was--I think she skipped the second grade.  She might have went from first to the third grade.  And she also skipped the eighth grade.  They had no alternative, they just skipped us.
Speaker 1: So you had good grades.
Speaker 2: Very good grades.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95511
Speaker 1: So they--so what are you--as a quiet person just because someone's quiet doesn't mean they're not thinking.  So were you--what, what was going on inside your head?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I used to escape in old movies.  I, to this day, love an old black and white.  Back then I would watch Shirley Temple movies like--and I liked--had a really vivid imagination.  I would imagine--I had this thing for fashion too, so I'd imagine fashion.  I would imagine costume design and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And this was at what age then?
Speaker 2: Nine, ten.
Speaker 1: Nine, so okay.  So, so you're, you know in the 19--like 1960, you know '60 [1960].  Well even moving to 19--only 1970s.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then when I did have friends, they wouldn't live there.  Like so I made a friend at camp [Susan Benjamin], but she lived in New Rochelle [New York].  And then my--I like to call her my first friend.  My friend from birth was one of my mom's friend's daughters, LeAnn Arrington [ph.].  And she--they moved to different--they lived in our neighborhood, they moved to a different neighborhood.  So I didn't see her as often, I talked to her on the phone.  But I didn't have as many friends in the neighborhood, like I didn't--wasn't hanging out on the street.  My youngest sister Cassandra, she is the social butterfly.  She didn't skip anything; she just stayed in her grade and she had the most friends and probably the most fun.
Speaker 1: So, so was there a lot expected of you as girls?  What was the expectations of your mother--between your mother [LaVerne Henderson Corbett] and father [James Blake Corbett]?
Speaker 2: Basically don't be stupid.  We have common sense, but there were no like rules like "you have to get this kind of grade," you have to do these, like they were pretty liberal parents for, for that time.  They--the expectation was okay, so you--there was certain chores you had to do, certain time you had to be home.  And one of the things you, you couldn't call somebody was "stupid."  So you had to respect your siblings and no fighting, no fighting in the street, that kind of thing.  But there were no rules, like no hard and fast rules and no beatings with belts or anything like that.
Speaker 1: No, no, no whippings.
Speaker 2: Not like, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95512
Speaker 1: Now the other thing that I, I wanted to ask--so you--were you good--you were good in art classes.  Is that what you gravitated to most?  You said, I know you said you liked to draw.
Speaker 2: I don't know, I didn't gravitate towards anything until probably high school [August Martin High School in New York City, New York].  And there was an affinity toward art.  But, but I really liked fashion.
Speaker 1: So who--what kind of fashion did you like back then?  Cause this, I mean this period of time--it's--
Speaker 2: I like the 1940s fashion.  I thought it was elegant.  Like to this day, like why is, like a twelve year old watching The Thin Man movies?  Because Myrna Loy had the most amazing costumes, or Dorothy Dandridge or Lena Horne in a movie.  I would watch it for that.
Speaker 1: Cause I was gonna say in the early '60's [1960s] it's bell bottoms and miniskirts and--which is fashion too.
Speaker 2: That was fun, that was fun.  But I--one of the things that annoyed me as a child was that wardrobe was limited.  We had cute clothes, but we wore what was given to us.  It wasn't like we had a whole, whole closet full and said "I'm not gonna wear that today, I'm gonna wear the hat."  You wore what my mother put out.  And there was some hot pants outfits and some cute--we--one of the things that was, that was really interesting, so we had three C's [Carolyn Corbett, Corynne Corbett, and Cassandra Corbett], we also dressed alike for a number of years.  We--so my mother saw an outfit she liked, all three had it on.
Speaker 1: Like twins.
Speaker 2: Like triplets.
Speaker 1: Like triplets, right I'm saying, okay.
Speaker 2: Like triplets.  But I was also the klutz of the family.  So one, one time we were staying at my grandfather's [Sydney Henderson] house, we all had the same outfit on but I was the only one with a ketchup stain.  I was, yeah I--so yeah we wore--and then until one Easter I broke out; wore something different.  But we wore the same outfits.
Story_ID: 95513
Speaker 1: So how were your personalities with your sisters [Carolyn Corbett and Cassandra Corbett]?
Speaker 2: We're very different.  So Carolyn is a neuropsychologist and a psychology professor.  She's very studious.  I said she played the violin, she was all-city violin.  So--and she went to Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] at sixteen.  Cassandra is--and she was very, very serious and she kept to herself.  I don't think she was painfully shy, but she was super, super smart.  So she didn't entertain foolishness.
Speaker 1: Your youngest sister.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Your older sister.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's a neuropsychologist, she doesn't entertain foolishness.  She's fun, but she's--and then Cassandra is a, a judge and she's more gregarious, outgoing.  'Cause she always has a social calendar since she was a little kid.
Story_ID: 95514
Speaker 1: So how did you end up then going to Pratt [Institute in New York City, New York]?  I mean I know you're interested in fashion, your par--so is that because Pratt is very good in terms of--
Speaker 2: I went to--I must have gone to a college fair or something and it was at Pratt and I met somebody from there that interest--that made me interested in applying to the program.  But I knew I wanted fashion.  I didn't know--I didn't want design, I wanted merchandising.  I didn't know what that was.  My mom [LaVerne Henderson Corbett] always said when, when, when we were young she wanted to open a boutique.  She was very fashion forward, or fashion conscious as well.  So she actually turned once the, the, the, the tenants moved out and my parents moved up to that apartment area, and she turned the--what was once their kitchen and living area into a walk-in closet and access--the kitchen became her accessory space, which she, which she--where she adapted the jewelry with her, with her torching, glue gun and all.  So she had an elaborate dressing area.
Speaker 1: So she actually--you, you're saying that she was making jewelry out of different--
Speaker 2: She would modify.
Speaker 1: Modify.
Speaker 2: She would modify jewelry, she would modify clothing.  She, she never wanted to look like anybody else on the street.  I remember the--I remember knowing that my mother was different one day when we were at the babysitter.  And I heard her, the babysitter saying to one of her friends, this is the '60's [1960s], "LaVerne doesn't wear a girdle.  Can you believe LaVerne doesn't wear a girdle?"  She was already kind of bucking trends then.  So she, so she, she kind of ingrained in us you really don't want to look like other people.  Even though she dressed us alike, she didn't necessarily want us to look like everyone you see on the street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Express your personality.
Story_ID: 95515
Speaker 1: So when you went to Pratt [Institute in New York City, New York], this is in 19--
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-seven [1977] or eight [1978]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: Seventy-seven [1977], okay.  You graduated in what year?
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 1: Okay, '82, [1982], okay.  So you're there, is it five years?
Speaker 2: I, I had one class to finish.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I finished, I finished--I walked with my class in '81 [1981], and then I had two credits and I took them that, that January of '82 [1982].  I never really went back.  But that's--my, my degree is June of '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: So who was the Pratt that you went to at that time?
Speaker 2: Very hippy dippy.  There was a lot--and very--I think the gay rights movement was very strong on the campus as well.  But as a--I was a commuting student, so it was a little--I wasn't really engrossed in the, in the culture of--but it was very--also dangerous because the neighborhood [Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, New York] at that time was not, it was a little dicey.  You know, what you would encounter off the campus.
Speaker 1: So the location is--it's the same location.
Speaker 2: Same location. The neighborhood has changed all around it, though.
Speaker 1: So tell, so what did you--what classes did you gravitate--what were you--were you coming in to do merchandising?
Speaker 2: I came in to do fashion merchandising, and so I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.  So I took a lot of art classes.  And I liked--and, and the merchandising, not so much.  Like when I took merchandising math, I realized I was never going to be a buyer.  I also worked in Macy's the whole four years I went to Pratt.  The, the four years that I was, you know, there full time.  I knew I wasn't gonna work in retail.  But I liked--I took a jewelry making class that there was a, a, a foundations class that you had to take where you learned like silkscreening, batiking and all that sort of stuff.  I loved that.  I loved that, I made this huge quilt with a Buddha on it.  We had to do wood carvings, all kinds of things like that.  I have a scar on my--from, from my jewelry making.  What other classes did I love?  There was--there, there were--and they also had like weird English classes that you could take.  And I took this English class called "space, time, drama."  I don't know.  I just gravitated to the, to the weirdness of it all.  But one of the things I liked about Pratt is that they had a very under the radar black theater.  They had black theater productions.  And I think that's the first time I saw Day of Absence [by HM Douglas Turner Ward], Ernest Gaines.  And that made an impression on me.  But I took dance classes.  They had dance majors, I took dance classes, painting, I did a lot of charcoal drawing and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 95516
Speaker 1: So I did--I was last--both of my--I'm the only non-Greek in my family, so my mom is a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], both my sisters are Deltas, my dad is a, a Que [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].  I think because I went to Pratt [Institute in New York City, New York] and I was not in the culture of a school that that was important, I didn't gravitate towards that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now did you--so what do you--what did you--was there a, a cohesive black student group there or was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah and the thing--I, I would say that the black students in, in art and design were pretty--the most that I, that I remember most.  I think the engineering people stayed with the engineer people, like architecture people.  But I would say there was ten or twelve percent black at the time.  But what I remember is the black fashion shows by the designers.  Incredible, incredible work.  And, and some of the parties were a lot of fun too.  So I'd bring my friends who were--I'd bring my friends who didn't go to Pratt with me to the parties.  I had a few friends there, but--
Speaker 2: But you weren't--because you were commuting, you weren't immersed in the, the culture of the institution.
Speaker 1: Not really.
Speaker 2: So that happens a lot, when someone-
Story_ID: 95517
Speaker 1: So what, what other things can you tell me that was significant about your, your experience during those years [at Pratt Institute in New York City, New York]?
Speaker 2: During those years.  One thing that I left out about my childhood that I need to, to, to bring up was that the--our vacation every year was as a family to a place called Chenango Valley State Park [Broome County, New York].  And it was not just our--it was the five of us plus either cousins or friends that we brought with us.  And then it was the Butler family, the Thornhill family, the Arbritten [ph.] family.  There might be ten black families in a white state park.  We stayed for two weeks and there'd be twenty kids running around.  And we went for--we started going when I was five and my parents went until I was twenty-five.  They continued to go even when the kids--there were no kids to take.  But there was no hot water, so you had to boil water and so the potbelly stove to get heat.  And we had to double up and triple up in bed, the kids.  And there was like a cement bottom lake, and we'd hike in the woods with Uncle John and Uncle John always got lost.  And we'd sometimes end up outside the state park on the highway.  Uncle John would take us fishing, that was a--and it was a great experience because it was the kind of place where we could get up really early in the morning and my dad [James Blake Corbett] would drop us off at the beach, which was the cement bottom pool which also had a light concession area, we'd make our sandwiches and we'd have a great day with all our friends.  And then we'd save our--we got an allowance every day, but we all wanted to make our sandwiches because at the end--the second week we'd always go to the New York State Fair.  And we wanted to spend our money at the fair.  So we'd saved all our money and when we'd go to the fair.  I remember one year we saw Sonny and Cher.  They had like great acts, but I do remember Sonny--and we'd walk around and spend our money and do great things.  And it was, it was a great time because they didn't have to watch us and worry about--so there was so many of us.  We were all together and we were able to be there from the time it opened till the time it closed.  So that was great.

Speaker 1: Now you were gonna--you were asking--
Speaker 2: Yeah I want--I was even --I'm trying to understand what you're like, you know at this point in time [at Pratt Institute in New York City, New York] and who's influencing you and what are your interests.
Speaker 1: So I--in college or--
Speaker 2: In college.
Speaker 1: My--in college I was very much hippy dippy.  I had pink hair.  I had pink hair.  First I had blue and green hair.  Blue streak here, green streak over here.  I got my hair done in Queens [New York City, New York].  And I remember that my dad [James Blake Corbett] picked me up from the, the hair stylist and--hair salon and we came into the house and my mother [LaVerne Henderson Corbett] said "Your hair looks nice," but the, the lights were off.  And my father whispered "Look at the color, look at the color."  They didn't say anything, he just said "look at the color."  And then my senior year I had fuchsia, fuchsia streak in the front and in the back.  So I--I was a little quiet until my--like I, I was still not--I was shy in terms of meeting new people.  But if I knew you, I'd talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.  And I was, I was nervous if I had to give a presentation in front of people.  Those were when, when the shyness came out the most.  But the--but then I--and I dressed in antique clothes and Army surplus stuff.  I would go to--there was a store called, in the East Village called Domsey's [ph.].  And I would go there with my friend Ladesa [ph].  And nothing was even hung up.  It was just you walk in and the, the window area, you--was just piled high with dresses.  And the dresses were five dollars, which was good for a college student.  So I'd buy all these antique dresses and make my own style.  And that was fun.  So I was influenced--so that whole four--so I bought all these dresses form the 1940s.  Again, I was really like influenced by the 1940s and the '70s [1970s].  And--but then I also started wearing like more makeup and stuff.  And my mom actually went with me before I started working at Macy's, well maybe when I, when I was working there.  But there were two companies, Stagelight Cosmetics and Barony [Universal Products] which had very, very like bright colors.  So I had like blue eyeliner and really like fuchsia lips.  So I had fun, fun with color.
Speaker 2: So was this consistent with everybody else you knew, or your friends?
Speaker 1: Consistent with the Pratt aesthetic, but not with the Queens aesthetic.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: I was like a little, a weirdo.
Speaker 2: So what did your parents think?
Speaker 1: Well when I, when I graduated from college, my mother told me I couldn't wear those things anymore.  I had to take the pink out of my hair to get a job.  So they tolerated it.  And one of, one of my, one of my family members said "Oh you think you're so forward thinking with your pink hair, but you know your grandmother was wearing that blue rinse way before."  My grandmother [Mildred Jones Henderson] had silver blue hair.  And she was a hair stylist and she wore that blue rinse, but it was gorgeous.  And so you think you--she said "You think you're doing something.  Your grandmother wore that blue rinse before you even thought about that pink."  So--
Story_ID: 95519
Speaker 1: What were you wanting to be?
Speaker 2: I, I thought I wanted to be a buyer till I found out what buyers did.  And then I wanted to do something in fashion, probably styling cause I heard what stylists did and I was really interested in that.  So that was what I really was interested in, like putting things together.  And there was--and I was interested in some production too.  So I worked on some, some, some production aspects of the fashion end, like producing--there was a, a designer called Bill Tice that, that the merchandising students produced a show for him.  And I was in the first--it was a two semester course [at Pratt Institute in New York City, New York].  I was in the first part of it.  And the second semester they actually got to do the show and stuff like that.  And I did some other--I did the video part of it, with the video production team.  And I really loved that.
Speaker 1: And that was as a student project.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a student project.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's--you're graduating; what do you do?  Where do you go?
Speaker 2: I didn't have a clue.  There was no such thing as internships.  There were, there were--and so I thought I wanted to work at a magazine and the best way to get a job at a magazine was to pass the typing test at Conde Nast.  So one of the things--in addition to my mom [LaVerne Henderson Corbett] being--my mom was a Spanish teacher.  And she taught honor students and she also taught Spanish sten, stenography and typing.  And I asked her to bring home a typing book for me, an English typing book for me.  And I sat in there till I got my typing back up to fifty words a minute.  But you couldn't have any errors.  So make an appointment and go take the typing test at Conde Nast, and go take the typing test until I could pass it.  And then see if I could get an interview.  I was trying to get into publishing anyway I could.  I didn't know anything about--I knew I wanted to be in styling.  There were two ways you could be a stylist.  You work at a magazine, or you work at a, a catalogue house and be an assistant.  So I applied for those.  But I didn't even know where to look for this kinds of job.  And so I, I, I did a little of that and I, I started temping.  And my first temp--at first I temped at a brokerage house as just a receptionist.  And then I temped at--while all along applying for jobs.  Then I temped at a, at, at Crown Publishing [Group], book publishing.  So I got exposure, I was there for maybe six months and I got exposure to that.  So I knew that I didn't want book publishing; that wasn't for me.  And I got an interview at Women's Wear Daily.  And I knew what Women's Wear Daily was the bible of the fashion industry.  So I said well this is a way in (unclear).  The job was for a secretary, and it was one of those interviews where it's like five minutes long.  I walk in and the woman who's a supervisor for all the secretaries wanted to--she interviewed me for a few minutes and she wanted to introduce me to the two women that I would be working with.  And one of them was yelling at her.  So I met the first person and the second person was yelling at her for some reason.  And so she went into her boss whose name was name was Jean Fahey and said I have this woman here, I think she'd be good for the job, but this lady's yelling.  She's like "hire her."  So I got the job.  And I started working there.  And the first, first time I go out to lunch with all--a bunch of the other secretaries, they tell me you know there have been nine people in your job in the past year because of the lady who yells.
Speaker 1: Who was, who was--
Speaker 2: Her name was Eleanor Barron.
Story_ID: 95520
Speaker 1: And so I worked for Eleanor Barron and Terry Yafian [ph.].  And, and it was set up--and our spaces were called pits.  So it was an open area just with dividers, and I sat in the middle and my two bosses sat on either side.  And I typed up insertion orders for advertising, I typed letters.  But then once a, once a month your, your ad team was up for what's called you're up, and that meant you had to take obituaries over the phone.  So you'd take obituaries over the--so you'd have to take all the details and take it down to editing.  So I got to see the editorial floor because that was when I had to take the obituaries downstairs.  And it was very regimented, it was nine to five, lunch from twelve to one.  And you couldn't make--it was very difficult to look for a job from there because you couldn't do anything cause I sat right between the two women.  So it was very interesting.  But Eleanor Barron got a job at Elle.  And she--and I was there with--I was working with her for a year and a half and she said "I wanna take you with me."  And I said I don't want to be in sales, I want to be in editorial.  So she is the woman who sold me to--so they, they hired the sales staff of course before they hired the editorial staff.  So she was the woman who went down to editorial every week and said "you've got to see her, you've got to see Corynne.  I want you to meet Corynne."  And I would get a call from Alex Witchel, who was the then editor-in-chief's assistant and say "We're not hiring yet; we're not looking for assistants yet but we'll keep in touch.  But she'd call me every week to let me know what was going on."  And then I finally got an interview to be the fashion assistant.  And my sister said you know this was--so this was the '80's [1980s], times of the power suit.  And my mother [LaVerne Henderson Corbett] already told me I had to throw away all my funky clothes.  And my sister said you need to wear a suit to this interview.  So I got a navy blue suit and a white blouse, I looked like a banker and went for a job as a fashion assistant and I didn't get the job cause I looked like a banker.  And I always tell the story to, to, to students about knowing the industry that you're, you're going in.  It almost cost me my career.  So the next day she called me up and said, Eleanor called me up and said they're-"you didn't get it, don't get upset."  But the beauty editor wants to see you today.  So I had to go after work in the clothes I wore to work.  And I got the job.  Well that wouldn't go without a hitch either because when I went to shake her hand, my strap of my handbag broke and it fell on the floor.  So it was a little funny.  But I got that job.
Story_ID: 95521
Speaker 1: So tell us about who Ellen, Ellen--
Speaker 2: Eleanor Barron was?
Speaker 1: Yeah, who she was and her role.
Speaker 2: Eleanor Barron was at the time I would say about in her sixties and the sales force at Women's Wear Daily was mostly men.  They talked about golf mostly all day long and they called their assistants "gals," which really didn't feel good.  I was not one of their assistants, but they called their assistants gals, be it black, white, whoever.  And it was a--so she was, she was gruff because she was fighting for her right as a woman to be in that field and to do the work.  And so she didn't take anybody's crap, male, female, whoever.  She fought back.  But she was--she--I was able to handle her, to understand what she needed, so she was very appreciative of that and she helped me very much get to the next level of my career.
Speaker 1: Which is really important.
Speaker 2: It's very important.
Speaker 1: In fashion.  Cause it's not a, sort of a logical move with things.
Speaker 2: No, it's very much who you know.  And, and it's relationship oriented.  Not only who you know, but will they, you know, will they go to bat for you.
Story_ID: 95522
Speaker 1: So, so what are you learning, you know, also about the structure of Women's Wear Daily, the politics of the situation, you know what is happening, what are the issues that are being dealt with during that time?
Speaker 2: So I, I learned a lot about church and state, which I didn't know existing in publishing.  So my thinking was I'm gonna get a job at Women's Wear Daily; I'll be able to move down to editorial.  But that rarely if at all happened.  And I was a secretary.  They didn't even call you an assistant, so there wasn't even a logical move from being a secretary to a sales person.  So I found myself while it was--the name was great, it was not a job that had any, any future.  I found that out probably in the first six months.
Speaker 1: And so what are you thinking, but--what are you observing?  What things is she [Eleanor Barron] doing and you know what are her issues even as a female?  You know I know you, you know, in that and who was run--you know is, is the magazine doing well?  Does it--I mean because it's sort of the bible of the--
Speaker 2: Right.  So there were, there were certain days when--so it was a fight.  You could see how the--I could see the struggle that it took to get sales, to, to sell advertising space.  And the stories they would have to tell and the presentations they would have to make.  And the frustration.  So it made it apparent that it wasn't for me.  It wasn't--
Speaker 1: Now who was heading the organization at the time?
Speaker 2: I believe John Fairchild was still there, yeah.  And he definitely was still there.  I never saw Mr. Fairchild.  But one of his lieutenants would come on the floor often.  But they didn't talk to any of us, they only talked to the, the salesmen, didn't even talk to the women that I worked with.  And so it, it was--and there were no--there was no, there was no interaction beside the necessary between the sales people and their assistants, who are secretaries.  "Get me this, do this."  It was not a collegial kind of environment.  It was very dog-eat-dog.  So, so that week when you're up besides taking sales, obituaries over the phone, the sales people also could take any business that came in.  So that was the week when you could actually move ahead.  So it was really important to take advantage of that and to follow up.  So it, it became--it was very, very competitive environment.
Story_ID: 95523
Speaker 1: So what then--and you--this [Women's Wear Daily] is like your first job really, I mean besides working at Macy's.  So you worked there for you said a year and a half.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then she [Eleanor Barron] has the opportunity to move over to Elle.  How does that opportunity come up for her and what is her position there?  And then, then you're saying shortly after she makes it possible for you to be a fashion assistant.
Speaker 2: Beauty assistant.
Speaker 1: Beauty assistant.
Speaker 2: So she--so sales--there was a women who worked at M magazine who also got a job at, at Elle.  And I believe she got her job first.  But a headhunter called Eleanor and she went to interview for it.  And she knew the category.  You have to, you have to--I think one of the things people are looking for when they're looking for a sales person is a vibrant list of, of, of connections that you can call on to get, to get advertising, or a strong track record, and she had that.  And she was able to secure a job.  And it was also a gamble because it was a new magazine coming from France.  Nobody knew about it, nobody knew it was going to be, what the potential was.  So it, it--the environment was risky for all I would believe.
Speaker 1: So where were you located?  Where was the office located?
Speaker 2: Elle? Elle was at 551 Fifth Avenue.  And we--and so on the first day I walked in dressed as I normally would dress and I met the fashion director.  I saw the fashion director as I walked in.  And she came up to me later and said you know you can always switch to fashion if you want to.  She [unclear] really dressed.  There were--since it was a, a rented space, bare bone, relatively new.  And there were just desks.  The assistants sat in desks next to each other.  Fashion and beauty all sat together at that point.  And we shared two phone lines.  The Fashion and Beauty Departments, the assistants did.  So you had to be really quick and nimble to get a phone line to make the phone call that your boss requested, etc.  And my boss's name was Gabriella Neurath and she was Hungarian.  And we called her Gabriella Darling cause she was very much a darling.  She knew the Gabors, she was that kind of darling.  So even when she asked you to do the most mundane things, she said it in such a way that it sounded fabulous.  "Darling, I want you to go down and get me a sandwich."  She didn't, she didn't believe then--there was a restaurant called Between the Bread, and she didn't believe in having the sandwich delivered.  She would want me to go and get it.  And sometimes Between the Bread wasn't actually in the neighborhood.  So I had to get in a cab and go to Between the Bread to get her a sandwich.  Or "Darling, I'm gonna let you go home early, but take these flowers to my apartment first."  Those kinds of things.  But she was a lot of fun because she was very colorful in her personality.
Story_ID: 95524
Speaker 1: So you, you worked there [Elle].  So what was--did you--you got on as--
Speaker 2: Editorial Assistant in Beauty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And what are you learning, and what is--
Speaker 2: Well I, I got to use like my art experience.  That's the first thing I learned.  The first--my first task was for the first shoot of the magazine, I had to go out and get really colorful nail polishes and colorful makeup from this store called Il Makiage.  And they trusted me to go out and get some really, really colorful stuff, and to call in some other stuff.  So I had to sit down and match colors, which really lent itself to my art experience.  And sit down and match colors for the shoot, for the pallet they wanted to give them to take to the shoot.  So that was like the first thing I learned.  And then I learned that--like you learn like the, the illusion goes away.  I learned that when you're matching makeup to a shoot, they didn't actually use the makeup on the shoot.  Things like that, you would learned things like okay, so now give us the credits for this.  And what advertiser is going to get the credit.  Those kinds of things we'd learn.  Then I learn--then I started going on shoots and learning all the details that, that took place.  Back then you had to tape the bottom of the shoes so that they didn't get scuffed.  And the--whether you pinned or clamped, you couldn't make any damage.  These days we have seamstresses on staff.  But then clamp things a certain way and so, so you learned a--you learned a little about how long hair and makeup actually takes to get done, it could be two or three hours.  Or you'd have a call time of 9:00 a.m. and then by you're doing your first shot at twelve.  So those kinds of things.  And I learned that the hours were going to be very, very long.  So I was at Elle for four years before I wrote anything.  I worked on the shoots before I did anything else.  And I went to press events.  And I learned that there's a beauty, of being a beauty editor which is you--there are certain assignments you have to do in the office, but a lot of the work is done outside of the office.  So going to a press event and seeing what happens at a press event, and so a press event could be a straightforward presentation, but very--more often than not, it was breakfast.  The presentation was breakfast (unclear) presentation over lunch at the best restaurants in the city.  Presentations over cocktail parties.  And sometimes black tie events, or sometime a trip somewhere.  So learning to navigate that was very interesting.  Having my first artichoke, for example, was really, really interesting.  I had to just watch.  I looked at the little rascals like something like what do you do?  But learning like--and then learning you know--I mean I knew about forks and knives and all that stuff, but I didn't know--but I had never been in situations where you had that many.  So to learn the dynamics of etiquette and that kind of thing, and to talk and to be seated with people you don't know and be able to have--and, and learn how to make conversation.  So what I learned was that you know, you know most people in the industry have skills, but if you don't have social skills, you don't get ahead.
Speaker 1: So you said that there was also other black women there in, in senior positions at the beginning of Elle, right?
Speaker 2: One black woman that had a senior position.  That was Ruth Gardner [Ruth Gardner-Loew], and she was the food editor.  The other black woman that was there was an assistant.  She was also an assistant like myself.  She worked for Regis Pagniez, the publication director.
Story_ID: 95525
Speaker 1: Okay, now who was hot in the world of fashion at this point in time?
Speaker 2: Elle Macpherson, and she was married to Gilles Bensimon, or she married Gilles Bensimon who was one of our principal photographers then.  Karen Alexander was a--one of the hot black models then.  Gail O'Neill came on the scene then and they shot a lot for Elle.  Christy Turlington. Naomi Campbell had yet to be discovered, neither was Tyra Banks.  Linda Evangelista, Rachel Hunter, Yasmin Le Bon, she was our first cover.  And but, but--and Elle was, Elle was groundbreaking in that prior to it coming to the United States, it was--you would just do a designer look head to toe and Elle broke all the rules in terms of mixing and matching.  And similarly, they used more black models than most of the other high fashion magazines.  Their models of color in general because Regis [Pagniez] who was the publication director, really was into changing the rules.  And it kind of helped that his wife was black too.  And so he, he put Karen Alexander on the cover of Elle and she had, she hadn't gotten a cover prior to that.
Speaker 1: So, so this--so they came in as a French publication and they were a little more inno--they were more innovative.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Than what you saw happening.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean that's the same thing with black models on the, you know on--runway models.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: That they really--it happened and, you know in France I think.
Speaker 2: Yes, the Versailles.
Speaker 1: In Versailles, right.  That Versailles show [The Battle of Versailles Fashion show on November 28, 1973] though, that was a little earlier.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, it was in the '70's [1970's].
Speaker 1: In the '70's [1970's], okay.  So are you very aware now of what's going on around in the world of New York [New York City, New York] and you know in fashion?  Are you becoming more aware and--cause this is a time also that some black designers are coming into--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Patrick Kelly was one of the designers that--he got a lot of exposure in Elle.  One of the things I was very aware of is the Benetton Campaign [Benneton Group's "United Colors" campaign] was happening.  Because when that photographer, Oliviero Toscani was one of our photographers.  So Elle had three photographers, Marc Hispard, Gilles Bensimon and Toscani.  And Toscani because I mean he was very, very progressive in his, in his view of women of color as well.  But I was aware, and it was the '80s [1980s] and, and you know what--I was also aware of not only--of the racial implications but the size implications.  I was never a size two when I worked.  I wasn't a size two when I worked there.  So seeing the world through this very, very narrow lens of how they, they judge beauty was very interesting, eye opening.  It didn't make me feel bad about myself or anything like that.  I was--I, I became actually more vocal about what looked right, what felt right to me.  And, and they became, they began to, they became--they came to rely on me as a quick thinker in terms of being able to come up with ideas.  And especially once I started writing.
Story_ID: 95526
Speaker 1: And I started writing because a friend of mine, Colleen Sullivan, worked at Vogue.  And there was an opening at Vogue.  And this is the four years into me working and I worked on shoots--
Speaker 2: Okay, so want to get the years right.
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-five [1985] I started there in 1985, in May of 1985.  That first issue of Elle came out in September 1985.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And then you worked there until--
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-three [1993].
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-three [1993], so you were there a long time.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, from the beginning to, okay cause it's still a very popular publication.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  So with--and so we had, at the beginning we had the--our first editor-in-chief, she lasted one issue.  She was really lovely cause she gave everybody an orchid when they got there.  But she lasted one issue; she couldn't deal with the French.  And so [Rupert] Murdoch brought in a woman called--
Speaker 2: And what was her name?
Speaker 1: Julia Schon.  And then they brought in a woman from England called [Evelyn] Eve Pollard to, to right the ship and to kind of get a rhythm going.  And she was part of the Murdoch team.  And she was ballsy, more like direct and she wasn't a fashionista at all, but she was a really good magazine woman.  And she knew what she was doing and she established some rituals there.  After every close, a closing party with crudites and fruit and Freixenet, very cheap champagne.  But just to gather the troops and after she had been there for a while, we took a staff picture where everybody put on their fuchsia Elle sweatshirt, went down to photo shoot and took a picture.  And as people left from the original staff, Regis [Pagniez] would cross their faces off of the picture.  So when I was leaving in 1993, he came in and said you are the last one.  I was the last one left from the original staff when I left.
Speaker 2: I see.  So what was the significance of that crossing the--
Speaker 1: I don't know what--I guess the changing of the guard perhaps.  But the--it was a really, really--I learned a lot but also I had a whole lot of fun.  We worked crazy, crazy hours.  But if you worked really late, I said that Ruth [Ruth Gardner-Loew] would take me to Petrossian and there was a, a, another restaurant where one of her best friends was the chef, Le Perigord and she would say okay we're going to go see Antoine [Bouterin], let's go.  But she taught me the value of having an extra outfit in the office.  Cause one day she came to my office and said "Do you have anything else to wear?"  Cause I had on jeans.  And she said we can't go out cause you're not dressed appropriately for where we need to go.  So after that I always had something ready just in case.  I didn't wear jeans often, but that was a very, very valuable experience.  But at the, as the magazine grew, the fashion and beauty teams grew, and the, there are two ends in fashion.  At a magazine there are market editors who go out and look at the clothes and then there are stylists who do the photo shoots.  And that's how Elle was set up.  And they--we had some--we had Jean Louis David who you've probably seen the salons around the United States.  He's a real person and his daughter worked there, and she was a stylist and she was there from France.  And she would do things like we were all working eight or nine, like 9:00 at night and she said "Okay, stop.  We're all going to dinner."  And they would call town cars and line them up outside and we would all get in the town cars and go to John's Pizzeria down in the [West] Village and have these big elaborate dinners.  And then she would turn to us and say "you pay."  It was so much fun, it was crazy, ridiculous.  And [Rupert] Murdoch owned a bunch of other magazines and Elle spent so much money on car services that they once said to Regis you've got to get the staff to, you know, you've got to change the culture.  They can't take cars unless they're going home or it's for business.  And he put a sign in the Art Department "no limousine, no magazine."  But the, the, the, the great thing I think in addition to learning shoots and stuff like that is I got to travel.  I went to like twenty-five spas around the world while I was there.  I went to Finland to eight spas.  That was a little scary.  I went to the World Club L'Avion in the Swiss Mountains.  Went to, to France, to Italy, to Ischia where they take the waters.  I didn't know what that was.  But all the healing waters and stuff like that just say that if you're doing something like that, you want some facilities nearby if you drink or even bathe in those waters 'cause of the, the sulfur and the iron encourages-
Story_ID: 95527
Speaker 1: I would like you to talk about the racial atmosphere too, okay or the opportunities.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Ready, so I got to do the spas because I started writing for the magazine.  And the writing came about because my friend Colleen [Sullivan] worked at Vogue and we were coming back from a press event together.  And she said "If you wrote, I would be able to walk upstairs right now and tell my boss to interview you right now.  But you don't write, so you need to start writing right now."  And I did.  I, I had already been assigning articles and editing articles, but hadn't written prior to that.  So I started writing.  And that opened up another avenue for me at the magazine.  And when I got my first cover story--no, actually when I styled my first cover, I got a, a note from the editor-in-chief [of Elle] that she was the kind of--whose name was Karen Anderegg, and she wrote a note to say "good job," I see you've got--so she kept in touch.  When I got my first byline I also got a note from her.  "Congratulations on your first byline."  So that was really, really good.
Speaker 1: That's-- So how many other people were--I mean how many writers did they have?
Speaker 2: The staff; in the Beauty Department there were four people, three to four people plus an intern.  In the Fashion Department there were like fifteen people.  And Editorial between features and help, we did help--feature, the feature parts of the magazine and food, another six, seven people, plus copy and that kind of thing.  And most writing was done by outside people.  Most of the times people edited more than they wrote, but there could be a mix.
Speaker 1: So what were you doing then?  Were you--
Speaker 2: I, I wrote and edited.
Speaker 1: Okay, how did you know that you had the talent to write or edit?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  It was a, it was on the job training.  I was fortunate enough to be in an environment where they said "try it."  And I did.  I mean I was really good with coming up with story ideas.  But then I--when I would--I could--I started out editing cause I--and assigning stories to other people.  And then sometimes the stories would come back not as I wished.  And then I realized I could have--when Colleen mentioned that, I could probably do exactly what I want.  And you also learn when, when you write and you're in-house, someone is giving you pointers on how to fix your--you know you get to rewrite in-house.  So you learn by doing.  But I had no idea that I would probably be a writer.

Speaker 1: So what were, what was the, the--how many other African Americans were there on staff [at Elle] and what were their roles?  Cause you always hear about fashion and how the racism is.
Speaker 2: There was nobody, there wasn't anybody in fashion for the most of the time that I was there.  That didn't happen till the '90s [1990s], they brought somebody.  But in Beauty it was me.  And after I left, there was Tia Williams came there.  In, in Editorial, Karen Brailford was in Editor--she was a write, she was a writer and a researcher.  So she was in there.  And then in, in the publication director's office, there was Agnes Bedou [ph.] came.  And then when she left, there was Tracy Belzano [ph.] and then when she left it was Andrea Jackson.  So there was a steady stream of people in photo and art.  But there was never--I would say there was never more than three or four of us at a time.
Speaker 1: And so how did those dynamics play out, or did you feel that it was you know, that, that was not relevant, or--
Speaker 2: In the space it didn't feel relevant, but in the industry, it did.  Because Elle didn't run like other magazines and I came to realize once the management changed at Elle, how other magazines run, ran and I was less comfortable there.  But the--at other mag--I, I was at Elle for eight years because I couldn't get another job.  It wasn't like people were beating down my door.  Most magazines didn't have any black people, and particularly not in the Beauty Department or the Fashion Department.  So they weren't, they weren't looking for anything above the norm.  They were looking for people from, you know friends of daughters and sons, daughters of friends as well as you know, daughters of colleagues.  But they weren't looking for a black girl from Queens [New York City, New York].  Even if I was known in the industry, they were--particularly when I was at Elle, were not looking for, for, for anybody like me.  And so it was a challenge.  I didn't want to stay there that long, but I didn't have anywhere to go.  I would interview for jobs and get close and I'd get it.  And the one time I did get close it was because it was someone from--who was formerly at Elle who recommended me for the job.  Before that, wouldn't even get a call back.
Story_ID: 95529
Speaker 1: Now what happened to Ellen [sic, Eleanor] who brought you-[to Elle]?
Speaker 2: Eleanor [Eleanor Barron].  She stayed for I would say three or four years and then she retired.  She was already in her sixties when she came.  And, and she retired. (This hair is bothering me, I'm sorry)  And then the sales staff stayed over.  Cause when it was first--when Elle first started, it was very fluid.  The staff was so small we all convened with each other and then it got bigger and bigger and then it--the management was first [Rupert] Murdoch and then Murdoch and [Peter] Diamandis and then they brought their publisher in and they got more corporate on the business side.  While the French were running the, the editorial side, it was still very French.  And by French, very French I mean that my day started because I was in Beauty, at eight or 9:00 if I had a breakfast.  But the publication director came in at noon.  He went to lunch at one or two, he came back at four and then the real work began.  So we worked midnight, 1:00 in the morning, 2:00 in the morning, regularly.  And one time I got in trouble cause I left at midnight.  And another time when it was like 1:00 in the morning, someone said "Well you don't have to come in first thing."  I said "Well I have a, I have a breakfast.  That's what beauty people--that's when beauty events happen."  They said "Poor you, poor you."  So it's a little--the atmosphere was very, very different.  But I didn't feel--I think it helped that Regis [Pagniez] had a black wife.  So that-that he was the publication director.  He ran things, so he didn't distinguish so much.  But I felt like the rest of the industry--there, there were challenges in the rest of the industry.  And when, when we got into the '90s [1990s], they hired an editor who came from a Conde Nast background.  And it was totally different, her name was Amy Gross.  She brought--she came in and she fired a bunch of people, she brought her own people in.  And she told me I shouldn't write, shouldn't write for the magazine.  "We just want your ideas."  "I'm not going to stay here now."  And it became really, really regimented.  There were things you were invited to and things you weren't invited to.  There have and the have nots.  And, and that was the nature of how they had run magazines in the past where they ran this one that way.  But it was totally in--different from how Elle had run previously.
Speaker 1: Now why did Conde Nast--what, what was happening?  Was it that the publication wasn't doing as well at that point?  How, how did Conde Nast come to publ--
Speaker 2: Conde Nast didn't come to own it, the editor came from Conde Nast.
Speaker 1: The editor came from Conde Nast.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we had, as I said we had nine editors in the time that I was there.  One time it was a triumvirate of people running around.
Speaker 1: Why so many?
Speaker 2: Because it--the publication director was the boss.  So--and, and you have to have a certain level of chutzpah, let's say, to deal with the French.  The French side of--French creative people who want to run things their way.  So for example, one of the reasons that they liked me is cause I could think on my feet.  I was not the beauty director.  Even when I was the market editor or the senior editor, they would still call me down to the Art Department because they would decide based on photographs, what they wanted a story to be.  Even though the story had been assigned and maybe there was a shoot done prior to that.  They'd look at the pictures and decide they didn't like that.  And they'd put some pictures on the wall and they'd say what would you write about there?  And I would make something up.  And they'd say okay, go back and tell your boss that's what we want you to write.  So that probably was not the best way to do business.  And so I think over time they wanted to change things and reign in the financial implications of changing shoots and reshooting.
Speaker 1: So this is the time too that money is falling, you know there's a lot of ad dollars falling.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's why you could have those expensive luncheons and, and car services and people.  So advertising--I mean it's the height of the advertising era.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, it's the height you don't--there's, there is no, there's no lack of any kind at a mag--cause it was one of the best fashion magazines.  It wasn't a lack of any kind in the staff.  Particularly fashion and beauty 'cause they bring in most of the advertising, there was no--
Story_ID: 95530
Speaker 1: And I hate to go back to this, but who else is, is--Andre [Leon] Talley, he's come on the scene, right?
Speaker 2: He's there.  I ne--I hadn't met him.  Mikki Taylor I would see at beauty events.  Sometimes I would be mistaken for Mikki Taylor.  So that was--so being--so I guess Mikki for a very long time was the only black woman at the events.  So once I got to Elle, there was another black woman in the room.  And then a couple other magazines started getting black assistants so that there would be--and you didn't know if there was pressure to stay away from, like you had to read the scene.  Do you stay away from the other black people, or do you congregate together?  And after a while we just did what we wanted to do.  Say hi, sit down together if we wanted to, not.  But there was no competition.  It didn't become, become competitive.  But they were few and far between, so there was my--there was Mikki, myself and [Jacklyn] Jackie Monk who was at Beauty Digest at the time, and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So where are all of you--where are all of you now then?  Has everyone stayed between you know, the three--Jackie, you and Mikki.
Speaker 2: So Mikki is an editor-at-large at Essence now.  And Jackie is the Deputy Managing Editor at Real Simple.  She got out of beauty a number of years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, but they're way more--I mean they have a tremendous amount of people of color now.  This young group--Kahlana Barfield is the Beauty--one of the beauty directors at InStyle.  There is a, an Associate Editor at Lucky, Megan [O'Neill].  There's an Associate Editor at--my old assistant Nykia Spradley is at Ladies' Home Journal as an Associate Editor.  So--and Tia Williams was at Lucky and Glamour.  So there, there has been a tremendous change from I'd say the mid to late '90s [1990s] on that--at least there's representation.
Speaker 1: So cause some people feel that it, it's getting--you know there was a period and maybe this is on the fashion side, not the beauty side I keep, you know where they're, they're really--black models completely disappeared.
Speaker 2: From the modeling end, absolutely.  I absolutely agree with that.  It, it--and particularly because I mean I've worked at Elle, I worked at--I've worked at places where they did use black models and then I've worked at places where it's few and far between.  So it becomes a challenge and, and there, there's the myth that, that black women don't sell on the cover of magazines.  So that excuse is used that a lot of times that it's given for why they won't put black women on the cover.  And then on the runway, it is a nonsensical to me rule or, or thought process that they want uniformity.  So that doesn't make any sense to me.
Story_ID: 95531
Speaker 1: But it's an industry that you fell in love with, is that--
Speaker 2: Yes, because I couldn't see myself as an insurance agent or anything like that, but I like the creativity of it and the expression of--and I like helping people break into the industry, honestly.  I like to see other people succeed in it as well.  And I like empowering--I, I think there's a way to empower women through these industries.  Through what we do--I mean it seems frivolous, but I think the real--there really are ways to make women feel good about themselves.  So if you're a black woman working at a white magazine that you make sure that they understand the needs of black women as opposed to saying "Okay let's, let's pick one black woman who's representative of everyone."  Well that doesn't exist.  So making the, the powers that be understand the needs of--so I think that's our role when we're doing that.  And we're--when we're working at a black magazine, it is to celebrate all the diversity that--all the diverse beauty that we represent.
Speaker 1: So when you say you like the creativity of it, can you explain that in more detail?  Of things that actually maybe happened to you or give examples?  Okay.
Speaker 2: So give examples-oh, creatively speaking, so I--for one story that I wrote, I went on--so I covered at Elle, Beauty, Health and Fitness.  One story I took a one week sailing course for women called Women for Sail in Florida where I was on a boat with a bunch of other people and learned how to sail and came back and wrote about that.  And I, and I would have never been able to, to describe that experience had I not done it.  So learning kind of new techniques about things are a lot of fun.  And then learning the science of things.  I went to the rain forest on a, on a press trip with hair care company called Sebastian.  And we went to, we went in the rain forest and there was a, a red substance that they used to paint the skin and to use, that they were going to then use--that that was also used in products in Brazil.  And one of the people at Sebastian took me to an apothecary so I could meet the scientists who made that and I wrote a story about him.  And I thought that that was really exciting.  But sometimes it's a matter of seeing an art exhibit or an old movie or a new movie.  And seeing something in that that can spurn [sic, spur] how you want the story to look visually.  How you want the hair to look, how you want the makeup to look.  So you--what's interesting about beauty is all the beauty editors can learn about a new product or see things at the same time, but, but can interpret it differently for their audiences based upon the wants and needs, and their own creativity.  So yes, this product does have these attributes, but is it part of an overall trend of some sort?  Does it relate to something historically?  So it, it just opens a door for you to find the best way to tell a story.
Story_ID: 95532
Speaker 1: Okay. So who are, who are--I want to know the structure.  That helps--I want to know the structure.  Who had the most status within you know, the Elle publishing ranks, and, and then also who was Elle competing with?
Speaker 2: Okay, so I'm going to start with Elle competed with Vogue and Harper's Bazaar and then InStyle when it came out, InStyle once it was launched [1994].
Speaker 1: But InStyle was not on the same level.
Speaker 2: No.  But Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, that's--that was their chief competition.  And, and it still is.  And in terms of hierarchy, the Publication Director was the chief, the top level of everybody in editorial.  Then it was the editor-- editor-in-chief, that was most of my time there.  executive editor, managing editor, and then directors of departments.  So beauty director, fashion director, features editor, that kind of thing.  And then usually under that there's senior editors, associate editors, assistant editors, editorial assistants.  So I started as an editorial assistant and when I left, I was a senior editor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But there was--was there ever a black person who was in a higher position there?
Speaker 2: Than I, yes, Constance White was at, was at Elle for maybe a year in the '90s [1990s] and she was the executive fashion editor for a time.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you, so you overlapped with--no you--
Speaker 2: I was, I was consulting editor by then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was there, but no, no one has been higher than that there.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see, okay.
Speaker 2: And I was-- Andre Leon Talley but he, he was probably the highest, but nobody's been higher at Vogue and certainly no one at Harper's Bazaar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Amy [DuBois] Barnett was at Harper's Bazaar, but it was not full time and it--she was a--she had a management level position, but I don't think she was there very long at Harper's Bazaar.
Speaker 1: Okay and now Amy's at, she's at Ebony.
Speaker 2: Ebony.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95533
Speaker 1: You said what I was thinking at Elle?  I wanted to do more writing.  I really wanted to be a beauty director.  And I couldn't break through at that point.
Speaker 2: And so what would have--what would a beauty director do?
Speaker 1: Direct the--oversee all of the aspects of the department, not-- the visual, the written, the editorial calendar, all of that, as--and, and manage as well.
Speaker 2: So who were, who were the key beauty directors in New York [New York City, New York] at the time?
Speaker 1: During my tenure at--Felicia Milewicz, Carlotta Jacobson, Lee McCallum [ph.], Mikki Taylor, that was Glamour, Harper's Bazaar, Mademoiselle, Shirley Lord, Andrea Robinson, that's Vogue, then Lesley Jane Seymour.  Those were the main ones when I first started at the big magazines that were our competition.
Story_ID: 95534
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what, so what do you do next?  You leave, you finally leave [Elle], right?
Speaker 2: Okay.  And, and I left because they told me I couldn't write anymore.  And I felt that if I were to go for a job, let's say I went for a job six months later and I had nothing to show for what I was doing, it would not be a good thing.  So I decided to leave.  And without a job, and I did know in terms of social skills, I knew Jean-Louis Ginibre who was the editorial director of all of Hachette and in the U.S. [United States], and David Pecker who was the U.S., so he was the editorial director--David Pecker was the CEO [Chief Executive Officer] of Hachette.  And I saw him in the elevator and--the other reason I left is because once you come in when you start as an assistant and you never move, and you move up incrementally, your raises are very, very small.  So I wasn't even getting the market rate for my job at the time because I was an internal promotion.  And, and they off--they finally offered to, offered it to me, like right before I left.  Cause David Pecker said "offer her the money."  And I saw David Pecker and Jean-Louis in the elevator after I decided to leave.  And David Pecker said "I understand you're leaving."  I said "Yes, I've decided to leave."  And he said, "So you're going to continue to write for the magazine."  And I said "I don't think so, I don't think that, that hasn't been offered to me" is what I intimated.  And I got back to my desk and my desk was a stone's throw away from the editor-in-chief's office.  And he called her.  And five minutes later my--she called me in and said "Of course you're going to write for the magazine."  So I was given a, a contract to be consulting editor.  Well I gave them ideas and I wrote a small article every couple months.  So I got that from there.  And I started freelancing for other people.  One of the people in the Sales Department said there is, "There is a Look Good, Feel Better supplement in Town and Country.  Would you like to write that?  I'm going to put you in touch with, with the person who does that" and I said "yes."  And it was a, it was profiles of women who had survived breast cancer, and that was my first assignment as a freelancer and I started freelance writing after that.  And Mikki started hiring me to write for Essence.  So I started writing articles for Essence.  I wrote for Self magazine, I wrote for--and then I started writing press material for cosmetic companies as well.
Story_ID: 95535
Speaker 1: So what is happening, though?  This is the, this is '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what is happening in the media landscape at this point?  Cause isn't there a proliferation of other magazines occurring?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Before I left, I was looking at some of those new magazines like Wallow is still at Elle.  The YMs of the world, the Taxis of the world, I interviewed at all those places.  But it did become a, a, a larger landscape of innovation.  So Elle wasn't the only innovator.  And it wasn't considered an innovator any more by then cause it's, you know, been around for a while.  It still--and so the landscape--so there were more jobs, I wrote for Sassy magazine and those kinds of things.  Sassy magazine was out as well, and that was a very, very radical in the way that they spoke to young women.  So the, the, the landscape had changed in that way as well.
Speaker 1: But those magazines didn't last that long either.
Speaker 2: No they didn't.
Speaker 1: So you didn't want to be part--well I guess you could--
Speaker 2: Well you know what, the nature of publishing--I was an anomaly to have stayed at a magazine for so long.  But I think that as a black woman, it was difficult to find another job, to really land one.  And so I didn't you know have the option of just taking another job.  And I wanted it to be a good one if I was going from Elle from--to somewhere else.
Story_ID: 95536
Speaker 1: But in that, in that time period Andre [Leon] Talley had become a big force.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, he was the black, or whatever, fashion guru.  So can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I think--I remember, I remember the first Black Girls Coalition.  That was part--and that was a big deal.  I actually won a pair of Manolo Blahniks at an auction that they had, or a gift at a raffle that they did.  I still have those shoes.  But that, that was the first time that black models had gotten together to, to assert themselves in the landscape.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: I want to say '90 [1990], '91 [1991].  But that was [HM] Bethann [Hardison] as well.  And it was a really important time and I also remember--this is, this was really interesting.  That one time we featured in the beauty pages, Gail O'Neill and her sister Denise in a beauty spread.  And we got calls from readers, from black readers that were angry cause they didn't think they were black enough.  Because if they were going to see themselves, they wanted somebody to look more like them.  So there, there was a, there was a challenge there of, of trying to, to meet the need that I don't think we were equipped to, to, to do adequately, or we didn't do adequately.  Because it's not, you know Gail or Denise's fault what they look like, but I guess in casting.  And also the ability to do people's hair correctly on shoots, came into play quite a bit.  So there was a lot of wet slick back looks on black models at Elle.  But the landscape--so Andre Leon Talley did, I mean he was Vogue and he was fashion, so he wasn't really a model--since I was beauty, he wasn't really my world.  He was kind of like up there somewhere.  And somebody I thought you know, I would never meet.  I think beauty people are significantly more approachable than fashion people overall.  Fashion is a little bit more competitive.  Beauty is more collegial because we spend--editors spend a lot of time together.  So it's much easier to reach out to someone.
Story_ID: 95537
Speaker 1: So, so tell me, so explain the, the work that you, the work that you did and--
Speaker 2: At Custom Publishing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So after I had been freelancer for about a year, I got a call from Hachette Custom Publishing and they asked me to come in to talk about this Avada project cause they needed somebody to be the project manager.  And essentially what a project manager does is act as an editor-in-chief for a project.  You get a budget, you hire a staff of freelancers and you create an editorial lineup and make a magazine.  And I made for--I did--I created Environmental Lifestyle Magazine for Aveda.  And then after I did Aveda's magazine, I did a magazine for Mary Kay for I would say the next two years.  But it's a challenge to do something like that because you're working on a branded magazine, you know, and under the auspices of a brand and you're not able to include other brands and particularly that's difficult for beauty.  And you're working really hard and nobody knows what you're working on cause you're not really--so I got burned out.  I burned out of that after a while.  And after, and after that I did a short stint at Ladies' Home Journal and then I went to Mode.
Speaker 1: But then can you talk about what--when you say you're working really hard because you're essentially part of the marketing arm.  You know they have their intern-- turf--
Speaker 2: Now you're gonna ask--I'm sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, but they're trying to satisfy their customers and show the different things that are possible and give tidbits of information, right?
Speaker 2: Well I look at it as--so I am an editor who takes--I actually put together stories.  So I put together let's say seventy pages of edit.  So marketing is not telling me what to do.  The, the client can say we want to highlight these products.  But I have to then create stories and then additional stories.  So on one cover I had Julia Louis-Dreyfus, one cover, and I shot this.  We--and we shot Jane Seymour, went to her house and shot her.  We shot Mel Harris I guess it is, one of the women from Thirtysomething.  We shot a few celebrities for those and we did stories about them as well; try to make it some--give it some editorial focus as well because nobody's going to pick that up on a magazine if they think it's some totally advertising driven.
Speaker 1: And you produced how many of those?
Speaker 2: I, I think I did four for Mary Kay and one for Aveda.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it's different; Aveda--Mary Kay is totally different in some respects, so--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did you--I mean even that's much different than Elle.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, so was there a challenge sort of addressing the, the audience, or did it not matter?
Speaker 2: Well I think--so once I understood who the audience was, then I had to create stories that related to them.  And the writing style would be different.  Elle was all about, you know, the latest, greatest, the science behind stuff.  This is more practical, practical service.  So take away things that you could actually use in your life.  Profiles of people that you might find interesting, so in that way-- The Aveda magazine was really about environmental issues.  Really about environmental for beauty, from a beauty standpoint as well as in life in general.
Speaker 1: Well can you talk about that?  Because this is about the third time that you've mentioned environmental.  And I just would like you to talk about that a little more; about environmental.  Cause you--I don't usually think of beauty with environmental.
Speaker 2: Well Aveda is a company--and this is before it was bought, purchased by Estee Lauder, was founded on, you know, Ayurvedic principles.  So what, what the ingredients in products, and, and sustainability was, was talked about long before that became something, you know in the general, in the general world conversation.  So of course [Horst] Rechelbacher who owned the company was very forward thinking in those--in, in, and use of essential oils and about Ayurvedic principles to live life.  So--and that was not only to--to the health of the body but also the health of the planet.  So that's why the magazine--so talking about issues of--that im--impact the environment were important in that magazine.
Story_ID: 95538
Speaker 1: Now you had talked about in the one instance, you know, customer feedback, you know, as it relates to black models or images.  What other things that you've done that you got--you know you either got positive or negative feedback or was surprised by the feedback?  Can you give some of those?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know at Mode and Heart & Soul particularly, Heart & Soul were--
Speaker 1: I don't want to get to Heart & Soul--
Speaker 2: Okay, those are, those are more consumer driven.  Elle was not that kind of magazine.  Elle--to me there are lots of different kinds of magazines that you can work at.  Some--I remember the editor-in-chief--one of our editor-in-chiefs at Elle, her name was Catherine Ettlinger, said she wanted the voice of the magazine to be "look you dumb reader."  So she wanted to talk to the reader as the voice on high.  And so that doesn't invite as much conversation as other kinds of voices in magazines.  So even Mary Kay, this is like service--we're your friend and here's some service, would invite more feedback.  But since it was custom, I don't get that much feedback.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95539
Speaker 1: So you're saying you got burned out really from doing the custom things.
Speaker 2: Yes, because--so it would be to produce seventy pages of edit in let's say ten weeks with a staff of five people.  For Aveda it was supposed to be twelve weeks and I think it took us seventeen weeks cause we had so many changes.  I worked with a committee of seventeen people at Aveda or something like that, on conference calls where they would want to change this and they want to change that.  So I learned a lot.  In a good way, I mean it was really hard, but I learned a lot.
Speaker 1: Well what did you learn?
Speaker 2: That it's not a good idea to work with a big committee cause too many--and, and that there has to be a point where you have to stop making changes.  You have to be clear about what the vision is of the book.  We've agreed on the vision, so--and that you need to appoint someone if there's a large group like that, to speak for the group as opposed to just listening to lots of people talk, that's counterproductive.  Also how to--I mean to walk the line of trying to create an editorial product with those kinds of challenges; of it being created for a brand I think is especially hard.  And to keep your editorial integrity, because I'm not--if I'm hired by a brand, I'm working for, you know, hired for a brand to copyright, that's one thing.  But if you're hiring me to produce an editorial product, I'm going to produce an editorial product.
Speaker 1: So in this process, did you ever find people who would come from a typical journalism background?  You know and was there competition with them or, or not?  Or did the fact that you had started at Elle have more credibility?
Speaker 2: There are people--well in magazine publishing, there are people with every kind of background, every kind of major, anthropology, sociology.  And then there are the, the general.  I think in fashion and beauty you find more of the anthropology.  In--but there are people who have traditional journal, journalism backgrounds.  I don't think there's competition as much, let's say at this point in my car--at that point in my career, of who's the smartest in the room.  That came a little later.  But that does come at some point.  There--there--people want to assert their intelligence and, and they don't necessarily ever ask what you majored in.  It's just a matter of I want to be known as the smartest person in the room.
Story_ID: 95540
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in--so this--so when do you--the name of your company was Corynne Corbett Creative Communications, so CC--
Speaker 2: Connections.
Speaker 1: Connections, sorry, so CCCC.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, then what happens at that point?
Speaker 2: So I--through that I was doing the, the copyrighting for, I was doing Maybelline, L'Oreal, Christian Dior.  I was doing some product naming, writing some package copy.  I, I named a, a line for--a new line for Black Opal, did that kind of stuff.  And I worked with freelance with Vidal Sassoon to do some events as well.  I knew that that really wasn't what I wanted to do; I've never wanted to really do public relations and I learned that.  And I did that when I wasn't doing the custom publishing stuff, or sometimes at the same time.
Speaker 1: So were you--was your staff--did it work for you, or were you using freelancers?
Speaker 2: For which?
Speaker 1: For, for custom publishing.
Speaker 2: For custom publishing, everything was freelance, everything was freelance and they were in the office.  It was like freelance project basis.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you would bring people to work in the office, but on a project basis.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So did you build up a stable of, of people that you worked with.
Speaker 2: Yes, so, the people that worked on Aveda worked on Mary Kay, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95541
Speaker 1: Okay. So next, what--
Speaker 2: So after that I worked very briefly at Ladies' Home Journal for writing fashion and beauty copy in the office for a few months.  And then I ran into a woman named Abbie Britton on the subway, and she used to be a beauty director.  And we had this collegial thing that when she was on staff and I was freelance, she would give me work and vice versa.  So now she was the editor-in-chief of Mode magazine.  And she said "I want you to come in and talk about a freelance opportunity."  So I came to meet her and to talk about the magazine and I think they had just finished their first issue.  And she came out of her meeting and she came with a stack of work and said this is what I want you to do.  So it was kind of like interview/hire in the same moment.  So she hired me to be the senior editor for fashion and beauty and to write and edit fashion and beauty copy.  Cause there was a beauty person there, so I edited her copy and I wrote all the fashion copy.  And I did that for--one issue was quarterly.  And the executive editor quit and she said how would you like to be the executive editor?  So I became the executive editor of the magazine.  And what was interesting about Mode is because--it was for women size 12 and up.  So it was the first magazine of its kind and it was a fashion magazine.  So it was, it was an interesting place to be at the time and it went from, I think we did quarterly for one year and then we went to monthly.  And I said that I was going to take the job because Abby never stays anywhere and I could be editor-in-chief.  And a year later she left and I became editor-in-chief.
Speaker 1: So you took it knowing that that was going to be the--
Speaker 2: I just, I said it out loud.  That was the one--like I said it out loud, "I'm going to take this job because Abby never stays anywhere."
Story_ID: 95542
Speaker 1: And so, so explain that experience.  Because this--I want you to--if you could provide context for things.  Because isn't this the time also that you know, plus sizes are now--they're coming out of the closet.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, yes.  So context--I think before Mode there was only this store in Manhattan [New York City, New York] called the Forgotten Women and there's like Saks' Salon Z was like a no man, no woman's land.  And then there was Lane Bryant.  And there wasn't anything that seemed stylish or fun and it--and everyone equated plus size with outdated, old--even if you were a young woman.  Like nothing stylish about it.  So what Mode tried to--Mode decided to do was first the average woman in America was--was and is a size 14.  To put context in it and to, and, and to, to realize that these are--this is what real fashion is for real women.  And to, and to highlight the designers who actually do plus sizes.  Cause designers had started to do plus sizes, but there were--people didn't know where to buy--go to buy them.  And stores weren't displaying them properly.  And so this--it sort of--it shifted the way that plus size women were looked at.  And there were plus size models already in the industry because catalogs had been using them for years.  But to, to take these women now and give them high fashion treatment was a radical idea.  And Nancy [Nadler] LeWinter and Julie Lewit [Lewit-Nirenberg] who, who were the publication directors and publishers, had created this idea.  And what Abbie Britton did as the editor was want to think--have women start thinking about dressing their bodies instead of their sizes and loving them, the bodies that they were in.  So creating positive self esteem in women was the whole notion behind--and, and, and knowing that you can be stylish no matter what your size, was the whole notion behind the idea of Mode.  But then to create an opportunity to celebrate this in a very fashionable way was a, was a really, really exciting thing to be part of.
Story_ID: 95543
Speaker 1: And so what did you do when you took over then?  And, and, and what, and where--because there are all kinds of--there's a publisher still.
Speaker 2: Publication director.
Speaker 1: Publications director and, and that person is a--what happened between she and Amy, or--
Speaker 2: Abbie [Britton]?
Speaker 1: Abbie, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: No, Abbie decided to move to California.  Abby had two sons and she wanted to move to California so that her sons could play sports, like organized sports and now her son [Eben Britton] is in the NFL.  So she made a really good decision.  But when I took over, one of the--we started shooting a few more celebrities on the cover once I took over.  We started going after--we had Winona Ryder.  We got Queen Latifah on the cover of Mode and after that, Cover Girl called her.  She had never looked more, more--it, it changed the way the world looked at Queen Latifah when we did that cover.  And somebody said to me recently "I can't believe that Queen Latifah's not thanking you for that cover."  I negotiated I think for a year with her to get her, with someone at her record label to get her.  But I--and it was, it was, I think it was--I think that was the first issue I was actually editor-in chief that we had Queen Latifah.  But I negotiated to get her.  Things didn't change.  What--I, I think the staff changed slightly and we did some things there--we did a Mode model search which was really exciting where we actually searched for--we did a, a nationwide search.  And you know crowned new models.  And a couple of them actually became very well known plus size models because of our search.
Speaker 1: And, what were they--
Speaker 2: One of them, the one of them is Jordan Tesfay.  She became--and she wasn't even the number one winner and she is still working to this day.
Speaker 1: So, so what--can you talk about--were you at the Queen Latifah shoot?
Speaker 2: Yes I was.
Speaker 1: Okay, so can you talk about that?  Cause things can get a little hair--you know hard at those shoots.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a challenge because we had a limited amount of time with her, and we shot with a photographer Marc Baptiste.  And Marc does not like to always follow the rules in terms of how many more shots we can do.  And he kept on pushing and pushing.  And one of the things we wanted to do was make her hair long and straight, add long and straight hair and she didn't really want to do that.  And the hair--the stylist, the fashion stylist, Susan Moses that was working me, told her that it was part of the look that she wanted to create to show the outfit and, and then she agreed to do it.  And then she was happy with that.  And, and she at that point didn't really like a lot of makeup either, but they again explained this is the look we're trying to capture.  So she was quiet for--quiet trying to contemplate the look for some of this at the beginning of it.  Like I'm not sure what these people are doing, not sure I'm gonna like it.  And then when we put her in the, the red outfit that she put on with the--it was a red long duster and a, a red top hat.  And she got in front of that camera and she said oh, I like this.  And started--she started getting into it a little more.  And we got all the shots we needed, we had like three or four cover tries.  Then Marc Baptiste says "I want more and more."  And the publicist is saying "Corynne, tell him to stop."  And he goes to--over to Latifah and says "Can we done more?"  And she says like yeah, "We can do one more, we can do one more."  And it was--it turned out to be great because it, it--I knew--we knew that we wanted her, but we didn't know what we were gonna get.  And it was one of the issues where people really noticed the magazine that maybe hadn't noticed it prior.  And noticed that they had not seen Queen Latifah look so [unclear] before.  Like she was standing in her power.  And, and I was real excited to be a part of that.  It was, it was a little stressful cause she was late.  Like a lot of times when we work with celebrities, you don't know what time they're gonna show up.  And you get there and you wait, you hope that they show up because I've, I've not experienced someone never showing up, but I have experienced after that someone six hours late.  And that not only runs into overtime, but runs into panic cause you might lose some of your, you know your hair and makeup people, depending on who they are, all those kinds of things.  So you never know what's going to happen.
Speaker 1: Cause people don't understand that.  It's a lot of freelancers, they have to be there, you know sometimes people are doing things for credit.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, they're not necessarily getting paid and--
Speaker 2: And then when you're--when you're dealing with women who are not model thin, you generally like to do a fitting, but I don't think we had a fitting with her the day before.  A lot of times with model, with models at Mode we always had a--the day before we had a fitting so we could see how things fit and decide what looked good, what didn't.  But when you have a celebrity, you might be able to do the fitting.  And she was one of the celebrities who we couldn't do a fitting with, so we didn't know how things were going to fit.  And, and, and what we had in mind, whether it was going to work, but it actually did.
Story_ID: 95544
Speaker 1: That's good. So what were--what other stories do you have to share from your Mode experience?  Because this is different, this is the first time you're editor-in-chief and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  It--the--I was so used to saying I was from Elle that I was about to go on television and I introduced myself to the, to the person that introduced as from Elle and somebody--the publicist from Mode was like "Okay, let me bring you back."  But one of the things I--this is the way I learned how--I mean I had learned a little bit from [Hachette] Custom Publishing, but how to really rally a staff.  I think that was--and to nurture staff and to discover new talent.  So I--there was a young lady in--I lived in an apartment building in Brooklyn [New York City, New York].  And there was a young lady who, who, who lived in the building and the super came up to me and said--I lived across the street from Pratt [Institute in New York City, New York].  "You should meet this girl, she just graduated from Pratt, I think she'd be really cool.  You should meet her.  I just think you should meet her."  And so I met her and we talked, her name was Victoria Sanchez-Lincoln.  And we talked and show me her designs, she's a fashion designer.  I said--and she was thinking that she was more interested in trend fest, I mean trend forecasting.  "So well maybe you should come to work with me one day."  So I brought her to work with me and she liked it.  And so she was an intern, she became an intern for a brief amount of time and then we put her on staff.  I think two years later she was a senior editor.  And right now she is the Fashion Director of Real Simple.  She has an eye for detail that is unbelievable.  So to, to find talent that--and talent of people of color, and to be able to put them in positions to win, there's nothing like that for me.  But I also learned--I think I learned the hard way to find my voice.  There are publication directors who are in charge and when I first started out, I was freelance, so I could say whatever I wanted.  And then once I got on staff, sometimes I would be swayed by popular opinion.  But eventually I learned that I had to speak up for myself.  So I think that was a, an important lesson in that space.  And there were a lot of, lot of late nights, a lot of late nights.  And I had to learn how to--I didn't know the value of self care in that job.  I worked, worked really, really crazy hours.  And while I worked there both my parents [LaVerne Henderson Corbett and James Blake Corbett] died while I was working at that job.  So I--
Speaker 1: So they died within eleven months of each other.
Speaker 2: Eleven months.  So my mother died September, '99 [1999].  She got to see the Queen Latifah cover, though, cause I think I had it early.  And my dad August of 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long--Mode had a sh--how long did it exist?
Speaker 2: Till--from '97 [1997] to 2001.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were, you were there almost to the end, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95545
Speaker 1: So were you aware of their--the issues with the sales staff and marketing and you know because that all--so can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: So one of the things--also as an editor-in-chief, I had to do more.  At Elle I did some sales calls with the sales staff and talked to advertisers, but not a lot because I wasn't beauty director.  As editor-in-chief, I went out a lot at Mode and had to speak on behalf of the brand, had to know what the circulation was and you know just how it--and I also became more involved with the American Society of Magazine Editors then.  And got to see, or got to be part of the judging for National Magazine Awards, so I could see what excellence looked like across the magazine spectrum.  And that, that also helped me to make a better magazine for myself.  And the woman who--Marlene Kahan who run, who was the Executive Director of American Society of Magazine Editors, took me under her wing and had me come and do panels and workshops just to get me more acclimated into the, the industry on a management level; to share my expertise as well.  But I was learning a lot from other editors too, which was very, very helpful cause I hadn't done this before.
Speaker 1: And who else is in your space at that point?  Because [HM] Susan Taylor is still at Essence.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but [HM] Monique Greenwood got promoted at the same time I got promoted.  Monique Greenwood was Editor-in-Chief of Essence and Susan had moved to Editorial Director.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So Monique and I got promoted around the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was the two of you really and the--I mean who else?
Speaker 2: And it was--I just--when I was looking through this, I got a letter that said "Now we have two women who are heads of non-black magazines."  But I don't know what the other one was.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so you--how bout your management skills too?  That's--I mean one thing is identifying talent.  You talked about growing talent.  But--
Speaker 2: I had to learn a little bit about--one of the things I did get was some management, like, like some work--I got to go to some workshops.  Because learning how close you can be to the staff, learning how to fire somebody.  Those were all very tough lessons to learn.
Speaker 1: And how large was the staff at Mode?
Speaker 2: About twenty people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the annual budget too?
Speaker 2: I don't even remember.  I would say for, for a shooting, I want to say for the issues, maybe a million.  Cause I would have to do, I would have to do the budget and also be the architect of what everyone said on my staff at the sales meetings to rally the troops.  So that, that was something new too, because I did sales meetings, but I only just had to do the beauty part, but I never had to--like have everybody practice in front of me and like do all of those things.  So I, I learned some valuable skills in terms of that as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95546
Speaker 1: And who were you wanting to be at this point?  That's what I, I guess I'm, I'm wondering.  And, and did anyone fit the Mode space after you left, or did Mode get incorporated into other magazines?
Speaker 2: No.  After I left, Kathy Bishop who had worked with me at Elle, was there as a, a consultant, became the editor-in-chief.  And then it folded.  And then there was another magazine called Grace with some people who worked at Elle, I mean at Mode, worked, which was also a full figure magazine.  But I was wanting--I don't know who I want--I actually loved being editor-in-chief, loved it.  I loved the--and this was a magazine where the, the readers were excited and vibrant.  I remember one--we had a little office across the street--22 East 49th Street I think it was.  And small, small like on top of a deli building, this was our first office.  And you had to lock the elevator, you had to lock everything.  Like pull down the gate kind of building.  And--but when you came to our floor during the day, you get off the elevator, you're in the space.  And we had a receptionist, but you're still in the space.  It was a small office.  And two women one day got off the elevator and said "We're just stopping by to say hi, we love your magazine.  And I'm in town cause it's my birthday and we love Mode magazine, so we just thought we'd stop by."  I'd never seen anything like that before cause you were not--Elle was like a fortress.  You'd never get in there.  And for someone to just come up, come in and just say that they loved the magazine, that was the relationship that we had with our readers.  They loved the magazine; they wanted to be a part of it.  And so when we had events and when we had opportunities to interact with the readers, it was more we're all part of the same community as opposed to "look you do dumb reader."  We're sharing stuff as a friend, and if you have stuff to share with us, we're, we're welcome to that.  You know, we're well--we'd, we'd welcome that.  So that was very different kind of feeling.  And it, and it kind of fuels your--and at the same time we also had a magazine called Girl which is a, a--for multicultural girls.  It was a teen magazine for multicultural girls.  And I didn't work on it for the--I worked on it the last year and a half I was there.  I became the editorial director of that as well as Girl and worked on that as well.  So that was fun.  And so we'd have girls come in.  But one of the things that I instituted in that is have girls come in and do round tables on subjects and talk about issues impacting them.  So that was fun.
Story_ID: 95547
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so, so after Mode was done the, the--it was almost like some of the plus size--even plus size manufacturers couldn't get their stuff in stores anymore.  The, the wave was gone.  I mean there was a magazine called Grace shortly after that ran for a while but it didn't, it didn't last.  And Mode folded because of 9/11 [September 11, 2001]. They were about to be sold and it was German buyers and they were skittish after 9/11 and didn't purchase it.  So that whole category sort of went dormant for a minute.  And it was not, it was, it was sad to see that cause it was very empowering to, to, to see that and to see the choices that were in stores, and then to see that go away.  It was sad, it was very sad.  And then magazines started to pick it up, so Glamour was doing things, mostly Glamour.  I think Glamour did a lot of it.  But magazines like O show women of, of different sizes as well and, and some of the service magazines like Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping started doing that as well.  And, and they may have done it all along, but it became more important because you had--there needed to be places to see women of, of all sizes.  And that be--but then once blogging in the last few years started to become more important, this is one of the categories in which it has become really extremely important to see bloggers talk about the plus size market and to celebrate the plus size market and to celebrate their curves.  So I think, I think that is--it's really good.  There is Maureen Danine [ph.] who does a really good job with her blog.
Speaker 2: Now I-the other--how, how, how large was Mode's circulation and what were its challenges?
Speaker 1: Six hundred thousand.
Speaker 2: So that's small, right?
Speaker 1: Well depends, depends on what--like Time Inc., the Time Inc. model is a million plus.  Six hundred thousand is not bad, but I don't know honestly if it was really a audited 600,000.  So the challenge is, the challenge is when you're independently owned, you're not able to offer the same kind of, of group buys.  You know the business challenges are those kinds of things, you can't offer the group buys and you can't necessarily compete with the Conde Nasts and the Hearsts [Hearst Corperation] of the world, the [unclear], I mean the bigger companies.
Speaker 2: Because they're all--they own a whole series of publications.  So an advertiser can place in a variety of different--
Speaker 1: And also get programs that run across a number of magazines and marketing programs and merchandising programs.  So it--there's no way that you can play against them.  Well you can play against them, but it's, it's a challenge; it's definitely a challenge.
Speaker 2: And their shelf space for the magazine.
Speaker 1: Yes, and getting the right shelf space.  Cause you, you, you have to compete for that as well, especially in supermarkets.  You wanna be above eye level.  And to get, and, and to, to get celebrities or whomever might be appealing on the cover, was the other challenge.  Now we're not necessarily fighting against other magazines for these people, but there's also you know, when Mode was in existence, for some "plus size" was a bad word.  So knowing who might champion that and knowing who might be offended by that, was also important.  Yeah so that's not something you know right off the bat.  So often people say sizism the last bastion of racism, but and in some ways it is because you can't really pinpoint the--go back to size and
Speaker 2: [OFF CAMERA VOICE]
Speaker 1: So sizism is the last bastion of racism cause you can't really tell if--where people are coming from with that and the whole plus size.  So we had some, some instances where people were insulted when we would approach them, so--it was, it was a--definitely a challenge.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I could see.  Cause it's complicated, it depends on how comfortable people feel and, and you were talking about something that people should own up to.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: You know what--
Story_ID: 95548
Speaker 1: So, so what, what, where are you now in your--you know your thoughts about what you want to do.  I mean now I know what--you know what are you--
Speaker 2: 9/11 [September 11, 2001] hadn't happened yet, cause I was at Heart & Soul when 9/11 happened.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I left Mode in February and I was feeling very pressured at the time.  I was, I, I--I was really in a fog cause my parents [LaVerne Henderson Corbett and James Blake Corbett] had died and I was just working to just forget in some ways.  And, and to met--to cope, it was my coping mechanism.  But I was--again, I was burning myself out.  But really while I loved the job, I was not happy in the job.  It was very political as well.  And--
Speaker 1: Political in what way?
Speaker 2: Being--having two bosses that try to--I almost felt like I was being bullied into making some decisions.
Speaker 1: So who were the two bosses?
Speaker 2: Nancy LeWinter and Julie Lewit [Lewit-Nirenberg] in terms of output because they wanted me to fire somebody I didn't want to fire.  So better for her, we should get this new person in who eventually took my job.  And my thinking in retrospect is they wanted this new person to be in, learn everything from me and then push me out.  And I really thought a long, hard about it and, and since they wanted to make changes, I said "You know you should start at the top and I think I'm going to resign."  Because I didn't want to fire my number two.  And they couldn't fire her after I left because they needed her.  And--but I felt like I couldn't--like when I said before I needed to find my voice.  It was--my voice was getting lost and I felt pushed against the wall, and I didn't really like that.  So I, I told my boss--I, I, I--before my father died I said "I'd rather work at McDonald's than to be in this position."  So I just, I just decided to get out of there.
Story_ID: 95549
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then so what do you do after that?  Because--
Speaker 2: I go into--I went to Vanguarde [Media].
Speaker 1: So how did you find out about Vanguarde?
Speaker 2: Because of Len Burnett [HM Leonard Burnett, Jr.] worked--his girlfriend was one of my best friends at the time.  And I think I had actually spoken to him about, you know opportunities before that.  So--
Speaker 1: Now who's this?
Speaker 2: Len Burnett was the--one of the founders of Vanguarde.  So I had spoken with Len just in passing about the business and he was dating one of my girlfriends at the time.  And, and then they had a party for something and I talked to Keith at that party as well.
Speaker 1: You have to say names.
Speaker 2: [HM] Keith Clinkscales.  I talked to Keith Clinkscales at the party they had for--must have been for Uptown [sic, Savoy] magazine.  So I went to that part and, and I--and [HM] Roy Johnson and I have a--had a little pact.  We know a lot of people in common.  So he called me to talk about a position there.  And it was the editor-in-chief of Heart & Soul.  So I accepted that position.  Probably a month after I left Mode.  And it was--so it was a, a, a totally different culture.  The first time I worked at a magazine that was directed towards people that looked like me, for black women, and it was a different culture and it was more a familial atmosphere.  And it was--I didn't have to second guess what somebody was saying.  Sometimes at Mode I thought people were talking in code.  Like they're saying something, but they really weren't saying it, it was like passive/aggressive.  They wouldn't say what they meant, so I'd have to like decode it.  And I had to be careful what I put in writing. There, everything need--like I didn't have to worry about any of that.  I could just do my job.  The challenge was that it was the, the company was challenged by you know, lack of financing, though.  So, but I loved that job.  It was--I had a very, very small staff and a very small budget, but we were able to create a magazine that really helped women to, to live better lives.  And I thought that was really important.
Story_ID: 95550
Speaker 1: And in the midst of that, 9/11 [September 11, 2001] happened.  Like my first year there [Heart & Soul].  And it was--I went to the gym that morning and I think the first plane hit [the World Trade Center] while I was in the locker room at the gym getting ready.  And I was training.  And my trainer and I were watching it on the--and then the second plane hit and we're watching it on television and we're like not sure what's happening.  It was just like I was in a fog, in a daze.  And I think I had driven to Manhattan [New York City, New York] that morning from Brooklyn.  I lived in Brooklyn at the time.  And I--so I went to the office and I couldn't get home, all the bridges and tunnels were closed.  So I was in the office for a number of hours and one of my friends' daughters went to school, went to a private school near me.  I went to the school and picked her up and brought her to my office.  Had to wait for her mother to get--be able to drive downtown to get her and for them to get to Brooklyn.  And it was the eeriest thing.  There was National Guards on the street and she was in middle school at the time, and she was very frightened, going on--had to comfort her.  And then the people who weren't able to get home were all in the office together, we were all in the conference room together.  And you know, holding each other up.  And it was--I'm so glad that, that I was there with them at that point.  And when I was able to--once Emma Jordan-Simpson picked up her daughter Candace, I drove--I was able to drive home and two of my--I drove two of my colleagues with.  So we made sure that everybody got home with someone.  So I took two of my colleagues home.  And we probably did like a three borough tour cause we couldn't get through like--some bridges were closed, some tunnels were--so I think we went--had to go all the uptown and go to Queens [New York City, New York] and then come around to go to Brooklyn.  So it was like a--and every 9/11 Michelle James and Erica Pittman send me a note on Facebook thanking me for taking them home.  It was like--but and we're bonded to this day from that moment.
Story_ID: 95551
Speaker 1: And I have to say though, though the company [Vanguarde Media] was challenged by money, I do feel like I was respected for, for my, my abilities there, for the job that I did.  And, and, and that gave me confidence to, to do more and to believe in myself and, and I, I was sad when it folded.  I was really, really sad, but we, we got to do--we got to--one of the things I wanted to do while I was at Heart & Soul had always been a health and fitness magazine.  But for some reason people thought of it as homework.  And I wanted to make taking care of yourself more--if I had to do it through entertainment, whatever way I needed to do to get women to be excited about taking care of themselves.  I thought it was necessary.
Speaker 2: So tell--you need to provide context for the publications.  I mean who started it, what was the vision, your--
Speaker 1: So I came to Vanguarde after it started.  So Vanguarde was started by [HM] Keith Clinkscales who had been at--who helped to start Vibe with [HM] Quincy Jones and he was on the business side.  And Keith and, Keith Clinkscales and Len Burnett [HM Leonard Burnett, Jr.] had before that had had a small publication of their own that they started.  And when Keith decided it was time to go to start his own thing, and he quit and he bought a trade publication and he bought Honey magazine.  And they started with the trade publication, I can't remember the name of it right now.  And Honey with an editor and the staff.  And then they started--then they launched a new magazine called Uptown [sic, Savoy] which [HM] Roy Johnson became the editor of.  And [HM] Harriette Cole worked there at the time.  And then they were in partnership with--they started Uptown [sic, Savoy] without, without having a partnership first with BET [Black Entertainment Television] with their publications.  So there was it was Emerge and Heart & Soul with the BET publication.  And they took Emerge, the Emerge list and changed that to Uptown [sic, Savoy].  Cause Emerge I don't think was publishing at the time.  And then they brought Heart & Soul, they moved that to New York.  So it was being published in Washington, DC and they brought, brought it to, to New York as me as the editor.  Cause [HM] Yanick Rice-Lamb didn't want to move to New York [New York City, New York].  So I think they may have started in 2000 and I came in 2001.
Story_ID: 95552
Speaker 1: It was young men living you know, men--there, there, there were the, the Black Enterprises of the world Essence of the world, so the, the Lewis family and Ed Lewis [HM Edward Lewis] and Clarence Smith, and--
Speaker 2: That was, that was a--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that was Essence and then the, the Graves family [HM Earl G. Graves, Sr. and HM Earl "Butch" Graves, Jr.].
Speaker 2: The Graves family which is--
Speaker 1: Black Enterprise.  So these are the, the older generation of men doing their thing.  They wanted to be the young bucks coming up.  [unclear] new, new, new hip relevant magazines.
Speaker 2: But isn't this interesting that all men?
Speaker 1: It is.
Speaker 2: I mean in some respects, okay and no women.  But, but having women sort of, you know as--I mean you have to if you have a women's publication--
Speaker 1: Right, but it is, it is interesting.  And that's across every--I don't--it doesn't matter what na--the only person, only magazine I can think of that had a woman is Latina when it first started, Christy Haubegger.  And, and--
Speaker 2: And then there's O Magazine.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah but that's--she brought that to Hearst, it's not the same.  Hearst doesn't have any women anymore.  Like in the management, decision makers.  I mean Susan is--
Speaker 2: Susan was
Speaker 1: [HM] Susan Taylor was the last I, I think powerful woman because that, that really had clout.  I mean Martha Nelson is just left--I mean this is 2013, Martha Nelson is--was the editor-in-chief of Time, Inc. for six months and now she's gone.  So at Time, Inc. now there are no high ranking women in management.
Story_ID: 95553
Speaker 1: So when you--so can you describe Keith Clinks--I mean at the time who was [HM] Keith Clinkscales, who's [HM] Roy Johnson.  You know you need to--you know--
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is describing.  Vanguarde [Media] was like a party and Keith was like--Keith and Len [HM Leonard Burnett, Jr.] and Gary Lewis who was in marketing, they were like--
Speaker 1: Can you describe each of them?
Speaker 2: Yes, so Keith is tall and lanky with wavy hair.
Speaker 1: But I don't mean descry--person--
Speaker 2: Personality.
Speaker 1: And background.
Speaker 2: Personality, so Keith is--gives it to you short and sweet.  You have Keith for two minutes, make the most of it.  So here's what I learned.  When you work at women's magazines you have to make a flowery picture, put a bow on it, talk.  With Keith, get to the point.  "This is what I want, this is what I need, this is what I need and this is the timeframe, and this is what you're gonna get from it."  That's all he has time for or else his legs start shaking like he's impatient, he's on to the next.  He wants a good idea and he's gonna also challenge you to make it better.  So for me, he would always say "Essence covers are always whiny.  Here's why you can't get a man, here's why--you need a--here's why you need a man, here's why you can't get a man, here's where all your problems are.  That's what Essence's cover line is.  What are you gonna give me?"  So if any of my cover lines said that, he was like "Oh, here's why you can't get a man cover line."  So in a funny way, but he was very, very smart about what the consumer needs, even if he's not a woman.  And what the market needs to be fresh and he, and he really, really thought that it needed to be a really--you stand in your opinion of what it is.  But really an opinion of empowerment.  So Heart & Soul was that, every woman magazine.  Honey was the sexy, young magazine.  Hip, young, sexy, fun magazine for younger women, which Amy [DuBois] Barnett was the editor of.  And then Roy Johnson was the editor of Uptown [sic, Savoy] which was your sophisticated black Vanity Fair.  But Roy was also the editor, editorial director of the other magazines as well.  So Keith was that person and Roy was the day-to-day boss that you go to to talk about ideas, make sure things are making editorial sense, look at your balance, call you on your budget, those kinds of things.  Len Burnett who was Keith's partner, was the salesman in the room, the spinmeister.  He could sell your grandmother, you know, some land somewhere.  I mean spin like no one could believe.  And, and in a good way.  I mean he was--but sometimes I felt like he was spinning me, like, you know like telling me stories.  I was like "Okay, what's the truth?  Where's the truth?"
Story_ID: 95554
Speaker 1: And then when [HM] Roy [Johnson] left, Ron Stodghill came as the editor of Uptown [sic, Savoy] and he was a good partner in terms of being able to bounce ideas off of and that kind of thing.  And the--and Gary Lewis who did the marketing, was like Merlin the magician, you know.  Putting together like big events and their keyword, everything had to be "sexy."  And there were a whole lot of parties.  But Heart & Soul wasn't the party brand.  So it was a--there was a challenge cause sometimes they would forget to invite me to stuff.  So September 11th [2001], a lot of people weren't in the office because on September 10th, Honey had a party that night.  And I didn't know anything about the party until September 10th.  And it was funny because they heard that I didn't know about the party and they were trying to get me to go and I was like I don't have anything wear, my hair's not done, I'm not going.  And Gary came to my room, in my office with--on his knees, "please, please come to the party."  Nope, I'm not coming.  So if I had been at the party, I probably wouldn't have been in the office on September 11th, but that was a, a really interesting dynamic.
Speaker 2: I think also--so you--what, when does-Honey, you're saying, was started by whom originally?
Speaker 1: Honey was started by Kierna Mayo and Jocelyn Dingle with Harris Publications a few years prior.
Speaker 2: So and we're talking 2000.
Speaker 1: So I would say '98 [1998] they started.
Speaker 2: So '98 [1998], and--
Speaker 1: Something like that, maybe '96 [1996].  They called me, they called me and asked me to work on it probably '96 [1996], '97 [1997].  They probably hadn't started it yet.  But they did own it.  When they went--when they weren't--Stanley Harris of Harris Publication---when they went into business with him, I think he owned it.  And then he sold it to Vanguarde [Media].
Speaker 2: Now who started Vanguarde?  See that's--
Speaker 1: Keith.
Speaker 2: Keith started Vanguarde.
Speaker 1: [HM] Keith Clinkscales.
Speaker 2: And how did--because this was very--the start was very flashy.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Because he had been with Vibe with [HM] Quincy Jones.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then what happened at Vibe?  I, I'm just trying to--
Speaker 1: Nothing happened.  He just wanted to--he--
Speaker 2: Wanted to expand?
Speaker 1: He wanted to have something of his own and he thought he needed to do it before he was forty.  So he set out to do this and raised capital.
Speaker 2: How much did he raise?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.  I wasn't there at the beginning.
Speaker 2: Okay, but then you--how large was your budget?  You said it was a small budget.
Speaker 1: It was a small budget.  I would say it was probably, it was less than, it was less than a half a million.
Speaker 2: Cause some people say that he was so busy partying, which is-- and that he didn't take business seriously.  And okay so I just want to--
Speaker 1: So I'm going to say this.  When I say that the--I, I said the Vanguarde culture was a party.  And it was a party before I got there, and the party went on too long and then they had to--by the time I got there, they were in a little bit of a reality state.  That they had spent a lot of money in that first year, too much money.  And now they had to, to cut--recalibrate, let's say.  There was still parties. As I said that--
Speaker 2: What kind of parties?  These were launch parties, these were marketing parties.
Speaker 1: You name it, there was a party.
Speaker 2: Like--you have to be more explicit.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the--there were parties for you know, a certain--like a cover model on Honey.  There were parties for, for, for trade shows.  I can't remember the name of the trade magazine.  If I knew that--they would do parties for the events that--events that they did.  So they did special events.  There were Uptown, like Uptown Hollywood parties.  There were, not Uptown, Savoy, Savoy Hollywood parties.  Uptown is Len's [HM Leonard Burnett, Jr.] now.  So Savoy is the name of the [unclear].
Speaker 2: You keep--you were talking about Uptown, but it's really Savoy that you've been meaning--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You've been meaning to talk about.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been meaning to say it was Savoy, so I need--do I need to say it again?
Speaker 2: Yes you do.
Story_ID: 95555
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so Vanguarde, I wish I could remember the name of that--so anyway Vanguarde was-when Vanguarde was founded, it started-[HM] Keith [Clinkscales] bought an industry--a music insider industry publication.  He bought Honey from Harris Publications, and he purchased--he went into partnership with BET to start with--to run their publication Heart & Soul and Emerge, which they turned into Savoy.  [HM] Roy Johnson became the editor of Savoy and turned that into a black Vanity Fair.  And so the parties that the--the party culture for, for Vanguarde was related to industry events, music events, Hollywood events, and celebrities in general.  And then for Heart & Soul we were, we would partner with Black Enterprise on the golf and tennis event, Heart & Soul would be the sponsor of the spa part.  So there were lots and lots and lots of parties.  And by the time I got there, there was lots of parties before I got there, but at the time I got there, there was a rude awakening.  I mean I think we were funded mostly by Provender Capital [Group].  And so sometimes Fred Terrell [HM Frederick Terrell] would be in our editorial meetings just to see what was going on.  And we ran a little leaner.  So my budget--I think everybody's budget got smaller as a result of that.  And then after 9/11 [September 11, 2001] we had to lay off because I, I only had like eight people on my staff.  We had to lay off a few people each because times got harder to get advertising.  And the, the atmosphere like they did love to party, but the, the work got done too.  That's cause we stayed there all hours of the night.  Again, I had another job where I stayed all hours of the night.  That changes eventually, but all hours of the night.  And so the first issue after 9/11, I remember this cause I had an issue to close after 9/11.  And the, and Iman, and Iman [Abdulmajid] was supposed to be on the cover.  And they were supplying a photograph as opposed to a shooting, but it was so high fashion and unapproachable, and they wouldn't let us retouch it.  So then I was left without a cover story and a cover.  And I had to find a new cover.  And I had to close the issue out say in three days, in the week following 9/11.  And me and two of my people from my staff, stayed in the office maybe three--for 36 hours straight, 36 hours to get it out.  And we ended up getting photos, exclusive photos of Cynda Lewis [sic, Cynda Williams] who was from "Mo' Better Blues" with her baby, and we put that on the cover.  But we had to do all of that at the very, very last minute.  Cause we had to make the printer, so we couldn't go home.  And I used to--I drove to work cause sometimes I would work so late that I didn't want to even be in a cab.  But one time--there were a couple times that I left work at like six in the morning and I just left my car cause I was so tired I couldn't see.  Took a cab home, laid down for an hour, took a shower and then came back to work. It was crazy. A little crazy.
Speaker 2: So when you said that--
Speaker 1: And I loved it. It's crazy--
Story_ID: 98170
Speaker 1: --of that group.  Did Roy John--
Speaker 2: Yes, Roy [HM Roy Johnson] absolutely.  Roy knew publishing.  I mean [HM] Keith [Clinkscales] knows publishing, but--and so does Len [HM Leonard Burnett, Jr.], but the, the--
Speaker 1: What was Len's role?
Speaker 2: Len was the Ad Director.
Speaker 1: Ad Director, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Len Burnett definitely knew publishing.  And you know they knew--but how to run a business, everybody's got a learning curve on that.  Because you get money and then you spend money when you don't know how much money's gone come in.  And you don't know the market is gonna collapse.  It, it's--it was a challenge.
Story_ID: 98171
Speaker 1: So when you were talking about the cover for Iman [Abdulmajid] was too high fashion.
Speaker 2: She had black eyeliner all around her eyes, like ring, like it looked like rings around her eyes.  Thick black liner, hair was really straight and she looked really--it didn't look inviting.  It looked really high fashion, wasn't really our brand.  We couldn't use it.  And I was like, "Well it would work if we could take that out"--and they were like "No you can't."  And I was like oh, no.  So we couldn't use it.  And that--you know usually we would shoot our own covers, but that was an instance where we thought we had Iman, hey, and she'll have a picture, it'll be great.  Well it wasn't something we could use.
Speaker 1: So someone else had shot it and they were providing the cover, and so that was gonna be cheaper.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: To get her, okay, okay I just wanted to understand that--.
Speaker 2: Yes, cheaper and economical since we were always working on a budget.  And the cover is the most expensive thing to shoot.  So I'd shoot--we'd, I mean we'd use some pickup art, but I had a photo editor who had to be really, really strategic.  So we had to figure out if we were going to spend more on photography than we had to write some stuff in-house and maybe not assign as much out, always had to balance that.
Story_ID: 98172
Speaker 1: So you served in that role two years, right?
Speaker 2: It was almost three by the time I left.
Speaker 1: Almost three, okay, okay.  And so what--so everybody is still there the whole time.  That's what I'm trying to understand and how, how--
Speaker 2: Amy left to go to Teen People.  So Amy [DuBois] Barnett left to go to Teen People 2002 maybe, end of 2002, maybe early 2003.  And then [HM] Michaela Angela Davis became the editor of Honey.  Then [HM] Roy [Johnson] went back to Sports Illustrated and Ron Stodghill became the editor of Savoy editor-in-chief of Savoy.
Speaker 1: And what--can you share some other stories?  Because this--what you had said before was this is the first place that I found, you know it was totally different.
Speaker 2: It was totally different because it was--okay so Thanksgiving they have a family style Thanksgiving.  People would bring in food.  And the day, you know the couple days before Thanksgiving, we have like this feast in the conference room that went on all into the night.  What else was different?  Really informal.  People strolled into your office.  I, I'm, I, I came from a very formal background.  Strolled in your office.  And it was very social.  So you couldn't tell when work ended and social began.  And it was--guys sat around and talked about playing golf a lot.  We got a lot done on the golf course, so they talked about playing golf a lot, the men.  And--
Speaker 1: So really--
Speaker 2: I, but you know it, it's, it is--and I, I guess "hot and sexy" was the name of the game.  Like it really was like "is it hot, is it sexy" was a lot--those words for everything.  And my staff sat in one big room, probably twice the size of this room, bout six people sat in it and grinded.  I sat really far away from them in an office, but I was in that room a lot and they got a lot done. And then celebrities would stop by and hold court in the office.  That happens at Essence too, but it's a little formalized, but hold court in the office, come by, hang out.
Speaker 1: Like who?
Speaker 2: I remember I brought two teenagers from my church to, to work with me one day and Mo'Nique [Monique Hicks] stopped by.  And they--and they were--I think I gave them some makeup, so they were playing with the makeup in the bathroom and I told them to go into the office to get something and went in there and they screamed like--they were fifteen at the time.  But like giddy girls, so excited that they had this opportunity.  They took pictures with her and they were really excited by it.  That one I really remember.  But people would come by and Erykah Badu was the one who was six hours late to a cover shoot.  I was just so angry I couldn't even--I went by the cover shoot at like 8:00 at night and she had just gotten there maybe an hour or two earlier.  And they were like "You wanna take a picture with her?"  And I was like "No thank you."  Okay.  It was, it was--I couldn't believe--I had heard that those things happen and that's the by-culture where those kinds of things happen when you work with those--I, for me that had never happened before.  I just had no concept of that.
Story_ID: 98173
Speaker 1: And since money was tight, sometimes your paycheck--you had to worry about your paycheck.  Not that it wasn't gonna come, but we'd get emails that said okay don't--you got a direct deposit, but you're gonna get a live check at 5:00.  That's when you know you might--have to think about your job.  And Roy, you know [HM] Roy Johnson was--had left and was at Sports Illustrated so he called me up and he said okay, we got to think about your next move.  I want you to think about your next move.  I want you to come in to Time, Inc. and meet with Isolde Motley.  We're gonna have lunch and, and I want you to meet with Isolde first.  So I came in and met Isolde Motley who was one of the editorial directors at Time, Inc.  And I met her and we talked a bit about my background, etc.  And then a few months later I had tea with her and, and she said "So we should talk about when do you think you wanna move.  When, when do you think you're ready to move on" and I was "I don't wanna leave my staff."  And she said "I think you've done all you can do at that magazine and you have to think about your next move."  And I think a few months later we folded.  Like I was already thinking, it was like January, but we folded in November.  So I had already started talking to Time, Inc. about other opportunities before Heart & Soul and Vanguarde [Media] went under.  But I did, I mean I really--
Speaker 2: You loved the--I hear (unclear)
Speaker 1: I liked the staff, I liked the staff.  I liked my staff.  I didn't like the, you know the circumstances weren't ideal, but I did really like the, the staff of people I worked with.  Felt like I identified some of the people and, and some of them I worked with again, it was really funny, so--
Speaker 2: So do you think really if it had been better managed, it would have been a different situation.
Speaker 1: Probably, probably.
Story_ID: 98174
Speaker 1: Well what do you think those publications--'cause they did--I mean they did make their way into the media landscape.  They weren't a blip.  Emerge was a more troubled story.
Speaker 2: Right, right, but Savoy I thought was, I thought was on its way to doing something.  I thought it was really interesting, it was a smart publication.  Honey under Amy [DuBois Barnett] was really good.  Under [HM] Michaela [Angela Davis] I thought it was a different sensibility, but I thought it was really good.  I thought Time, Inc. should have bought Honey when Vanguarde went under, instead of launching--in my opinion, Time, Inc. should have bought Honey and its list and never launched Suede cause Honey would have still been around.
Speaker 1: That's true because Suede didn't last but a moment.
Speaker 2: It was--it had no identification with the audience, my opinion.  That--so--but it was also when you look at small place, I had worked at Mode too.  When you have--when you're not owned by a corporation and people are running it, you have personalities influencing things in a way.  Like at Mode, they'd have the handyman from the, from the building do the painting in our office and do their painting in their house and there was no, there was no lines of demarcation, and there were no boundaries.  So it, it's very different from a Time, Inc. or a Hachette sensibility.  And having spent--I spent nearly ten--from eight years on staff and then with Custom Publishing, ten, eleven years getting a check from Hachette.  Very different from being in a, like a mom and mom, or mom and pop kind of situation.  I think there's freedom in a small publication, I liked it.  I, I liked, I liked that part of it.  I didn't like the long hours, but I did like the--I liked my staff definitely.  I didn't feel--like I think what I liked about is that I didn't feel that pushed against the wall feeling that I had at Mode.  I felt like I was saved from that.
Speaker 1: Pushed against the wall kind of feeling.
Speaker 2: Like--
Speaker 1: Beat up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you felt in a more nurturing environment.
Speaker 2: Not nurtured, but free.
Speaker 1: Free, okay.  And then it's around black people.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're, you know it's a whole different proposition.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's around black people and there's some freedom to that.  But then sometimes it needs to be some boundaries in that as well, so.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 98175
Speaker 1: So now what happens then?  So you--it, it folds actually before you think it's gonna fold.
Speaker 2: So it folds--well I did get warning.  I did get warning that it was--
Speaker 1: Who, who gave you warning?
Speaker 2: Ron Stodghill told me it was about to go under.
Speaker 1: And who's Ron Stodghill?
Speaker 2: He, Ron Stodghill was the editor-in-chief in chief of Savoy.  And he said "Look, my people on the street are telling me, you know, my people in finance are telling me it doesn't look like we gone make it to the end of the year."  I said "Oh, okay."  And I called in sick, and the day I called in sick, they called everybody in the conference room and told them they were folding.  [HM] Keith [Clinkscales] called me an hour before and said "I'm about to tell everybody we're over."  I was like oh--I wanna come in tomorrow and talk to my staff.  He said "No, we're over today."  It's over.  I was like wow.  I was shocked.  And I, and I felt really badly that I wasn't there.  And, and I think that then we just came in and packed up our stuff and left.  That was my first experience working at a company that went bankrupt.
Speaker 1: And then what happened after that then?
Speaker 2: I--my philosophy was go with the--since it was in the paper and everybody knew, go with the tide of everybody knowing.  I reached out to Isolde Motley and Bucky Keady at Time, Inc. and I think I--so that happened right around Thanksgiving [2003].  I was--I had a meeting in December at Time, Inc. and then I had a--my job for--interviews at Real Simple in January.
Story_ID: 98176
Speaker 1: So it--you didn't--you weren't out too long, okay.
Speaker 2: I started at Real Simple in February.
Speaker 1: So talk about Real Simple.
Speaker 2: Okay, Real Simple--everything that those last two jobs were, all the jobs I've talked about where I've stayed all hours of the night, this is the first job that I worked at that I went home, I left the office at 6:00 cause everybody else did too.  I didn't know what to do with myself.  I come home and I said this is what it's like to have a life.  I couldn't believe it.  I said what do you do when you get home at seven?  I really had never had that.  It was--
Speaker 1: Talk about the concepts.
Speaker 2: So the concept of Real Simple is, is making life easier.
Speaker 1: Now this, this, this is 2000--I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: Two thousand and four [2004].  So, so Vanguarde folded at the end of 2003.
Speaker 1: So even after September 11 [2001], Vanguarde still--you stayed in there.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I started [at Vanguarde Media] in February of 2001 and it folded in November of 2003.  In February of 2004 I started at Real Simple.  And like a huge staff, like seventy-five people or something in Editorial alone.  And I was the beauty and wellness director.  And it, it--the challenge was when you're an editor-in-chief, in you have to think like this.  You're thinking about everything, every little thing.  And then I had to go from here to like think about this piece right here.  These are your pages, these are the things you have to do.  And it was, it was a hard adjustment to be involved in everything and then be involved in one thing.  But Kristin van Ogtrop who was the managing editor, which is the equivalent of an editor-in-chief at Time, Inc., was really great about giving me extra, she always gave me extra assignments.  Like gave me opportunities to do other things because I would get my work done really quickly.  But I discovered that I loved pilates while I got this, once I got this job.  I started doing pilates on the machine.  And so I would leave work at lke 5:30 and go to pilates, make vacation plans and do things like that.  So I started living the philosophy of the magazine is that your life can be easier if you follow some systems and you can save money, save time and make your life infinitely better if you--and, and what was really great about the magazine is that the editor lived the philosophy.  She was out the door at 5:30, she had family, she went home to have dinner with her kids and her husband.  And so that--so you adjust top-down.  So you get the work done in the time that you're there as opposed to when I worked at Elle and they went out to lunch for hours at a time and it was a, it was a very, very different.  So that was my second tour of duty, duty in beauty.  So I'd been an editor-in-chief for like seven years I hadn't been in beauty.  So I went back to beauty and it was, it was like going home.  Took a while, but it was like going home.  And getting back in the swing of going back to press events and that kind of stuff.  So it became fun again, and going on shoots.  When you're editor-in-chief, you stop by the shoot, you don't necessarily have to produce it and be there all day.  And so that was--it was, it was really, really good.  But the writing was a challenge there cause it was layers upon layers of editors.  But the writing style was not natural to me.  The kind of writing and the way that they explained things, the, the stories they told as part of it-weren't part of my life experience.  Like--so in other words, felt really white compared to Heart & Soul but even more--it didn't feel like--so and it was a little New England patrician feeling.  That's the kind of voice of the magazine.  So it's not warm and cozy.  I'm like a warm and fuzzy girl.  So that was a challenge to write in that.  So I would edit more than I wrote cause I, I really couldn't get the hang of it.  I got the hang of it.  I, I mean I knew what needed to be done, but it didn't come naturally to me.  So I didn't need to write, so I didn't write.  I did a--my job wasn't that of a writer so I didn't have to write.  My--the person that worked for me, Elizabeth Graves, she wrote like that naturally, so it was perfect.  And so I did that job for about--in the--I did that job for about a year and a half.
Story_ID: 98177
Speaker 1: And then one day Kristin [van Ogtrop] came into my office and asked, and, and told me she wanted to promote me to executive editor.  I, I was shocked.  And there were two executive editors, myself and, and a gentleman named Jim Baker.  And one of the things that was great about--when they--when I was hired at Real Simple, or when I went for the interview, Kristin was hired, had been hired at the same time that Amy [DuBois] Barnett was hired at Teen People, Kristin was hired at Real Simple.  And what the person in HR [Human Resources] said to me is that "We wanna build a really strong team around Kristin cause this is the first time she's been--run a magazine.  So we're looking for really strong people who can take direction and, and can be part of the team, but help her grow as well."  And so when the executive editor left, he was from the last regime, she promoted someone she had brought over from Glamour, Jim and myself to executive editor.  And I was--he was more on copy, I was on staff development.  So I did all the hiring and identified people for promotion.  And then I looked over--and then I oversaw Fashion, Beauty and Food; those departments.  And he oversaw the rest.  But he, he was the ultimate last word in copy before her as well.  So that was really good.  And I worked on the Real Simple television show as one of the editorial liaisons.  So I got to look at scripts and look at the--we had a show on PBS [Public Broadcasting Service], and then we did a development deal with TLC [The Learning Channel] and I worked on the, on putting that together as well.  So I got to do some really--things out of the box that I had never done before.  And one of the, one of the things I really liked about working at Time, Inc. is I had never worked anywhere where they were forward thinking.  So I got there in 2004, they were talking about, they were talking about 2005 when I got there.  We'll be five years old in 2005, what should we be doing?  And I was like "You're talking about next year already?"  And they would talk about, you know, things two and three years in advance because that's how organized the brand was.  And as in turn, the company was.  So that was an interesting adjustment too, to see that when you're at a very, very large company and Hachette is a large company too, but it was, it's French so a little bit emotional the way that they make decisions.  This was really pure business play.  And the fact that they create magazines or invest in magazines that have a circulation of a million plus only is, is their strength.  They want to create very big brands.  I had not seen that before.
Story_ID: 98178
Speaker 1: But it's interesting that--but we were at the beginning of the media apocalypse.
Speaker 2: Right, we had no idea, no idea of the media apocalypse.  But--
Speaker 1: Was gonna happen and, I mean is, is--now who's at Time, Inc.?  Is, is, is Dick Parsons [HM Richard Parsons] there?
Speaker 2: Time Warner?  No.  At Time Warner, Dick Parsons is still at Time Warner then.
Speaker 1: He's at Time Warner, okay.
Speaker 2: Norman Pearlstine was, was the editor-in-chief.  And--
Speaker 1: But Time Inc. is part of--
Speaker 2: Time Warner.
Speaker 1: Warner, right.
Speaker 2: But we're not in Time Warner Building, we're in--the Time, Inc. building is separate.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so--and I'm trying to remember who--and, and, and, and--what was her last name now?  It'll come to me.  But it was run by this--so it was-why can't I think of the woman's name? It'll come to me.  They--it's, it's ver--and Time, Inc. is very much church and state, very, very much.  And brand run very much on, on their own.
Speaker 1: Individually.
Speaker 2: Individually, yes.  And so I was in, in, in--and really engrossed, but I, I also got to do a lot of stuff with HR [Human Resources] in terms of staff development for minorities.  I worked on--I was like the liaison for National Association of Black Journalists, like the editorial lead to help develop whatever panels we were coming up with for NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] and I was on that committee.  And I was on the committee for Unity, those kinds of things. So it--they--I had time to do all that and then work on the television show as well.
Story_ID: 98179
Speaker 1: So the--how did the television show come about?  I mean how did those things--
Speaker 2: There was--
Speaker 1: So you had the television show for, for the Learning Channel and--
Speaker 2: Well first the PB--there was one season of PBS and then there was one season of The Learning Channel [TLC].  The PBS came about when they were the first president of the brand was there.  They were trying to find the right partner.  And because Real Simple is, you know, then they didn't really want to tout brands as very, very--it was almost like Consumer Reports in terms of the testing that we had to do, and that kind of thing. Sexier than Consumer Reports and more beautifully laid out.  But that rigor of looking at things, so it--they never wanted to seem too invested in advertisers.  So they, they thought PBS was a good partner and had three hosts, one of them was African American.  And they did both human interest, like soul-y kind of stories, practical, food demonstrations, like a mix like the magazine was.  But it was a little--it was not, not a little, it was very quiet and a little too quiet that you might fall asleep, that kind of--it was really, really a soft sell in, in--so it lasted for a season.  It was, it was too quiet.
Speaker 1: Who hosted it?
Speaker 2: Three hosts.
Speaker 1: You said, one black and two white.
Speaker 2: The, the black host's name was Cydnee [Welburn], I don't know her last-- Cydnee and Rob [Keefe] and I don't remember the last person's name [Dena Querubin-Blizzard].  And they would come to our sales meetings and present as well.  But, but one of the things about Real Simple is that it had at that time it launched a TV show, international editions in Japan, South Africa and Greece.  A books division, this was all under--and so Kristin [van Ogtrop] had a lot going on.  So Jim [Baker] eventually got promoted to like Development Director to oversee all of the other aspects.
Speaker 1: But how did she end up getting the job in the first place?
Speaker 2: Who, Kristin?
Speaker 1: Yes, if they said well they just want to surround her with strong people, what was her role?
Speaker 2: She came--she was an executive editor at Glamour.  So I don't know.  She's very much--she's still there.  She's been there for ten years.  She-
Story_ID: 98180
Speaker 1: So Real Simple still, still active and involved, you know, out there.  I never heard of the publication, I--
Speaker 2: Real Simple is, it's, it's--it never has a person on the cover.  It always has a still life.  It is--and the November and December issues are super thick even in bad economy.  It's, it is, it is definitely a sense of--it's a psychographic more than a demo.  And women who love it, who love organizing and we love organizing (unclear), they are at focus groups.  I have seen women pet the magazine like--it's like their friend.  They wait at the mailbox for this magazine.  Has a huge fan base.  And, and she really does embody the brand.  And, and, and is very smart and, and I learned a lot.  I mean she's--I, I really stay in touch with her to this day cause she's a great--she's great and genuine leader.  Like, I've worked for people who you can't believe anything they say, but I can believe what she said cause it's what you see is what you get.  And I really--you know that's, that's a nice thing to have in a boss.
Speaker 1: Means that you don't have to guess at things.
Speaker 2: You don't have to guess, not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 98181
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so what happened then?
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: You stayed there, but the apocalypse, even--
Speaker 2: I'm, so--this is how the apocalypse happens at Time, Inc.  So I told you there was seventy-five people on--in the editorial staff.  And in 2008--well in 2007 they did their first round of layoffs.  Very, very few people were impacted in editorial and things went on.  In 2008 they said oh--but what they would do is cut back the budget or at Time, Inc. they had something called "cost per page."  So how much, how much does it cost to produce each page.  And that's how you budget the magazine.  And they started lowering the cost, cutting the cost per page, slashing the budget that way.  Then continuing to slash the budget and then they came--and we'd have meetings about the changes and we'd have executive meetings.  The staff, the, the, the executive staff of the magazine would have meetings about how things were changing.  And we had a meeting where we were told we had to slash like I don't know, a million dollars off the payroll or some, something like that.  And I said how you gonna do that?  And we started discussing, you know, who might be up for elimination.  And I went out to coffee with Jim who was, who was--Jim Baker who was--used to be my co-executive editor, and was no longer.  He had been promoted.  And we were talking about some shifts that were happening in his department.  And I said "I think I'm gonna get laid off because there's no way that the people that we're discussing will add up to the money that we need to cut."  He said "I don't think-- Where'd you hear that? I don't think that's true."  "I just have a feeling I'm gonna be laid off."  And a couple weeks later she [Kristin van Ogtrop] came to my office and told me that she had to eliminate my position.  And, and if you can do it in a good way, she did because she told me way before she told anybody else on the staff that--she gave me weeks to adjust.  And then to, to work out, you know my exit.  And then they made the other adjustments.  But I was like "they're not talking to me."  Cause I would have had to make all of the adjustments and talk to all the staff that was leaving.  And I wasn't--I didn't remember being in, in anymore meetings.  I was like "I think I'm gonna be laid off."  And I was, but I was like wow.  But before that I had--so that was November.
Story_ID: 98182
Speaker 1: In March or April [2008] it was like I kind of miss--one of the things about Heart & Soul I liked was that people would come up to the--meet on the street and talk about what they liked about the magazine.  They would see me and say "Hey, I like this, I don't like that."  One time I was in Victoria's Secret buying underwear and this woman came up to me and started talking to me.  I'm on the bus, I'm on the subway.  People really--and I would, I did a lot of speaking when I worked at Heart & Soul, right.  At least once a month I was on the road somewhere speaking to groups of women, etc.  Speaking at conferences, and that kind of thing, and I really enjoyed that because I got to engage with the reader.  They were very involved readership, very passionate about the book.  So, so that was really interesting.  And I didn't--I missed that.  I missed it.  So that's when I started my blog--I decided I was like oh, I miss writing too cause I was as an executive editor, I was pure management.  My whole day was in the building.  All my meetings were with people from the company or from the magazine.  And I said I need to do something more, so I started with the blog that--first I started "That Black Girl Blogging" and I said I wanna make it a website.  So I made "That Black Girl Site," started doing that.  And so when she [Kristin van Ogtrop] laid me off, she said "Well what do you think you want to do?"  I said I think I'm gonna work on my site full time, and I showed it to her and she was like "Wow. That's really good."  And at the same time they had redone the Real Simple website.  And you had--they asked staffers to audition to blog on that, to write sample posts.  And I, I had been accepted to start writing on that blog as well and I had been doing that for a number of months.  So I was writing on the Real Simple blog and hosting my own blog while I was working there.  And then when I left, I continued to work on the Real Simple blog and my own.  So I got involved more on the new media, new digital side.
Story_ID: 95569
Speaker 1: So, so talk about that--okay, talk about who Real Simple--
Speaker 2: So Real Simple attracts a, a specific kind of mindset.  They're women who really have little time--who want more time in their day.  So they wanna get dinner on the table quickly, they wanna dress quickly.  They're not--I mean they're interested in trends, but they are not driven by trends.  They wanna look good, but they don't wanna spend all their money on clothes or beauty or vacations.  They want, they want to think, they want to, they want to work and live smarter in any way possible.  And they like their life to be as organized as possible, or they aspire to that place.  So they may not have an organized house, but in their head one day they'll get there.  So they live--and so they're always looking for ways to achieve that goal.  So Real Simple gives them tip upon tip in an elegant way.  So they also want to entertain and, and be crafty but not in a crunchy granola kind of way.  Be more crafty like one, one year we did a Christmas party at Real Simple.  And we didn't--and this was one of the years where there was no budget.  But Real Simple had its own photo studio down on Hudson Street.  So I was in charge of the committee and we had a, a Style Department, a Styles Department.  But it's not like a Fashion Department.  The Style Department was responsible for propping and making all of the still life shoots and tablescapes and all these things, look beautiful.  So you have all these props and so forth.  We took a raw studio and they created a--with, with little to no budget, just went into the closet and created like nice lighting and tables and all this stuff.  So we created that sort of the stuff.  And part of the, part of the, the, the, the Christmas party was there was a table, a holiday celebration, there was a table where you could make your own gift tags.  And that's what Real Simple was about.  Like little ideas like that, like you could stamp or--like ways to make things easier and maybe cheaper, but still look really creative, but still has a little touch of elegance to it.  So the magazine really attracts that kind of person.
Speaker 1: Its, its demo [demographics]--talk about its demo audience.
Speaker 2: Demo, it, it--most of the, most of the readers are white.  There is a small percentage I would say, less than ten percent of readers are black women.  But those--but those black women that do read it are very, very passionate about these things.  Mid-40s and high household income for a magazine.  At what point I think it was like $90,000, which is high for a magazine, you know a magazine about home.  And--but they're really, really passionate about this organization area.
Speaker 1: So were they--did they do events?  How did they interact-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with their--and that's what I wanna understand them, you know cause I think of Black Enterprise where their events became, you know, maybe even stronger than the publication.
Speaker 2: Right, see Real Simple the publication is stronger than their events.  There are events, there was one, one event that Caroline, Caroline Kennedy did. They did the biggest yard sale in Central Park [New York City, New York] the first year I was there.  Then they did a holiday extravaganza in Grand--they took over Grand Central Station one day.  Lately they've been doing--in the last few years they're doing pop-up shops.  And then they--and but for a couple of years they also did mall tours all over the city [New York City, New York] where they would take--they would use, utilize the stores and, and, and, and show people how to shop in a Real Simple way, do they get like the best of Real Simple.  Like we pick these gifts, these are the--this is the best way to holiday dress, those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: So were they doing those internally?  Were the writers actually--who, who would do those?
Speaker 2: There was a black woman that works at Real Simple, well she now works in the Lifestyle Group named Tamara Stewart.  And she put together all of those events, and she is a marketing person, and she is amazing.  She now does it for all of the Lifestyle Group.
Story_ID: 95570
Speaker 1: So talk about what is happening in the media landscape, and starting when because--
Speaker 2: Post 9/11 [September 11, 2001] the media landscape changed crazy.  So when I worked at Elle, Elle was the heyday I would say of magazine world.  Trips all over.  I went to France, I would say twice a year for the eight years I worked there.  Plus I went to Italy--I went everywhere but Asia.  I didn't go to Asia or Australia, I went everywhere else.  I mean I went to Finland.  I mean so that kind of--so I traveled all the time.  Car service everywhere.  Lavish parties and etc.  Then it started to shift a little bit, then when you work at a small magazine, there's no budget to do anything.  But there's still parties and stuff, but there's no elaborate travel or anything.  Then 9/11 happened and everything got smaller in terms of mindset.  And at the same point, not only was the economy affected, but the advertising landscape started to change because a lot of the advertising dollars started to shift online.  And with that shift became a shift in the kind of jobs available.  So at Vanguarde [Media] for example, we had both print staff and online staff that worked, that we had to have, you know in, in that count of eight people.  Somebody had to work on, on the online portion of it as well.  And when I got to Real Simple, there was a--one of, one of the people that worked for me, Nancy Hawley at--who is my managing editor at Real Simple was very--there very briefly, cause she got hired as Real Simple's web director.  She was in charge of realsimple.com, so she went over to Real Simple and she was there before I got there.  And she ran realsimple.com and they had maybe a staff of seven or eight even then.  But the advertising dollars started to shift.  But what was happening is that big publishing companies didn't know how to monetize--to figure out how to monetize and make a, a, a big impact in profit from the money going to online.  Because it's a different kind of money.  It's not like the same money that you spend on print.  So as a result, that's when the, the layoffs started to happen cause they were seeing that they're spending the same amount of money on print, but they're not getting--there was diminished returns, so we had to start looking at staff and you know, seventy-five people were on staff at Real Simple.  That's a lot of people.  Even though there's a lot of pages at Real Simple, and there's a lot of research and a lot of testing.  But they still had to cut down.  So the first--in 2007 they started with the cuts at Time, Inc., and Real Simple wasn't really impacted.  In 2008 and when I got laid off, we--they were impacted.  In 2008, 2009 and 2012 they had layoffs.  So now they no longer have a staff of seventy-five, they probably have a staff of thirty-five, in edit, thirty.
Story_ID: 95571
Speaker 1: And so it's shifting, but at the same time the online presence has grown.  And the other thing is that the way that print staff is paid versus digital, not the same.  So--but everybody needs the digital--so no journalist or anybody who is working in, in media today can be a purely print editor and think that they can survive.  You must have some digital skills.  So when I got laid off from Real Simple, it was really a good thing that I got to hone my editorial skills.  I went to--I, I went to conferences like there is something called PodCamp (unclear), well PodCamp, where you learn all about podcasting and vlogging, video blogs and in addition to the--that kind of thing, as well as blogging.  I joined meet-up groups so I could get to know some other bloggers.  I joined Word, I went to something called WordCamp which is done by WordPress that teaches you more about the plug-ins and some of the things you need to know to, to make your blog better.  So I, I took advantage of those things during the fifteen months I was not working full time.  I did some copyrighting for some cos--some beauty clients.  But I wanted to get a job in digital, but I didn't have the--I didn't--the salaries were really, really different.  So if they asked me to put my old salary down I think the sticker shock was scary to a lot of people.  And I didn't know just how vastly different for a while, the salaries were.  But in the meantime, I was gaining all this experience, which was, which was really good.  And I started something called "That Black Girl Radio Show."  I did some interviews doing that as well.  So I expanded what I would have done had I still been on staff.  I made the, the blog a little bit more robust.
Story_ID: 95572
Speaker 1: And I did it every day and I got to speak at some blogging conferences.  I went to BlogHer, which is the biggest blogging conference for women.  They have something called Community, the Community Keynote.  And in 2009 I entered it with a post about Michelle Obama, Michelle Obama's hair.  There was somebody who wrote and I wrote a reaction to this woman, this white woman who wrote about how Michelle Obama should have an afro and how you know, and how [HM President] Barack Obama's hair was plain.  And just the things, the nuances they didn't get.  So you had to--there were nineteen of us in over two hours.  We had to get up and present--give, give our community keynote and talk about it.  And I--my--the category I was chosen in was opinions.  So I, I, I shocked them when I actually read it out loud.  People were like I can't believe you went there, but that's what I wrote on my blog.
Speaker 2: So talk about what you wrote.
Speaker 1: That, that when a white woman writes about a black woman's hair, she doesn't really know, understand the perspective on which--which, from what she's talking about.  I talked about even saying that Barack Obama's hair--the, the--I don't know if he was President yet, yeah he was President.  President Obama's hair was plain is not to understand what black men go through at the barber shop to get the line just right in their hair.  It's, it's precision, it's not plain, it is, it is a choice in how they do their hair and they spend the time in the barber shop weekly to maintain the look.  And when it is off, the world is over for them.  And I think I, I, I mentioned in it that my--one of my little cousins who was like twenty-something at the time got his hair cut by someone different and he went around to everybody asking if they thought the line was off.  Like is that line off?  And I talked about that, that this is--that natural hair is, is, is, is not just--you can't just decide to have natural hair one day.  And that it's a decision and, and that we can't force someone to have natural hair just cause you think it's a good fashion choice.  So--and I think the woman was Italian, so she also didn't, didn't understand the black culture.
Speaker 2: So what happened as a result of that?
Speaker 1: That I, that I wrote it?  Nothing.  I got like good feedback.  I've written a lot--I mean when I was writing every, every day and then I wrote a lot about the reactions to Michelle Obama.  Her arms, her hair, that, that, that for us to, to--she is the first, the first, first lady that has been deconstructed for her physical appearance in a way that is totally unfair.
Story_ID: 95573
Speaker 1: So you, you--but in the meantime you're learning about the new media space.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, which--what, what are else you were learning about the new media space?
Speaker 2: How to engage with the--how to engage with the reader.  How often you have to--how often you must engage with them.  And it's not just about your blog or whatever, that you must be an authentic part of the community at large that's happening.  So I got involved on Twitter more and just started to understand what was happening in that landscape overall, particularly among, among blacks.  Because there's a strong black web presence and also finding the time of day where people react to you.  And mine was after 11:00 at night, somehow.  That's when I did my best writing and I got the best reactions from people.  I posted, you know I wrote at night and it posted during the day but when I was on Twitter on interacting people, it was mostly at night.
Speaker 1: So are you--cause people get home, they get from work, then they sit down and there's a looking through everything.  I think, I think--'cause I've heard that.
Story_ID: 95574
Speaker 1: But I want to ask--so I want, I want to go to Essence next, which is more recent.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So how did Essence come, come about?
Speaker 2: I got a call from Angela Burt-Murray.  Angela and I worked together at Vanguarde [Media].  And she asked me if I would consider doing beauty again.
Speaker 1: Now what was her role at Vanguarde?
Speaker 2: At Vanguarde she was executive director when Amy [DuBois] Barnett was editor-in-chief of Honey.  And when Amy went to Teen People, Angela went with her and took on a similar role--she took a--I think she went in as a senior editor, but eventually became executive editor there.  So she--and then while I was at Real Simple, she became editor-in-chief of Essence in 2005.  So she called me and asked me if I considered doing beauty.  And I said "Hadn't thought about it, but let me give it some thought."  She said "Okay, I'm gonna give you a call back in a week or so."  She called me back and said--she said "Would you want to go back in the market," would you--cause this all--it's a different mindset.  I said yeah, I think I could come up with a story--I was more concerned do I know enough about what's happening in terms of trends and stuff.  Could I come up with story ideas.  And I looked into it and I said "Oh yeah, I think I could do this again."  She said "Okay, I have an opportunity here.  I'd like you to come and freelance.  Would you be interested in doing that?"  And I said "Yeah."  So in March of 2010, I went to Essence and one of--Pamela Edwards [Christiani] was going to People magazine as the--she was the senior beauty editor and she was going to be the fashion and beauty editor at People magazine.  And I was there for about a week, or not even a week and then it was announced that Mikki was retiring from her position as beauty director at Essence, Mikki Taylor.  And then everybody said "that's why you're here" cause they--I guess that's what we couldn't-somebody said "That's what we couldn't tell you when we called."  I was like okay.  So I freelanced in Mikki's job after she left for a couple of months and I interviewed for the job and I got the job and I started officially in May of 2010.  And one of the things that, that changed while I was there was that you know fashion and beauty had been all in one section and, and, and what Angela had--no, beauty and hair had been all in one section.  And what Angela had noticed is that there was an opportunity to create two separate sections and that she wanted to create a strong hair presence, strong black hair presence.  And she thought that was a very strong both argument for readers and for advertisers to do that.  So she wanted me to create that and to just reinvigorate and change the, the way that beauty was being looked at.  And so I, I re-envisioned the section and also the other thing that was happening is that they were doing a special hair issue, a freestanding issue, like a thirteenth issue which she wanted me to oversee.  So I did that and that's when the next round of late nights came.  But it was a really great experience because we really got to get in-depth about black hair.  Not just natural hair, but all about, about care, about weaves, about wigs, about relaxers, about all the things that we talk about.  And we got great reaction, a really, really, really strong reaction from that.
Story_ID: 95575
Speaker 1: So after--shortly thereafter working on that though, that was in the Fall of 2010, Angela [Burt-Murray] announced that she was leaving.  And we had about six months of no editor-in-chief.  We had [HM] Sheryl Hilliard Tucker as the interim editor-in-chief, but we had no official leader.  So it was a little weird to be there then.  But the pages were still--we still had a lot of--we had about 12 beauty pages, 12 to 18 beauty pages in an issue.  So that kept me busy.  And after Constance, then Constance White was named in March of 2011 as the editor-in-chief.  And she came in and another market down, I guess it's another market downturn because we started losing pages, editorial pages started dwindling and the beauty, the beauty and hair pages were impacted by that.  And so it started to become a challenge to actually do things in the--and Constance's vision was not the same as Angela's in terms of her seeing beauty and hair as very important anchors in the magazine.  So it was a different mindset.  So had to adjust to that as well.  And as stuff was impacting--the number of pages started getting smaller and smaller.
Speaker 2: Down to what?
Speaker 1: In one issue I think there were like three or four pages, or one issue there was two.  And that--and the advertising for, for Essence, fifty percent of the advertising comes from the beauty and hair category.  So for it not to have that kind of presence, then I don't know what the story--how you were saying that we are the leader in this if we're not showcasing it.  That's just my opinion.  But I, I think it, it, it was an adjustment to the market, but the ad dollars going online, so--it did change dramatically.  But we did a second hot hair issue, it was called Essence Hot Hair.  We did one for 2011 as well.  And Tasha Turner and Marcia Caster were my staff.  We put that together.  And that wasn't as well received as the first one, but, but we did a good job on it; it still came together.  There was some talk about the first one not being Essence branded; they didn't feel like it was Essence branded because it had too many pictures.  But it was the one that was dog-eared at the hair salon more than the second one.  So it was a matter of do we make it look pretty, or do you make it info packed.  And I think we made it pretty and info packed, but the first one really hit home more than the second one.  But they couldn't really--what, from what I understand the--they couldn't get traction with the hair advertisers to really invest in it so they didn't keep it after this 2011.
Story_ID: 95576
Speaker 1: And, and one of the things that we did work in tandem with the advertising, not the advertising, essence.com, and we did a all beauty all access video web series.  And so between--and Tia Williams--that was the essence.com beauty editor on time, at that time so what I used to, to tell them is that they should understand that they have Elle, InStyle, Glamour, Real Simple between the three of us, we had worked at both major, big magazines as well as Essence and that they should utilize that as a selling point.  And--but we did this beauty all access video and it was three days a week.  So it was one--so each--either myself, Tia or Tasha [Turner].  And we did those for a good year and a half, almost two years of videos.  And then we went down to like one a week cause I think it was getting too expensive.  But I never knew, cause we never got like readings on how, how many people watched it, but that was another instance where people would--I was one time after working out, getting a pedicure and one of the women walked by and said "I know you cause I watch your videos."  And that Fashion Week people would come up to me and, and mention that they watched the videos too, so I was "Okay, that's good."  But I really, I really thought it was important to change some notions at Essence.  So you know there's all these ideas, "black don't crack, we don't age."  But the truth is that black skin does age, it just ages differently.  So tell that story and to educate the reader about it, was like a really modern way to say "Okay, so you could say that so black don't crack, but it sags, it loses elasticity.  These are the things--you get dark circles, you get dark marks.  Like there are things that happen to your skin that you should understand."  So I was able to really think about that.  And one of the things that we did do while I was there which I thought was really important is we changed--all magazines have beauty awards but we created a, a beauty award that recognized products that was specifically created with us in mind.  But do they work with us in mind.  Do they--and, and what's their point of difference and really blow it out and test them.  And the first year we did that, it was a success.  The second year in 2012 we did it, we actually had an awards ceremony and we honored five or six, five, five categories of individuals who had made an impact in the beauty industry.  And what was interesting about that was that they said--Ted Gibson was one of them.  And he said he had--this was more important to him than any other honor that he'd ever gotten.  And to recognize the talent in the community was really, really important.  Lisa Logan who is a, a nail artist who's also--who's, who's known for doing Beyonce's [Beyonce Knowles-Carter]] nails, but also owns her own business, said she brought her daughter who's twenty-one so that she would understand that Mommy does more than nails.  And that--the business they're in, that they are in, that she is in, does a lot to uplift women.  And that "Now you know what Mommy does when you see Mommy get this award, you get it."  That was really important to me to do.
Story_ID: 95577
Speaker 1: So what happened at Essence then?
Speaker 2: So the--so the 2013, next round of lay--so we got a new CEO, Laura Lang.  And she--we were supposed to have layoffs in November of 2012, and they pushed it to 2013, the beginning of 2013.  And when I was laid off, so was the creative director of the magazine.  So they laid me off, the creative director off, and the photo editor off with the 2013 layoffs in January.  And then shortly thereafter Constance [White] left.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Constance had come in--what happened--you didn't mention a Michael Bullerdick.  You didn't mention anything about--
Speaker 2: Michael came in July, he came in 2012, he came in--
Speaker 1: 2-11 [2011], 2011.
Speaker 2: He came in 2011, okay, that was interesting.  Michael was--
Speaker 1: Were you there at that point?
Speaker 2: I was, I was.  The, the--what was interesting about Constance's tenure is we might not know somebody was coming to work there until they showed up that day.  And such was the case with Michael who-- we came back from Essence Music Festival and there he was.  And he really was tasked with putting the magazine on schedule cause apparently it wasn't on schedule.  It was tough.  His, his style was a challenge, really a challenge.  We butted heads a lot cause he told me he heard I was always late.  I said "Who told you that?"  And then he told me one--told me somebody that I knew from another magazine in the building.  Somebody from Real Simple said it.  And I said "You know what?  You don't understand that these people are my friends and I can just ask them."  Like trying to pit people against each other.  It was, it was really, really difficult, difficult for a while.  Then it calmed down.  But then his opinions came to light.  And once they did, he was shortly gone, he was gone shortly thereafter.  It was, it was kind of quick.
Speaker 1: But he was--it was controversial because he was--
Speaker 2: Of his hire.  I mean so two controversies while I was at Essence was the fact that we had the first ever white fashion director, Ellianna Plocas, and, and then, and then in July--and then when Constance [White] got there, she hired in addition to that, Michael.  Michael was really about deadlines.  He wasn't about content.  But Ellianna was content.  And that--you know it is--if you decide to--this is my opinion.  If you decide to hire somebody, better be ready to go to the wall with your decision and be ready to fight for it; can't be quiet about it and let people come after you.  That's my opinion.  But it was a challenge.
Speaker 1: So Constance was--
Speaker 2: No, that was Angela [Burt-Murray], Angela hired him.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And, and I think there was a lot of ire after she--to say the least, she got a lot of flak for that.
Story_ID: 95578
Speaker 1: And I liked what they had to say about their methodology.  I had been coached before and everything.  And then so I went in January, but in June I decided I was gonna just bite the bullet and send some money on some coaching, and I did their coaching crash course.  And it helped me just start getting a handle on what I really wanted to do.  I felt like I needed to figure on that's next sooner rather than later.  And once when I was at--I've always been mentoring people, especially when I was at Real Simple, I did--interviewed people all day long.  And people were always asking my advice about breaking into this and breaking into that.  So I was at a--when I was at Essence, I was at Erno Laszlo which is a beauty company, and I met a young lady, she was an intern.  And you know, you know the, the morays of when you're in the office and you see somebody and you just nod and, and I, I nodded at her and she was an intern, so she didn't want to come and interrupt the meeting.  But she saw me.  And she went down to the lobby and waited for me.  And she said she really wanted to talk to me cause she wanted some advice on breaking into the beauty business.  So I talked to her and I gave her my information and in the cab back to my office I said I need to formalize this because I need to figure out how to help more people do that.  So when I was doing this co--doing the coaching period, I did the crash course and then I did an intensive, like a five month period.  And my coach and the group leader helped me kind of hone what that is.  So what I think, what I--my goals is to do is to help multicultural beauty professionals succeed in every area of the business and in every stage of their career.  And that's what the Beauty Swirl is.  But what happened when I got laid off from, from Essence was that I said "Hey, I think I want to start with teenagers.  I wanna start exposing young women to the areas that are available in beauty for them to follow a career path in."  So I created Beauty Biz Camp.  And I ran the first session this summer [2013].  So it is a three--it was a three week program, so I just started with a summer session.  For 2014 I'm going to expand.  But it's a three week program where they looked at first behind the beauty, here are the different areas so behind the magazine.  This is what a magazine editor does, behind a blog, at a blog, this is what a blogger does.  This is how celebrity fragrance is made.  So I had people from the industry come in and talk about what they do.  So the first day they learned the lifecycle of a celebrity fragrance from inception to counter.  They learned what a vlogger does, they learned what a magazine editor does, how they, how they got there.  How a, a small beauty company made its own products.  Like every detail, marketing--and then the next week behind the products, how a product--how you think of a product and then how--what's a great idea for a product all the way to how does it get to counter and how do you market it, how do you do publicity.  Every day you learn something different, so people like [HM] Lisa Price from Carol's Daughter came out.  Eva Valentine who worked on the Justin Bieber, who worked with the company who does Justin Bieber's fragrance came out.  People from Clinique.  I had a broad range.  And then the third week was behind the glam.  This is what happens at a fashion show, this is what happens at a photo shoot, and we actually did a photo shoot.  Marc Baptiste who did the Queen Latifah cover [at Mode], came and did a photo shoot.  And they--and I divided the girls up into you're hair, you're makeup, you're art direction.  You stay in your teams, you stay with your profession, you see what happens.  And a woman--the woman who won "The Face" [TV show on Oxygen], Devyn [Abdullah] was one of the models, we had three models of different ethnicities so that we could--and so they could learn the different aspects of it.
Speaker 2: And it was well received.
Speaker 1: It was well received, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: So is that where you are?  So tell me where you are in your life.
Speaker 1: So, so right now in my life I'm, I'm--I really am focusing on both the Beauty Swirl and Beauty Biz Camp.  And I also in addition to that since I've left Essence, I've just finished a project with Clinique where I was their Facebook beauty expert.  And in addition to writing Facebook posts and being--and giving multicultural women advice about beauty and particularly about the products in the Clinique line, I did a live stream.  I hosted a live stream show for them talking about some breakthroughs and answering specifically questions from multicultural women about how to use products and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 95579
Speaker 1: So what do you think the whole beauty landscape--let's start with the, the media landscape for, for a black woman.  'Cause you know when you were talking about [HM] Susan Taylor, that was sort of the pinnacle of Essence, you know.  And so where, where are things, you know, because--and even magazine pub--so I want to talk about media events specifically magazine, and then I want to move into the, the minorities space and beauty.
Speaker 2: So media, so this is the media is, is changing significantly and everybody is shifting.  So I, I--in January before I got laid off, Felicia Milewicz after forty some odd years at Conde Nast, left and she was most recently beauty director at Glamour.  And at her dinner, there was a farewell dinner that some editors were--and some--and Maybelline gave her.  And we--she said to me "You have to start thinking about what's next.  The landscape is changing and they're not gonna wanna to pay your salary."  And I said "I already thought of it."  She said "wait till get fired."  Two weeks later, I'm laid off.  So--and, and it has happened to a number of other colleagues in the media.  That the--it's shifting.  Everyone is narrowing down their staffs.  If you're very senior, you have to adjust to what's there and you have to figure out what do you want to do, what do you wanna do next.  And, and do you wanna do online.  And do you have the online skills?  I, I'm grateful that I do know a lot about online, but I'm also very senior.  A lot of the people are young, so I have to figure out what, what's my value proposition here and what's the skill set.  So in, in, in thinking about what my next move is, media has become--a part of the land--but not the biggest part of it.  Just because the way that media--the direction it's going, I don't see that as viable for me right now.  Unless I started my own magazine or something like that I'm really not, I'm not interested in that, even if it's an online magazine.  So I, I think that I'm shifting gears in terms of I'd like to write and edit and empower the next generation to do great things.
Speaker 1: So you want to really sort of be--or do you ever go and be part of--and go back to Parson's I mean or--I mean Pratt [Institute in New York City, New York], Pratt, sorry. Parsons? Pratt.
Speaker 2: Would I go to Pratt?  I--would I go back to Pratt?  To be part of the faculty?
Speaker 1: Mmhmm.
Speaker 2: I would have to get a master's or Ph.D. to actually make a livable wage.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So you're, you're--but you wanna serve in that capacity.
Story_ID: 95580
Speaker 1: I want to talk about what is, what is media now?  I mean in some respects because there are a lot of people trying to do it--
Speaker 2: Well, media has become very democratic.  And citizen journalism is, is, is a--we're not gonna ever leave that now, bloggers, vloggers.  And particularly in the style and beauty space, they're here to stay.  And the-but, what challenges me about that bloggers and vloggers and--is the intersection that, that they--a lot of people are in it, not everyone, for the deals that they make and the, the deals that they can make with brands, brand ambassador.  But coming from a journalistic background.
Speaker 1: What does, what does that mean?  I've heard that vloggers can get paid $40,000.
Speaker 2: To represent somebody and talk about something and yeah.  They can get paid to align with a brand, tweet on their behalf, make personal appearances, host an event on their behalf.  And that--but then if I'm--if I've been--I'm coming from the back when I do journalist background, it's a little--there's a gray area that I'm not so comfortable with in terms of representing somebody's brand and then stating my own opinion and where do they meld and can they be separate.  I mean FCC [Federal Communications Commission] is involved in this, FTC [Federal Trade Commission] I guess and, and what bloggers do have to disclose if they got the products for free and that kind of thing.  But I'm not sure that everyone is doing that.  But they are here to stay and, and brands like working in this manner.  They're always looking at who they can align with and, and I'm not ex--I'm not as excited about doing that.  And I feel like the people that are already in that space already own it and I'm just--I don't, I can't differentiate myself from them.
Speaker 1: So who owns it now?
Speaker 2: I mean the, there's, there's so many bloggers.  I mean but the bloggers who've been doing it for years and years are, are--have made, have made an impact.  And so for me to start now, That Black Girls Site, I particularly didn't write a lot about beauty, I'll start writing more about beauty now, but I don't know if I want to review products as my job.
Speaker 1: But who, who was doing a lot of important work you think in the, in the--
Speaker 2: In the blogosphere?  Afrobella is one of, one of my favorites.  "What About Our Daughters", I mean if we're gonna talk about just important work, calling people out on stuff, there is a site called "What About Our Daughters" which is a little controversial, but she does call, she calls BET [Black Entertainment Television] on how they, they're misogynistic and, and not so woman friendly stances on things.  And--
Speaker 1: Who does that?
Speaker 2: Her first name is Gina [McCauley], I can't think of her last name right now.  She's an attorney out of Texas.  And "What About Our Daughters" I think is, is, is one of the better sites.  Afrobella for beauty.  Natural hair is a big thing.  So she is one of the first people to do it and she does it very well, and she does beauty as well.  I'm talking about black bloggers in particular.  "This That Beauty" is another one.  She--Afrobella is Patrice [Grell] Yursik and "This That Beauty" is--why am I blanking her last name?  Felicia [Walker Benson].
Story_ID: 95581
Speaker 1: Who do you think is gonna emerge and who's important I guess is what I'm saying because you have your traditional publications that are struggling.
Speaker 2: Well I think what's gonna happen is that the landscapers now has to create a space where everyone is learning together.  And that a magazine has to differentiate themselves from the people that are speaking to their audience daily.  So a brand now has to--one of the people who think I think does it well is The Atlantic has learned to take their magazine brand and their online brand and to create a--the online entity, and create a brand that speaks daily on the subjects that are important to them.  Because you have to live in a space where the cy--the news cycle is so short that you have to bring something different to the table by the time--If you're going to put, cover something in print.  You have to bring a different spin, an in depth look at something because they may already know that news, or a different story altogether.  So you have to look at the way that you're reporting.  You can't report in the same way that you once did.  I think that--I think that that is critical to how media--and you have to, you have to recognize that the audience-- and the audience of let's say people 35 and younger, I would even say 40 and younger, look to bloggers and look to online for their information.  So how can you play in that, in that sandbox well?  So, so--
Speaker 1: So it's almost like traditional media has to follow the blogs.
Speaker 2: Or has, or has to innovate in that way.
Speaker 1: Has to, has to innovate in that way.  So do you see who's doing that well because--
Speaker 2: Besides The Atlantic, no.  Atlantic is the one that does it the best.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that's not in the minority female space.
Speaker 2: Ebony, I like Ebony's website.  When, when it first re-launched I thought it was good.
Speaker 1: Someone just sent me-Okay, I won't be on camera saying that.  But someone just sent me an article and it was like so sleazy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I said when it first re-launched.  For me, Essence is too entertainment-driven.  It's like a black people magazine dot com.  And I think it needs to have a little heft in some way.  Huffington Post: Black Voices I like.  It could be, but it's Huffington Post, it's not--I don't think we're there yet in, in, in the black space.  I mean-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95582
Speaker 1: So what, what about the area of beauty?  What are your feelings about this time right now for black beauty care, subject matter?  Is this an exciting time?  You know what are your--you've seen, you, you know you've been in the beauty space for what, forty years?
Speaker 2: No, I've been in the beauty space for--
Speaker 1: Well thirty years.
Speaker 2: Thirty.
Speaker 1: Thirty.
Speaker 2: Almost thirty.
Speaker 1: Right, no it's been--
Speaker 2: Eighty five [1985].
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970].
Speaker 2: Eighty five [1985].
Speaker 1: I mean in the beauty space, not black beauty space.
Speaker 2: Eighty five [1985].
Speaker 1: Eighty five [1985], okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So not quite 30, almost, 28.  So I think that the beauty space since 1985 has changed dramatically.  That everybody knows that they need to talk to all women and both brands and publications.  Some do it more successfully than others.  But--and, and, and creating product that works for everybody, at least they're trying hard.  Especially in, in cosmetics, face cosmetics.  Because I think that aging for black and Hispanic, no one's gotten that down yet.  They only know how to talk to white women who are afraid of wrinkles; that's all anybody knows how to talk about right now.  But the, but the, the change in the cosmetic arena is refreshing.  Still a long way to go; sometimes it's just not right still.  I don't care, even if you have somebody i--that's black in the lab, it can still be wrong.  And I think they need to be testing in terms of hair, the, the--everyone's embracing the natural hair movement.  And women are--and, and there's a movement from relaxers, but the, the recognition has to be that they're both important.  And that I, that the shift is that, that black hair, is, is, is more in depth, you can't write it away in a line or one tip in a general market magazine cause it's more, there's more to it than that.  Now I think that, that--I don't know if there's an understanding of it, but that's the fact; that people need to, to really understand.  And that consumers will take nothing less than that from, from anybody they're going to and that's why they go to the, to these YouTube videos because at least they know--they're looking for somebody who's gonna talk to them about their specific needs.  So I think the audience has become more demanding and vocal about what they want as well. So in order to succeed, the beauty industry has to then respond.
Story_ID: 95583
Speaker 1: And I think the most important thing; I think the--why I'm passionate about something like Beauty Biz Camp and The Beauty Swirl is because in order to make the change you have to have a seat at the table.  And if you don't have a seat at the table, then you can't be there when they're developing the products and shift it out.  You have to speak--you have to--somebody has to be there speaking for the audience.  And if they're not there, that's why we get these mixed messages.
Speaker 2: Well you know the only thing that makes me somewhat sad is that you've been at the table, you know, at the very beginning where even one would say high fashion and you know, beauty were, were there.  And, and here we are thirty years later talking about a seat at the table.  So I just wanna check--
Speaker 1: Okay but, but here--seat at the table meaning at a cosmetic company, at a, at a, at a manufacturer.  I didn't have a seat at the table at Elle, I was an editorial assistant.  That's not a seat at the table, I'm not a decision maker.  I'm somebody who's following the decisions, they're not asking my opinion.  And I don't have the power to make change.  But when you're a senior level, and I wasn't even a beauty director.  But when you're a Director or a above, the executive editor, editor-in-chief and you have a seat at the table.  So at Real Simple for example, I could say black women don't do this in a meeting.  Like when they would talk about Thanksgiving dinner and they're talking about mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts, I say well, that might be what some people do, but we have collard greens and you know I could say that because I was in the management meeting.  But when you're not in the meeting, you can't make changes.
Speaker 2: So you're saying that you believe that there's a long way to go still.
Speaker 1: Well I'm talking about the beauty industry.
Speaker 2: In the beauty industry.
Speaker 1: In the beauty industry, I'm talking about a seat at the table when you're developing product, marketing product, assessing advertising dollars and talking to the consumer at the counter.  That's what I'm talking about; seat at the table.  Seat at the table when they're talking about who needs the new product and what are the needs of the consumer.  They're only guessing about us.  And they can do research but they--who's there to interpret the data once you see it?  Well they say this, but this is what it means.  You have to have somebody there who can say that.
Speaker 2: So you would like to grow the industry, essentially.
Speaker 1: I would like to see the industry more diverse.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well that's, that's what [HM] Bethann Hardison has been trying to do too.
Speaker 1: Yes, and she's doing it from the runway perspective.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I wanna do it from--and I really want--you know one of the passions is I want black, well I want all girls to do this, and particularly girls of color, but not just black girls, to define beauty for themselves.  I don't want anyone else to tell them what is beautiful.  They need to, they need to create the definition of beauty that works for them.  There's a big difference there.  We are, we are told what is beautiful and who is beautiful and what the standards of beauty are.  We need to change that.
Speaker 2: And you're saying change it by this training and early introduction of people to understand the industry and--
Speaker 1: To understand the industry, but to understand their power in being--see even if you're not in the industry and you understand that you can define beauty for yourself even when you go to a counter or you're looking at what someone says is beautiful.  You can make the decision for yourself.  That's, that is, is really what I think is important.  So even if none of the girls who went to my program become--end up in the beauty industry, I believe some of them will be.  They do know how to think about beauty differently and themselves differently.  And I think that's important.
Story_ID: 95584
Speaker 1: So when you, when you define black beauty or multicultural beauty, how would you define it?
Speaker 2: Okay, so, talk about black beauty.  There's not one way to define black beauty.  Black beauty is from the lightest to the darkest, from the kinkiest to the straightest to wavy.  It is the confidence to own who we are and to love it and to celebrate it.  That's for anyone, but particularly for us where we were told we're not good enough and that, that, that, that we're not enough of anything.  And that what we have is not beautiful, but for us to know that it is and to, to push back on that notion.  And to say that, that, that it is true; "I am beautiful" and to believe it.
Speaker 1: And what do you think African--how African Americans have influenced our mainstream beauty industry?  How do you think that?  Whether it's been acknowledged or not.
Speaker 2: I think the way that we--that the way that we wear and own color, particularly color cosmetics.  Because the way that we're, the way that we're starting to embrace our hair.  I don't know if we've always embraced our hair.  But the way that we are not wedded to one hairstyle; that we experiment, that we're risk takers with our beauty.  I think that, that has shifted the industry.  This whole braiding phenomenon that's happening on the runway, that's all black.  That's from our streets to the runway.  That has been interesting to watch.  That--they set up braiding like counters at salons and stuff like that and this is the stuff that we do in our homes with our kids, with ourselves when we have nothing else to do.  So we do influence that just as the way that we influence style in terms of owning--we don't necessarily--we, we take trends into consideration; we take trends into consideration from the runway.  We take influences from the, from celebrities into consideration, influences from our friends into consideration.  We throw it in the blender and we make it our own.  That's with beauty, that's with style.  And that's what makes us uniquely different in this marketplace.  I think Hispanic women do it differently, but we--as a group we take a little in--little bit of here, little bit of there, and then we decide, we decide.  When you look at the young girls on the street, you know that she--or most of the girls that are--especially stylish young girls.  They have decided what they want to be and who they want to be in this space.
Story_ID: 95585
Speaker 1: Staying within the same space, what are your hopes and your concerns for people who, you know for African Americans who want to be in this, this--
Speaker 2: That the industry is shifting and we won't be prepared.  So we, so there are people who have digital skills, but there are people who have no skills.  That we--one of my concerns is that don't know where to get the resources.  I meet too many people who are graduated from college and haven't had an internship, haven't met the right people.  And they're starting so far behind their white counterparts that it, it's disheartening to see.  That, that, that we don't know also sometimes the rules of engagement once we arrive.  Nobody--I mean other people get told "this is what you do," we don't have that ongoing dialogue with our daughters, with the young people in our lives cause most-- some of us don't know.  So the rules of engagement in this industry, period.  What are the rules of engagement in fashion and beauty?  How do you succeed and how do you make an impact?  So I think that those--so those are some of my concerns that they're getting lost.  I mean it's one thing to have a blog and be successful, it's another thing to, to let's say one day be the fashion director of InStyle.  That you--that, that you've created--or be the next Andre Leon Talley at Vogue.  There's something that happens, like Robin Givhan that was at the Washington Post went to Vogue for like a year and left.  That says something.  Went back to the Washington Pos.  So what is it that we don't know or maybe--and, and is it selling out or is it adjusting to the, the culture, the corporate culture.  What, what are those lines and what do they look like?  And as the industry shifts, I'm just wondering what--can you even aspire to be somebody at Vogue?  Will Vogue be in existence?  Has the time passed and we never got the chance to do it.  Will it be the only way for us to do it is to, to be a blogger and I'm not--I don't have anything against bloggers.  But the highest echelon of the industry--will we have a chance to get there?  And not be second guessed once we do.

Speaker 1: So what do you want--when you look at your, your past, what do you--well first of all before I get to that, what do you think people would--what do--how do you want to be remembered, or what do you think people will say about you?
Speaker 2: "She helped a lot of people."  I think--I would hope they would say "she made a difference and she helped a lot of people."  And "she helped change the face of beauty" in terms of not--I'm not talking about Beauty Biz Camp, but in terms of beauty editorial to change the way because I'm a black woman who worked--I mean I can talk to white women, I can talk to Hispanic women, I can talk Asian woman and I can talk to black women.  I took the time to understand what everybody needs.  So for me to start in this career at a white publication [Elle], I had to automatically teach, I had to teach myself what the sensibility of white women was.  And what the other ethnic groups might want.  Where inherently I know what black women want, or what need or I can ask them.  And I, and it's not the same--they're not gonna--a lot of times when, when, when--at least this is what I think.  If you're white you are a lot of times in beauty you're, you're just thinking that what you think is what everybody needs.  But I think the understanding is when you're coming from a different perspective, you know that indeed needs are different.  And then you might have to look at things differently.  And the education of the general market is starting to happen that they do understand that.  But prior to that, it was--I mean just a simple tip as we don't wash our hair every day, so you can't say "when you wash your hair every day."  These are things that you wouldn't have to know.  It's simple, but if you're a black woman reading you know that obviously whoever wrote this is not talking to you.
Story_ID: 95587
Speaker 1: So what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I want, I want my legacy to be that there are people in positions of power who are from really diverse backgrounds, not just ethnically, but financially, from fiscally, that the industry shifts because the perspective is not monolithic anymore.  It's not the rich, white, WASPy since of elite.  Because even if--even when I went to Elle it--I didn't--Elle wasn't like that, but when you're at a general market magazine, you're a lot--you're in that, you know, when I worked, when you work at some place like that, people or everybody's married to a banker, have a house in the Hamptons [New York].  You know there's that--there's a--but I wanna see that, that everybody's not from the same place.  So that there, that, that, that I've created a, an atmosphere or a legacy where people will learn from each other and challenge each other.  Challenge the thought process.  Challenge creatively too.  Not kumbaya necessarily, but I think it'll be an infinitely more interesting place if, if style and beauty reflect a more diverse mindset and experience.

So we heard audio around Lois telling stories of the, of when they first moved to New York from Norfolk [Virginia].  And, and living in Harlem and being in the snow and being in the cold for the first time and being in the city, so the reporter heard a bunch of that and, and a little bit of, of the Jones' legacy of keeping the family together.
