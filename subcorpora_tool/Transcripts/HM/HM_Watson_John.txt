Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers archive.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Observing is Steven Mudroch [The HistoryMakers Researcher/Writer].  Sir, could you give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: John, J-O-H-N, Alfred, A-L-F-R-E-D, Watson, W-A-T-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: May 21, 1940.  I was born in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Former occupation?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Cause I'm retired now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, yes, sir.
Speaker 2: I was a university professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco.
Story_ID: 30384
Speaker 1: Okay, I've asked you about your occupation.  What is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: March 7, 2011 (laughter).
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: You're in Daly City, California.
Speaker 1: Okay, in your home, right?
Speaker 2: In my home, yes.
Story_ID: 30385
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, before we go into depth, there are five, light-weight, "People Magazine-ish" type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone.  And they only require a short answer.  And the first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Food?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That I can just eat and eat and eat, nothing falls in that category, but I love, as generically, food that has spices in it, hot sauce.  I like probably foods that come from cultures that put a lot of tomatoes and hot sauce and green peppers, rice and barbeque and things of that nature.  But specific food is [shaking head]--
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: A favorite time of the year?  In San Fran--in this area, the Bay Area, [California] the favorite time for me is the periods between about mid-May to mid-June 'cause it's relatively warm.  Then from mid-September to about Halloween [October 31], again it comes back rather warm.  In this immediate area, I'm told that this is the second foggiest city in the world (laughter), is Daly City because most of the time on the Fourth of July, you can have firecrackers out there and you won't see 'em, just right across the street.  And so that's a--but the thing is, is that it's microhetergeneous climate here.  So you can go ten minutes away by car and you'll be in eighty degree weather and the normal summer.  And so even though you may, you can be trapped here, but you can get away very easily.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's true, very true.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite?  I can't, I'm more--a favorite implies exclusive, and I'm not an exclusive person.  I like variety, but I have things, I do like blue.  I like yellow, and I move into colors that are different shades of, it's not pink.  But it's lavender and maybe purple.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes (laughter).  The favorite place, my favorite places to travel is to either go to Zihuatanejo [Mexico], not Ixtapa [Mexico], but Zihuatanejo and recently, and I went twice last year to Isla Mujeres and Cozumel [Mexico].  Those are my favorite places to go.  They're close by.  The weather is nice, and if you go to the places where the large North American culture tends not to go, it's just lovely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Good beaches.
Speaker 1: Now, the last question in this set is this one.  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase or saying.  Gosh, again, that's a tough one.  It's tough only because you don't notice it (laughter).  It may be there as something that you--I don't go around repeating and quoting people as a routine.  And so it may come out and I don't, it's so normal, it's background noise in some way.  So I suppose I can't identify, right off, I can't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe I'll think about it, but right now I can't think of some phrase that I routinely say, and--
Speaker 1: Well, that's fine, that's fine.  We'll just move on and if you think of one, you know, we'll go back to it.
Story_ID: 30386
Speaker 1: But I wanna ask you about your family history next.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, you know, separately first, and then we'll get 'em together.  And I'll ask you about your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Catherine with a "C", C-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E, Pauline, Berkley, B-E-R-K-L-E-Y.  That was her, that's the--
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Centralia, Illinois.  Now, you asked me the hard one.
Speaker 1: Now, I have a date down here.
Speaker 2: Nineteen--
Speaker 1: Tell me if it's right.  September 26, 1918, is that it?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So we've got it.  So she was born in Centralia, Illinois.  That's downstate Illinois, in Southern Illinois.
Speaker 2: That's right, Southern Illinois, one of those stops along the Illinois Central [Railroad].
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us like what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back, first of all, can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: I can get her side of the family all the way back to my great, great-grandfather, James Cornelius, who is her mother's [Ellen Cornelius-Berkley] father [unclear, this relationship would make him Watson's great-grandfather].
Speaker 1: All right, now, James Cornelius, that's the one that I saw the picture of not long ago.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And he was a subject of the Federal Writers' Project in 1938, I believe, right?
Speaker 2: '36 [1936].
Speaker 1: '36 [1936], all right, okay.  So he actually got a chance to tell his story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the slave narrative, and that was a wonderful find because it gave a history of, it gave us a history of what it really was about, what it was like to be enslaved in the United States and what happened to him, and particularly, he and his family members because when he was transferred from one enslaver to another, his family, his mother and his brother came together, but he never saw his father after that.  And he was about four or five years old then when that happened.  And he was, the transfer, the sale occurred in Franklinton, Louisiana.  And his new enslaver was from the Sanddell (ph.) family, and they were in Magnolia, essentially, Magnolia, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he started off in Franklin, Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Franklinton, yeah.
Speaker 1: Franklinton.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he said, you know, when they cite him, it says Franklin, and I went around and around.  And then it became clear to me he was in this county that was, the parish rather, that was not too far from the border of Mississippi because he actually, later on in his life after the Civil War, worked, went back and worked in areas and came back to Magnolia.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, he has an interesting story of going off as a boy to the Civil War.
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was a man, was a man servant for his enslaver, some Murray Sanddell (ph.), and he, the enslaver got shot, killed in some battle.  And he was about fourteen or fifteen years old.  And he was brought back to Mississippi, and then he was there until the end of the war.  But you lose sight of his brother and his mother.  He doesn't talk in any of the narrative about when his mother died, what happened to her or his brother.  And that's a very important piece in this, my efforts to try to sort it out.  And the difficulty you run into when you try to do any kind of analysis in Mississippi, is they have this unique history of courtroom fire, destruction--courthouses being destroyed by fire and records are just gone.  And the census, you know, the U.S. census is every ten years.  And if you have a couple of fires in between there, you can lose twenty years of documentation of bodies.  And Pike County [Mississippi] definitely had a lot of fires.  I think it was three courthouse fire in Magnolia which was the county seat.  And then the 1890 fire, you lose all of the U.S. censuses, the bulk of U.S. censuses.
Story_ID: 30387
Speaker 1: But you do have this document from the Federal Writers' Project which is, I was looking at it, and it's really something to treasure, you know, cause not everybody had a chance to tell their story through the Federal Writers' Project.  And we just, the general public today, just became aware of it in '95 [1995], I believe, when public radio broadcasts, they had a piece on it.  That's one of the things that inspired Julieanna Richardson, the founder of this project [The HistoryMakers]--
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: --was that Federal Writers' Project broadcast about the slave narratives.
Speaker 2: The worse part about it is that many of the tapes were just left in vaults and go to pot, and they weren't able to recover 'em all.  I would have liked to have, have access to his tape and hear his voice.  I have the transcript 'cause the transcript was written in two forms, the so-called language of the time and then translation (laughter).  And it's markedly different in terms of being able to read it.
Speaker 1: Right, and some interpretation may be even off.  I know even the transcripts of our interviews can be, I know it was proposed to do 'em by machine at one point, but a machine could not get black inflections--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --yeah, they couldn't get it, yeah.  So it's hard to, you know--
Speaker 2: It made it actually, you know, not having really interacted with the individuals who were the most impacted in that kind of vernacular, I'm not always convinced that (laughter) the talk (unclear) and the talk was, the speech was as noted.
Speaker 1: Right, yes, sir.  So, but he lived until when?
Speaker 2: 1943.  He lived to be, it's, either it was 98 or 102 [years old] 'cause you figure, he couldn't read.  He couldn't write, and someone tells him when he was born.  But, you know, that's word of mouth.  We know when he died, but exactly when he was born is another issue.
Speaker 1: I know in the piece in the other room that I was reading the, I guess the newspaper in Magnolia, [Missippi] they ended it by saying--he was talking about his interaction with his former master and how much the people in town seemed to respect him.  And the author ended by saying, well, you're ninety-three years old, said, it's wonderful.  Let me just tell you, it's quite an honor to be respected by so many people, not it's an honor to meet you, but honor for you to be respected by (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hum, right.
Speaker 1: It was a way of--
Speaker 2: Actually, sometimes I read that and it's, there's some segments, there're some--in the original transcript that's in the slave narrative, there are some things that it's very clear he had a loyalty attachment to the Sanddell family.  I mean it was, there's a line in there he says when he returns back and the master's wife greets him and hugs him.  And it was like this was a barrier, a line had crossed because she grabbed and hugged him, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he says, she hugged me like a white boy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It was whoops (laughter).
Speaker 1: She was so glad to see him.  So, yeah, so her husband leaves with him, and, but he comes back, and he tried to bring back as much of the effects--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of the master as he could, from what I read.
Story_ID: 30388
Speaker 1: So he's [James Cornelius, Watson's maternal great-grandfather] like the, so that's as far back as you can go on your mother's side [Catherine Pauline Berkley].  Now, are there stories, well, what are the stories that are passed down about him and about other relatives?
Speaker 2: You know, it's been my experience in trying to do all of this kind genealogy and searching and doing history, there's a whole lot of secrecy and closed mouth.  Some, obviously, some families, they were diarrhea.  Everything was given.  I'm finding all of this out in the last ten years.  And the only reason I even began to push on this whole pursuit was when my father died [Hosea Watson].  And he died in 1999.  And I went to Mississippi cause I was giving a talk at Tougaloo [College, Mississippi], and my father's side of the family has property there, has 110 acres.  And so I was, some people I hadn't seen; some people down there I had never met.  So I just said, well, I'm that close.  I might as well go down and visit 'em.  And one of my aunts asked me about my father's brother.  And I said, my father don't have a brother (laughter).  And it was like whoa.  And she said, yes, he does.  And I said, I'm unaware of my father having a brother.  And then I started doing detective work, found out, yes, he has a brother, 'cause my grandfather [John Watson, 1897-1847] had remarried.  And on the obituary, there's nothing listed.  But the reason is, is 'cause my grandfather's new wife was pregnant, and he died before the baby was born.  So he died in April and the child was born in June.  So the obituary wouldn't have anything on there.  And I started searching and found out she lived in Oakland [California], of all places.  And she'd been out here since 1950.  So I found her April 11, 2000.  And she's ninety-seven years old now.  And, yes, I--
Speaker 1: Now, this is your grandfather's, I mean second--
Speaker 2: My father's father--
Speaker 1: Second wife?
Speaker 2: Second wife.
Speaker 1: Okay, your grandfather--
Speaker 2: But my father never told us.  I had no reason, I don't know why, understand why.  I can, you can conjure up ideas, like the age differential between my father and his father's new wife was about, only about five or six years, because my father's mother [Althia Woodland-Watson, 1900-1936] passed when he was sixteen [sic, nineteen years old].  And so, that's the only thing I could think of.  But he never told us and that part I don't understand.
Story_ID: 30389
Speaker 1: Okay, any--did your father [Hosea Watson] talk about what it was like to grow up--oh, now, we're still--
Speaker 2: We're still, and I did that, I did it just to give you information of what (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're still on (unclear) your mother's [Catherine Pauline Berkley] side of the family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, still on my mother's side of the family, yeah.  I only did that to just indicate why I began to pursue and then in this pursuant I'm finding, I found out there's a lot of secrets out there.  And--
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your mother's side now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we can back, okay.
Speaker 1: What did your mother say about growing up, and what was it like growing up and what did her people do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, Centralia, Illinois was considered like just being in the Deep South.  You know, there were towns that you couldn't be in after 6:00 o'clock, sundown, rather.  And everything is relative.  So in Centralia, it was better than Cairo, Illinois or some of those other little hick towns down there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's been a book written about these "sundown towns."  But Centralia was not a sundown town, I take it.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, it wasn't.
Speaker 1: There were plenty of 'em in Illinois.
Speaker 2: In Illinois, a lot of them down there.
Speaker 1: About thirty or forty towns that blacks could not be in after sundown.
Speaker 2: And so she, you know, we were made aware of that experience in Centralia because we really went to Centralia.  We never went to Mississippi.  We went to Centralia to see her family, at least the family that moved to Centralia.
Speaker 1: Now, did James Cornelius live in Centralia?
Speaker 2: No.  He lived all the time in Magnolia [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I never even knew about him.
Speaker 1: Was there a story about--so you didn't even, they didn't even pass down the story or--okay?
Speaker 2: No, they just didn't, you know, it was like family, that kind of history stuff just wasn't--it probably, in some segments, cause a lot of these families were large, ten and twelve kids.  And so there may be one sibling or child that decided they were gonna be the history keeper, the archival person.  But they didn't necessarily have full communication.  And so, and then others were trying to forget the South, and so it's, it's interesting that this kind of behavior existed.
Story_ID: 30390
Speaker 1: Now, one other question about James Cornelius and I hope you give us some of the documents to take back with us--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can take that, one of the print outs.
Speaker 1: But the question is, in the picture of him, he has like straight hair.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He looks like he's, could have been the product of some sort of a mixed situation.  Is there a story behind that?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of.  I mean other than the obvious that there definitely was some mixing going on.  I mean he looked, I call him the Colonel Sanders (laughter) [James Cornelius resembles Harland David "Colonel" Sanders, founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken].
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause I was thinking perhaps his father actually might have been the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, recently, I have a--my mother [Catherine Pauline Berkley] has two sisters that are still alive.  And one of 'em is, her youngest sister is still alive, and she lives in Detroit [Michigan] or Ann Arbor [Michigan], rather.  And I just heard that recently, it may have been an inverse situation, in the sense that he may have been a product of a white woman and a black slave, enslaved person, rather than the other way.  And in his narrative he says, he asked his mother why they didn't change their name to Sanddell.  And she says that allegedly they could keep their last name of Cornelius.  So that's, because, see, Sanddell was the last person.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And slaves would typically take on the name of the slave master.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it varied because I just, on my mother's side, the Berk--cause she's a Berkley, on the Berkley part of it, not the Cornelius side of it, I just found out that her grandfather, so papa, grandfather [unclear, this would be James Cornelius according to his statement earlier in the interview] changed his name to Berkley when he, when they--apparently, it must have been, they came from some place in Louisiana and then into Mississippi.  And they changed to Berkley.  And I gotta get more detail on it cause on Ancester.com [sic, www.ancestry.com, a website for studying geneology], you know, when you have a public tree, people can have access, they find out information.  And all of a sudden, there are relatives popping out of the woodwork who are either initiating things or had some--and I'm finding information.  And it's really great.  I've made a contact with a Berkley descendant who's down in, right outside of Magnolia now.  She's a retired teacher and come to find out she was a teacher here in Oakland [California] for thirty years.  (Laughter) It's like, wow, you know.  And I've been out here since '69 [1969].
Story_ID: 30391
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your mother [Catherine Pauline Berkley]--what was life like in Centralia growing up for her?
Speaker 2: I think that she had a positive life in the sense that there may have been some boundaries, de facto boundaries existing, but they had a, like a little farm.  My grandfather [Joseph Berkley] worked at, worked for the railroad.  He was like a blacksmith type person for the railroad.  And my grandmother [Ellen Cornelius-Berkley] didn't work cause she had thirteen kids.  And they went, it was like only one or two schools so they went to an integrated school.  And my mother was trying, was actually looking at going to teacher's college.
Speaker 1: So she was going to go, but what happened?
Speaker 2: I don't think it was readily accepted.  But some of it was being drive--let me tell you a little story.  You know, gosh, you've [The HistoryMakers archive] probably got an archive on him, one of the few black, successful, prominent black statisticians [David Blackwell, 1919-2010].  He just died.  He was on the faculty of Berkley, National Academy of Science person.  I was gonna say, about to say, it's with a "B".  It's a darn shame.  Anyway, he went to the University of Chicago [Illinois].  He got a Ph.D. at like twenty years old.  And he was very, very successful.  Well, they, in high school, they boyfriend and girlfriend (laughter) in Centralia.
Speaker 1: Well, that's something--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --cause so many of the links end up back here in the Bay Area [California].
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--and I actually met him, cause we served on some committees at the university, in the university-wide committees.  And I told him, I said, yeah, you used to be my mother's boyfriend (laughter).  And then I met his daughter.  She's a physician.  And he had a son-in-law or son that was--it was must have been a son that wanted to go to the medical school [University of California, San Francisco] and I ran into him.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's see.  So she graduated from high school in Centralia [Illinois], but--
Speaker 2: And then she came up to Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because he went away to school, and there were some issues.  That's all I could, where I pick it up is again, issues that are tied into the times.  And she came up to Chicago, started working, and then that's how she met my father [Hosea Watson].
Speaker 1: Now, did she have relatives in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Nah, let me think.  She probably had aunts because he mother had twelve other siblings or so.  And they, so and I know some of them were in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let me go to your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Hosea, H-O-S-E-A, Watson.  He doesn't have a middle initial.
Story_ID: 30392
Speaker 1: We're rolling again.  Now, what is your father's [Hosea Watson] date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 11, 19--
Speaker 1: I have '17 [1917].
Speaker 2: It's 1917, yeah, that's about right.  And he was born in, they say Brookhaven, but it's not Brookhaven.  That may be the post office, but it's Wesson, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Wesson, W-S-S-O-N?
Speaker 2: --S-S-O-N, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now,--
Speaker 2: And he, and it's, he was one of those kind of births in which, you can't get a birth certificate out of Mississippi.  It's just none exists for him.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, he passed away in 1999.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace his side?
Speaker 2: Now, I can go back to his, I may be able to go one more generation back.  Let me see if I can do it right.  You pick up names in 1870, if they weren't freeman.  And so there's a "Harrison One" [Harrison Watson I], is what I call him because they used certain, first names often, in generation after generation.  So Harrison One is picked up in 1870, but he was born in 1820.  And he was born in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, that fifty-year period, I don't know if he came to Mississippi the day of the census (laughter) or when he came to Mississippi--
Speaker 1: Or had he been there all along?
Speaker 2: Because, and I have no indication of Watson being the name of the people in Virginia.  We think we've identified a Watson in Copiah County [Mississippi] that, in that area where he essentially lived.  So from Harrison One--so it's a fifty-year hiatus in there, and we don't have any idea what, how that trav-that journey.
Speaker 1: Now, how long did Harrison One live or did he--
Speaker 2: Harrison lived, he lived, he must have lived another maybe twenty years.  He lived pretty--it's amazing, in spite of all the heavy-duty work that's involved in slavery, how long some of these individuals, a lot of individuals lived.
Speaker 1: Some lived to 1990.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so Harrison One had eight or nine kids.
Speaker 1: Now, was he a farmer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a farmer.  No, no, he was not a farmer.  He was a blacksmith.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.  He was a blacksmith, but he must have lived on some kind of farm-type place.  But he was, and when I first found him in the census, it had "B-S" in terms of--and I thought that that was a name for a landowner, and he was a sharecropper.  And then I ultimately found out that meant blacksmith.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so he had eight or nine kids, and one of his children was "Harrison Two" [Harrison Watson II].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he begot Harrison Two, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, now, Harrison Two is the father of my father's father.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Harrison Two is your great, great grandfather.  And Harrison One is your great, great, great--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, let me see.  So my father's grandfather is Harrison Two.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he'd be your great, great grandfather?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: I'm counting all these greats (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it's--and as I was mentioning earlier, I have now found out that Harrison Two had a brother called, named Aaron Watson.  And Aaron Watson had a son named Aaron W. Watson, who became a player-manager of the Laurel Black Cats [founded in 1932 in Mississippi].
Speaker 1: A black baseball team.
Speaker 2: The black, historical, regional black baseball team, very successful in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now what did Harrison Two do for a living?
Speaker 2: Harrison Two was a farmer, entrepreneur.  He bought a 110 acres of land in, like 19--I'm gonna say 1902.  And I just still don't understand how he was able to pull that one off.  And I got from the city a copy of the deed and the bill of sale.  And I was shocked.  But, and then he had ten kids.  And my grandfather was the oldest, my grandfather, [Rev.] John [Watson].
Story_ID: 30393
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is your [paternal] grandfather, John Watson.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, Rev. John Watson.
Speaker 1: Okay, what denomination was he?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What denomination was he?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they, I'm gathering that they're playing a leadership role on some level in that community?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, all of this is coming out, but it was never explicitly like, you know, like you envision the Kennedys get together at a compound (laughter), and they start doing the lineage and telling you that your role is up at that first one percent and not at the bottom (laughter).  You know, you hear them say, well, you're a Watson, but, you know, in a vacuum, that doesn't mean anything.
Speaker 1: In those days, at the turn of the century, a blacksmith [the occupation of Watson's great-grandfather, Harrison Watson II] is an important job in the community.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a respectable job, and then you get like a landowner as a son, and then the third one's a reverend, which is a--
Speaker 2: But he wasn't, he didn't--he became a minister after he came up to Chicago [Illinois] and he was an adult.  But Harrison Two was very entrepreneurial.  I mean I'm told that he sold ice, and he sold Sogram (ph.), and he'd grow stuff, and he would make his sausage and the whole nine yards.  And so he was a very, very hard-working individual.  And obviously, I, I'm beginning to think 'cause now I found out about this Aaron [Watson, manager of the Laurel Black Cats], his brother, who's also tries the entrepreneurial.  And then I started looking around at my own siblings and what have you.  They're, within there, there's an entrepreneurial spirit.
Story_ID: 30394
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, your father [Hosea Watson] is born in Chicago [Illinois] then?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was born in Laurel [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: He was born in, again, he was Wesson [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Wesson, okay.  Oh, that's right.  You said that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then he moved to Chicago when he was about six years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So he comes to Chicago.  And, now, did he talk about growing up in Mississippi and Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And it was not very favorable (laughter).  He did not like me going to Mississippi.  You know, growing up there, he wasn't, he was--Mississippi was not one of his favorite places.
Speaker 1: Did he have a, did he share a story with you about Mississippi that can illustrate?
Speaker 2: I just think it was a town and gown issue that, as he grew up, became acclimatized to Chicago and urban ways and what have you, that was just seen as country.  (Laughter) That's just a simple--that's country.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did he have any stories about how blacks were treated down there or anything?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he didn't dwell on that.  I think it was more in terms of the fact that you were dealing with situations that were not the same as growing up in an urban area.  So, country (laughter), town and gown type of--
Speaker 1: All right.  So he was glad to be in--
Speaker 2: He was glad to be in--I've been there, done that, and I ain't going back to Mississippi (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did he say about growing up in Chicago?  What part of town did he grow up in?
Speaker 2: He grew up around, the church was on 53rd [Street] and Federal [Street], and it was above the housing, his housing, at least a good part of his living conditions were, where he lived was above their church [Berean Baptist Church].  But he went to Lane Technical High School [Chicago, Illinois].  So he was a rare breed.  And so he was not going to whatever it would have been, close around there.  I don't know if DuSable [Leadership Academy] would have been around at that time, but he went to Lane so he was traversing all the way up to the North side, and being one in a case, or one of three in class?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is true.  Lane is still an exclusive kind of school.  It's not exclusive, but it's a school where you have to be an achiever to get in, test to get in it.  So, he was in Lane Tech, and what did he take up at Lane Tech?
Speaker 2: I get the impression it must have been, you know, the kind of, where they gear you for the, at that time, for those kind of schools like CVS [unclear] and Tilden Tech.  He had access to those trades and, not necessarily preparing you to be an engineer in the classical sense when we think of engineering, but to really to have skills, to fix cars or--cause he was very, very good at mechanical things.
Speaker 1: And so he didn't pick a profession out of that experience (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, not to my knowledge, not to my knowledge.
Story_ID: 30395
Speaker 1: All right, now, so, now, when--am I jumping the gun here to ask you when your parents [Hosea Watson and Catherine Pauline Berkley] met because I know the War [World War II] is imminent in this story.
Speaker 2: Right, and--
Speaker 1: Did he serve?
Speaker 2: --they had met like in '38 [1938] or '39 [1939].
Speaker 1: Okay, so they met before the War?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did they get married before the War?
Speaker 2: Well, the War had already started in Europe, and I was born in 1940 so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, right, okay.  So they got together before the War.  Now, did he go off to this, was he drafted?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was in the service, and he had, military he enjoyed, had a certain level of enjoyment for it because he originally was put in the Officer Corps.  And there's an incident which I don't have all the details, but this whole group of black soldiers, something happened, and they just kicked them all out of the officer corps.  And then he eventually, they were still in--they were all in the [United States] Army, but then he rose to be a first sergeant.  And he was in the motor pool.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did he go overseas?
Speaker 2: Yes, he went to all sorts of places, and he went to about seven or eight different countries.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he--
Speaker 1: Was he part of the famous Red Ball Express as a motor pool (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I don't know if he was part of the Red Ball Express.  And then he stayed in the reserves because I can remember as a child, he and my mother having serious discussions of him being at risk for the Korean War.  And you know, at that time, let's see, that would have been 1950 or '52 [1952] or something like that.  And there were already four of us (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were a little toddler when your dad was in the War, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So he was there through the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he didn't come back until '44 [1944] or '45 [1945], something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I would guess after '45 [1945], they probably kept him through the end of the War for the most part.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So probably '45 [1945] or '46 [1946].
Story_ID: 30396
Speaker 1: So, well, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Me?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Earliest.
Speaker 1: The earliest thing you remember when you were a little, little, tiny kid.
Speaker 2: Gosh.  I can't pin a--all I know is that I can remember, one thing I remember (laughter) very early was my grandfather [Rev. John Watson] baptizing and taking us in--his church had one of these stages, stage that you took the floor up or something, and it had a big tub (laughter) put water in there.  And I can remember like I was drowning (laughter).  I remember that.  I vaguely remember my mother [Catherine Pauline Berkley], we were being baby sit by someone, and I can't remember that person.  And my mother, had gotten burnt or something on her arm, but--and that was the first place we lived in the projects, Ida B. Wells Projects [Chicago, Illinois].  So I was young, very young then.  I could have been, no more than one or two years old [ca. 1942].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in those days, you might not have been aware of it in those days, but Ida B. Wells was a, as a housing project was an up and coming residence, you know, people who were up and coming, getting ready to move on to something else.
Speaker 2: Right, it was clearly a launching pad.  I mean you, that became very evident because there would be families that would be around for four or five years, and they're gone.  And you find out they've moved further South or, very seldom would they go West, to the West Side, rather, like Northwest or traditional West Side; not Northwest, 'cause Northwest has opened in the last "X" number of years.  But West Side.  And they went South, and South was an incremental kind of move, you know, going towards, you eventually get to 63rd Street.  And maybe some people get escape velocity and get to Blue Island or one of those places.  But you wasn't going much further than that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, because of rigid segregation in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, rigid, de facto segregation.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Very rigid.
Speaker 1: I think they, a lot of housing court battles in Chicago over that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's the subject of "[A] Raisin the Sun" [play by Lorraine Hansberry, 1959], the extreme segregation of--
Speaker 2: I mean it's--
Speaker 1: --the black community.
Speaker 2: --large, the streets and the railroad tracks, bridges--the railroad tracks were always dividing lines.
Speaker 1: The viaducts and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, viaducts, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you grew up in what they call now the Kenwood-Oakland neighborhood, I guess, around thirty--
Speaker 2: Well, I grew on, on 38th Street, Place, 38th Street and 39th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where, I mean 39th, and we moved to 39th when I was ten or eleven [ca. 1950].  And we stayed there till I was eighteen [ca. 1958].  And we just, one, because it's eight of us in the family.  And all eight of us weren't there then because two were born after we moved out of the projects.
Story_ID: 30397
Speaker 1: Now, describe the place you lived in, in Ida B. Wells [Housing Projects, Chicago, Illinois].  What was the unit like?  How many rooms?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can't remember all of the rooms, but it was, the first place was a small place, because it was just myself, my mother [Catherine Pauline Berkley] and maybe Roger [Watson's brother] cause he was born a year after I was.  Then we moved to, about a block away, and there we had, it was upstairs, downstairs, and so up--so that would have, Robert was born, Elliott was born, Stanley was born, all there because my sister--well, she may have been born there, too.  So we had to get out of there (laughter), now, that I think about it because it probably would have been about at the most three bedrooms, at the most.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, cause we did a lot, you know, with having all boys, that helped 'cause we could stack up.
Speaker 1: These are brick units, (unclear), (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Brick units, but, you know, Ida B. Wells was, everything is, again, is through your perspective.  And relative to some of those wood houses or frame houses and what have you that were in the neighborhood, Ida B. Wells was, you know, it was nice.  And we had front, we had yards with grass in 'em in the front.  And then we had, I have a picture of me at about seven or eight years old.  And I didn't realize it, but my parents had built, had put a little, must have had a garden out there.  And, but it was designed very nicely because in the areas where we were, you had central, everybody comes--could come into this central area.  And you got to know every, you know, your peer group, and your kids are growing up.  And so you had, you had a community.  And it was a lot of community things going on.  And then you had Madden Park.  You'd go to Madden Park, and that was just, you know, a three block walk or something like that.  And it was, we used to spend a lot of time in Madden Park, both at the community center there and just the park itself.  And then you had Abraham Lincoln Centre [Chicago, Illinois], and we lived in Abraham Lincoln Center.
Speaker 1: Now, Abraham Lincoln Centre is now the Northeastern Illinois [University, Carruther's] Center for Inner City Studies [inaccurate].
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: You know, the Jacob Carruther's Center for Inner City Studies, seven story Frank Lloyd Wright building (laughter), I found out.  You know, I didn't know that when I first (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and this is (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, it was, it had a library there, and then you could take classes there.  And we'd take art classes, and the pioneers there was Mr. Oaks and Ms. Summerville.  Those were the people that stick in your mind.  They did everything for you.  I enjoyed, I mean it was--it was, you'd get on the other side of Oakwood Boulevard, and you'd start going into the 40's, 41st, 42nd, 43rd [Streets, Chicago, Illinois], as far as I was concerned, you had a lot of just run-down shacks.  So (laughter), so the projects was heaven.  We had the Hampton Building.  It used to some, a streetcar barn right there at Langley, between 39th and 38th.  It was a streetcar barn there.  Then it was all the way, a good part of it went all the way to Cottage, and then on 39th itself, was grocery stores and Woolworth and Kroger and A & P and Walgreens and so 39th Street was a busy, a nice busy street.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the, I know you went to Oakland School.
Speaker 2: I went to Oakland.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was right across--
Speaker 2: That was on 40th [Street].
Speaker 1: Fortieth, yeah, okay.  All right, well, let's see.  So at home were like you and your brother, Roger, and who else?
Speaker 2: Well, when we left the projects, all my--so it was Roger, Elliott and Robert, Stanley and Cheryl.  And then my mother had two more children.  So then had Gail or Christopher and Gerald.  Gerald's my youngest brother.  He's twenty years younger than I am.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, you have a pretty good sized family?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter) eight, seven boys and one girl.
Story_ID: 30398
Speaker 1: So, well, what were some of--you know, this is an historic neighborhood.  I've heard so many stories about it, and then, you know, over the recent years, over the last thirty years, I've hung out over there.  But what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in that neighborhood [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Ah, before, I would just say race music of blues and what have you became national or accepted in all venues, 39th Street, 43rd Street, 35th Street, you know, that's where, you know, B. B. King [African American blues musician] and all of them, they were doing those clubs.  They were on that, as part of the Chitlin' Circuit [performance venues for African American performers during the era of segregation].  And there was always, it was a community so you had, you were engaged in, you had an opportunity to do a lot of different things.  You didn't feel that you were being denied anything, but you don't have a reference point.  But you did know that there were boundaries.  I mean that, you knew, because you'd run the risk of getting yourself either just harassed by citizens or the police, being in the wrong place or what they defined as the wrong place.  And, but you had just a lot of bustling activities, and we had freedom.  I mean I, I think about when my kids grew up around here, and even kids growing up now, there're very--that are in neighborhoods like this, they don't go out.  We could ride our bikes.  We would ride our bikes to a place, and we had this, right over by the outer drive, off of Oakwood Boulevard, you come up over the hill.  And right next to the railroad tracks, it was a lot of greenery and what have you.  We had something we called "Dead Man's Path," and we'd ride our bikes down these steps, and then on the sand and along the tracks and into the trees, all the way down to 47th Street.  And that was just, you know, you could go over to the lake [Lake Michigan], a lot of--and there was no, no sense that you were being restricted in that way.  And you had a lot of, and since there was a launching pad for new families, it was a lot of kids.  So you could have what they called a day cruise, but, you know, you just always had buddies and individuals you can interact with.  So that was fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I--the only thing I think that when I started college, what I noticed that the defect, if there's a defect, was that the formal expectations in college for handling some subject matters, particularly, things with English and reading, what you've read and what you hadn't read, was distinctly, markedly different than what one's experience had been formally or even with the things that you'd either read or had access to were markedly different than the, now, this new group of people you're in school with.  And the reference point was them, and not you, and so you were playing catch up.  You were playing, wow, I didn't know anything about that.  I remember when I went to [University of Illinois at] Navy Pier [Chicago, Illinois] and you take that entrance exam, and I had to take an English certification exam.  And they sat us in the room.  They gave us these little blue books.  I'd never seen a Blue Book before, and they asked us to write on the topic--it was dealing with Howdy Dowdy [children's television show, 1947-1960] or something like that.  And it wasn't something we, I don't think--I would have had a TV by then, had experience with a TV, but it was certain things I just was not aware of.  And I wrote my essay out, and I wrote it on both sides of the paper, and that was a "no-no".  I wrote in pink [ink], and I didn't put margins.  None of those things were--and so, you gotta go to a remedial English (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what you're saying is that the black community was so insular--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --because of segregation that the experience, what you knew was the black community, I mean pretty much exclusively.
Speaker 2: Yes, very parochial, and but exciting because you had the full range of talents in that circumscribed area.
Speaker 1: Cause if you, for instance, the black professionals.
Speaker 2: Professionals would be not far away.  That's for certain.  They wouldn't necessarily be in the projects, but they weren't far away, and you felt the impact, their impact because they would either go to the same churches or they would come to, they'd come--their kids would come to Madden Park or similar kind of parks.  So you felt that presence, and the, many of the businesses were black, you know.  So it was a whole, the whole continuum of possibilities was existing, and you were getting reinforced continuously through black newspaper--the "[Chicago] Defender".  I sued to sell the "Defender".  You would have, obviously, the Bud Billiken Parade [popular African American Parade on the South Side of Chicago] would be one of the things, but you had these different Mason groups and the women's group.  They would have a parade, you know, (laughter), up and down Vincennes or some place like that (laughter), all these different activities were going on.  And so you were exposed to that as a way of life that you didn't feel like you were just sitting in a cave or anything of this nature.
Speaker 1: A lot of stimulation, huh, correct.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of stimulation.
Story_ID: 30399
Speaker 1: Now, tell me this now, when you think about your parents' talents and dispositions, their outlook on life, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: It depends on what part of one's life because there are aspects of my life that are very much like my mother [Catherine Pauline Berkley].  But my father [Hosea Watson] was a very active individual.  He was active in the church.  He worked at the [United States] Post Office.  He tried to get himself a bachelor's degree, by going to school at night, but his job kept changing because he was not a postal delivery person.  He worked in the big house, so to speak.  And he was engaged in the first, he was one of the first black supervisors in the Post Office.  And he was a founding member of the Postal, Black's Postal Supervisor Organization, and eventually, when he retired, he was the superintendent of a district or a station on the South side [of Chicago, Illinois].  So he, and then he managed a Co-op.  In Ida B. Wells [Housing Project, Chicago, Illinois], there was a co-op store.  He managed that for a number of years.  And his sons would be down there doing the inventory (laughter).  So (laughter).  And my father worked with, for us, with the premise that you had two strikes against you.  You're black and you're poor.  And so the motivation was there.  He, my mother was very big-hearted.  I mean he was big-hearted, but, you know, she had a dimension that, in terms of helping, interacting with people on another dimension with helping them and helping her family.  I mean she was a very strong motivator.  And so it was there, the pressure--the push was there.  It was not like you potentially couldn't do anything.  It was always, you could do what you wanna do, and being the oldest, and my experience was that, there used to be this magazine for an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Every year, they did like a review of progress (laughter).  And it would have vignettes on individuals who were the first of this or the first of that or this, that and the other.
Speaker 1: Was this in "The Crisis" [magazine]?
Speaker 2: It was, it was an extension of "The Crisis", but we did receive "The Crisis", but it was a, it was like an annual report, but it was well done, a lot of pictures and everything.  I used to just wait to read that to find out who were the new pioneers, you know, when somebody would be the first one to walk in office "X" or whatever (laughter), you know.  And I would envision myself being--it was like, this is what you had to be--that was gonna be life.  You're gonna be going into all these new places because you knew these boundaries were out there, but they were opening up at their own, whatever pace they were.  And at some point, that you had to be in a position to deal with that.
Story_ID: 30400
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about school now.  What did you--did you like school?  You went to Oakland [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to Oakland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I always liked school.  I don't think there was a period of time, where it was like, let me get the hell out of here (laughter).  So, it was a place, it was a fun place with all of its ups and downs.  The ups and downs, generally, and particularly, in that neighbor--in going to Oakland, was the down part for me was that I often got into fights because (laughter) I'm a very independent person so if fifty people wanna go that way and I'm the one person to go that way (laughter), and that causes a problem or if people are gonna vote, then I'll raise questions.  And so I had a lot of fights.  And that was one of the reasons I didn't go to Wendell Phillips [Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  My folks was concerned that I would end up--now, I'm going to high school, and it's a different ball game.
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute now.  For instance, what, give the instance of what a contrary decision, how that can start or cause a fight?
Speaker 2: Well, if you're in, if there's a classroom vote going on in, you know, in elementary school and everybody--it may be for a decision for an election, and you may take an opposite position, you have to vote on something.  You take a strong opposite position.  And there'd be some people in the class who'd--there're followers and there're leaders.  And there're a lot of people who follow just because somebody who's much more effective, as a leader, convinces them to go a certain way.  Well, I, my position is that I will go a certain way based on whatever my mind tells me.  And that may be, that may or may not be with you.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have a favorite subject in school or favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: I had a number of favorite teachers at Oakland.
Speaker 1: Oakland, at Oakland.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous) I mean we had mostly African American teachers, dedicated teachers, not jive teachers.  I mean these are people who liked to teach.  And they made teaching--they made education fun.
Story_ID: 30401
Speaker 1: And I always had a feel for science or I won't say, you know, at that time, I probably didn't, wouldn't classify it as science.  It was exploration, adventurism, trying to get answers, turning over rocks, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Okay, did you do a lot of, you know, nature exploring around the lake [Lake Michigan] and in the--
Speaker 1: Well, the exploring would be in a way of like going over there, and then walking the rocks or getting on your bike and putting a route together to do something.  And so you were, you had that freedom to explore within limits or in--when I was young, when I was at that age, we could probably go, probably to 31st Street Beach [Chicago, Illinois] or at least 31st Street and definitely down to 47th [Street].  And when I got a little older, cause I was still living in the projects, so let's say I was thirteen, fourteen years old, maybe not even when I was in high school because I was going to Parker by then.  I used to walk from 39th Street to the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois] on a Sunday.  It would be a Sunday ordeal.  Two or three of us would walk.  The museum was free and the exhibits were all, so many interactive, fun exhibits, you'd make a day of it and you'd walk (laughter) back home, you know.  It'd be a long day, but--
Speaker 2: Now, were black kids welcome in Hyde Park [Chicago neighborhood] in those days?
Speaker 1: Not readily, but you, the route we used to take, we would go up to Drexel, take Drexel [Avenue] down to like 51st Street and then take 51st over.  We tended to avoid, I think, if I remember correctly, we tended to avoid most of the University of Chicago's campus.  And then we'd cut over to the museum [Museum of Science and Industry].
Speaker 2: Okay, essentially, for those who are not from Chicago, the University of Chicago is in the middle of the South Side, sort of--
Speaker 1: You had your issues going, it depended how you got into that area, there would be issues.  But if you, you know, if you took, I think it was 51st, straight over.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, what, so you were interested, would you say you were more interested in science when you were growing up in your formative years than any other subject?
Speaker 1: Well, I was saying is that it probably would be defined as science, but it was, it's the act, the process.  It was an exploratory mind.  It was a nosey (laughter), it was being nosy.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's a observation stage.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You wanted to observe some things.
Speaker 1: Observe, yeah, and also engage.  And you engage--one way would be things that would occur in class with experiments and what have you, however trivial they were.  I enjoyed getting involved in what limited science fairs we had locally, right in the school.
Speaker 2: So Oakland had a science program for elementary school.
Speaker 1: Well, your teachers, clearly when you got to eighth grade, Mr. Mitchell, I think was the guy.  And we would have experiments, and we do--simple experiments, but they would be experiments, like make a motor, you know, make, you know, magnets.  But those kind of things excited me.
Story_ID: 30402
Speaker 1: And then my parents [Hosea Watson and Catherine Pauline Berkley] were very responsive to me.  At that time, they had these Gilbert Science sets [made by A.C. Gilbert Company], nothing like the cheesy things they have now, I mean real, good chemistry sets where OSHA would throw 'em in jail today (laughter), you know, if you bought one of those sets (laughter) today.
Speaker 2: Because they would be considered dangerous now or something else?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, everything is, there's so many rules now.  And there were chemicals in there that we probably shouldn't have been playing--dealing with.  And clearly, in terms of risks analysis, they would say, well, if you've got a choice between this kind of experiment versus another kind of experiment, they would always go to the one that's gonna have the low probably of something happening.  And one of the things I almost did when we were living in the projects, I almost burnt the house down (laughter) because I was making gun powder, and I lit it (laughter), and you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, did you learn that from the Gilbert chemistry set and a science kit?
Speaker 1: Who I learned?
Speaker 2: Learned how to make gun powder from that?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, yeah, well, it was simple.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it was, there was--the Gilbert sets were just (unclear), nice sturdy tubes and a lot of different chemicals that were in there, experiments that you could do and a lot of 'em using flames and, you know.  But--
Speaker 2: So what would you use for a flame, a candle or?
Speaker 1: Heating up, boiling, you know, warming something up to get a reaction to go faster.  So.
Speaker 2: I mean how would you do it?  Would you put it on the (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, what you would have is a container that had a wick in it.  It was alcohol and it would just burn it.
Speaker 2: Okay, I wondered how they did it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And all this, so this fire, chemicals (laughter).
Speaker 1: And it was just, and then you mixed it in together cause you don't even know what, just say, well, that looks good.  What's gonna happen?  You don't know what poisons you're generating or anything at that point in your life.  You know, all you know is that you've got bubbling (laughter) and something is happening, something is precipitating or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we live an age now, there's so much litigation--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean now, and the Gilbert people were the same ones that were responsible for American Flyer Trains.  And those were my favorite trains.  I didn't like a Lionel, three tracks and big ole monsters, you know.  Lionel trains [no sound].  But American Flyer, when they just, they stopped making 'em, both of 'em.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so Mr. Mitchell was your [eighth grade] science teacher [at Oakland Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was, I remember him specifically, Mr. Mitchell.  He was a good teacher.  But we had, they had teachers had asserted discipline.  The classes were never, how would say, the "Blackboard Jungle" type classes, but they were--there would be some distractions, but the teachers had significant control cause if you got out of line, you had to come up there and put the hand out (laughter), you know, or the knuckles (laughter), one or the other.  And the ruler was close by.
Speaker 2: Okay, now was there a tracking system in school to track--
Speaker 1: I don't think so.  No, no, there wouldn't have been a tracking.  That's modern (laughter), that's modern (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay, so you'd be in a classroom with all kinds of different levels of, skill levels--
Speaker 1: Skill, different skills levels.
Story_ID: 30403
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you didn't have that much homework [in elementary school].  As a matter fact, you had minimum homework.  If I remember correctly, that you would come home--our routine would be to come home, if we had chores to do, we'd do those.  And then you'd either go to the Abraham Lincoln Centre [Chicago, Illinois] or you'd go to Madden Park, go to the community center there, then come back.  And then that began to wane more because I had to work.  And I started working when I was about ten or eleven.  First, just, like I said, you had--actually, if you say working and earning money, it was probably more like nine or so 'cause those grocery stores on 39th Street, A&P and Kroger, we all, we would get wagons.  And we'd stand out in front of the store, waiting for people to come from shopping and petition and offer our wagons.  And we would carry their groceries home.  And then they'd give us some money and we'd go back.  And that's how we'd make money.  That was one way we made money.  And then I started selling "Chicago Defenders".  And I would get up early on, it was Fridays.  It was one day--I think it was a once-a-week paper then.  We'd get up, go to 35th and Indiana, I think is where we had to walk to get newspapers.  And we'd go through the neighborhood "Chicago Defender" [singing it] and just shouting it early in the morning, (laughter) waking people up, selling "Defenders".  And--
Speaker 1: So it wasn't like you had a route--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You'd just--
Speaker 2: Nah, you just, you just got your papers, and you earned whatever you got, so a nickel for every paper you sold or something like that.
Speaker 1: Because in those days, now, from I've read about the crowded nature of the Black Belt in Chicago [Illinois] in those days and I assume there's a lot of street traffic then, a lot of people in the streets?
Speaker 2: A lot of what?
Speaker 1: People in the streets to sell the papers to.
Speaker 2: Yeah, people in the streets, but a lot of time, you were just going down to, you could go over to Ellis or in the projects, just shouting, like people would come around selling "watermelons" [singing it], exactly like that (laughter).  And that was part of the culture then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I got my first paper route for a paper that no longer exist in Chicago's, "American Herald" or "Herald American", something like that.  And I was twelve years, eleven or twelve years old [ca. 1952].  And I must have delivered papers on that for about six months or so, but I remember it was in the winter when I had my first real problem, and somebody tried to, well, they did rob me.  I was in the, one of the, the part of Ida B. Wells [Housing Projects, Chicago, Illinois] where there are four-story buildings.  I don't think there were more than four or five.  And I was on the first floor, and this guy pulled a derringer [pistol] on me and wanted my money, you know.  And I, at that time, I had that, I had--the thought ran through my mind, you know, if I'm fast enough I can--I was standing in front of a door.  If I kick the door and somebody will come and I can move out of the way, like get out of the way of the bullet or something (laughter).  And that, my mind eventually came to the reality, and I gave the guy the money.  But he lived in the building, and I called, I went home and told my parents.  And then the branch manager came and I said, it's the guy upstairs.  He may have been eighteen or nineteen years old.  But nothing ever really happened.  And then, so my parents made me quit because they were worried about, you know, a repeat of that.  And then the branch, about three or four months later, the branch manager kept coming back, and then I started delivering papers again for him.  And it was okay.  And then I had a chance to deliver papers, because that was an evening paper.  So I had to deliver in the evenings, and I wanted a morning route because if it was either the "[Chicago] Tribune" or the "[Chicago] Sun-Times," you'd deliver it in the morning.  And Tribunes were so darn big relative to the Sun-Times.  So I started working for Willie Johnson over on Oakwood Boulevard.  And he's the brother of [John H.] Johnson, of the "Ebony" [Magazine].  And so I carried papers for him, my gosh, until I was graduating from high school, for about four years or so, three or four years.  And I had Oakwood Boulevard, 41st Street and in those days, you know, you'd come, get to the branch, roll up your papers, stack 'em, get 'em in your bag or you buggy.  And then I went to, and then I would deliver 'em, but then we had to go out at night to collect our money.  And so then you ran the risk of getting robbed, and I did get robbed, one of my buddies and I, we got robbed one Christmastime.  We had lots of money cause that's the time you made, you know, you got over, you got--you could come back over the Christmas holidays with thirty, thirty five dollars, with people giving you gifts.  And that was fun, obviously.  But we got, one night--
Speaker 1: It's like having a couple hundred dollars now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was a lot of money, I mean for us, it was a lot of money.  And most of it was change.  So you're walking down the street, and you're sounding like bells (laughter).  And one night, my buddy and I were coming back home, and this gang of guys came up to us with this, these sticks.  And then it was a rash of getting beat, people getting beat up with these sticks, and we were praying like heck that they would not--we gave them the money and hoped that they let us go.  And they did.  They let us go without injury.  And, but then when I had the other route in the, in Ida B. Wells [Housing Project, Chicago, Illinois] itself, another time, the guys were shooting with zip guns at me.  But zip guns was, you know, one load, and the accuracy was lousy and I ran, I got my buggy and just ran and zigzagged.  And then one time I was in another building, and I was caught in the middle--and I must have been about fifteen then, fifteen, sixteen [ca. 1956], and a guy caught me in between landings.  And we fought.  And then I got out of the building and hauled it, and got home (laughter), and I was easily a block ahead of him, you know (laughter).  And the physical fight I ever had in my life was on a paper route, and I was a senior in high school.  And I had delivered, I was delivering, this was morning.  So I'm in the morning.  It was before I went to school.  And a guy came out of nowhere on me, and we were in this building on Oakwood, off of Oakwood Boulevard.  And we again fought.  And if you make enough noise, that kind of, where people come out, and then I just hauled it.
Story_ID: 30404
Speaker 1: Now, you said that one of the concerns that your parents had about you going to Phillips High School [Chicago, Illinois] which would have been the neighborhood school, was right there on 39th [Street] or Pershing Road rather, but--
Speaker 2: That's 39th.
Speaker 1: --was fighting, you know, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, it was because, there was some concern that, you know, a lot of the individuals who went to Oakland [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] with me would be going to Phillips.  And they expressed some concern that I would be engaged a lot.
Speaker 1: So how did, was Parker [High School, Chicago, Illinois] chosen.  Now, Parker was mostly white--
Speaker 2: I had an uncle that lived in the district (laughter).  It was simple as that.
Speaker 1: This was mostly a white school in Englewood [neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois], in the Englewood section of the city [Chicago].
Speaker 2: Yeah, and cause my uncle lived over on 68th [Street] and Perry [Street].  And so that was the, it allowed me to go and my brother to go 'cause he and I both went there.  And it was a, so now, for me coming from 39th Street, moving out into the area where the upper middle class, African Americans were moving as families and what have you, and I'm coming from the projects.  And then I have to go home at night to the [Ida B. Wells Housing] projects.  I don't, there, these--I don't mix with my classmates because I don't live in the neighborhood.  And that was different.  And they would, that was when I got exposed to, in high school, you're wearing Brooks Brothers suits and this, that and the other, all this kind of bougie [bourgeois] stuff (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, there was a, I've been told there was a kind of dividing line between the kind of fellows that Brooks Brothers suits and those other guys they called "Gousters" (ph.) that wore--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that wore flashy Zoot Suits.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't ever wear a Zoot Suit or anything, but there was the crowd of individuals, and in my case, you know, I was dealing with hand-me-downs and all sorts of things.  And I bought into it as an idea, that this is the way you're supposed to evolve into.  And it corrupted my mind until I was probably a sophomore in college.
Speaker 1: So, you say it corrupted your mind.  What--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, it corrupted my mind because I lost sight of what was important in life, that it wasn't what you--where you bought your clothes or anything of that nature.  It was really what you had up here and what you could do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had to learn that the hard way, but I learned it.
Story_ID: 30405
Speaker 1: Okay, so what do you think, what was the student composition, I mean the composition of black people at Parker [High School, Chicago, Illinois], I guess the percentage maybe roughly?
Speaker 2: Well, my class was the fifty-fifty class [half black, half white].
Speaker 1: I mean when you graduated, right, it was fifty-fifty?
Speaker 2: No, it was the fifty-fifty, my class was the 50--
Speaker 1: When you started?
Speaker 2: When I started, it was the fifty-fifty class.  And, but the class of others, it could have been as high as, it could have been seventy-thirty and then the class before that, could have been eighty-twenty and then after me, it was fifty, so it would have been forty-sixty and then twenty-ninety, I mean twenty-eighty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was more and more, it became more and more African American, less, fewer Whites and then that was a much more precipitous drop than going up the curve, much more precipitous.
Speaker 1: All right, now, this is 1954?
Speaker 2: Well, I started in '54 [1954], yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, and you had Brown versus the Board of Education [of Topeka] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  I hadn't thought about that.
Speaker 1: Were you aware of it at the time?
Speaker 2: Not fully because again, the formal segregation, dejeure segregation, I mean dejeure segregation was not necessarily something you identified with in Chicago.  You just had to deal with all that de facto and just straight up using the rules and things and things to keep you out, but it was all legal.  I mean it wasn't, they weren't doing anything illegal in the context of there was a law that says you could not come.  Like there wasn't no law that said you could not eat at Stouffers downtown on State Street, but it was hell eating at Stouffers downtown, going down to those stores on State was difficult.  And you definitely didn't go over to Mayor [Richard J.] Daley's [in office 1955-1976] neighborhood [Bridgeport] or Back of the Yards [Chicago neighborhood] or--
Speaker 1: Bridgeport [Chicago neighborhood].
Speaker 2: Bridgeport or any--I had this incident happen.  I feel asleep.  My brother and I had gone to, three of my brothers to, three of us had gone to Riverview Park.  So you go out to Western [Avenue] and you take Western, and it was out, it was the North Side on Western.  And so to get home, you just take the bus or the streetcar--it was the streetcar then, down Western to 39th Street and then you'd catch the 39th Street bus and come east.  I fell asleep, and it was a crowded train, streetcar, and my brother must have thought I got up, I mean he thought I had gotten up with them.  And I hadn't, but I had fallen asleep.  So I'm up to 42nd [Street] or 43rd [Street] and Western until I realized that I'm on the bus, I'm on this thing--I'm in the wrong part of the world being over on Western to begin with 'cause generally, the line, by that time, at that time, even Halsted was, Halsted was the line, the ultimate line.  And so I got off, and I just started walking.  So I'm walking from Western on 39th Street, going home.  And I get around the, there's used to be an [United States] Army training, not training, research center on Pershing [Avenue] close to Western.  And these three guys came up to me, and I'm--they wanted to know what I'm doing.  (Laughter) And I'm, and I'm gauging them.  And I'm thinking, how can I pull this one off, and then I just put on the after burners and got, you know, got ahead of 'em sufficient that it was no issue.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this is--what we're discussing here is dangerous, dangerous--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there was a boy named Lenard Clark, that's the last one.  I haven't been in Chicago for six years, but ten years ago [sic, 1998], I guess, Lenard Clark was beaten with baseball bats for going up under the viaduct into Bridgeport.
Speaker 2: Umm.
Speaker 1: It's still, you know, so I'm saying, you can still encounter this years after.
Speaker 2: After, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: But it's, you know, so--
Speaker 2: And I had that, extension that I used to deliver telegrams.  So I, one of the jobs I had growing up was being a telegram deliverer, and you use your bikes.  And the station, I think, was like on 47th [Street], but we went as far as 63rd [Street] and over to South Shore [Chicago neighborhood] almost and maybe over past Wentworth and down to 35th [Street] or so.  That was our--and that's rain, sleet, snow and everything.  We're riding our bikes out there, and I'd have to go in some of these neighborhoods, I don't know what I'm gonna run into, you know, delivering a telegram (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, yeah, it's a, you had the viaducts and dividing lines of Chicago, would have to be learned to, and it's survival really.
Speaker 2: It was survival.
Story_ID: 30406
Speaker 1: So now, at Parker [High School, Chicago, Illinois] itself, now, how were you treated at Parker, and did you continue, I mean was school, you know, still fun for you?
Speaker 2: It was still fun.  It was still fun.  There were, when there would be problems on the--there were fights and things that, that was driven by race, after-school type activities.  There weren't that many.  I remember one in our, that, maybe I was a sophomore or freshman, it was pretty bad.  But after that, it was pretty, it was by and large relatively quiet, relatively quiet.
Speaker 1: Okay, so sort of a--
Speaker 2: It was, you know, it's sort of like the different leaders or individuals who had leadership skills worked together, and it was in my class, if I remember correctly.  So it solved itself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because, cause when I graduated, I ran for class vice president, and it was touch and go.  So it was a matter of being a politician and (laughter), and getting the vote, getting enough White votes (laughter) and convincing the brothers and sisters (unclear) they should go my way.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you lettered in track and then you were in the band?
Speaker 2: The band, I actually was the manager for the band.  My brother was the assistant manager.  Track, I did a lot of stuff with science.
Speaker 1: Now, okay, well, let's dwell on the science though for a minute.  I didn't wanna stop here.
Speaker 2: I was involved in science fairs, yeah, I mean student honor roll and that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were an honor student in school?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And did you have a favorite teacher or mentor in school [Parker High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: There were teachers I liked.  There's one everybody refers to, is Ms. Odell and her green forms, her green--she was an English teacher.  And she was the classical, strict English teacher.  And she had forms after forms and forms, but, and it's sort of like a love-hate relationship.  But you felt that you learned a lot from Ms. Odell, and I think, when I go back on Classmates.com and people will make comments, they'll talk about Ms. Odell.  And she was tough.  And then Ms. Eddy who was the mathematician, the math teacher.  She was really tough.  But, again, it's sort of like tough, but you learned a lot and you, and you just made the adjustments to strictness.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the chemistry teacher, I had a good relationship with him.  As a matter of fact, I used to help him in, set up experiments and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you work in the lab or as a volunteer in the lab as a student?
Speaker 2: No, I mean it was just, I had a knack for being in--when we'd do our experiments, and then he, I did well on the exams and just one of the people he had make up solutions and if we were doing a fermentation, watch the fermentation and check on it and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Now, did your Gilbert Chemistry set help you in this regard in terms of becoming more--
Speaker 2: No, it's just, I think, you know, each of us have, you just come here, and there's a certain thing that, you just look at it, and it just feels good.  And the chemistry set just re-enforced but it was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 30407
Speaker 1: And because when I was a kid, I don't know if you ever remember this program, "Mr. Cox".  Mr. Cox came on every Sunday, and, around 6:00 o'clock, and this would--everybody, you know, it was one of those TV, those rare TV moments cause there weren't a whole lot of TV shows.  And you'd sit up and look at Mr. Cox, and what I was always excited about, it wasn't so much "Mr. Cox", the program, but DuPont had commercials to come on.  And their commercials, in those days commercials were ten minutes (laughter), fifteen minutes, they were long commercials.  And I would sit and just wait for the new DuPont commercial each week because at that time they were into synthetics, and "Better Life Through Chemistry" and all of this excitement that would come.  And I could just sit there and marvel.  And, you know, this was, I was at, I was--
Speaker 2: There was a Wally Cox show.
Speaker 1: Wally Cox, yeah.
Speaker 2: Wally Cox, right.  I remember Wally Cox, skinny guy with a bowtie--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: --with big glasses.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Wally Cox, that's right.
Speaker 2: He was kind of like what you would call a nerd today.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, but the, DuPont were the people who were sponsoring it, "Better Life Through Chemistry" and plastics and they--I would just sit there and marvel at them taking all of this, putting chemistry to work and making all of these different kind of materials and what have you.  And I just, I saw myself as synthetic chemist.
Speaker 2: Now, did Wally Cox play a scientist on the show at all?
Speaker 1: I don't think so.
Speaker 2: I know it was a comedy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a comedy.  No, I don't think he was a scientist.  He was kind of a nerdy kind of guy, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but it was, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can't remember either what his profession was.  But I remember the show, yeah.
Speaker 1: But it was, the commercials were what really drew me or I looked forward to on Sundays, was the commercial.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, did you like the Walt Disney specials on Science when you were growing up?
Speaker 1: I don't remember any Walt Disney specials on science at that time.
Speaker 2: Maybe he did it later on.  I know in my generation they did that like "Futureland" and they would talk about--
Speaker 1: No, they had "Mr. Wizard."  He was good.
Speaker 2: Don Herbert, right.
Speaker 1: And that was about, that's all I really remember.
Story_ID: 30408
Speaker 1: We're rolling again.  Okay, all right, we have speed again.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, did you pay attention to, were you impressed by science fiction and that sort of thing when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Not, I mean I would read once in a while, science fiction, but not too much.  I mean some of the movies, you know, "Flash Gordon" [1980] and that kind of stuff, "Mr. Ming" and more horror type stuff, more so, but I think in science, straight up science stuff.  But they always had the crazy scientist, you know, that was--in a lot of, so many movies would have the crazy scientist.  Now, you didn't necessarily identify with the craziness, but it was like buttons (laughter), you know, that kind of stuff.  And then the museum, and the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois] was an exciting--it was a laboratory in and of itself because it was so interactive.  And you could just go there and just have a field day.
Speaker 1: Now, were your parents and community, like encouraging in terms of your interest in science?
Speaker 2: My parents [Hosea Watson and Catherine Pauline Berkley] supported me the best they could support me.  They didn't know anything about it.  I mean basic, in other words, this is what I had an interest in and if I asked for something that they could do, they tended to support it.  Yeah, they tended to support it.
Speaker 1: Did you know any black scientists growing up or did anybody?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  I didn't, I mean the only thing I knew was Percy Julian [African American chemist] and a lot of it was tied into all of the housing problems he had out in Cicero.  It was that kind of awareness, trying to move in and all of the hassling--
Speaker 1: Right, I think his porch was bombed on set on fire or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that kind of stuff.  And, but I never, I didn't ever meet him.  I knew he was a chemist, and that was about it.  I did meet someone who worked in his company later on in my life, but--
Speaker 1: But at the time, you--so you had no active role model you could talk to?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  It was, again, it's that explore, you know, you're on your horse, and you're doing, not a random drift, but you're doing a drift.
Speaker 1: Now, were your science teachers at Parker [High School, Chicago, Illinois] white teachers primarily?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And the chemistry teacher just made, he was a grumpy old man (laughter) for the (unclear), but he was, but it was exciting, you know.  He was one of those kind of guys that would tell one of these corny jokes, and, but it would have some relationship to the science.  And he made chemistry very exciting, at least to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're saying you got good grades.  You were like an honor student, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 30409
Speaker 1: And when it came time for you to become a senior, did you--well, you had to be considering college, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, but college, considering college was what could be possible financially.  It was never at the level of thinking of going away to school.  That was just totally out.  I mean it wasn't, it was not in the equation, just no way could I even consider it because my parents were in no position to support an activity--I don't care how limited it was.  They were in no position to do it.  And I didn't know enough about the outside world in terms of applying to colleges and what, and so the thing you would do is either go to [Woodrow] Wilson Junior College [later Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois], Chicago State [University]--
Speaker 1: Well, Chicago Teachers College in those days.
Speaker 2: Teachers College then, yeah, and then, or [University of Illinois] Navy Pier [Chicago, Illinois].  You could go downstate, but Navy Pier would be, is home.
Speaker 1: And that was the University of Illinois branch.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was the branch that was out at Navy Pier, a two-year branch.
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't ask this.  Before we get you out of your youth, was church a big factor in growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah.  I went to Monumental Baptist Church over there on Oakwood Boulevard.  And they always had, I mean many summers we went to summer bible school, I suppose it was called.  And, but they had a lot of activities.  My father was very engaged at the church.  My mother wasn't.  And it was a wonderful, it was another outlet, another community activity.  And then we're going to Abraham Lincoln Centre [Chicago, Illinois], you go to Monumental.  They had, they would have things going on.
Speaker 1: And right across from each other.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right across the street.  And so, and then all of your, you know, a lot of your buddies or your playmates went to Monumental and so, it was a--I have very, when I go back to Chicago, and I have the, have time over a weekend, I will go back to Monumental.  And I think the last time I went was about maybe five years ago.  I was surprised to see some of my old Sunday school teachers were still upright (laughter).  You know, they were still moving vertically (laughter).  That was a shock.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, so well, you gotta, you think you gotta stay in town to go to school.  Let's see, oh, before we get you out of high school, now there are several individuals that you went to school, that graduated with you that are notable people that we should mention.  I think Mavis Staples is one.
Speaker 2: Mavis, Mavis Staples [African American singer] was in my class.  Tom Burrell was in my class, and there are other individuals, obviously, but they just stuck out and I just said, you know, cause--
Speaker 1: Oh, we mentioned Bob Hambrick (ph.) too.
Speaker 2: And Bob Hambrick, yeah.
Speaker 1: He won a state championship at Simeon High School [later Simeon Career Academy].
Speaker 2: So, yeah, that's, it was a number of--out of that school, and it's really, I don't know how else to say this, we had our fiftieth class reunion in 2007.  And about 50 percent of the class showed up.  You know, there's a certain number who are no longer with us and then there's all these women who have married and we couldn't chase them down with their name.  And I, as I said, it was a fifty-fifty class.  We had about a fifty-fifty mix, and that was good, I mean worked at it in a real way to achieve that, and we achieved it in the sense that we had a planning committee that was diverse.  It wasn't all the black students who stayed in Chicago kind of thing.  And, but what is very clear, if you now line up and say, you know, who, what were the trajectories, and what were people--how far did they do the long jump, brothers and sisters have done well, very well, very well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so a lot of people with decent careers came out of--
Speaker 2: They had lawyers, had been successful teachers.  There's a teacher who was a, became a principal, Diane Smith.  She now lives in the suburbs, but she had become a big-time principal in Chicago.  We just had some good people that came out of that class.
Story_ID: 30410
Speaker 1: Okay, now, from what I understand, and correct me if I'm wrong, I think during that period of time Parker's [High School] campus was shared or a part or was adjacent to [Woodrow] Wilson Junior College [later, Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Wilson and the Chicago State [University] were right there, [Chicago] Teachers College was right there.
Speaker 1: So they were on the same campus?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it made it easy to--so which one did you decide to?
Speaker 2: I went to [University of Illinois] Navy Pier, I started out at Navy Pier.  And it had, it had a history of what we would call in the neighborhood as you go to the place to go for tomahawk because a lot of people went to Navy Pier (laughter), and very few survived Navy Pier cause the normal flow was to go to Navy Pier and then go downstate.  Well, you know, the chop-chop would come with the tomahawk, boy, and you'd be whew.  And there'd be very few that would get under, get away from it.  And I had my difficulties because I was, I got caught up into Joe College life.  I had to work, but that was okay, but I then, you know, I pledged for a fraternity [Alpha Kappa Alpha].  I got, started doing all this, trying to see if I could get my Brooks Brothers shirts and all that other stupid stuff.  And I suffered, and the only thing that I excelled in, independent of my environment, sort of like that poem, you know, if you can withstand all of what's going on, you're a man my son, you know.  With all this other stuff, the only thing that survived was in chemistry, I've never gotten a grade lower than a "B" in chemistry, never.  And but, I went in thinking I was gonna be a chemical engineer, and that was the dumbest decision I ever made because, again, chemical engineering had surfaced like the Wally Cox and the synthetic chemistry, chemical engineering had, was, man, that's the place to go, is to into chemical engineering.  I like chemistry, and I didn't realize--and I had real appreciation for engineering that the chemistry, chemical engineering, that adjective was an adjective on engineering, but engineering was really where it was at (laughter).  And I remember going to Navy Pier and they said, if you wanna be a chemical engineer, you've gotta take drafting.  I had never taken drafting.  And so most of the students in, my classmates who were going in engineering and stuff like that had taken drafting in high school.  And it was very clear that was not for me.  So I jumped out of that one really quick, after the first semester.  I can't--chemical engineering wasn't it.  Chemistry is it.  But, and I wasn't a pipefitter either (laughter).  So, and then I, you know, like I say, I got bad grades and had to be--I went, I had to drop out.  I went, no, I was asked to kind of ease my way out, and I went to Wilson and regained my composure, came back to Navy Pier and then just went totally downhill in terms of seriousness.  And so then I had to get a job, and really a, a real job.  So I got a job and I worked at the [United States] Post Office, but I was driving a truck, picking up mail from the boxes and special deliveries.
Speaker 1: Now, how old were you then?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was, let's see I graduated from high school when I was 17.  So--
Speaker 1: And that's '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: Eighteen or nineteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So you came out in '58 [1958], is that right?
Speaker 2: '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Fifty seven [1957], okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And then I, somewhere in there I met my wife [Valerie Modia Landry] (laughter).  I met her actually at Navy Pier, and we got married in 1960--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --because we just celebrated our fiftieth wedding anniversary in October.
Speaker 1: Her name is Valerie, right?
Speaker 2: Valerie, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So did you meet in class or at school or did you meet as a (unclear)--
Speaker 2: We met because she was pledging Delta [Sigma Theta Sorority] and I was pledging Alpha [Kappa Alpha].  That's how we met.  But we were both going to Navy Pier, but our paths were, didn't cross naturally because she's a year younger than I am.
Story_ID: 30411
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  It says you were hired by the American Institute of Baking [AIB] as a Research Assistant.
Speaker 2: Okay, so after I worked at the [United States] Post Office, working at the Post Office, and I started going to IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology] at night, and at some point I saw a notice for a job at the American Institute of Baking for a lab technician.  And so I applied and got the job, and that was a good job.  That changed my mind about chemistry immensely because they would work with nutritional biochemistry.  They were, it was a research institute for the baking industry.  So they were working with how to bake bread, they used different flours and this, that and the other.  But they had a research arm that dealt with physiology and nutrition, nutrition as part of that.  And so they would try to see what kinds of supplements to add to the flours or to use grains that were rich in certain amino acids and what have you.  So we would do experiments where we'd feed rats diets that had supplements in them and monitor a variety of end points.  And because it was chemistry with life, that just took me to another whole level.  It took me away from straight up synthetic chemistry.  It's like, wow, this is fun, and that's what I, it was that experience that converted me to want to become a biochemist rather than a straight up syn--organic synthetic chemist.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you were--about how many people were employed by the American Institute of Baking?
Speaker 2: Well, in the laboratory, there were about four research laboratories and out of that, maybe each lab had about five people in it.  But in the other side where the bakers were, you know, it could have been fifty people over there.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were, as a researcher there, you were in a kind of a smaller, more elite group, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yes, and that's why I learned a lot about life.  I'll never, you know, I can't minimize the higher beings, putting these (laughter) (unclear) meg course corrections in my life because that's when I learned there were individuals and there were PhDs and Masters from elite institutions who were buying their clothes as Sears, bringing their lunch (laughter).  And my whole concept was, make enough money to get my Brooks Brothers and buy my lunch (laughter).  And I learned, you know, that, that's when I learned that, you know, I was focusing on the wrong thing.  And so, and that whole lifestyle change was very important, and from that point on--because when I went to IIT, I had the advantage of I was working on a laboratory, had worked in a laboratory for almost three years.  I knew how to do science, how to design experiments and things of that nature.  I could handle myself with equipment in the laboratory.  And I was just dealing with the didactic and that came relatively easy.  It really did.
Story_ID: 30412
Speaker 1: Okay, so when the brought you in, like, I imagine it was an entry-level kind of position?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just a lab tech, feeding animals, feeding rats, and being available to feed 'em on the weekend, and some limited chemical, some limited analyses.  Sometimes you'd do total nitrogen's, where you just, after every experiments we'd gather five rats per group, freeze 'em up, grind 'em up, so we got a nice homogeneous.  And we'd take the sample out and do a nitrogen, a Kjeldahl total nitrogen analysis or look for something else, some other analysis.  And over time I learned a lot of different techniques.  And I, then I even became a person who was involved with the nutritional test groups.  So they wanted to do, find out about the levels of vitamins in particular food stuffs.  Then I would be part of the, I would be the person doing those analysis.  And so it was a good learning experience.
Speaker 1: Now, were you the only person there that didn't have a Ph.D. or a master's degree or something?
Speaker 2: Probably every lab had technicians that didn't have degrees, one or two technicians.
Speaker 1: Were you the only black person employed?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, 'cause the (unclear), remember I said, it was a person I met who worked in Percy Julian's lab.  He was, that's where I met him, was there, but then he left after a year or so.  So I was the only person going in and out of the building (laughter).
Speaker 1: He helped you, did he help you get adjusted?
Speaker 2: No, he was in a different lab, different lab.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we talked and things, yeah, he was telling me about what he did with Percy [Julian] and things of that nature.  But he was older than I was, and we had not--we didn't develop a drinking-buddy type of relationship or anything (laughter), just a nice guy, and that was it.
Story_ID: 30413
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you work there all through the rest of, I mean, you know, through school, through IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology]?
Speaker 2: No, when I decided to go back to school full time, I quit the job.  And then I went back, my father--since my father [Hosea Watson] worked at the [United States] Post Office, so semester breaks, summers or Christmas holiday type thing, I would get jobs at the Post Office.  I was married by then and my wife [Valeria Modia Landry] was working, so we lived on campus at IIT.  And then I got a research summer fellowship at IIT, and then I got a scholarship at IIT.
Speaker 1: Okay, so who were some of your mentors at IIT?  Or is there any special teachers there that--
Speaker 2: There was Jane, Jane--it's with an "M", but I can't remember her last name now.  She was my person I dealt a lot with in biochemistry 'cause I worked in her lab, and she--then Ms., Dr. Rawl--Rouch (ph.).  He was an old-time, very strict biochemist, I mean, yeah, he was a biochemist there cause I was taking a lot of upper division courses with graduate-type students at night.  And I was an undergraduate.  And I'll never forget one exam I had with Dr. Rouch.  He refused to give me a hundred.  I got ninety-nine on it, and this, it was something like I'd spelled a word wrong (laughter) or something he, he was not gonna give me a hundred on it (laughter).  But he, but he was a decent man.  He was very traditional.  And in the chemistry department, I got to work with Dr. Kreski (ph.).  I liked him.  All of the people in the biology department I had a good relationship with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause, I had to be a biology major with a biochemistry minor--option.  And so I took a lot of courses in the chemistry department, but my degree had to come out of the biology department.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you do a lot of lab work when you were at IIT?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  I worked in the lab all the time.  I mean lab, lab work for me was just a, just excitement to be in the lab.  I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you got your B.A. in 1964?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Twenty-four years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it took me seven years to get through college (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, you had a Commonwealth Edison Academic Scholarship?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that scholarship has its own history.  IIT, so there's, we're talking about this time.  I was living n campus.  My wife and I were living on campus.  It was only a handful of African American students on campus, living on campus.  One of the people was one of the Little Rock Nine women [Gloria Ray Karlmark].  And we were, I was constantly getting stopped by the campus police, ride my bike around the campus, would come home, I'd be coming home late or my wife and I would be coming back from Sunday school over on, in the neighborhood, and we'd be putting our bikes in the basement.  And the cops would stop us.  And it's only a handful of us there, and I said, wait a minute.  This is crazy.  And I'd get stopped in the middle of the night coming home from the lab.  So I lodged a complaint.  And I got some level of response, but then it still happened again.  So then I had my department chair involved, and then eventually, it got to the dean of the college.  And he wanted to talk with me.  And it just so happened, it was, I was one of two students who had got straight "A's" that year, that semester.  And I had been awarded this scholarship, some prestigious scholarship, by name.  And he said, so through talking and he knew I needed money.  So he said, well, we have this Commonwealth Edison Scholarship for Colored Students.  It's never been used (laughter).  And it was more money than this very prestigious scholarship.  And I'm, being poor and needing money, I jumped on it.  And I look back on it, I reflect on it and said, you know, the records will never show that I had this, that I had, or a person such as me had won this other scholarship because I got the Commonwealth Edison.  It was, had never been used and it was for Colored students.  And, but that was, it was a decision I made and it was driven by money.  I didn't have that kind of knowledge then anyway, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, people nowadays would assume it was some affirmative action thing that got you, but it was hard work.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 30414
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you begin working with the United States Public Health Service--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay--
Speaker 1: --in '64 [1964].  Is that true, in '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: I graduated from IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] in '64 [1964], January of '64 [1964].  And then I started graduate at the University of Illinois, at their medical center [University of Illinois, Chicago Medical Center].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And soon after that I applied for a United States Public Health Graduate Student Fellowship, and I got it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was an advantage because now I had a certain amount of autonomy relative to the institution.  I didn't have to do--I didn't have to become a teaching assistant or do other things cause my money was coming in from good ole Uncle Sam.  And I had a wonderful, wonderful thesis advisor who passed--I just found out he passed last year, James Hayashi [1926-2010].  And he would supplement my income through his grant.  So I did, you know, and my wife was still working, but then she started, yeah, we started having kids and so she wasn't working.  But I had enough money to get through graduate school, you know, at that time.  You know, three thousand dollars a month was like you're in fat city (laughter).  You're walking to school and didn't have a car and didn't have to pay taxes (laughter).
Story_ID: 30415
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you were describing your [graduate] thesis [at University of Illinois Medical Center].
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, so I was, my thesis was on the glyceraldehyde metabolism.  Now, what is glyceraldehyde?  Glyceraldehydes is a three carbon compound that has two kinds of functional groups on it.  One of 'em is an aldehyde (laughter) and then it has two hydroxyl groups on it.  And so on each carbon, there's a functional group.  So one of 'em has a carbonyl which is the aldehyde and then two, the remaining two have hydroxyl groups.  If you put two glyceraldehydes together and some, a little bit of chemistry, you make glucose, the sixth carbon sugar.  So it's a three-carbon sugar, okay.  And my thesis advisor, James Hayashi and his colleague were always interested, they'd look at finding bacteria or organisms in nature that could destroy certain products, natural or unnatural kinds of products.  Glyceraldehyde is a by-product in the petroleum industry.  And they wanted to understand how is glyceraldehyde metabolized by organisms or is there anything, anybody out there that would eat it.  And so they got sludge from different places around the world.  And lo and behold, there was this one particular organism, the Rhodotoria glutinis would metabolize it as a sole carbon source.  In other words, you would essentially just glyceraldehyde there and some salts and ask, is anybody gonna grow.  And this one mold grew.  And, but you didn't know how it metabolized the glyceraldehyde.  So that's, that was my question, was to find out, okay, this organism grows in it, and it seems to be happy growing in it.  Then how is it doing it?  How, what is it doing to that molecule to be able to get its energy to make its building blocks.  And so I focused primarily on the initial reactions.  What did it have to do?  One, it has to take it in, and two, did it just start--what did it do, the first thing, to this molecule to begin to convert it into different things?  And one of the steps was that it reduced it to glycerol.  And then it phosphorylated it to glycerol-three phosphate.  And then from that, from that place, you can make almost anything if you're a very creative organism.  And you can get energy because you get, when you take something like glucose, sugar, regular dextrose, the process in metabolizing it is eventually to split it into two, three-carbon molecules.  You get to a common place and it's common nature--it's almost a common pathway for all organisms once you get it to that place.  And you can build from it, generate energy, do anything.  So that's, and so that's what I found out, and in that process, we were able to identify a specific enzyme [NADPH-dependent aldehyde reductase].  And that's why the glycerol, glyceraldehyde paper is there because we could measure glycerol and now we had an enzyme that could reduce glyceraldehyde to glycerol cause you could measure glycerol.  So you could do things in a systematic way if you had a measure of the two.  You could measure with, in the absence of my enzyme that I found and then in the presence of it, and you'd just subtract, and you get a total--cause they'd reduce it to glycerol and then you measure total glycerol.  And then you'd just measure in the absence of my enzyme, you'd just glycerol.  Subtract the two and you know how much glyceraldehyde is there.  So it was, and it was a nice project, nice organism to work with, very--since it was one of the few things that could grow on it, didn't have to worry about contamination of the issue, I'm not contaminating my cultures (laughter) 'cause nothing else was gonna grow on it.
Story_ID: 30416
Speaker 1: Now, I hope I'm following--what's the name of the organism?
Speaker 2: Rhodotoria--
Speaker 1: Rhodotoria.
Speaker 2: Glutinis, Rhodotoria--
Speaker 1: How do you spell--
Speaker 2: Ah.
Speaker 1: It's a fungus basically?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a mold.  All I was looking for was the seeing if my Ph.D. thesis was around.
Speaker 1: Rhodotoria--
Speaker 2: Glutinis.
Speaker 1: Glutinis, all right, so this is a mold that would grow on--
Speaker 2: Glyceraldehyde.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, you could have taken another compound and another mold--but one of the things that bacteriologists are always doing is finding out, is there something out there that can metabolize as a sole carbon source, this or a sole, you know, organisms that grow on sulfur.  You know, when you look at it, how is something gonna grow on sulfurs, but they, the mechanisms are there to convert the sulfur to get it in an oxidized form.  And then you generate energy and before you know it, you've got a whole organism with carbon and the whole nine yards.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this fungus produces a enzyme [NADPH-dependent aldehyde reductase] that can metabolize, you said, petroleum?
Speaker 2: Well, it needed an enzyme to get it to a place that's now normal for most cells.
Speaker 1: Okay, but I'm trying to ask, does it metabolize petroleum by-products or something?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, when we were doing this, that was the driving force for them asking that question cause (laughter) they had these big gallons of glyceraldehyde from Shell Oil and that was the motivation to see if something could grow.  And it was intellectual.  We weren't getting any funding from Shell or anything of this nature.  It was an intellectual discussion, I mean question.  But what came out of it was that, with one of the things of cataracts is that you get the fluid--glaucoma, I'm sorry, glaucoma, you get the fluid build up.  And that's because you get polyols, like poly--six-carbon compounds that reduce sugar.  Basically, all six carbons have hydroxyl groups on 'em.  And those hydroxyl groups hold water, and so you get pressure and that causes the glaucoma.  Well, if you can have an enzyme or something that could interfere with that--drug rather, that can interfere with the reduction of glus-glyceryl, glucose to this polyol, sorbital or something of this, just a polyol, you have, if you can block that reaction, then you can reduce the formation and accumulation of the polyol.  So what happened was that we tested a compound on this reductase [NADPH-dependent aldehyde reductase] that I found.  We were looking for inhibitors too.  And it worked, and he said, well, maybe it's the same enzyme that causes the reduction of glucose to the polyol.  And lo and behold, it had pretty much the same properties.  And so it was a lot of work, they--after I left they spent a lot of work--time trying to identify drugs using that enzyme that I had discovered as a model to screen for potential enzymes that would inhibit polyol production from glucose.
Speaker 1: So were they ever successful in coming up with something?
Speaker 2: I think they had mixed results, you know.  I think they are, there are treatments with some of these inhibitors, reductase inhibitors for glaucoma.  But, you know, I never followed it.  It was not an interest of mine, but I know he [Watson's mentor, Dr. James Hyashi] and Dr. [C.C.] Doughty began to pursue that, particularly, Dr. Doughty.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is your thesis.  Now, but in '68 [1968], you earned your Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Illinois Medical Center, campus in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was your dissertation?
Speaker 2: It was that.  It was--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --the metabolism of glyceraldehyde, glyceraldehyde metabolism, by Rhodotoria [glutinis].
Story_ID: 30417
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you were done, you didn't really have a big interest in pursuing it?
Speaker 2: I was interested in metabolism.  In other words, my focus now was the generic area of metabolism, carbohydrate or fat metabolism.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I didn't have that much interest in protein metabolism, but it was carbohydrate or fat and I don't know if it was at that time, certain aspects of long-chain, fatty acid metabolism was exciting or it was obesity issues, triglyceride accumulation, all of this.  But I ended up going to work with John Lowenstein at Brandeis [University, Waltham, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he worked on regulation of fatty acid synthesis, the formation of long-chain fatty acid.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to Brandeis?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, as a post-doc.
Speaker 1: Okay, now we didn't even have that in here, so I've gotta right.  So when did you go to Brandeis?
Speaker 2: It was immediately after (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1968, then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, actually, it was--I finished up, cause it, I had to come back for graduation so that made it '68 [1968].  But I actually had finished up, I'd missed the reg--the '67 [1967] graduation, but I was at Brandeis in '67 [1967], that September of '67 [1967] or August of '67 [1967], I was at Brandeis.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were working with Dr. John Lowenstein?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, well, tell us about that experience.  So were you teaching too at that--?
Speaker 2: No, no.  When you're a post-doc, that's your grace period because this is the opportunity now to bring together the fact that you can read the language, you can write synthesis and paragraphs and everything.  And you are now to focus and hone your skills.  You don't have any demands other than to be productive.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I mean you can, some people ask for other things.  But I didn't ask for anything (laughter).  That's for certain.  It was just a--then I, again, if you get a fellowship or something like that, just focus on what you're doing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were working on fat metabolism?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was fatty acid, long-chain, fatty acid synthesis, the regulation of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was your daily routine, I guess, at Brandeis?
Speaker 2: Well, and these were test tube, animal experi--animal and test tube experiments.  So we would feed animals unique diets.  And then we would, and these diets would be oriented toward causing a tremendous accumulation of fat in the liver.  And as a consequence of that, enzymes, a lot of enzymes related to fat embolism would go up sky high.  And so we were trying to understand which, identify which enzymes were going up, what kinds of dietary changes caused the accumulation of the fat, tri, primarily, triglycerides in the liver and then how you can, where were the vulnerable potential parts for regulation in this whole process, both at the level of what's natural but also as potential targets for drugs.  And 'cause you, all of this stuff, a lot of it--things have changed immensely now in the sense that we can now knock out enzymes.  We can knock out genes.  Before, everything was focused on using a drug, trying to find a drug to block here and then ask the question, what happened?  But you can knock out the darn gene (laughter), and say, what happened, you know.  And you can in, and you can go right into the whole animal.  You couldn't just--sometimes the drugs wouldn't cross barriers, and you just couldn't go to whole animal experiments right off.
Story_ID: 30418
Speaker 1: So chemistry's changed over the years in terms of the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I mean it's, as a, and it's just the nature of science.  It's that there's been different areas that have come together and the lines that used to separate them are no longer real.  Technology has changed so that experiments that you couldn't even think about doing, you can now do.  And you can get more precise answers 'cause a lot of those drugs, you know, every, it's like, what's the comment?  Nothing is poisonous and everything is poisonous.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a warning on every drug now that's advertised, even the ones that have (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because if you don't have anything, if you don't eat anything, that's poisonous (laughter).  And any compound is poisonous if you take too much of it.  Water is poisonous, if you drink too much water, it's poisonous.
Story_ID: 30419
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1969, you were hired by the University of California [San Francisco]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at San Francisco, and this is the job that you spent your--
Speaker 2: I spent the whole nine yards, but I didn't come here with that idea.  I was gonna ride it, ride it to the ground.
Speaker 1: Well, how did it come about?  How did you end up here?
Speaker 2: It came about because I was looking--again, this is mindset, where I came from, my roots.  I thought people who were in Academia came from a certain class.  And I wasn't from that class (laughter).  So I was looking at industry.  I had, I was looking at drug companies.  It was like I was--the thing for me was, I've paid my dues.  Now, I need to find me a place to work, a place that will minimize the foot of society up my butt, and earn some money, have a comfortable life.  And the drug companies were that at one point.  In your mind, in terms of thinking, they were the more likely place.  The next place would be government, but academe, no way.  And I was almost ready to Pfizer [pharmaceutical company] and a matter of fact, I had the papers, and my postdoctoral mentor [John Lowenstein] had gotten a phone call 'cause somebody had heard about me (laughter) out here.  And he said, you should go out to the University of California and interview for the job.  And even if you don't get tenure, you get the job and you don't get tenure, don't worry about cause you've been at the University of California, and the University of California, its standards are so high that you could go some other place and walk in with tenure.  It was like, you know, you've been running with the rangers, and so (laughter), you go some other place, there would be no issue.  And I debated and debated.  I said, okay, I'll come out to California.  And I, you know, I remember getting off the plane and never been to San Francisco before.  And they took me to restaurants and did things that I had never done before in my life.  And then I met the people, students and what have you, and I said, okay, if they offer me a job, I'll give it five years, seven years.  Seven years was if, you're either up or out.  You know, if you don't get tenure in seven years, you gotta get your hat.  And so I said, I'm still young enough.  I could take a chance.  Took a chance, and everything worked out.
Speaker 1: Now, well, tell us about, two guys are mentioned here, Dr. John S. Wellington and Dr. William J. Rudder.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, when I came, the reason they were around searching for high melanin content personnel was that, that's in that '69 [1969], that area, a lot of turmoil.  And this institution had, this particular campus [University of California, San Francisco] had made a commitment that 25 percent, a goal of 25 percent of its entering classes for the dental school, nursing school, medical school and pharmacy school would be under-represented minorities.  And so the medical school was taking the lead on that.  And they wanted, they felt that, not only they wanted a faculty member who could run in that race, but they wanted someone to be engaged in the new venture.  And so I, my interest has always, I always had some political and social interests, and I was engaged in any place along my earlier times, I was engaged in different things, not always in the academic arena, but I was a lot of the stuff the marching against Mayor [Richard J.] Daley and March on Washington [1963], a lot of different things I did--
Story_ID: 30420
Speaker 1: Were you active when Dr. King [Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Chicago and San Francisco--
Speaker 2: We had, a little.  I went one march with him, one march with, they were engaged in Gar--that place where there were housing issues.
Speaker 1: Cicero?
Speaker 2: That's on 55th [Street], going west [Gage Park].
Speaker 1: West, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so then, so anyway, I said okay--
Speaker 1: So, I just started to thinking.  We haven't mentioned this in this particular interview, but it's probably well known by a lot of people, but there, after the murder of Dr. King [1968], there were riots all over the country and heightened interest in trying to do something to mollify black discontent and some of the horror that white people even felt about what the country was becoming, right?  That's what you were referring to when they were--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, you know, cause it was, it--I had this, I don't wanna call it a dilemma, but I had this issue I had to deal with.  I, here I am with a Ph.D. or would, I'm in training for such.  I got the skill, but where, you know, is it just for me?  And that was one of the reasons that helped me make a decision of not going to Groton, Connecticut because the Pfizer, because Pfizer was, I'd be doing well, but I'd be in a town and 99.9 percent of the African Americans there were at a very lower socio-economic side and I would be out there in an isolated place.  I'd be doing good, but, financially, but it wasn't me.  And so it was like coming to a place such as this [University of California, San Francisco], which is a diverse city, and then they had this activity that was going on.  And it seemed you could now bring all that together, as long as I could survive in the academic arena.  And with John Wellington, he was the Associate Dean for Student Affairs in the School of Medicine, and I came in as Assistant Dean for Student Affairs and as an assistant professor in biochemistry.  So I had a job description--
Speaker 1: So the (unclear) (simultaneous)--okay.
Speaker 2: --was fifty-fifty.  And, but the university here was very, the people at that time were very, very good about this.  They said, look, your primary importance and responsibility is to survive as an academician.  John [Wellington] said, you know, John and the dean would cover my but with regard down to the student affairs, even though that was part of my responsibility.  But, you know, if you gotta make a decision on any time--[oh, you're going to turn that lamp.  Okay, just turn the light out.  Go, all the way at the top.]  And, your most important thing is to survive as an academician and this other stuff as assistant dean, you know, that can come in later.  And they gave me the time.  And they also served as a wonderful, he and the dean, helped me financially in terms of getting my lab together, and when I ran into issues about needing more equipment and stuff like that, I didn't have to necessarily go to my department chair.  I went to the dean.  And the dean took care, took care of it.  And so that worked out really, really nice.  And then, and John felt that some people might think, well, if I'm assistant dean, and he's an associate dean, that there would be this gradient and it was not, that we should eliminate that disparity.  So I think within (laughter) six months, they gave me a title of associate dean.  So, you know, that John and I would be, so there would be no ambiguity about our mutual authority and--shared authority rather.  And John was good people.  He just died here on my son's birthday last year [2010], in December.  And he was a good man, good man, really went--you know, there are liberals and there are liberals.  This is a solid, real liberal, not somebody who spouts the stuff and he was internally consistent in his whole life in all the things he did, he and his wife [Mary Jane Evans Wellington], both were good people.  And then [William] "Bill" Rutter was my department chairman.  And he helped me a lot, helped me in terms of maturity, that next level of maturation that you need to become really independent and successful in a very competitive institution.  And--
Story_ID: 30421
Speaker 1: Now, did the position as associate dean [at University of California, San Francisco] subtract from what you were doing as a professor of chemistry?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean if I--it's no question that I couldn't run the race with somebody who was, didn't have that fifty pounds on their back.  I couldn't run it at the same speed as my other, junior faculty members that came in when I came in just because I had other things to do.  And, but that was okay, because that was where [William] "Bill" Rutter comes in cause he was my department chair and we would gauge it appropriately so that at the right time I would be at the place where I could have success in terms of promotion.  And I, you know, I had eight years to, seven years--it's seven and out, but it's really seven and then one more year.  And everything worked out fine.  And so then it, once you get tenured in a place like where I was, it was just, you know, one of the top seven medical schools in the country, that was great.  And then I continued on.  In the interim John [Wellington] and I divided the work up in such a way that it wasn't student affairs.  We divided the office up to curricula affairs, admissions and student affairs.  Student affairs was a twenty four-seven [24-7] on call.  You know, your student is in Fresno.  My car broke down.  I can't get back to school.  I don't have any money and then you, now you've got to find money in the middle of the night and everything to get to the student.  And I couldn't deal with that kind of up and down.  So I took over admissions.  Admissions was on a cycle.  And it had predictability.  And so I became the associate dean for admissions to the medical school.  And coupled with that, I was the person who was the dean-type responsible for the financial aide for the medical students.  So I had the gate and the money (laughter).  I (unclear) (laughter).  What more did I want?  So it was fun.
Speaker 1: So you were able to help some of the students--
Speaker 2: A lot of them, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you think that you, I mean how do you think would have been had you not been there to help or do you--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you'd hope that there is, I'm not the only copy (laughter) out there that, but I took it seriously.  I took it seriously at the level of I didn't want the embarrassment associated with just getting students of color for the sake of getting students of color 'cause that's a program that's designed to fail.  I took the position that I was not a fan of the separate track that you would have in minority affairs office or all these other things cause all you're doing is re-highlighting and functionally what you do is that you take this issue and put it on a tether away from the jugular vein, 'cause you can then cut it off any time you want.  I wanted it (laughter) right next to the jugular vein so it had to have whatever was gonna be going on as it related to helping students.  Why is uniquely that minority students would need help and other students wouldn't need, would not need help?  And they do.  And it may be that some issues, more minority students are using it than the others, but they both are using it for help.  So you design your programs and your strategies around the broadness of the needs that your students have, and then you don't have this problem of saying, well, you know, we got--we're putting all this money all over there for you.  And as if majority students didn't have problems, didn't have issues, as if they were just pristine, coming through.  And then history would tell you that's not the case.  And I used to always have to remind my colleagues that if we take the attitude of one minority student carrying across slips and now you're gonna put this broad stroke and go out after minority students in general, if you follow that to its logical conclusion, then there would be no white students in school (laughter) because the history of them slipping, you know.  That's one of the things you learn by going through the process, that not all of 'em are fast runners.  So, and so if that's the logic you wanna use now, then we shouldn't have any white students, you know, (laughter) 'cause they fail just like everybody else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, anyway.
Story_ID: 30422
Speaker 1: All right, now, I wanna ask you about the, in '69 [1969] the publication of your paper, "The Identification of NADPH-dependent reductase in a Rhodotorula strain," paper that was published in the "Journal of Bacteriology".
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's just, we had, when we'd gotten evidence from the enzyme in the first paper about the glycerol and glyceraldehydes, we purified the enzyme or at least got it to a stage where we could characterize it.  And that's just, that's that NADPH reductase.  So how did I give the title?
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's the name of the enzyme?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's just, it--you know, you can be very formal with it or you can be very--
Speaker 1: Okay, now, it's making--all right.  And then, so this is a journal of bacteriology.  Is this, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you don't (unclear).  You know, it's a single organization, you know, so any kind of--you would have in the journal bacteriology stuff on biology, viruses and all different bacteria, different molds.  It didn't matter.
Speaker 1: But it was a significant publication?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, (laughter), it's the journal that, it's not a garbage journal (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, yes, it's "the" "Journal of Bacteriology," you're right.
Speaker 2: At that time.  You know, so much has happened in those years.
Story_ID: 30423
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in '73 [1973], there's another publication "Cholesterol metabolism in HTC cells".  Tell us about that.  What is an HTC?
Speaker 2: It's a hepatoma tumor cell.  So--
Speaker 1: So that's a cancerous cell.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so lumor--liver, when it has a tumor, it's a hepatoma for hepatic.  And there had been a theory advanced and well-accepted that one of the characteristics of cancer cells is that they lose the capacity to regulate cholesterol metabolism.  And here comes John Watson riding his horse (laughter).  And I developed an interest in cholesterol metabolism, and these cells were available and I did some experiments and lo and behold, I saw regulation.  And, but all the other work had been done primarily with whole animals, taking these cells and injecting them into the hind leg or injecting them into the liver of the rat and asking questions about regulation.  And they wouldn't see it in the whole animal.  But if you put 'em in tissue culture cells, you do the perturbation right, you see nice regulation.  I had no problem demonstrating regulation.  And you notice, that's '73 [1973].  So that means I had been on the faculty [of University of California, San Francisco]--I came there in '69 [1969], so four years.  I'd made that observation probably in year, my second year there, probably then.  But the battle that I had to try to convince the community that I had a legitimate observation, demanded that I test everything and make certain I wasn't spitting in my cultures, make certain that this was happening and that happened.  And, you know, if you do enough of it, then eyes would begin to say, well, you know, he's done a lot of--it can't be this, it can't be that.  And I was able to get it published and eventually found out why the two systems showed different results.  And it's all about models.  It's how you ask your question.  That's part of science is that you can get consistent answers (laughter) if you just keep asking the same question the same way.  And the thing is, is to always challenge your observations, find unique, different ways to come at your problem at slight angles, and saying, and if this is true and that's true, then this should be true.  And then you find out if it does--if it is, and if it's not, then your objective is to find out what is the difference.  And so, the person--there was an individual faculty, an established scientist who had done all of this work.  And he really had an established, you know, he's twenty years, was twenty years older than I was.  And then he joined the faculty here and that made it even worse (laughter) because I was in the department and he was in the--he's a physician, M.D., Ph.D.  And he was in the Department of Medicine, and here he is over the VA Hospital, I mean VA [Veterans Affairs].  And I'm on the main campus, and we had a long time before we were able to get it settled.  And it was actually through one of his people working in his lab.  We did a set of experiments together and published a paper together--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and solved the problem, addressed the problem.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when did your, when did that paper publish?  Was that the "Inhibition of Three--
Speaker 2: It's a paper with Sandra [K.] Erickson on it ["Regulation of cholesterol metabolism in a slow-growing hepatomas in vivo," published in 1988].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, this was done, when was that paper published?
Speaker 2: I can't remember.  It's got to be a few years later because I kept on going.  Once, once I had made my point, I kept going and then, but there was still always this thing, well, you know, that's--it would be for, well, that's tissue culture, you know, as if it had lost its legitimacy.  But meanwhile, great strides in medicine will be made with tissue culture cells, so (laughter) either tissue cultures have validity or they don't have validity (laughter), you know.
Story_ID: 30424
Speaker 1: So this can be complicated and tricky, trying to, you know, make your point even though it's science?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, and then as, like it was stated Friday [at NSF ScienceMakers Public Program at Allen Temple Baptist Church].  You know, someone asked the question about, you know, buying scientists off or something or buying science, and that the science can't be bought off.  The scientists can be bought off and scientists can also buy into their own ideas.  And the beauty of science, one of the beauties of science is that in general, somebody is gonna surface somewhere and challenge existing knowledge, not necessarily with the concept of gonna challenge it per se.  A lot of times it's to say, okay, I'm working with this new technology, new system, new ways of analyzing.  I just wanna establish baseline.  And the literature says, A, B, C, D and E should happen and this is what--and you go in there with these new tools and all of a sudden, you find out it ain't what it was said to be.  Now, you gotta ask yourself, you ask yourself, why is that the case.  And then you begin to sort it out and the technology allows you to see things that you didn't see before.  And that, and it potentially can offer answers.  And so, you know, the public gets very upset when they'll hear today that coffee is, there's elements in coffee that are bad for you.  And then two years later now it says, too much coffee is gonna make you turn your head around and all this other kind of--but it's because we're constantly finding new knowledge.
Speaker 1: Yeah, even in the coffee they were saying that caffeine's bad for your nerves and other things.  And then they say--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --caffeine releases sugars in the muscles when you run so it's good for you to drink coffee after you've had exercise, and there's all different kinds of information about coffee.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so, and that's for drugs that they develop.  Now, you would hope that the drug companies or the people who are developing these drugs would have a much wider array of tests and what have you.  But some of 'em, one of the elements of the test is time.  I mean you may, it may look good for five years, but ten years out and someone's been taking the drug for ten years or twenty years, it's a whole nother ballgame, could be another whole ballgame, but you don't get the data till twenty years later.  Well, what drug company is gonna wait the twenty years before they say, okay, we got enough data to say it's safe and let's put it on the market.  In the meanwhile, they're, you know, eating ALPO [dog food] or (laughter) or water and bread 'cause they've went and spent all their money.  So it's a balance that has to be in there.
Story_ID: 30425
Speaker 1: So you were, now I think you've already referred to this but it's on the outline anyway [the interviewer's notes], you were Dean of the School of Medicine in the Admissions Department [at University of California, San Francisco] for, from '73 [1973] to '80 [1980]?
Speaker 2: Well, it was sort of like from '73 [1973] to '80 [1980], and then I got an established investigatorship award from the American Heart Association.  And they required that you spend 85 percent of your time on research.  And that was what I was looking for cause I'm getting to the place where now I had to feel that I had to, to do a little bit more, a little faster running.  And what I got, is a five-year fellowship, and they pay 85 percent of your salary.  They give you money for equipment and stuff like that, and it's five years.  And so I had, you know, that gave me breathing room.  It gave me an opportunity also to say I needed to get, you know, somebody else needed to be doing this for a while.  And that was good.  It was a prestigious award.  It was very competitive, very, very competitive.  And I got it.
Story_ID: 30426
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that's, yeah, that's--so what were you able to do during that period of time?
Speaker 2: Oh, I just made myself, I stayed in the cholesterol metabolism or it really, my problem evolved from cholesterol to a more generic regulatory problem.  And that is, that cholesterol is one of a unique, is one product of a unique class of compounds.  And those compounds are called isopentenoids--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that, I--
Speaker 2: Iso, I-S-
Speaker 1: I-S-O-
Speaker 2: pent, P-E-N-T-O-I--pentenoids.
Speaker 1: --N-O-I-D-S, okay. [I-S-O-P-E-N-T-E-N-O-I-D-S]
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. And those are, and the "pente" tells you that it's five, but iso tells you it's branched.  Okay, well, in nature the isopentenoids are the most abundant compounds in nature.  There're thousands of 'em, and they are primarily the compounds that contribute to a lot of fossil fuel because they're the result of dead organisms, the, this was left when the organism decomposed and the pressure and the temperature, the organisms from and a lot of the shale and what have you is isopentenoids.  And those are the compounds that now are used, you know, burn for your fossil fuel.  So there's a lot of it around, at least there had been a lot of it around (laughter).  But all your plants, the colors in plants and the colors--the compounds that often you'll hear about that's good for this and good for that, they're isopentenoids.  And there's certain isopentenoids for humans that are essential like ubiquinone.  You can't make ubiquinone or CoQ [Coenzyme Q10].  I shouldn't say ubiquinone, CoQ, you can't make that.  So you have to get it from your environment.  And if you don't have it, you don't survive.  And there're other compounds of the isopentenoid group that if you don't get 'em, you'll die.  So cholesterol, your body can make cholesterol so if you don't get the carbons that make cholesterol, your body knows how to do it.  So you don't have to worry about a cholesterol deficit.  Your body knows--unless, you're in some other major deficit state.  But your body can synthesize cholesterol, at least, and our bodies can synthesize cholesterol.  So the question of regulation of cholesterol, while it's important because if you don't make cholesterol, if you don't have it in your diet, your body increases its synthesis.  If you have it in your diet, your body shuts it down or shuts it down to a very low level.  And in trying to understand regulation of cholesterol, you have an input molecule that at some point branches off into all these others, including cholesterol, and cholesterol may be that 95 percent of the carbon is going in that one direction and the other 5 percent is going in the other--it's that other 5 percent, if you don't have it, some of 'em, you die.  And so the question then came, well, how do you--how are you gonna study this process if it's, in fact, you can't, that cholesterol, your body can respond to cholesterol.  You can see it, but what happens to those non-cholesterol-type molecules?  What role are they playing in this regulatory process or are they playing a role?  So what I did was took advantage of Mother Nature's, one of Mother Nature's mutants, and insects, Insecta.  Insects cannot make cholesterols.  They can't make cholesterol or cholesterol-like molecules.  They don't normally make cholesterol at all.  But they make other, they can't make any kind of sterol, insects can't do that.  So when that boll weevil is going around and eating the leaves and stuff like that, it's getting sterols from the plant.  And that's how it's able to make it through the world.  It's now dependent upon eating a sterol-containing food 'cause other than that it'll die 'cause sterols are essential for it.  But that observation is of such a nature, if it wants to develop into a full insect, that observation led me to say, well, there are insect cells that grow in culture, just like the HTC [Hepatoma Tumor Cell] cell.
Story_ID: 30427
Speaker 1: And one of the things that became--I was reading a paper, and I said, but they don't have any serum in here.  And serum is gonna be the source of cholesterol because serum has the cholesterol containing proteins because it's taken out of your blood, and clarified, calf serum or fetal, fetal calf serum or whatever, cholesterol is not and here is--I mean it's there in serum, but here's a cell growing without cholesterol.  It can't make cholesterol, and it doesn't have any in its diet, how is this cell surviving?  Well, to make a long story short, I started using these insect cells and asked the question about controlling the flow of these carbon molecules, and where were they going 'cause they don't make cholesterol so all of their carbon was going to all of these different other compounds.  And lo and behold, I got regulation of the carbon flow by using a specific inhibitor, which says then there was a whole level of regulation that was independent of cholesterol because these cells don't make it, and I wasn't giving them any.  So I was able to use the statin, it was a statin, you know, the statins, they're given for lowering, people take Lovestatin [a drug ingested to reduce cholesterol levels] and those other kind of compounds.  And it affects this particular enzyme and inhibits it.  And as a result of blocking that enzyme, the carbon that makes those other, all the isopentenoids can't be made.  And I found out the cell tries to then up regulate that enzyme, the insect cells.  So I then switched off of cholesterol as cutting in its regulation 'cause I had a cell that didn't make it and didn't appear to need it, but I can now look at non-sterol and non-cholesterol regulation of this enzyme.  And that's where I began to sew the fields (laughter) 'cause it took me out of the arena where there was a lot of competition 'cause if the cholesterol was in humans and people were focusing on human-related diseases, and I can now look at the non-sterol component.  And that process was operating in both animal cells and the insect cells.  It's just that the animal cells gives you two layers of regulation that you have to dissect the two, two equation problem.  You gotta get two answers for it.  The insect cell only gave me, I only have one (laughter), one question, one equation.  So then I could just--and that's where I spent my time, with the insect cell.  And I, and that came up about through the work I was, that time I took off for the fellowship.  And that's what I, that came out of that.  And that's where I ended up.  I didn't, I wasn't really focusing in on cholesterol metabolism per se.  One, I got my butt kicked left and right with the guys who were studying (laughter) cholesterol metabolism.  They just got these factories, and they were smart as hell, and they had the right kind of cells to use.  And they had just jumped out there and they won a Nobel Prize and the whole thing.  But I was working with insects, Drosophila cells, fruit fly cells.  And that just made a heck of a difference cause I could relax.  I didn't have to wait and have to have that fear every month of, oh, shucks, I'm gonna get scooped again.  And I had my own little territory, and it was not, to some people, it was not as exciting because of the fact that it wasn't dealing with cholesterol and it wasn't--but I felt that since both processes were occurring in animal cells and insect cells, if I can just work out at it there, I've got a one-body project question.  And I looked for the answer there, and I got, I thought, close to identifying what was that non-sterol, non-cholesterol-like molecule that was regulating, but I, it, whatever it was, it was a very small amount of it.  But it was being derived from the, from the product that was needed to make all of these isopentenoids, including sterols.  And if the cell didn't have it, couldn't make these isopentenoids, they'd die.
Speaker 2: So, this is, is this the substance of the paper ["Isoprene synthesis in isolated embryonic Drosophila cells. I: Sterol-free eukaryotic cells," 1983] that you published in '86 [1986]?
Speaker 1: Which one is that?
Speaker 2: The "Isopentenoid synthesis in halobacterium"?
Speaker 1: No, Halobacterium is another one.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's another one, okay.
Speaker 1: That's Drosophila.  I had it with Drosophila.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's the fruit fly.
Speaker 1: Fruit flies, yes, cause what it--they may have another name.  I'm trying to think if it had a number, but I think it would have been Drosophila cells.  It should have been one right after that or right before it.  Did you see it?
Speaker 2: I don't--it's not in this, I don't think.  I don't see it.
Speaker 1: JBC (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) and '76 [1976], and then you flip the page and the other one is from '86 [1986].  I think we may have just missed it.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 2: Halobacterium.  Oh, here it is.  Drosophila cells.
Story_ID: 30428
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So the halobacterium is one of my ventures.  You know, you're always looking and so halobacterium, when you fly into San Francisco [California], you see those salt ponds and they're red, and they're red because of special bacteria that grow in that very high salt concentration.  And by high concentration, I'm talking about four molar [4M] salt.  And when you consider that the salt separating the, circulating in our blood stream is .15 molar [0.15M], this is four molar [4M] salt.  I mean it crystallizes.  It's almost, I mean you give it a little wink, and it'll crystallize out on you.  But there's a bug growing out there that gives rise to the color, what you see in those salt ponds.  And that's, and they're called halobacterium.  They're extreme organisms, and it's one of a--they're called archaebacteria as a family.  And those are the bacteria that grow in these hot springs and Yellowstone and what have you 'cause they can withstand those temperatures.  Well, they also can, they're extreme in a wide range of ways.  And one of the ways is high salt for the halobacterium.  Well, halobacterium is red because it's almost like, have rhodopsin, like in the eye.  And it takes the sun, and then it converts it and develops into energy.  The organism has as its, part of its cell wall nothing but isopentenoids.  They don't have regular, straight-chain, fatty acids in their membrane.  They have these branched isopentenoid compounds.  And it's an advantage to having branched isopentenoid compounds.  One, they are much more fluid because it's branch and it--if they're just flat, and straight-chained, they can get together and move.  But now, you've put a kink in 'em, they can't, they become--they retain the fluidity.  The other thing is that they're saturated so they're resistant to UV [ultraviolet] radiation, double bonds, don't get all changed and oxidized.  They're just, they're stable.  And two, they form what we call ether linkages, rather than ester linkages.  And ether linkages takes a lot to break an ether linkage as opposed to an ester linkage.  So like Crisco [an oil] has ester linkages, and when you wanna make--you just take some lye and boil it up and you break that bond, and you've got soap.  You can't take the same kind of triglyceride-like molecule from Halobacterium, throw alcohol, alkali in there and boil it up and break that ether bond.  It takes a much more strength, a much more active chemical reaction to break that bond.  So they're resistant.  That's why these organisms can grow under these extreme environments.  And that's in all of the archaebacteria.  So they can--that's why they are what they are.
Story_ID: 30429
Speaker 1: Well, the natural extension is, if I'm interested in looking at how cells regulate isopentenoid synthesis and this is, these are isopentenoids.  They [halobacterium] don't make sterols, and they don't make the same kind of compounds that, that the other bac--the bacteria were making.  So I wanted to find out could they regu--could I regulate them and how they metabolized, how do they generate the precursor to make these isopentenoids.  And we found, we made a very novel observation that if I add this statin, they die.  So that meant that they have an essential need, you couldn't replace it with anything other than the product from the statin that was this precursor, that their statin was blocking that reaction.  If you provided this, they were okay, but if you blocked the formation of it, normally, they died.  And so then we studied that process, and then I found that their enzyme that was sensitive to statins had catalytic properties similar to the insect and all other organisms.  But it was, had other characteristics that were different.  And so we started to characterize that enzyme, and as a result of our work, we were able to get a better insight into the enzyme that was in the insect cell and in the mammalian cells because this enzyme had some properties that were different.  And those differences allowed us to probe and ask other kinds of questions.  So the halobacterium was just a thought, and it was one of my exciting--it's a paper that I think of all the time as my, you know, how do you say, my contribution paper, one of my contribution papers, is that all of the students on there are minority students on that particular paper.  And it was, it's a good paper.  And from that work, there was a geneticist that took advantage of our work to use that, my observation to now start selecting for mutants.  And now they could do things in halobacterium that they used to couldn't do before because I had showed that, a way to kill it and how to rescue it so they could select for mutants.  So.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is 1986, I think.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I didn't, I--you know, I was trying to develop some other things of identifying the regulatory compounds, but the chemistry got really tough.  The kind of compounds I needed to use were very reactive, and I didn't always know if I had 100 percent what I added was the compound I said I was adding cause if I had .2 or .3 percent of an isomer, then I may have run into problems, and I can't interpret the data.  So I just kind of gave it up.  For the questions I was interested in, it just seemed like it was gonna be really tough.
Speaker 2: Okay, but you're saying people are still building on that research now.
Speaker 1: Well, I know they use it--now, it was being used as a tool, as a selective agent, to select for mutants.
Story_ID: 30430
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now in, and we don't have the year here, but you helped found the Coalition for the Advancement of Blacks in the Biomedical Sciences, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, CABBS, yeah, that was, there's a, the life sciences, the biochemist types at the time I was really engaged in that--that could have been in the mid-'80s [1980s] or somewhere around in there.  There's a handful of, you'd go to national meetings, and there'd be so many African American scientists there.  And I, and when I, and the measure that I was using, that we used, were people who were able to get NIH grants.  So a lot of people work in labs.  A lot of people work for industry, etc.  But when you're in independent investigating, you gotta compete and write your grants.  And then we were trying to select for that group of individuals.  And most of them came out of the university.  They weren't coming out of industry or something.  So you'd have one here and one there (laughter), etc., and we were trying to put together a group to, as a professional society, but it was, we had no sponsors.  So when we tried to have meetings, we all had to come out of our pocket.  We had to, at (unclear) university, I had to plead and work with the people at my university to maybe get the dean or somebody to provide food and meeting space.  And, you know, it was an idea that we tried, and it just never got off the ground.
Speaker 1: Okay, but in '85 [1985], you won the Henry McBay Outstanding Teacher Award from the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, NOBCChE.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that organization took a much broader approach in their original--they were basically looking for anybody, I mean the students.  It didn't matter if you were in industry or academe or anything.  There was this, they brought in the whole spectrum of black chemists and chemical engineers, independent of where they were in the whole scheme of things.  And it's been very successful, Bill Lester was one of the founding members of that [sic, William Lester, professor of the graduate school, Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, was not a founding member of NOBCChE].

Speaker 1: All right, I just wanted to go back to the paper on the Halobacterium and your research there, and I have a note here to ask how it relates to everyday life.  But, you see, that's really not the question.
Speaker 2: Well, the one thing when you're involved in trying to solve scientific problems, you look for models to try to get answers, and the simpler the model, the happier you are.  And because Mother Nature tends to keep the same concept, the same generally, you know, the automobile has four wheels, and it has right now, an engine and an axel and it just may be that the wheels may be bigger.  It may have an axel that's turned and twisted in kind of ways, but it's still an axel.  And so if you can now get the simplest and understand the principle involved in that you can now go from that to maybe understanding the much more complex.  And so halobacterium, even though it's, or archaebacteria, they're extreme organisms, but once you get to a certain place in there, they're carrying, those cells are carrying out the same functions as the complex mammals, mammalian cell.  And the beauty of like working with Halobacterium, one beauty of it, and at the same time, there's a downside, is that they require high salt.  So the enzymes will not work unless you have your reactions going on in four molar [4M] salt.  If you knocked it down to two molar [2M] salt, the proteins come apart.  But the advantage of it is that they're stable as hell (laughter), you know.  You can, you can work at room temperature and you got--as long as you keep enough salt around.  And most of them are nice and stable or thermobacteria, that the enzyme reaction will not occur unless you're up to seventy degrees.  Well, that just gives you degrees of freedom to be able to work at, with a stable enzyme at that temperature and get a, and it may lead you to finding enzymes that you can--Dr. [James H.] Johnson [African American civil engineer, former dean of the College of Engineering, Architecture and Computer Sciences at Howard University] was talking about the sludge and a lot of those kind of enzymes come from those extreme organisms.  And so the Halobacterium for me at the time was the, that drew me in, was the fact that that, all of its lipids were isopentenoids cause I was interested in isopentenoids.  And how does it make this isopentenoid?  And these isopentenoids were very complex.  They're very, very complex and it's a dominant lipid, I mean compound, lipid-like compound in these cells.  And so if I'm interested in isopentenoid metabolism, how you regulate it, maybe I should look at that simple organism.  And it's right out there in the high salt.  And I didn't wanna work with sulfur bacteria that grow at sixty-five degrees.  I tried it.  I had a flask growing at sixty-five degrees in the lab.  Well, you know, keeping a flask growing, and keeping it growing at sixty-five degrees just as a routine lab, not really set up, it's not easy.  But salt, (laughter) you just pour it in there and just get 'em to growing.  It doesn't take, it doesn't take 'em long to grow.  I mean they grow pretty fast.
Speaker 1: Okay, but this knowledge of how this--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: The knowledge of how this halobacterium is able to grow in this high salt environment is part of a puzzle that, I guess, would you say that biochemists were trying to figure out how all these--
Speaker 2: Well, you always try--
Speaker 1: --organisms are able to survive--
Speaker 2: Life.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You're trying to understand life.  And where you, what ledge you land on to do your thing will vary, and you, but you're always looking for the trick, technology, tool or what have you, that's gonna allow you to get to your answer.  And sometimes you may have to divert to something that's simple, simple, a simple organism and build up.  And, and now with the technology of being able to knock out genes or to grow, you know, to do, to take a foreign protein and put it into another organism and then get it to make large amounts of it.  You can isolate it, you can study it, and if you're getting something on the extreme organism, there're sometimes very unique advantages.  And particularly, in a commercial sense (laughter).  I mean you've got something that's resistant to alkali, then, you know, (laughter), if you can now harvest something out of that and apply to an environment, you know, you've--that's better than going out there and throwing a bunch of chemicals in there to cause a reaction, if you can get Mother Nature to do it for you.  And so for me it was the fact that it did have all the, all the lipids, all of the fats were isopentenoid based.  The dominant was, it was 90-some odd percent.  And we could ask questions about potential regulatory aspects which then would allow us to go and say okay, if that's true there, is it true over here in my next level of complex system 'cause you have maybe a strategy to how to be able to address the question which was not obvious before.
Speaker 1: So what you're really, you're say though is that, to be able to answer these questions of, these life relationship questions through biochemistry is in and of itself, worth doing because it's, these are keys to--
Speaker 2: Yes, they're potential keys.  And Mother Nature does keep patterns.  Some people say, well, why do you climb a mountain?  And some people say, well, it's because it's there.  Well, that's one way of looking at it, but you also can say, well, in that process I'm gonna learn a whole about--a lot about climbing mountains (laughter), you know, what rock formations and what things to look out for.  And that can be applied to something else.
Story_ID: 30432
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, '94 [1994] you won the Lifetime Mentor Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science [AAAS]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and other winners of this award include Isiah Warner [African American chemist] who we interviewed [for The HistoryMakers archive], Gary May [African American electrical engineer], Silvia Bozeman [African American mathematician], Diolo Bagayoko [African American physicist].
Speaker 2: Oh, so you've--I mean you interviewed 'em?
Speaker 1: Well, I interviewed Isaiah Warner and found him to be a fascinating person, down at LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], had a real happy group of grad students working with him, you know.  Okay, so in 2001, you retired?  Is that--
Speaker 2: Huh, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: You retired in 2001.  Now, you were only 61 and, but you became a professor of Biochemistry Emeritus.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, this is something that's not granted to everybody that retires.
Speaker 2: No, un-un.
Speaker 1: So it's a special status.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I didn't realize that it wasn't granted (laughter) to everyone until someone told me, guess what?  (laughter) Everybody don't get this one.  But, and it was, making that decision was somewhat tough, but it wasn't that difficult.  One, you know, you, there's an intellectual drive for your subject matter.  You're excited, I mean, you're really excited about going to the lab and what have you and science.  But, and the amount of time that you have at one institution, you have this other dimension of retirement and accumulating and what have you.  And it got to the point with me that it was now time for me to make a retool.  So I'm sixty-one years old.  Science and the life sciences are changing where to have a real good, functional lab, you've gotta have elements of new technology and backdoor approaches or front-door approaches, but additional approaches rather than the ones--because I really was trained as a chemist.  And that meant I had to get into molecular genetics and the whole nine yards or what's modern, called modern cell biology.  So some of those technologies, I'd have intro--learn myself.  That meant taking a sabbatical.  That's one year, and then you have to write a proposal now with your newfound knowledge and perspective to try to get money to use this knew knowledge, skills and what have you effectively.  And if it, even the best of people are very, don't necessarily get there on the first writing, on the first submission.  Generally, you've got to have preliminary data.  Then you gotta convince the study section that you, in fact, can do what you said you can do.  And that help with more preliminary data and a publication would even help even more.  So let's say that's another two more years that you're, maybe two, 'cause the cycle was, the funding cycles were like every six, nine months, something like that.  It takes about that length of time, at least at that time it seems.  It as, so you couldn't just do, turn this stuff around in night and day.  Meanwhile, it takes resources to do the things that you wanna do to convince the parties that you're ready to deal.  And if you--so by sixty-three, I got it all done, you know, and you cross the finish line and you're ready.  And you get a grant for three to five years, somewhere in there.  So I'd be sixty-six or sixty-eight, but you've gotta now get ready for another one (laughter).  And you have to ask yourself, now wait a minute.  Do I wanna do this again?  If I put the uniform on again, and if not, why did you do all of this for one time to be on the stage to show that you can play a clarinet, 'cause that's all it amounts to.  You get the money, you're on the stage for your three to five years, and you may be successful, but if you had an idea that you did see yourself retiring at some stage, why would you wanna just go through all of this stuff just to have the--to say that I could do it.
Story_ID: 30433
Speaker 1: And I wasn't motivated to do that run again, to go through all of that, and still it was an uncertainty because every time that you lacked, you weren't successful, that moves it another year.  And, you know, it's really showing the people you know how to play a clarinet for one time on the stage.  And I wasn't gonna try to be a player at sixty-eight.  Why I need to do that?  That'd been another eight years, that would have thirty-some odd, almost forty years running at the bench.  And see I, in contrast to many of my colleagues, I never wanted to be symphony director.  I worked in the lab.  I only, I never wanted my group to ever get any larger than about six people.  And I was in the lab every day.  I was not one of those that was in  his office doing the cogitating and doing the science politics and all--I was in the lab 'cause I enjoyed my own creation.  And the up, besides that, it gave me an opportunity to interact with the students continuously.  They didn't have to say, "Where's prof [the professor]?"  I was in the lab and if something goes wrong, I could talk to them about it, and we can address it right then and there.  So I'm a hands on, lab person, a very practical lab person.  And that also, as a style is not necessarily a winning style as you mature because the expectation is you go through being in the field and tilling and working diligently and hard doing your own experiments when you start out.  But as you mature, you've now got a team.  And your team can get larger and larger and be forty people.  And meanwhile, you're sitting up in [chimes ringing].  That's the man [delivery man at the door].
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, let's see.  Let me get unloose here.
Speaker 1: I have to sign for it. [pause]  I think it, what it comes down to is the next option would be obviously to go into like full-time administration or in a crass way of looking at it, being a, being the reservoir for all of the scud work and the things that the rest of the faculty don't wanna do (laughter).  You know, and that's, because if you're gonna be earning a salary and there're always things to do.  And most, and there're things that nobody likes to do, but if you have somebody around who's not doing, being active in the lab, they pick that up.  And then your space disappears, you know, and that--to me it's a, it has its own potential minimization, marginalization.  You might as well just, you know, get on your horse and ride away.
Story_ID: 30434
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you look back on your career, now, is there any, what was the riskiest decision you made?
Speaker 2: In biology, as a professional?  I think the riskiest decision I made was to go the route of Drosophila cells [fruit fly cells].  That was a very risky decision cause I didn't know what I was gonna run into.  But in some ways, probably none of your decisions are risky because you make those decisions on the basis of evidence.  And so they had evidence that would say that short of being blind or having made a crucial mistake, it should work.  So, so maybe it's not even, you know, so risky is, it was--you tend to make decisions that are gonna have a high probability of success, at least I do because one of the things that happens when you have small groups is that you don't have the options of someone that has thirty people in their lab.  They can send twenty of them down blind alleys.  All you need is one or two of the others to have success, and then you just say, turn right (laughter) or turn left.  And you can just crank it out.  But if you've got a few hands and you send 'em all down blind alleys, you know, the probability is that all of 'em will go down blind alleys and nothing will turn up, at least in a cycle fast enough to be able to show progress and what have you.  So that has, that's part of the, that is an issue when you, one, have small groups and two, when you--and you're engaged yourself because you only can work on a certain part.  You can't do everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 30435
Speaker 1: And then if you've got young people coming in your lab, they're trying to learn and get established and you're trying to teach them.  So--
Speaker 2: Who have been some of your mentees that you're proud of, I guess.  You know, I don't wanna get you in trouble or, but are there any special students that you--
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I was in the medical school [University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine], I probably had my greatest impact with students in medical school who either wanted to dabble and find out or those who had been, got excited and have continued moving in certain directions.  There's a young man at Case Western [Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], Emmitt Jolly [Jr.], from Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee Inst., Alabama].  He was in our summer research program.  He worked in my lab.  He became a graduate student at UCSF [University of California, San Francisco].  He got his Ph.D.  He did two post-docs and now he's on the faculty at Case Western.  And he clearly is a person that I'm glad that, for having the privilege to be involved in his development.  There's a young man down at UC, San Diego [University of California, San Diego].  I just heard he got, he's an associate professor now.  There was a program I started and he worked in my lab, Gentry [Patrick], Gentry--Gentry, it'll come to me.  But anyway, he's down at UC San Diego, Ph.D., again, he's a Ph.D.  There's a young lady, Jamil Scott.  She's at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] now.  She went to graduate, she was in our summer program.  She worked in my lab.  And then she went to Harvard to get her Ph.D., got her Ph.D., and now she's doing her second post-doc.  She's still at Harvard, but again, a Ph.D.-type student.  And then there's a young man who got his M.D., PhD, not here, but he got it at Michigan, but he worked in my lab for, gosh, over two years.  He was at Santa Cruz.  He was a student from Santa Cruz, and he took a year off and worked in my lab.  It's amazing how you forget these names, even though they're on the tip of your tongue.  It'll come to me, it'll come to me.
Speaker 2: So there're quite a few, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, they're individuals, who at the lab level and then as just a straight mentor, either formal or informal, like one of the first students I ever interviewed for medical school is Eugene Washington who's the dean of the medical school at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles].  Then his buddy [Michael V. Drake], his running buddy, I was his formal and informal mentor, and he's the chancellor of U-C, Irvine [University of California, Irvine].
Story_ID: 30436
Speaker 1: Now, does it take--what do you, I guess, what do you primarily focus on as a mentor for young people or what do you--
Speaker 2: What, you mean in terms of a strategy?
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you have a strategy for that or is it--?
Speaker 2: Try to reassure.  It is a monster.  But it's a monster that you can beat.  And you've got to feel comfortable, I mean recognize you can beat, you can beat this monster.  You can't be intimidated a prior (unclear).  The other thing is, is to be realistic, not in a sense of realistic of, you know, yeah, it is a monster, but don't think that you're gonna, don't try to solve all the problems.  Don't--you know, take it in steps.  And I try to make the uninformed aware of how this thing works because it does have a rhythm.  It does have a heartbeat.  It does have a process, and if you know where the alligators are and you know where the quicksand is, you can win it because too many other people have won it (laughter), you know, and some of 'em are high fliers and some of 'em are just mediocres and so it's not like, it's if it is something that is reserved for some small cut.  The margin is much greater than what it appear when you're from the outside 'cause the people who win are successful.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying social IQ is sometimes more important than maybe the other, I mean the talent of the individual on some level, are you saying?
Speaker 2: Well, you gotta, you gotta have some talent (laughter).  You gotta be able to read, write and think (laughter), you know.  But you've got to know the dynamics of it.  You gotta have a sense of feel for, you know, what--when somebody started acting a fool, cause there are a lot of faculty members who will act a fool on you, and for a variety of reasons.  And you've got to know how to deal with that in a way which is still gonna allow you to win.  So what a person in my position should be doing is helping the student understand that kind of dynamics and not, particularly for a minority student, I pull the race card first because the moment you pull that trump card, 'cause you can always pull that card if it needs to be pulled, is that you set up a dynamic that just, that becomes the issue and not what you're dealing with (laughter).  And you wanna always keep, you're dealing, if you're in the scientific community, one thing that does work is data and being able to make your case, that if you can present--most of the individuals you're around, they can live, they can deal with data.  And, but you can't be, I felt this, I presumed this, et cetera, you know.  You gotta have documentation and things of that nature.
Story_ID: 30437
Speaker 1: So, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, the hope is the same I have, you know.  We're gonna keep on getting--keep on, keeping on, gonna get over because the record says we'll get over.  I mean the barriers have been put there.  And every time there's a barrier put and they put glass on top of it or spikes, somebody gets escape velocity.  And all you gotta do is get one or two, get escape velocity and you've, one, you've established that it can be done.  And if it can be done, the others can do the same.  They've just gotta realize that maybe you gotta make a feint over here and then jump (laughter).  But it can be done.  That's one.  The disappointment is, is that it's not occurring fast enough cause at my stages, when I joined the faculty and we were thinking in '69 [1969], that, you know, we would, the curve would have, be much steeper than it is now.  It's steeper than it was before, but it's not as steep as one anticipated.  And a lot of that is tied to the fact, we didn't realize how deep the cut was.  And, you know, it's, it's un--when you think, if you're objective, you step back and you say, you know, you come into the, you come, and you bring a community or a group of individuals, you drop an atomic bomb on them, through the world of enslavement coupled with Jim Crowe, coupled with de facto, A, B, and C resistance.  All of that's in there.  You drop the atomic bomb and then after so many years, and then there's, then there being a half life of the removal of the radiation, all things are gonna be equal (laughter).  You know, it's like, now you can (laughter), you know, you can run the race, boy.  And, and then the ones who are, they'll say, well, that happened with the grandparent, and I just arrived on the boat, and I'm able to do this, that and the other.  Well, guess what (laughter), nothing, there's no rules set up for you, against you, working against you.  And that history.  And so the damage was much greater than had been, I think really realized because you keep thinking, you look around to your left and right you see guys that's doing the same things as you.  And you say, well, you know, we'll be able to get over this one.  We've, and so it has its own increments.  And then you gotta have time working in your favor because a lot of individuals gotta pass through the pipe.  They're, it's like a dye dilution.  You gotta, you gotta get the crude way of saying it.  You gotta get the Strom Thurmond's [politician, opposed Civil Rights legislation of 1950s and 1960s] and the New Age Tea Partiers [conservative political group] and they gotta float through the pipe.  They're still there.  And they come up.  They're like weeds, you know.  You think you're going along fine and then they pop up again, so you gotta find a better weed killer and (laughter) get rid of 'em, and so--but you can't give up because if you give up, the game's over.
Story_ID: 30438
Speaker 1: All right.  Another question we always ask is this one.  When you look back on everything you've to this point, is there anything you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Well, if I had control over things, you know, I would have probably not let myself get sucked into that phenomena of the Brooks Brothers and Joe College [while at University of Illinois, Navy Pier] and that kind of stuff at that period of time.  But then again, that may have been what was important for me to be where I am today.  You don't know cause you can't do the control (laughter).  You can't do that, and the next time, how do you say, well, if had been different here and did that.  But the tacking process is of such a nature that that was the right tacking protocol for you.  And you try another tacking protocol and you, and either, that you control or you don't control, 'cause there're other forces operating in your, that are impacting on how much, how you attack, then I can't predict.  I mean, you know, this, you can say, oh, well, if I'd a done this a little differently.  I could argue that I could have, if I was starting out today--maybe that's the better way to say it, 'cause I would be a product of the most recent journey, so my mindset would be more in-line where the young, new Ph.D.s, young scholars are going.  And I would say that more of them now are taking a rather concentrated focus on their development.  You know, they're really putting that energy into running without anything on their back.  And so I would probably be doing the same, I don't know how much--I don't know where my social, my direct social consciousness would be and how active I would be.  I would be active, but I don't know how much--well, I know I probably would not be as active as I was, from the route that I came just because--
Speaker 1: And the time.
Speaker 2: --that was consistent with my time.  And, but I see the young guys now that are coming, the individuals, they're just grabbing the bull by the horn and running with it and doing well.  And I always, I used to argue that you can't wait 'til you got tenure to now say you're gonna get engaged because you haven't learned how to be engaged.  What makes you think that now that you've got tenure that you're gonna be a--you can do-the do.  In fact, when you get tenure, professionally, you're expected to be even more, 'cause you've, in some way, you're projecting to the community, your colleagues that you're knowledge based and your success, your prowess is of such a nature that people are willing to invest in your tenure.  And then the expectation is, is that you're gonna do more so that you can go to the next level.  And now, you're gonna say, now, I'm going to be engaged in these other kinds of activities.  They're almost, it's like a baby trying to run the hundred-year dash because you've spent so much time focusing in the other direction.  I just don't see the ease in which--I never felt that you could ease into it and say, okay, now, I'm gonna be this mentor, this great mentor or be a person who's going to be engaged in all those kinds of things to increase diversification and things.  I just find it--it obviously can be done, but I just don't see it being an easy transition, particularly, when, as you move up the academic ladder, actually, the expectations from you are higher.  It doesn't, it doesn't say, ah, now, you can sit on your butt (laughter).  It says now, you've demonstrated that you know how to run.  Now, run faster.  So.
Story_ID: 30439
Speaker 1: What today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I hope my legacy is that whatever I did professionally can be reproduced and it sustains itself, okay.  That's very important because I took it very seriously in terms of what I did with what I did.  I had people in the lab, but I was in the lab (laughter), you know, and it was my--and we were working, we were doing this painting together.  And so that's important because one thing is for certain--at least it used to be, probably not so much now, is that if you were a minority person and did good science, sustainable science that stood the test, you just faded.  Sometimes you'd just fade into the woodwork.  You're just another good scientist.  You're not exceptional, but you're good and you made a contribution.  But if you blew it (laughter), you are remembered, you know.  And one, because you, sometimes you're the only one around.  So it's not like you've got, you can just hide in the woodwork (laughter), like so many of your white colleagues, who blow it, you know.  They can hide in the woodwork, or they recover in ways which allow, you know, recover in ways that it's not easy for a lone, different person to recover.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you gotta respond to the challenge of all that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 30440
Speaker 1: Tell me this, now, we talked about, you know, your life in chemistry and academia, what other things do you like to do?  And I know that you're involved in, you've been to Africa and you've been very much involved with the Yoruba in Nigeria--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but what are some of the, tell us about that and tell us about some of the other things you're involved with?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always been interested in a wide range of things.  A lot of people (unclear).  My wife [Valerie Modia Landry] is, she teaches at City College of San Francisco [California].  So she's a dance, she teaches dance.  And so that whole social dimension, associated with dance and music, coming up the right way (laughter) sort of thing, that's part of my life.  It's not as much now.  We don't go out dancing every week (laughter) as we used to but it's still part of our lives.  My children are very important.  My family, family is very important to me.  And so I have four kids and we do, when they were growing up, you know, I took the position that Sunday was family day.  So if I had to go into the lab, it either had to be very early in the morning to check something or after we done our thing on Sunday.  And so family, we would go, every Sunday, if we could, we would go some place within a three hour radius.  So that would be a six, at the most six hours of traveling.  And we did a lot hiking and every summer, if we would go, we'd take a three to four week vacation, and we'd go camping and travel in the camping type areas.  So that's very important to me.  And it's even, now, family is even, still very important.  Like this weekend, we were up in Sacramento [California].  My wife was celebrating her seventieth birthday so the family came--we have another house up in Sacramento.  And so everybody came up to Sacramento.  I had Friday, before coming to the event, I had did most of the barbequing and stuff here outside.  And then, but I had some things to do up in Sacramento.  This coming weekend, two of my grandkids' birthdays.  One is the 10th and one is the 13th, and we're celebrating their birthdays next, on Sunday, next Sunday, the 13th [of March, 2011].  So family is very important to me.  And I just would not give up that interrelation.  If I had to stay in the lab overnight, fine, but I was not gonna, Sunday.  I was always engaged in, personally engaged in slow-pitch softball leagues or flag football leagues until I tore my ankle up at forty-two years (laughter) old playing flag football.  So I had to stop that.  But, so the outdoors, doing things.  And then I like, now, I'm learning, I'm slowly but surely just doing handy, handyman stuff 'cause when I was working, I didn't, I just didn't have the time to start projects.  But since I've retired, I've been able to start simple projects, but start 'em and finish 'em, and feel comfortable--and feel joy at the end of it.  And actually having a house up in Sacramento has helped a lot because there are things I have to do up there, and not the same kind of things I do here.  I don't have to do much here, but there I do.  And, you know, we like going, like going out and having unique dinners, going to unique places.  We definitely like going to jazz clubs, music.  What else?  Read.

Speaker 1: Oh, I asked about the travel to Africa.
Speaker 2: And so, that's, that was one, when it surfaced as, okay, now, we're at a stage, my wife [Valerie Modia Landry] are at a stage we can begin to do things more on our own.  Traveling to the continent was an idea of completing a circle that it gives you an opportunity--you may not know who are the progenitors of your, per se, but to go back to the continent, you've completed it, so you've seen it.. You were engaged, and the more you see, the more exciting it could be.  And so I have a friend who's a travel agent.  She would run these African American center tours to Africa.  And one year we were gonna go to Nigeria, Togo and Ghana.  And they had a coupe in Nigeria, and it just threw the whole thing off.  Then she reformatted the tour so we could celebrate Kwanzaa in Kenya.  So we left here a day before Christmas or two days before Christmas, something like that and flew to Kenya.  And that was a wonderful, wonderful experience.  We celebrated Kwanzaa in Kenya and the people up there, the people who were serving as our host, they were thinking we were bringing a religion to 'em.  And we told 'em, no, it's not a religion and, 'cause it's not a, it's not practiced there other than as a harvest season in the continent.  And the young people who were serving as our hosts, they spent time finding out from their elders a little bit about the whole concept of the harvest time and what have you.  And they learned a lot because we were doing our thing there, but we would, every night we'd set up a table and do the reverence and go through, and they would be looking at us.  And they didn't know what was going on, but we engaged them in it.  And the last night, we were up in Kisii [Kenya], 'cause we were traveling through.  We went through Nairobi [capitol of Kenya].  We went Mombasa [Kenya].  We went to Kisii and one other place.  And we're doing it by bus, and we would stay in motels, and it was a wonderful, wonderful experience.  And we got to, particularly, when we were in Mombasa, we went one of the slave castles and got down to the door of no return.  And my wife, we have it on videotape, but it was an experience.  So I went down there, and my wife was standing, stayed upstairs, and she was videotaping, and then I did a libation, and all of a sudden this swirling just started happening right down at that gate, the door of no return.  And it was an eerie experience, a very, very, very eerie experience at Fort Jesus [Mombasa, Kenya].  I'll never forget that.  And that, it was almost like maybe it was telling us we shouldn't go to West Africa first.  We needed to go to East Africa first, even though most of the enslaved people in this hemisphere come from the, from West Africa, but some came from, from East Africa.  And I got bit, you know, in the sense of this is the place to go.  I mean I need to go back, and then one of my--my oldest daughter was married to someone who worked for this foreign service, United States, for the State Department.  It's the Foreign Service.  It made a big difference in that.  And one of their, one of their stations was in Zimbabwe, not Zimbabwe, Botswana.  And so we went and spent time with them in Botswana, and that gave us an opportunity to go to South Africa and then to Zimbabwe, and I had a wonderful, wonderful time.  And again, it was a sense of enlarging our view of ourselves, but also a sense of connectiveness.
Story_ID: 30442
Speaker 1: And in the backdrop of all of this [Watson's travels to Africa], there was a, there's a center here in the city called African American Cultural Center, in San Francisco [California].  It's not in this city.  And there was a Nigerian guy who was the head of the center.  And he had these classes in Yoruba language and culture every week.  It cost five dollars on Saturdays so we'd go to that.  And I was getting more and more excited about that knowledge I was gaining and beginning to see behavior, I mean the cultural nuances that were being expressed the Yoruba people were things that, happening here, but we didn't understand why they, why we did, in the body language and the classic is shortening words to the point where (laughter), you know, it's like the Jamaicans that go into the vowels, dropping vowels off.  But it's code--some of it's code--but the Nigerians can--he would write maybe a four-word sentence on the board and then he would, then start expanding, and, you know, it was four lines cause it's just (laughter), they could contract left and right.  So, you know, when we talk about slang and the language, there's an intrinsic--any place there's any Africans, in Brazil, Cuba, Spanish-speaking countries, the Africans have, the African people have brought another nuance to that language, significant difference than the Brazilians.  The Portuguese that's spoken in Brazil is spoken differently that the Portuguese in Portugal.  And Spanish in Cuba is definitely different than Spanish in Mexico or even in Spain itself.  Anyway,  and then there's a first sponsorship in the United States of the International Orisa World Congress was held here in San Francisco.
Speaker 2: You're talking about '97' [1997]?
Speaker 1: Ninety seven [1997].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in town actually--
Speaker 1: Really.
Speaker 2: --just before it I think, before it happened.
Speaker 1: So, and since I was taking the class, even though I hadn't been initiated into the tradition or anything of this nature, I was involved with arranging that.  And after the conference was over, I had made up my mind I was gonna get initiated in to the tradition, into the religious tradition, and I did.  And it, like removed all sorts of weight off of my shoulders or feelings of barriers or weight, yeah.  And that's what it was, was weight, because if you think about it, the only reason that African Americans in this hemisphere are Christians is because the enslaver was a Christian.  He could have been a Muslim.  He could have been--so the only reason that that--and this severance that we have, that for Christianity and that the Africa as a continent and within the continent, the various particular tribal gathering units, cause the countries mean nothing.  That's all European.  That's, those are not (laughter), that's not Africa.  That's European butchering.  And we had our own traditions before Christianity, before Islam, the people had their own traditions.  And once I got initiated, it's like I no longer had to feel that what I was doing was alien.  And it's still alien, but it was alien in the sense--it's only alien because I don't live there and I don't speak the language.  But it is, it's in the DNA, sort of thing, in the bones.  And it's been a wonderful, wonderful really--It doesn't mean that I don't, when I'm in Chicago [Illinois], if I can get to Monumental [Baptist Church] and hear some good, gospel music, I will go.  And it doesn't mean that I'm around here taking crosses and throwing them in the ground.  It's just that I have something else that feeds me in a different way.  And it's mine.  And that's, and so I really, that's my--that's why I do it.
Story_ID: 30443
Speaker 1: And so I've been to Nigeria, I go back to Nigeria about every two or three years.  And there're a few places left in--I've been to Egypt three times.  I liked Egypt, and partially because, one of the times because, the way you get to Kenya, you stop off in Egypt.  And when we did that Kwanzaa trip, we stopped off in Egypt Christmas Day, and it was amazing to be in a hotel in Egypt, seeing a Christmas tree and buying, I bought a couple of local Christmas cards (laughter) in Egypt, you know, on Christmas Day, like I was not expecting that.  And then I went back one time on a real nice trip, you know, like twenty-day trip--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: It was really good, and I like to go to Tanzania and Zanzibar [Tanzania].  I'd like to go, actually go back to Kenya to spend more time on the, in the Mombasa on the ocean rather than in the interior, and I'd like to go to [The Republic of] Cape Verde, Ghana, go back to South Africa.  I don't think I saw enough of South Africa.  I'd like to go to Cape Town [South Africa].  I was in Johannesburg [South Africa], I didn't go to Cape Town.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I don't need to go interior, super interior.  I'm not into trekking and that kind of stuff, not at this stage of my life.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But it's that kind of feeling complete, and even though I spend, when I travel for vacations, I stay in, I try to stay in this hemisphere.  One is quicker and cheaper (laughter), but if I wanna, for a real, what I call vacation--vacation to me is water, sand and drink (laughter).  That's a vacation (laughter), you know.  And I've done enough of what I call touring vacations, when we used to go camping, you know, you're on the ground, your tent's up for three days.  Then you're packing it up again and going someplace else, and it's up for three more days.  That's, that's work.  And then if you go, when we take the kids to Mexico, we would go to different cities and hit the museums or hit this, and, you know, it's busy, busy, busy.  But we did try to always end it up by a few days on a beach or something.  But it was work.  So now I just go to lay back (laughter).
Story_ID: 30444
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I have not asked you about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't know because I don't know what the (laughter), how deep you want this well, how broad you want the well.  I mean I really don't.  Now, I think this, the whole concept [of oral history] is fantastic, and it should be done obviously, and we hope that it doesn't all stay in the vaults, but it takes money and I realize that.  And you kinda wonder who ultimately is going to make it even more real.  And it probably and it'll end up probably having to, yes, corporations, but it's gonna probably have to come out of The HistoryMaker community [oral history archive].
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, that's the only way.
Speaker 1: This will be a rich contribution to it.
Speaker 2: And that has to be bought into and sold in a way that it doesn't--you don't have to be a millionaire to make a contribution because I know when I first got the flyer about the fund-raiser, I kind of felt that it was, the fund-raiser for the people who had money as opposed to the fund-raiser for the people.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Because it seemed like it was much more, too gala to attract the audience that you really would like to attract.  I mean you wanna attract everybody including, but you, there's only so many people at the top.  But, you know, a million people with one dollar is just as effective as two people with 500,000 (laughter).  And then you've got that many more eyes and ears that are invested into the program.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, our last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That I did my best.  That's number one.  That I, within the confines of being a human being that, in spite of the fact that the good--
Story_ID: 30445
Speaker 1: My last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as a person who's not arbitrary or capricious, a person who did his best and he did it with positive intentions, that my efforts are always oriented to the larger good for myself and my family, for society and not selfishness, not personal greed and gain because they bring into another whole set of emotions and energies.  And I just as soon be able to interact, you know, if a student called me tomorrow and I don't even know him.  And they wanna say, how do you get into graduate school or something?  I'll talk with them and sometimes it'll be an hour or two hours.  It doesn't matter to me as long as I don't have anything else going on or I'll say, okay, well, look, what are your hours like?  And they start telling me different things.  I'll say well, I'll meet you at Borders [chain of bookstores] at 6:00 o'clock.  We can sit there and talk.  And so I feel very, very--it's important for me to definitely be a resource.  I mean I have all this, I have experience, experience that a lot of individuals don't, and in our community don't have.  And I can help, I can give that information to individuals.  How they use it is another thing, but also to hopefully reduce a lot of poor strategies.
Story_ID: 30446
Speaker 1: You know, if you're applying to medical school or graduate school, and you haven't taken the certain courses and then you come along and say you're gonna take the GRE [Graduate Record Examinations] or the MCAT [Medical College Admissions Test] exam, but you still need to take your physics, that don't make any sense.  All you're doing is spending money and wasting time and then embarrassing yourself when the scores come back.  You've got to optimize, you should try to optimize as much as you can before you, before you start the ordeal.  It's like this lady that on Friday [at NSF ScienceMakers Public Program at Allen Temple Baptist Church] was raising this issue about she was, applied to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley], and she was the only black student and applied for molecular biology and science and blahta, blahta, blahta.  And one, I felt it was quite improper for, that panel was not the panel to deal with it.  Number two, we don't know what her (laughter), you know, you can say you did all these things, but we never, I have to see what you got there and then I can see if we can subtract and add or maybe you should take this thing in steps and go maybe to a state college and get a master's and then do the run.  There's nothing wrong with those, you see.  You gotta get out of the mindset that, no, I'm only real or I'm only strong if I, in fact, jump from where I was and right into Berkeley, one of the most competitive institutions in the world.  You can go over to San Francisco State [University, California] and jump to Berkley from there with great ease.  And there're a lot of good programs at San Francisco State that's clearly shown students going to--I mentioned some of those students who were in programs at San Francisco State and go to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and graduate from Harvard.  And it's just, you've just gotta look at how, you wanna win, okay.  That's what you wanna do?  Let's show you how you can win.  Now, if you wanna win that way, then you're asking, you may even be asking for a whipping, an unnecessary whipping (laughter).  Well, you're gonna get a whipping, but unnecessary but--
Story_ID: 30447
Speaker 1: So you're saying that you wanna be utilized for the advice that you can give to them now as well as-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --remembered in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean that's, as a person who's, as a resource and that I didn't shirk away from that.  It's very important to me to be able to have felt and for the individual to feel that, you know, at least they got the information.  What they did with it, what they do with it is their own business.  But that I didn't say, well, you know, my office hours are from 1:00 o'clock to 1:15 and at 1:10 I'm drinking coffee (laughter).  That's very important to me because it's, the ignorance level is very high, the unawareness in how to win in this game, 'cause you--it is a strategy.  You have to use strategies to win.  And that's one of the things that's lacking in the larger community 'cause we don't, our kids don't know that sometimes it's not just grades.  There are other things that come through.  And sometimes, it's the aggregate of all these little things adding up to make this, make this recipe work.  You may know that to make a cake, you need flour, sugar and this, that and the other.  But if you put the portions in there wrong, (laughter), you'll get, you don't know what you'll get.  You'll get a cake, but it may not be a cake that's gonna (laughter) sell in [unclear] (laughter).  So you gotta know that, and you gotta be willing to deal with it and you also have to be willing to consider the possibility that not everything goes in a straight line.  I mean there's something called the second law of thermodynamics [inaccurate], I think that--I think, I'm being factitious, that your capacity to do work [mechanial work, in physics] is independent of the path that you take.  And ultimately, your free energy change is the same.  Some of them are barriers that are that high, some of them are barriers that are this high.  But when you get to the point where you gotta, where you're measuring free change and going from State A to State B, it's the same.  So it's independent of how you do it.  It's just that it may cost you more, but then when you come back down, you go past--you go all the way up and recover all that energy that you put up there and then you come to the place where you started.  This is what, you still got the same game.  So, the objective is to try to, one, reduce high energy activations, find catalysts, find ways of getting around that so that you just gotta up and over and (swift sound).  And it's a simple phenomenon.  But the person's got to be serious, and you can't say well, I wanna become an astrophysicist and not be willing to take some higher orders of mathematics.  It's part of the, that's what goes along with it.  And it may not even be routinely relevant.  I mean I think about all the math that I took and those quantum mechanics courses.  I didn't use that stuff in my day-to-day dealing with science.  But it was, it grounded you.  It gives you a perspective.  It gives you a way to begin to ask questions or how to address.  I mean it's a problem-solving skill.  Really, it's developing problem-solving skills, and that's important if you're going to get a Ph.D. degree because it's not appreciated that the Ph.D. degree is the highest academic degree of an institution.  It's higher than the other degrees of professionals, engineering degrees and M.D. degrees.  All of those are professional degrees.  But the highest academic degree is a Ph.D.  And what it tells the world is that you know how to think and solve problems, not that you're necessarily gonna be a history major and you're gonna solve a transportation problem, but you, but on the strategy, you would know how--this is what you have to do to unravel a problem.  And if you don't know the language, obviously, you can't solve certain sets of problems because it's not you, but the strategies are almost the same.  I don't care if you're a historian, I don't care if you're a mathematician, you have to be able to identify the variables, the unknowns and how do you get to control so you can control, to get--hold some parts constant so (laughter) so that you can ask a question and where to go to look and how to test the system.  And that's what, in a sense, a person with a Ph.D. is telling the world, I've been certified to be a problem solver.  And I should know how to solve problems.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you.  You answered more than the question I asked.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But that's part of this process.  And it happens all the time--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --but thank you so much for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, no problem.  So you want me to bring those pictures in here.
Story_ID: 30448
Speaker 1: (PHOTOS) (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay. JOHN WATSON:  Let her rip.  Okay.  This is a photograph of my brothers and my son at the Million Man March [1995], but so this is my son, John Malik, this is me, this is my brother, Roger who's a year younger than I.  This is my youngest brother, Gerald who's 20 years younger than I, and then this is my brother, Christopher, who is 18 years younger than I. JOHN WATSON:  This a photograph of the fraternity Christmas party in Chicago in 1959, and I was escorting my wife to be (laughter) at this party-- INTERVIEWER:  And what was her name? JOHN WATSON:  And her name at the time was Valerie Landry, and that's me. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION): JOHN WATSON:  So this is a picture of me with my oldest, my first child, Lisa, and I was in graduate school at the University of Illinois at the Medical Center. JOHN WATSON:  This is a picture of me on the graduation day of receiving my PhD. from the University of Illinois. INTERVIEWER:  What year was that? JOHN WATSON:  Nineteen sixty eight [1968], June, '68' [1968] or May '68' [1968], one. INTERVIEWER:  Keep going. JOHN WATSON:  This is a picture of my paternal grandfather, Reverend John Watson who, and he has his two--two of his grandchildren on his lap.  One of them is me.  That's me, and this is my brother, Roger. JOHN WATSON:  Okay, I didn't mean to put that one in there cause I don't need that one.  That's fun and game, camping (laughter). JOHN WATSON:  Ah, this is a picture taken at Navy Pier, probably 1959 and I was pledging Alpha Phi Alpha, Beta Chapter in Chicago, and so this is, we were all in the pledge line, this Ronald Thomas, Tommie Jackson, Raymond Brody, this is me and this is Bennie Stewart [right to left]. INTERVIEWER:  This is a picture taken on the day we received our chiefancy titles in Lagos from the King of Elegoosi (ph.).  And this is my wife, Valerie, this is me, and then this was another person that received the chiefancy title, and her name is Faith Casa. JOHN WATSON:  This is a photograph of me with another person being initiated into the traditional Ifa religion of the Yoruba people and we were coming out of the sacred grove after having through a, one phase of our initiation process.  This is my teacher, Chief Priest Ifa Beneshola Atanda (ph.)--I'll have to write that out for you.  And then these Aywhoas (ph.), Bibulous (ph.) who helped in the process of initiating.  The guy that's with me, he's a Prince in Nigeria, but I don't remember his name.  We went into the grove together. JOHN WATSON:  That's my mother, Catherine P. Berkley-Watson. INTERVIEWER:  About what year is that?  Do you know? JOHN WATSON:  Oh, I, I don't know.  I figure-- INTERVIEWER:  In the '40's [1940s], you think? JOHN WATSON:  In the '40's [1940s], yeah, yeah. JOHN WATSON:  Around the same time.  This is my father, Hosea Watson, and he was still in the Army, and that's in '42' [1942], '43' [1943]. JOHN WATSON:  This is a photograph of all of my siblings.  So this is me, this is Elliott Watson, Gerald Watson, Roger Watson, Christopher Watson, Stanley Watson, Robert Watson and my only sister, Cheryl Watson. JOHN WATSON:  Okay, this is a collage that represents the celebration we had in October, my wife and I had, and actually, it was as surprise to her cause my children and I worked on it, my celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary.  So that's me, and this is my wife, Valerie.  These are my children with us.  This is my oldest daughter, Lisa, my next older, Susan, next is Catherine, and my son, John Malek.  And these are grandchildren, who are shown.  This is my oldest grandchild, Christania (ph.), Marisa, and Kallon, and Kayla and Khaleel.  Khaleel, Kayla and Christania's mother is Catherine and Marisa and Kallon's mother is Lisa.  And then this is just all of the family members who was at this reception--at the party and then this, the new person is Harvette Gray who's the cousin of my wife. INTERVIEWER:  I know Harvette. JOHN WATSON:  You know Harvette? (laughter) JOHN WATSON:  And this is Beverly Watson, my brother, Elliott's wife, and then this is my sister, Cheryl. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION): JOHN WATSON:  And this is my, let's see, they're papa's parents.  And papa is my mother's father. So he would be my grandfather.  These are great grandparents on my mother's side.  I got to give the names. INTERVIEWER:  Oh, okay. JOHN WATSON:  Okay, okay, so I was--I had to--so this is Marshall Berkley and this is Charlotte Berkley. JOHN WATSON:  This is just a photograph to show our joy and excitement of attending President Obama's inauguration and for me, it's just part of a process because I went to the March on Washington--my wife and I went both to the March on Washington.  I went to the Million Man March and now, the inauguration. JOHN WATSON:  And here we are dressed up to go to an inaugural ball, my wife and I. INTERVIEWER:  That's 2008. JOHN WATSON:  Two thousand eight [2008], yeah.  [January 2009 for the actual inauguration]. JOHN WATSON:  This is my mother's mother, my grandmother, and her name is Ellen Berkley. JOHN WATSON:  This is a picture my sister sent me recently.  She calls it Boys in the Hood.  This is in Ida B. Wells Project, and I must have been--this is me, this is my brother, Roger, and this is Elliott.  I don't know.  I suspect I must be about seven, eight. INTERVIEWER:  No, you look about five to me. JOHN WATSON:  Oh, five, okay.  Yeah, okay, but that's Ida B. Wells [projects]. JOHN WATSON:  And this is me in like kindergarten or second grade. INTERVIEWER:  You're making some weird faces (laughter). JOHN WATSON:  Yeah, I was shocked.  I haven't seen that, I don't remember seeing that picture. JOHN WATSON:  This is me, early '40's [1940s], made in the early '40's [1940s]. JOHN WATSON:  This is my mother's father, Joseph Berkley, my grandfather. JOHN WATSON:  And that's me in high school, graduation picture. INTERVIEWER:  From Parker High School? JOHN WATSON:  Parker High School, yeah. JOHN WATSON:  This is Mary Robinson King Watson.  She is my father's grandmother, so she's my great grandmother. JOHN WATSON:  This is James Cornelius who has a Slave Narrative.  And he is my mother's grandfather on her maternal side.  So he's, he is the father of Ellen Berkley.  And he lived to a ripe old age of anywhere between 102--98 to 102, just--and he died in 1943.  He was born enslaved. JOHN WATSON:  Okay, now this is my high school year book--oh, did you get it? INTERVIEWER:  No. JOHN WATSON:  Okay, I'm sorry.  Okay, and so what I have in here [Parker Pine 1957] is pictures from high school cause high school was a wonderful time for me.  I enjoyed high school [and so did this transcriber, also a Parker High School graduate, 1966].  I had no qualms, no ill feelings.  And what I wanted to emphasize here is that it ends up that there are-- INTERVIEWER:  Oh, that's Jesse Owens' brother-- JOHN WATSON:  Yeah, that's Jesse Owens' brother--that three HistoryMakers, all of us came out of the same class, high school class.  So that's me as the Class Vice President.  And the additional HistoryMaker is Tom Burrell, oh, I'm sorry.  The next HistoryMaker is Mavis Staples. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Did she sing even back then? JOHN WATSON:  Huh? (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Did she sing in school? JOHN WATSON:  Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  When we--because when we identified, I remember very well in high school we were asked to identify what we wanted to do and be, and she always wanted to be like Mahalia Jackson.  And I, since I didn't live in the neighborhood, I had no relation, I didn't even know that she was part of, that they were singing at that time.  And then there's me. JOHN WATSON:  So that's just documentation that, the probability of that happening, one high school, not the high school, one class, it seems very small, but it happened. INTERVIEWER:  Could we get the basketball team too? JOHN WATSON:  Yeah, let me get it, okay.
