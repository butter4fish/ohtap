We are at Skadden, Arps [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP], 4 Times Square in New York City [New York, New York].  Would you please say and spell your name, tell us your birth date and what you do.

Speaker 1: Excellent.
Story_ID: 656895
Speaker 1: So we start with what we call People magazine type questions, easy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That might not be easy for a fashion designer (laughter).
Speaker 2: It's hard to pick a color.  I do, I do love all shades of pink, mostly the deep rich ones, but I love, there aren't many colors that I don't like you know?  I'm always like excited to explore new colors and to rediscover colors or to fall in love with colors I thought I didn't like.
Speaker 1: Time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of year?  I love spring.  I mean, I like fall but I love spring because it's like rebirth and you know, I love watching things turn green.
Speaker 1: Food--
Speaker 2: Favorite food.  That's interesting; you know, I love nuts and popcorn, but I love the things that I need, like I eat a lot of kale, but I love kale.
Speaker 1: Vacation destination--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm wide open for vacation.  I sometimes end up going to the Caribbean and there's something really nice about that because everyone is so welcoming and you sort of feel like you're with relatives all the time, you know, so I do love that but wide open, I love travel.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite saying or phrase?
Speaker 2: There are a few.  One is--you know, because there's stuff you have to tell yourself all the time to remain sane--and one my mom [Patricia Dayle Reese] gave me is, I have all the time I need to do all I need to do.
Speaker 1: (Makes sound) That's a good one.
Story_ID: 656896
Speaker 1: So, I, I'd like to talk about your family. And we'll talk about both sides of your family. Let's start with your mother, please tell me her name, her birth date, where she was born and tell me about her.
Speaker 2: My mom, Patricia Reese, was born Patricia, Patricia Dayle Rose [Patricia Dayle Reese], April 1940, April 12th.  She was born in Detroit [Michigan].  She's like a Detroit native through and through.  Her family came up from Mississippi.
Speaker 1: What part?
Speaker 2: Meridian [Mississippi]; so, my grandmother, Mary Cleveland, was born in Meridian.  I don't know what year she and her parents came to Detroit.  It was probably sometime in the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: And do, how far can you trace back your mother's family?
Speaker 2: Pretty far.  You know, my younger sister, Erin [Erin Reese Burks], has done all the family tree work but grandmother was really good at, you know, staying in touch with relatives and all that, so, if I made it a mission we could probably go back at least two or three generations beyond my grandmother (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do--are you aware of any specific connections to slavery?
Speaker 2: I'm not.
Speaker 1: Can't go back that far?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  What, what was your grandparents' work?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was secretary to the secretary of state of Michigan for like twenty years.  It was Richard Austin [Richard H. Austin], and before he was secretary of state, he was in public office in Detroit so he, you know, ran in Detroit and was in public office there for years since she was the secretary and when he won secretary of state she went to Lansing [Michigan] to continue to work with him and she would commute back and forth to Detroit on the weekends.
Speaker 1: So, the family stayed in Detroit.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and by then, by the time she went to Lansing, I think my aunts and uncles were out of college probably except for my youngest uncle, Jerry [Jerry Dayle (ph.)], who was in Kalamazoo [Michigan], so he was really close to her because Lansing and Kalamazoo are probably about a half hour apart.  So, her kids were out of the nest, as they say, by the time she went to Lansing. And then on my--
Speaker 1: And what about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather passed away, you know, he, my grandma and grandfather divorced when my mom was probably two or three years old and he was not very active in her life.  He used to come by and visit every now and then, but honestly I don't know what he did.  We didn't have really a relationship with him at all.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 656897
Speaker 1: What was your mother's work?
Speaker 2: My mom [Patricia Dayle Reese] taught modern dance at Wayne County Community College [Wayne County Community College District, Detroit, Michigan] for a couple of decades, you know, and she taught part time and then she opened her own business which was called Things To Be Done, and she provided all kinds of services to the community, from secretarial services to, you know, public relations.  She would, you know, polish and guide people; you know, create their business cards, write resumes.  She would help people write their thesis papers, she did all kinds of stuff.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: But, it was like a real service to the community, because my mom was, you know, she was very polished and, you know, very well educated and she knew how things should be done, and I think a lot of people, especially young people, they really need, you know, some guidance and some polish and at the time, the services that she provided, the secretarial stuff and like business services, you couldn't just go to Kinko's and, like, create your own--
Speaker 1: They didn't exist yet.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, and so she did all that for twenty-four years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where did she go to school?
Speaker 2: My mom went to Wayne State University.
Speaker 1: Which is the local--
Speaker 2: It is the local state university.  It's right in the heart of Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: And many, I feel like many people in the black community went to Wayne State University.
Speaker 2: It's true.  It's so funny though, when you're home and you're, you know, on campus, the black population is probably less than 20 percent that way because it pulls from everywhere and from the whole state, so, you know you're always thinking you know, that it's a predominantly black university but it's not (laughter).
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that, because there's so many prominent African Americans who come out of that school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, because there's so many prominent African Americans that come from Detroit.
Speaker 1: Ding (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Get that in, girl.
Story_ID: 656898
Speaker 1: So on your fath- tell me your, your father's name, when and where he was born and about him.
Speaker 2: My father was Claude Reese, no middle name, and he was born in Lowndes County, Alabama, December 12th, 1934.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And, how many children in his family?
Speaker 2: There were, you know, from my grandma, my grandma's first marriage there were four kids, so my dad was the second.  Uncle Isaac [Isaac Reese, Jr.], and my dad, and then there were twins, Lionel [Lionel Reese (ph.)] and Vaughn [Vaughn Reese (ph.)], after my dad.  And then, she remarried and had one more daughter, but she had a lot of stepchildren from the second marriage too.
Speaker 1: And, tell me who are your grandparents?
Speaker 2: So, my dad's mom was Essie Mae Jones [Essie Bates Jones], previously Essie Mae Reese, and then what was she before?  She was a Bates previously; Essie Mae Bates, and my dad's father was, died when my dad was like seven, and he was Isaac Reese, so--Isaac Reese, Sr.--yeah, I never knew really either one of my grandfathers.  Grandmothers played a very large role, but grandfathers were not really on the scene.
Speaker 1: What were, your grandparents were Essie Mae and Isaac--
Speaker 2: Grandma was a homemaker.  We called her Grandma Down South.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That is like it was her name: Grandma Down South.
Speaker 2: She was a, she was a homemaker, you know, she made quilts and did little home industry things and when she was younger, I don't know if she worked outside of the home.  She might have done some cleaning or taken in cleaning or laundry or something, I'm not sure, but I don't know of her having a profession outside of the home.
Speaker 1: And what about Isaac Reese?
Speaker 2: I don't even know.
Speaker 1: You know, because he died so young.
Speaker 2: He died so young.  It's a good question.  I'm not sure what he did.
Speaker 1: Do you know why he died?
Speaker 2: He actually was in a horse and carriage and this was, you know, like probably 1940 in a horse and carriage because this, we're talking like boondocks of Alabama, and he got hit by a car and killed.
Speaker 1: Wow. And then Mr. Jones, what was his first name? Don't know?
Speaker 2: That's a good question because he died before I was born too.
Speaker 1: Really? Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, the whole Jones family, we had a relationship because there are tons of aunts and uncles and they were like big family, very, you know there must have been like ten or twelve of them, Aunt Sadie Mae [ph.], Aunt Sarah [ph.], Great Aunt Alice [ph.] (laughter),
Speaker 1: Right, (pronunciation) aunt (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, exactly. Uncle Willie George [ph.], everybody had two, all the men had two names, Uncle John Paul [ph.], Uncle Vinnie Lewis [ph.], but I didn't know who the father was and I never met him.
Speaker 1: So what were the kinds of jobs in the family? With these, ten, twelve people?
Speaker 2: Wow.  That's, I think for the men mostly, factory work.
Speaker 1: Factory.
Speaker 2: Everybody migrated to Ohio and Michigan over time, and--
Speaker 1: But when they were in in Alabama, was it farming?
Speaker 2: Probably.  Probably farming.  I mean, my dad's generation was the first to go to college.  Like, my dad's older brother is a research doctor.
Story_ID: 656899
Speaker 1: And my dad [Claude Reese] joined the [U.S.] Navy and I think that's how he was able to start paying for school.  So he, after he got out of the Navy he went to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] for one year and he ran out of money and came to Detroit [Michigan] and started at Wayne State [Wayne State University], and he was like working and going to college at the same time, and then my Uncle Pop who is, they call him Pop but his name is Lionel [Lionel Reese (ph.)], because, you know everybody in Alabama has other names.  He went to the [U.S.] Army and I think he also ended up going to Wayne, but then my dad, you know, after he was at Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC] for a number of years, he was like kind of on an executive training program and they put him through the master's program at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], so he used to commute back and forth and like he--
Speaker 2: And how far away was that?
Speaker 1: About an hour and a half from home.  So, and he was working at the same time so those were like some intense years, but he was determined.
Speaker 2: Right. So when he was going there, did, was he living on campus during the week?
Speaker 1: Now, that was in the '70s [1970s], so we were, when my dad was going (unclear), I just remember that 'Rich Man, Poor Man,' the series was on TV and my dad would, I don't know if he was working nights and going to school during the day or the other way around, but he would get home at like ten p.m. and he would be out of the house like at the, you know, like at five or six in the morning--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --so he was kind of doing it all and he would drive home, but he wanted to get home in time to see 'Rich Man, Poor Man' (laughter) so he would be, that car would like roll into the driveway at ten o'clock.
Speaker 2: So that's why you remember that.
Speaker 1: I do remember.
Speaker 2: And that was before, that was before VCRs [videocassette recorder].
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  That was like--
Speaker 2: So you had to be there to watch it.
Speaker 1: I think he graduated with his master's [degree] like around '72 [1972]; '72 [1972] or '73 [1973], something like that. Maybe '74 [1974] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so he was at Chevrolet, you said?
Speaker 1: No, he was at Chrysler.
Speaker 2: Excuse me, at Chrysler.
Speaker 1: Yeah (background noise).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: So Chrysler, how common was it for Chrysler or any of the automotive companies to pay for their executives to continue education.
Speaker 2: I think it was actually very common.  I don't know if there was any special incentive for my dad because he was African American.  I mean, he was only the first, he was the first black plant manager at Chrysler period and the second in all the big three, so there was someone at Ford [Ford Motor Company] before my dad, and then my dad. So it was, you know, a long road for him and he got passed over a trillion times but finally you know, was given the full responsibility of running the plant.
Story_ID: 656900
Speaker 1: During that time, the '70s [1970s], '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] were very important for Detroit [Michigan] in many ways.  It was booming.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, can you describe to the best of your knowledge from what your parents have told you, and even what you may remember, what the times of your life meant?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we, when I was probably three or four, we moved temporarily to Indianapolis [Indiana], because my dad's job was transferred and we back to Detroit, so that would have been like '67 [1967], so we were in Indianapolis from probably '67 [1967] to '69 [1969], and the riots occurred, I believe, in '68 [sic. 1967]--
Speaker 1: It was '68 [1968], I believe.
Speaker 2: --because I remember coming home because we would home some weekends and a lot of the rioting occurred near my [maternal] grandmother's home and I just remembered I was very young, but I remember things just being in disarray, you know, and I think if you live in Detroit or you're from Detroit, the whole, you know, like burning of the city and the aftermath.  I mean, still, when I go home there's still plenty of burned out buildings and they're from that day, you know, so it's like the blight, but I don't think after that point people thought of Detroit as booming; I mean, it was an interesting time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I actually think I got the dates wrong, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and we had a black mayor in the '70s [1970s], Coleman Young, who was, you know, a key figure and obviously extremely pro-Detroit and very protective of the city and I just remember, you know, my mom [Patricia Dayle Reese] was always extremely pro-Detroit.  My dad [Claude Reese] always wanted to, you know, build a big house in the suburbs because that's what you did.  If you were successful, then you moved to the suburbs and all the executives, you know, pretty much lived in the suburbs and that was sort of one of the straws that broke the camel's back of my parents' marriage, because my mom always wanted to stay in the city and they had literally bought land in Bloomfield Hills [Michigan] and an old college friend of my dad's and you know, fraternity brother, Howard Sims, who is a, he just passed away last year actually but a really famous, especially in Detroit, architect was gonna design the house and, you know, they had the plans and everything and we'd go out to the land every week and then like, like my dad had a chainsaw, you know, to scare us basically and we would be (air quotes) clearing the land, you know, preparing to build a house and it was really a bone of contention, though, with my parents because my mom really didn't want to leave the city and my dad, that was like the culmination of his dreams was to build this, you know, modern house in Bloomfield Hills.
Speaker 1: Wow. And did he do it?
Speaker 2: Nope.  They got divorced, and they separated, and sold the land, and yeah.
Story_ID: 656901
Speaker 1: I want you to go back to your childhood and way back.  What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Hm. I think my earliest memories are probably in Indianapolis [Indiana], because I don't remember much beyond that.  We lived in these townhouses and, you know, they had like the clubhouse with the pool and everything and then there were all these, you know, connected townhouses and my older sister, Leslie [Leslie Reese], went to Harcourt Elementary [Harcourt Elementary School] in Indianapolis and I just remember, like, you know, standing at the front door with my dad [Claude Reese], like waiting for the school bus to drop her off in the afternoons, you know.  I remember going to nursery school there.  I went to a Jewish nursery school, like a preschool, and they would always hand out matzah before nap time, you know, and they'd give me saltines, and I was like, "Oh, I like the matzah too," (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, they wouldn't give it to you?
Speaker 2: If I wanted it, I asked for it, I'd get it but they had saltines ready for me in case I didn't want it, but there's a little tiny school bus that used to drop me off.  I remember when my younger sister [Erin Reese Burks] was born like, you know, just being so excited to get home from school and I knew my mom [Patricia Dayle Reese] was going to be home with the baby that day and running up the stairs, so most of the earlier memories are actually in Indianapolis in the townhouse, and like playing. We were always the only black family wherever we lived; you know, in Indianapolis, we had to integrate that little townhouse situation. In Detroit [Michigan], we were like probably the second black family in our neighborhood and I remember coming back, you know, because my parents rented our house when we were in Indianapolis. They used to--I guess they rented it to, what they called some (air quotes) hippies, and they had painted the inside all kinds of crazy colors and my parents, you know, had to repaint and everything but our next door neighbors weren't happy to see us come back at all, and their kids weren't allowed to play with us, Mrs. Powers [ph.].  She's--
Speaker 1: Wait, when you came back to Detroit?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Because that was, what, 1969, probably?  Yeah, her kids were not allowed to play with us, and the kids across the street weren't allowed to play with us, but there were so many other families that, you know, were very welcoming and it was a really good community actually, because everybody was very, you know, active in the Woodward Greenacres Association [sic. the Greenacres Woodward Civic Association] and, you know, there was a lot of carpooling and our neighbor on the other side was an interior decorator, Mrs. Verne [ph.], and she used to have us over all the time and, you know, to bake cookies or, she had a workshop in her basement and she used to pay us like a quarter to pick up stray pins.  She had like a magnet on a stick and you'd like go around the basement floor picking up pins, but she was everybody's favorite in the neighborhood because she would have all the kids over to do crafts and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: That was a good thing for you to learn.
Speaker 2: Very good.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)(Unclear)(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, you know, she helped my mom out because my mom always sewed and I remember Mrs., we called her Mrs. Verne.  Verna Camens [ph.] was her name.  She would kind of guide my mom like on home sewing projects like curtains and stuff like that and give her interior decorating advice--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --but I had a great childhood.  I always, you know, and I knew it at the time and I have always been so grateful because I had, you know, like a very carefree childhood.  My parents were strict and pretty old school, and I think that was a good thing, you know.  We had to, we had to work first.  Anything that we wanted, we had to do chores.  You know, you didn't go anywhere on Saturday if your chores weren't done period, you know, and I had to get up and make my bed every day and we had to wash the dishes and, you know, keep, do our share of the, of the housework to keep everything going.  It was a very, like old school upbringing you know, and I'm grateful for it.
Story_ID: 656902
Speaker 1: How many children in your family?  What's the order?
Speaker 2: I grew up with two sisters, so my older sister, Leslie [Leslie Reese], and my younger sister, Erin [Erin Reese Burks].
Speaker 1: And what's the age difference between you?
Speaker 2: Leslie is almost three years older than me, and Erin is almost five years, so she's like four and a half years younger than me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then after my parents [Patricia Dayle Reese and Claude Reese] divorced, my dad remarried [to Kathryn Reese] and from that marriage I have two brothers, so my stepbrother Marcus [Marcus Reese] is, how much younger, let's see, that's a good question, let's see.  Marc's like forty-one, so he's almost twelve years younger than me, and then my youngest brother Claude [Claude Edward Reese], who passed away, was what thirty years younger than me?  No, twenty years younger, twenty, twenty-one, twenty years younger (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was young when he passed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was twenty-one.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: He died in a car accident.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Like your--
Speaker 2: Grandfather [Reese's paternal grandfather, Isaac Reese, Sr.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Gran- grandfather.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 656903
Speaker 1: Going back to--now I don't whether you'll, you tell me where you're going.  It's either Indianapolis [Indiana] or Detroit [Michigan], but in your young years when, when you put yourself there, what are the sights, sounds, and smells that you remember?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Wow.  Sights, sounds, and smells.  I remember being outside a lot.  You know, by the time we came back to Detroit, I was a little more independent (unclear) and we were just outside all the time, playing with friends and you know, putting on little plays in the backyard and playing dress up and, you know, having a seance across the street at (laughter) Colleen's [ph.] house. Or you know, we had a lot of great neighbors and so there was just, you know, probably all the kids within a two block, at least, length of the street were super friendly and played together and that was a big memory.  I, I remember too, that, you know, on the weekends we always had lessons, so we had, we'd go to the Y [Young Men's Christian Association] and you could pick, you know, they had that Saturday program for children and you could pick three classes, so I would swimming and art, and then I would decide do I want to take knitting or do I want to take--you know, there was always a choice of three and Erin [Erin Reese Burks] always took gymnastics, Leslie [Leslie Reese] always had dance, so that was like Saturday, you know, chores and then we'd go out for lessons and then come home and play and, you know, but we were just, I always, when I moved to New York [New York], I always felt sad for kids here because it's like oh, you don't just get to, like, be outside, you know, and I could hear my mom [Patricia Dayle Reese] calling me from two blocks away, you know, and you knew actually everybody, you were kind of like, "Wait a minute, I think that was my mom."  You know, you just like get up and run home, but I, the freedom of that, of just, you know, being able to run around the neighborhood and everybody else's parents would sort of have an eye out for you, you know, and it just felt completely safe.  I don't remember my mom being concerned for our safety.  We used to ride the city bus.  She taught us to ride the city bus at a really early age because she was like, "I'm not gonna take you back and forth everywhere forever.  You're gonna have to learn how to get to your lessons and go to the library."  I mean, we used to spend a lot of time at the library.  Like our neighborhood library was probably about two and a half miles away and we would just walk over there.
Story_ID: 656904
Speaker 1: So you were always doing this with a sibling?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. So you weren't alone?
Speaker 2: Nope, I think very little time alone, and I have a cousin that's very close to me in age, she's like maybe seven months younger than me and we spent a lot of time together too.  They didn't live far.  I mean, I remember walking over to their house.  They probably lived about three and a half miles away, but you know, we were taught to be independent.  You know, if you had thirty-five cents and you could walk to the candy store on Saturday afternoon, that's where you were headed, but I remember my mom [Patricia Dayle Reese], she made sure we had exposure to, you know, the museums and libraries and she was taking, like, she used to take dance classes to you know, to stay current with her craft and we would be in a main library [Detroit Public Library Main Branch] in Detroit [Michigan] in the Cultural Center [Cultural Center Historic District].  You know, she would drop us off at nine and pick us up at twelve [o'clock], and we were so happy because of that huge children's reading room.  We were always taking books out and just sitting in the library and reading and plotting what we were gonna take out next.  You know so, that was, I don't know if it was a girl thing that we were totally content to do that; you know we grew up with two sisters and you know exactly what I'm talking about.  There are just certain activities that were very easy and, you know, that we welcomed and I think, you know, doing crafts and reading and you know, the whole dance and swimming and all that stuff, you know, and we were forced to play piano and do all the things young ladies should do (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Forced.
Speaker 2: It's like we have, it's sort of like an old school, you know, education that way.  I mean, she insisted that we take piano lessons, you know, and I hated it.  She let me out of it after about two years, but both Leslie [Leslie Reese] and Erin [Erin Reese Burks] played for years.  They don't remember anything now (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's good.
Speaker 2: At one point, I think Erin was sixteen and my dad [Claude Reese] was like, "Are you gonna become a concert pianist?"  And she was like, "No."  He was like, "Do I have to keep paying for these lessons?" (Laughter) You know, it was like that, and she was like, "Okay."
Story_ID: 656905
Speaker 1: So we're talking about growing up.  What--where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: I went to school in Detroit [Michigan].  I went to Detroit Public Schools [Detroit Public Schools Community District] all the way through and our neighborhood school was pretty good, our elementary school, but I remember when it was time to go to middle school, my mom [Patricia Dayle Reese], you know, got busy and both my older sister and I went out of region for middle school and she, she was just super active in schools and, you know, she was always up at school and sort of just finagled, you know, a better middle school situation for me than was in our region and then I went to citywide high school, which was Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], so--
Speaker 1: So, Cass Tech's a famous high school?
Speaker 2: Cass Tech is a famous high school.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about what it means, you know, this was the only magnet school at that time, right?
Speaker 2: There were later on, like probably when I was a sophomore, a new school called Renaissance [Renaissance High School, Detroit, Michigan] opened and that was also a magnet school, so you had to test to get into Cass and it was a huge school; I mean, my graduating class was almost eight hundred kids, so it was this big old giant building almost downtown, and I remember we used to take, we took the suburban bus because it was closest to our house and we'd take it straight down Woodward Avenue and get out on Henry [Street] and then we would pretty much run to school, because it was like two rough burned out blocks, you know, and there would be rats and you name it, you know, drunks and, you know, all that.  We would run from Woodward to Cass and that was, you know, that was the school jaunt, but it was such a fantastic school to go to, when I was there I remember, I mean, I was lucky because my older sister was there before me so the door was sort of, you know, the carpet was rolled out for me, sort of, because she knew the ropes--
Speaker 1: And she was a good student (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and she had a locker on the second floor, which you know, that, that school had seven floors, so it's like if, the lower the floor the better the locker, of course, if you have a little seniority, and she introduced me to her friends so I didn't look like a raw freshy.  And they gave me all the, like, "Put your books in your book bag.  Don't let anybody see your freshman books because they'll give you a hard time.  Do not buy an elevator pass.  You don't need to purchase an elevator pass," you know, stuff like that.  But, it was so much fun because it had curriculums so I was in an honors curriculum so I went and had AP [advanced placement] courses and yada, yada, yada.  Leslie [Leslie Reese] was in performing arts, and so she was always in, you know, productions and you know, dance and theater and they had radio TV speech, and all these other classes.  There was chem-bio [chemistry biology] for people who you know, wanted to go into medicine.  There was even air conditioning and refrigeration, you know, for people who wanted to be entered at pre-engineering.  There were, there were probably about between twenty and thirty different curriculums and you were encouraged to, you know, pick one after your freshman year.  So--
Speaker 1: After your freshman year?  So, you're pretty young to have to make this choice.
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Yeah.  But it was, it was amazing.
Story_ID: 656906
Speaker 1: I remember the first year I was there [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], like, being in study hall, first week of school and it's just this, you know, I've never been in a school so large and there was so much activity and performing arts was gearing up.  They knew what their first production was gonna be.  It was gonna be, I think it was gonna be 'Godspell' [Stephen Schwartz], and they were dancing and singing through the halls and passing out fliers like, "This is what we're gonna be doing," they're like, (singing), "See thee more clearly, love thee more dearly" ['Day by Day'].  And we're like, you know in study hall and these little shrimp freshmen looking through the windows like, what is going on out there? You know, and there were little mini-fraternities and sororities, there was rushing and all kinds of stuff and--
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Of course, all the sports teams and stuff like that, so there was a lot of activity, tons of clubs.  I had clubs five days a week.  I had to be at school at like 7:15 for, you know, National Honor Society (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What were your clubs? Okay.
Speaker 1: French club, American Youth Hostels [American Youth Hostels, Inc.], because we like to like basically go to Cedar Point [Sandusky, Ohio] or go to Flint [Michigan].  We used to go to Flint to go (air quotes) skiing, cross country; Flint, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Flint?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Exactly.  French club, that's four.  Maybe there were four; I feel like--oh, art club.  We had like art slash fashion club so--
Speaker 2: And did you know you were interested in fashion at that point?
Speaker 1: You know, not really.  I didn't think, I didn't realize it was a career.  I just thought it was a hobby.  I liked to sew.  My mom [Patricia Dayle Reese] sewed, I sewed.  She taught me how to sew.  We always did projects together.
Speaker 2: Like from what age?
Speaker 1: Probably, I made my first garment when I was about eight, because we had home economics in elementary school, and we had sewing projects, and I remember I made a pair of elastic waist pants and I made a second pair, and I had a tunic, too, and I'm wondering if my mom made the tunic and I made the pants, because we had a little fashion show and I remember I wore one pair of pants and she wanted me to carry the second pair over my arm, just to show that this was, this outfit had two looks (laughter).  I didn't really want to carry them, but she was like, "Yes, you made two pair, you're going to carry the second pair over your arm," because she made the tunic and I made the pants and it was, it was a print of patchwork denim. So was a little tunic and some pull on pants--
Speaker 2: I remember that fabric--
Speaker 1: --and then I had made a second pair of navy blue pants that I could wear; or were they white?  Maybe they were white, like white polyester pull on pants (laughter).
Speaker 2: But the fact that they were elastic waist, that was not, that--
Speaker 1: For kids that was normal.
Speaker 2: Was it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm trying to remember the--
Speaker 1: For girls.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I had a lot of elastic waist bottoms because I was always on the precipice of (air quotes) chubbies, like every year, you know, and me getting school clothes and the catalogues would come and my mom would look at me and she was like, "Should we get, should we get chubbies, should we just get chubbies, or should we go up a size?"  And I never wanted to get chubbies.  I was like, just get me the bigger size, and we'd have to hem them you know, but the elastic waist was a good thing for me.
Story_ID: 656907
Speaker 1: So you, you started sewing with your mom [Patricia Dayle Reese] when you were young, but thinking it's a hobby in high school.  Now, Cass Technical High [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], what you, you described all of these different tracks that you could go in, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. And there was a big art department, and then that was broken down.  There was a fashion curriculum as well, which I was not in but because I was in science and arts, which was the honors program, I had, I was able to minor--(laughter) that's hilarious, right? I was able to minor in any other curriculum.  So, I minored--did I minor in fashion or did I minor in art, one of them.  But my mom knew the head of the art department because he was there when she was in school--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --and, yeah, when she'd come for parent teacher conferences or school events, and they would always be catching up, Mr. Irving Berg, and he'd be like, "We gotta get Tracy [HistoryMaker Tracy Reese] into the art department.  We need her.  We need her in the art department."  So, I was happy to take those classes because I'd always had our classes on weekend at local colleges, or, you know, there was a wonderful place called Your Heritage House [Your Heritage House, Inc.] in Detroit [Michigan], which was run by old friends of the family and it was in this beautiful Victorian building in the Cultural Center [Cultural Center Historic District, Detroit, Michigan], and it was basically you know, all kinds of classes, weekend classes, for children so whether you, you know, were a poet or you wanted to paint or whatever, she had relationships with the Detroit Institute of Arts [Detroit, Michigan] and some of the other museums in the cultural center and I remember we'd go down there on Saturdays and meet at, at Your Heritage House and we'd walk over to the DIA, and in the basement they had classrooms and we would paint, you know, with instruction for three hours and you know--
Speaker 1: And you were about what age then?
Speaker 2: I was probably like thirteen, twelve, thirteen.  We loved Your Heritage House, and that's something I would like to, I would love to do something like that in Detroit for, for youth because, you know, all art education has been wiped out of public schools [Detroit Public Schools Community District] and it was such a big part of my childhood (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Even out of Cass?
Speaker 2: Cass still has it--
Speaker 1: But, that's unusual.
Speaker 2: --but not on the scale that it used to.
Speaker 1: Hm, wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 656908
Speaker 1: Who else is going to Cass [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] with you?  Are there any people that we may know who were in high school at the same time as you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's a good question.  I never even looked at it that way.  You know, it's so funny, your life is your life and you're not thinking do people know who I know?  I mean, you know, probably if we pulled out some names we would find out I was, honestly I was kind of a nerd in high school.  I was in American Youth Hostels [American Youth Hostels, Inc.] and I think because of the honors program too, it was just kind of like a nerdy situation and I literally hung out with about thirty people and we like travelled in a mass.  There'd be like six cars trailing everywhere, but, let's see.
Speaker 1: And was the school for the integrated?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.  I remember, I mean at the time I went it was probably about 50 percent black, but the first, like Asian kids I met, it wasn't until high school because Detroit [Michigan] doesn't have a big Asian community.  It has an, an Arab community, but still even those kids I didn't really meet until high school, and they had a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then what about the honors program?  Was that, what was the racial composition there?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  It's probably about 70, 30; maybe 30 percent black--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and a lot of the white kids who might have gone to private school for middle school, because middle schools on the whole were like rough in Detroit, came to Cass after that, so kids who went to Country Day [Detroit Country Day School] or whatever, they ended up back at, at Cass for high school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 656909
Speaker 1: When it comes time to go to college, how are you making your decision as to where you might want to go?
Speaker 2: That was interesting.  I mean, I'd already come to New York [New York] because I went to a summer program for high school students at Parsons [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York] and because I took classes in the fashion department at Cass [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], I got a scholarship.  You know, I sent in my little portfolio, and at the encouragement of the department head there, Cledie Taylor, Dr. Cledie Taylor, who is still very important on the art scene in Detroit [Michigan], but I got a scholarship to come to New York and at the time, my Uncle Stan [ph.], one of my mom's brothers, or both my mom's brothers, were here actually.  Stan was in New Jersey.  He lived in East Orange [New Jersey], and my Uncle Jerry [Jerry Dayle (ph.)] was in Manhattan [New York], but I feel like he might have been on the road, because he was a production stage manager, and he lived in Manhattan Plaza [New York, New York], but he, he was on the road probably nine months out of the year for a lot of his career here, but I stayed with my uncle in New Jersey, and they had two babies.  Winston [ph.] was like a year old, and then Jeffrey [ph.] was born that summer.  So it was like, oh, my god.  Does life get any better than this?  Two babies and I get to go to Parsons during the day; you know, it's like take the bus into the city and I remember my uncle like showing me the route the first day, and he literally drove me to the end of his block and got out of the car and went into this little hamburger joint to get us coffees, and he explained to me it's like, "A regular coffee means it has milk and sugar," (laughter). And he was like, "And then you take the lid and you tear back this little part so you can sift through that," (laughter). And I was like, "Oh, wow, okay," you know.  And then he drove me into Newark [New Jersey] so that I could get on the bus into the city and I would come in at port authority [Port Authority Bus Terminal, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And then, you know, after that I would take a bus from the end of their street into Newark and then walk over to Penn Station in Newark [Newark Penn Station] and then take the bus into the city (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what year was that?
Speaker 2: This was probably the summer of '80 [1980].
Story_ID: 656910
Speaker 1: So, port authority [Port Authority Bus Terminal, New York, New York] in the summer of '80 [1980] is a pretty seedy (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Special place.  Look, you just kept your head down and walked fast, but Parsons [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York] was just a block away--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --'cause the classes were at 40th Street and 7th Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was, you know--
Speaker 1: And I guess you run to Cass [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: I was sixteen, I knew that, I knew, I knew how to get there quick.
Speaker 1: Being sixteen didn't make you ready, or was it your previous experience (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'll figure that out.
Speaker 1: I mean that, that experience just coming out of port authority--
Speaker 2: Well, work itself wasn't all that either.
Speaker 1: Right. Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, so.
Speaker 1: But you had no fear.
Speaker 2: I don't remember having, no.  I don't remember having fear.  I remember having excitement.  I was just so excited there was just so, everything was new, everything was huge. And that was my first introduction to the industry, you know, and that was important.  I mean, I feel like we, we must have taken at least one day of classes on the main campus and I don't remember how I got down there.  I must have been taking the train, but I must have been with other kids, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because I feel like even our orientation was in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Right, because that's where the main campus is.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But that was, that was a big deciding factor for college.  I remember considering going to RISD [Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, Rhode Island] or Cooper Hewitt [sic. Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] or, you know, I mean and my SAT scores were good and so I had a lot of choices and I remember my mom [Patricia Dayle Reese] saying, you know, "Do you want to go to a university, at least for your freshman year, and then go to Parsons?" You know because she wanted me to have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because at this point you didn't know that you wanted to do fashion.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But she was like, you know, "You only get to have that (air quotes) college experience, that classic campus experience, you know, once in your life and you know, there was, there were a lot of opportunities you know," and, I was, you know, you're like in a hurry.  I was like, "No, this is what I want to do."  I'm clear, and I had a scholarship to go to Parsons. And I had one for FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that was (unclear) Cooper Hewitt--
Speaker 2: --but I didn't want--
Speaker 1: --was free.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, not for a Michigander.
Speaker 1: Oh, no?  Okay.  Maybe just locally.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. It's not free any more, but it was free at the time.
Speaker 2: I don't remember a, I don't remember a free situation.
Speaker 1: But also they don't have the kind of fashion program or department like Parsons does (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) yeah, and it was like that because even Parsons you're supposed to take a foundation year, which is, you know you don't take your fashion classes until sophomore year, so foundation year is, you know, really the Parsons principle, you know, and it's your figure drawing and color and design and all these other classes and, they accelerated me.  You know, they're like, "You actually are very advanced.  You don't have to take foundation.  You can start in the sophomore year," and that was attractive to me too, so it's like okay, I can do this in three, I'm, I'm there.
Story_ID: 656911
Speaker 1: And so you come to Parsons [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York], you, you move to New York City [New York, New York].  Where--does Parsons have a campus?
Speaker 2: Parsons had dorms and they shared some dorms with NYU [New York University, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and shared a meal program with NYU, so I was in a dorm on Union Square, so Union Square West [New York, New York], so right at the corner of 16th Street, there is that big, was it Blue Water Grill [New York, New York] or something in that?  That was our dorm building.
Speaker 1: Where Blue Water Grill is now?  Wow.
Speaker 2: And it was, we had floors four through eight were dorms--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then Antonio Lopez had the penthouse and kids were always going up there, especially boys, but--
Speaker 1: And he was, he welcomed you to go?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, I think he liked that, you know, energy and, you know, they were design students.  A lot of Parsons kids with different curriculums, but Parsons kids.  So, I was in those dorms for the first year, and then I got an apartment in Hoboken [New Jersey], with a friend from home who wanted to move to New York, somebody I met while I was working at the fabric store, Barb [ph.], and she was like dying to move to New York, so I was like, "Okay, let's get an apartment together," because Parsons only lets you stay in the dorms for the one year.  They have limited space.
Speaker 1: So then, Hoboken, which is just across the water [Hudson River] in New Jersey, at this, what year am I talking about?
Speaker 2: That was '82 [1982] that I moved to Hoboken.
Speaker 1: And so, what was Hoboken like then?  Now, it is quite the chic place to live.
Speaker 2: Right?  It was--
Speaker 1: Was it becoming that?
Speaker 2: --you know, it was, there were grumblings of that happening and there were a lot of, there were a lot of kids there because it was still affordable and it was convenient to get to the city, but it was cute.  It was a very manageable, you know, little town and transportation was easy and you know, the rent, I feel like our rent was like $663 a month.  For some reason, that number stays in my head.
Speaker 1: For what size apartment?
Speaker 2: For like a one bedroom, but I had other friends from school who were also in Hoboken, so we still go over to each other's houses and it was, I liked it.  I lived in Hoboken for probably four years altogether and a different apartment every year, because at that age, that's pretty much what you do.  It's like you're trading up, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you stay with your friends?
Speaker 2: That's a little bit better, and that's a little bit better.
Speaker 1: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 2: You're changing roommates.  I feel like I changed roommates each time I--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --I moved, but I liked it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and what, and--
Story_ID: 656912
Speaker 1: During this time, what's happening at school?
Speaker 2: Wow, school was intense.  You know, the first year I was at Parsons [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York], the, the department head in fashion was a woman named Ann Keagy, and she was super old school; you know, like white blouse, black skirt, and she, you know as part of her orientation speech, she told us that, you know young ladies were expected to wear, you know, skirts, and young men should, you know, have a clean shirt and you know, pressed slacks and she told us, you know, "This isn't for everybody and some of you are gonna drop out or you'll be asked to leave if you can't hold the standard," and she was like, "You must live, eat, breathe, and sleep fashion."  You know, it was like a very hard core and that year we were the largest class to date because there were forty-four students in our year in fashion, so for--I started in '81 [1981]--there were forty-four students and the typical class size before that had really not been more than like thirty, and Parsons was getting pressure from The New School [New York, New York] to accept more students and she left after that year because she was against the idea of increasing the size of the program.  She didn't think the education would, you know, be quality and she didn't think that there were that many students who deserved to be in the program, or that there were that many job opportunities for that many kids coming out of school, which is all true, but I think for The New School, Parsons was a real attraction for students (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what's the affiliation with Parsons and The New School?
Speaker 2: You know, it's changed over the years because now they call it Parsons The New School [Parsons The New School for Design, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) or whatever, but at the time it was Parsons School of Design and I think it had just joined with The New School like maybe in '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: Was that, The New School was a separate--
Speaker 2: It was a separate school, yeah.
Speaker 1: --school. Originally.
Speaker 2: So, I don't know the true dynamics of the relationship at that time, but I remember, I think it was on the new side and there were, there was a lot of you know dissatisfaction in some camps with, like the new order of things.
Story_ID: 656913
Speaker 1: For your class though, there are forty-four students, who, who was in school [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York] with you?
Speaker 2: Well, the biggest was Marc Jacobs, and we became fast friends because they also, he, he skipped foundation year as well and we were the only two that skipped foundation year in fashion design, so we went down to orientation and we were sitting in the auditorium there and, you know, they literally called every freshman's name and put you in sections and, you know, "You go here, you go there, blah, blah, blah, section A, section C," whatever.  And, the two of us were just sitting there, you know, at the end of it all and we hadn't been called (laughter) and we were like, "Hi," "Hi," you know, and they were like, "Oh, okay, you know," and the downtown people had to figure out why we weren't, we hadn't been put in foundation sections.
Speaker 1: Oh, because that had been done at admissions point--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Right, and uh-huh.
Speaker 2: So, we just naturally became friends because we were birds of a feather, and by the time we got uptown, which we called uptown 40th Street, you know, we're coming into class with people who knew each other already, because they had done foundation year together, so I think we sort of cleaved together a little bit, just naturally, but you know, we were literally in class with the same, I mean, we probably lost, I think we lost a couple people over the course of the three years, but you're like in every class with the same people for three years and we carried twenty hours of credits per semester, and, you know, like design and illustration was a six hour class; you know, draping.  We had two days of draping and it was, you know, nine to twelve and one to four [o'clock], and then you had a lot of homework after that, because everything was just sort of work intensive, so.  You know, by the time we were graduating it's just like, "See ya."  You know, it's like I probably, my four closest friends, or I can expand that to maybe seven.  Everybody else is like, "Okay, I never want to see you again ever.  I know everything about you and it's really much too much.  I know you're gonna be sick on Wednesday.  I know you're gonna cry on Friday."  Like he was like, "Okay, bye."  But it was just like that forced intimacy, you know, and all of the, all of the politics of, of school and the fashion school too.
Speaker 1: Well, we only ask that because you're in all these classes together.  You're working together, learning together, and at the same time looking to discover your-- Voice.
Speaker 2: --personal voice and creativity.  What does, what does the competitive environment feel like?
Speaker 1: It was very competitive, because I, you know, especially like, you know some people are really good at draping, and that's you know, where their creativity really came through.  Some people were more technical and they were really good at pattern drafting.  For me, I always loved illustration.  You know, those were my classes.  Designer and illustration were my strongest classes and then, you know, draping I learned and I was always competitive in terms of grades and I was on scholarship too, so I was determined to keep a B plus, A minus average and I think I've graduated with A minus, and so you know, I just have to really like bear down.  Same thing with pattern making.  I remember Marc and I looking at each other like, after like the first week of pattern making we were like, "This is not coming naturally to me."  (Laughter) It's like we're gonna really have to, like, go into overdrive here and he's so crazy, he was like, "Here's what we're gonna do," and every day we would bring, we would literally bring coffee to the teacher and talk her up and we would present our homework to her together and one of us would just keep up a constant stream of conversation (laughter) so she didn't see all the like eighth of an inch and off here and there that (unclear) with those little patterns because he used to make quarter scale patterns and it's just like we're gonna, we're gonna have to do something because we have to, you know, have to maintain grade point, but this is just not, this is not my shining hour of this class, and it was hilarious, and she probably knew exactly what we were up to, but most of the other kids were cruel so, you know, I did manage to get an A minus out of that and so did he (laughter).
Speaker 2: Did the two of you ever find yourself in competition?
Speaker 1: You know, we were feeling that our styles were kind of different, yet complimentary at the time, so it was more, you know, you're supporting your friend and, you know, he's been pitted against you and he was always the star you know, even, you know, and he was, you know, very flamboyant, his outfits and stuff--
Story_ID: 656914
Speaker 1: He worked at Charivari [New York, New York] and he had access to a lot of, like good stuff and--
Speaker 2: And just for context, Charivari was like the fashion boutique (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The, the fashion, the fashion boutique and he got me a job there too, like, I had to get a job second year because my parents [Patricia Dayle Reese and Claude Reese] didn't want me to work first year.  It was like, you know, focus on your studies, but second year I had to get a job.
Speaker 2: You worked there?
Speaker 1: And I worked at Charivari for like probably, well the last two years I was in school I worked Charivari on the weekends.
Speaker 2: So you worked to buy clothes?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: You didn't do that?
Speaker 1: I worked to buy art supplies.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  (Laughter) You were, you were unusual.
Speaker 1: No, we did not buy, I did not buy clothes.  I did not have that kind of spare change.
Speaker 2: Well, Charivari was very expensive.
Speaker 1: Expensive.  But I loved selling, though, and it was such great exposure to brands.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It was so hot at the time and I remember I worked at the store they called Lady's [ph.], which was on Broadway and 82nd [Street].  It was actually between 82nd and 83rd [Street].  It was the original store and their offices were upstairs.  It was just a little spiral staircase and Selma [Selma Weiser] would come in, you know, with her red hair and she had this like mint green, like Fendi fox coat that she always wore in the wintertime, and it was, you know, and she'd be tottering on heels and she would go up that staircase to the offices, but, and she used to come in at the end of the day.  She would count out receipts.  You know, they would tear the tag, the price tag off of each garment sold and keep it in a lockbox and she would come at the end of the day and she would open that lockbox and go through all of those tags and she know exactly, you know, what the business was then.  She was just likely through and she was just like, "Okay.  This is where we are for the day."  But I loved, I loved selling.  It was a lot of fun and, you know, you'd get such interesting customers on the Upper West Side [New York, New York].  Remember how hot the Upper West Side was at the time?  It was the only place to be, and Marc [Marc Jacobs] worked at 72nd [Street], which was like the, you know, the most forward store, and then later on they opened Workshop [Charivari Workshop, New York, New York] and he moved there on 81st [Street] and Columbus [Avenue], but it was a lot of fun.  It was like, it was a perfect place to work while I was in school [at Parsons School of Design, New York, New York].  But we, you know, the whole class was competitive, but you were supportive of your friends, you know, and so all of that was you know, really very bearable.  I think that there were just a lot of politics in school in general, you know, and if you weren't like a cute boy it just wasn't that, you know.
Speaker 2: That's fashion.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 656915
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to--well, let's go to Charivari [New York, New York] for a second.  When you were working there, because they sold the top designers, the top, well cutting edge designers, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cutting edge, exactly.
Speaker 1: Very fashion forward designers.  As you were there handling the garments and seeing the way that things are made--
Speaker 2: They're constructed, yup.
Speaker 1: --the construction on the inside and out, how is that affecting your design skills, you're, what you're learning?
Speaker 2: Well, we were encouraged at Parsons [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York], you know we, first year we had to do shopping reports, they called them, every week, and you had to hit the stores and everyone was like okay, do Madison Avenue, or do 5th Avenue or hit the department stores or whatever, and we literally had to go look at clothing, look at construction, and we had to report on what we had seen; you know, what were the popular colors, what were the popular textures, textiles, silhouettes, all of that, and we had to like kind of draw up little, a little report and give verbal, so we were always encouraged to look at garments, and one of my favorite classes at Parsons was actually called (air quotes) museum, and we had a classroom in the basement of the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] and we'd examine old garments every week.
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was awesome.
Speaker 1: Part of the Costume Institute?
Speaker 2: Yup.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: We, it, but being, working retail, I mean it was a just like a leg up.  You know, it was just that much more--
Speaker 1: Well, then you're seeing not just the old things but the new things. Right.
Speaker 2: But the new things, and the cutting edge things because there were, you know, Japanese designers were exploding and I just remember it like we had a lot of Yohji [Yohji Yamamoto] and a lot of Issey Miyake, and, you know those clothes were ground breaking.
Speaker 1: Yes,
Speaker 2: But, I worked at (air quotes) Lady's [ph.], so our store was probably the most commercial.  I mean, we sold a lot of McNamara suits [ph.], you know, and stuff like that, but we got, well we sold a lot of Issey Miyake too, I remember, and some of the windows and stuff they used to do were just like so awesome.  But, it was so great to be able to really handle the clothes, because if you just go, you know, if you're doing a shopping report, you can handle clothes to an extent but you can't really, you know, turn them inside out.  But at Charivari we could (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you're also seeing pricing.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And, you know, there was a huge change; a shift in you know, textiles and stuff like that at that time too, so that was definitely interesting because I think a lot of kids (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like what, what was happening? I mean, with textiles?
Speaker 2: Well cotton was really big and there was a lot of interesting pleating and --
Speaker 1: Well with, with Miyake? Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, especially. But it was, not that Pleats Please--Pleats Please kind of pleating.  It was, he used to do all different kinds of stuff--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --a lot of experimental textiles.  But, you know, my memory fails me a little bit.  I just remember, you know, more about silhouette and texture and it just being, you know, completely different than anything I have known.  It was, you know, when you're like, B. Altman's [B. Altman and Company] was still open when we were in school and I remember doing shopping reports there and everything was very refined.
Speaker 1: Right, because that's a traditional department store.
Speaker 2: Exactly, and Anne Klein was a huge brand at the time, and you know, everything was like, you know, suede, and finished just so, and, you know, it was sportswear, but it was all very clean and very refined and Charivari was just like their proportions were just completely different and the textiles were more raw, and there was, there was just a lot to take in, but then they had to refine it too, because like I said, we sold a lot of McNamara suits.  We sold a lot of Mugler [Thierry Mugler] and stuff like that too, so it was just a good all around exposure.
Speaker 1: So the Mugler was still edgy?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Mugler was huge.
Speaker 1: Although it was stil suiting, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Remember those Mugler shows that you used to stage in New York [New York]?  It was like if you didn't get into those shows, you were just nobody (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That, that--now everybody gets into shows--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in, in a, in a sense.
Speaker 2: Hello.
Speaker 1: In, in a sense.
Story_ID: 656916
Speaker 1: Now you also mentioned something that's very true about the fashion industry and, and while you're at Parsons [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York] you're seeing it's fairly well dominated by men--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and very fairly well dominated by gay men, which is--
Speaker 2: And all this was new to me.
Speaker 1: You're from Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, nobody, I'm from Detroit and New York [New York], you come to New York and there's exposure to everything, you know.  I didn't know from gay, I didn't know from, it's like okay, all of this is new, and I didn't know from politics and all that either, you know.  I was raised if you work hard and do your best, then this is gonna put you on the track to success.  And it wasn't so much about outside factors, although they always existed and, you know, my parents [Patricia Dayle Reese and Claude Reese] certainly had to deal with racism and all kinds of stuff, but I always felt that if, that my work would speak for me and that would be enough.  But, Parsons taught me that that's not necessarily so.
Speaker 1: And coming to terms with that, coming, facing that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was rough. It was rough.
Speaker 1: Can you describe a moment when you had to face that head on?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one thing that made it a little easier is our class also, we used to call ourselves the aluminum class, and the class after us we called the silver class.  The class just before us, we called the gold class, and the class before them was platinum, and this had to do with the size of class and how many males versus females were in the class.  Our class was forty-three with, did we have ten, ten or fewer males?  The class before us was almost 50/50, and they had like thirty kids, so they were, that was like (makes sound).  So, the faculty didn't have much love for our class, because there weren't a lot of cute guys stroking them and, whatever.  It's like almost all women instructors and maybe they just want to have their butts kissed, I don't know.  We had a, after Ann Keagy, we did have a male department head [Tim Gunn] and he was, you know, very partial to the boys and you just sort of realize that that's how things are and that it doesn't have anything to do with you personally, and the girls kind of cleave together to some extent and we just kind of roll our eyes like of course, you know.
Speaker 1: But while that's what you did, it has an effect, does it not?
Speaker 2: Definitely.  But that was the training for, you know, the real industry you know, and I think that you might as well lay your cards on the table.  It's interesting how little has changed, you know, thirty years later, and your, women's role in all that is, is super interesting too, you know, and I guess, you know, a lot of women prefer to be dictated to by a male, how they should look, how they should behave, and maybe that's never gonna change.
Story_ID: 656917
Speaker 1: While you were at Parsons [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York], one of the instructors that people know anyhow is Tim Gunn.  Was he, did he--
Speaker 2: He was not there when I was there.
Speaker 1: He wasn't? Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I met Tim years and years later, because I used to, I taught at Parsons for a while when I first started my business, and then I used to come back and critique and I think I met him when I was coming back to do critiques.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think he was there.
Speaker 1: It says he started in '82 [1982], but it may--
Speaker 2: But he might have been downtown or in another department.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I don't think he was in fashion until like the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: But out of Parsons, Parsons is certainly considered, if not the top fashion school, one of, less than a handful of schools.  So, there's a lot of competition and a lot of expectation upon departure.  So as you are preparing to leave, what is your strategy for what's next?
Speaker 2: I think I started to sweat it out at the end of junior year, because I was like oh, my god.  I'm gonna have to, you know, how am I gonna get a job, and I got so lucky Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole]. I--a friend who graduated the year before me was leaving her job.  Her name was Tina Chow.  So, not that Tina Chow, but another Tina Chow.
Speaker 1: Another--there was more than one Tina Chow? Okay.
Speaker 2: More than one Tina Chow. And she remembered my work, and she was helping to find her replacement because she was gonna move to Italy and Tina was funny she was like born in Hong Kong, raised in Canada, schooled in New York [New York], and then moved to Italy, you know, and it was always so funny to hear her speaking Italian, because it was such a mixed accent.  But she called me up, or she came over to the school, or I don't know.  I know somehow she got my number, and asked me if I wanted to come over to interview for this job and it was right across the street at 575 7th Avenue.  It was probably March of my senior year and we were working on our final portfolios and, you know, final projects for the show and all that, and I went over and interviewed, and the interview was with Martine Sitbon, who is a French designer and she was freelancing for this company Arlequin Paris, and they were a small company owned by, well it was owned by this French guy Paul Matoff [ph.] but it was backed by Ricky Sasaki [Chikara "Ricky" Sasaki], who is world Hong Kong, world Japan, and Martine was in town and, you know, they were trying to gather up some interviews while she was there and she liked my work and they offered me a job, so I actually started working before I graduated.  I started working like the first week of April, and they, I remember they, you know, gave me time out from school to go to work, because it was like, well that's actually everything you're here for, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: The point (laughter). And how often did that happen for students to get a job before they finish?
Speaker 2: Not.  It was just, I mean, god was like, had a plan for me and Tina luckily remembered my work and we stayed friends for like years and years, but I was so relieved because I remember thinking oh, my god.  I'm getting like beyond, on the street with all of us like, you know, trying to get a job and they would do a little bit of placement interview work, but it wasn't intense and nobody really knew unless you were like a, you know, a shining star.  I mean, I got good grades, I kept my scholarship, faculty was kind to me, but I still wasn't a cute boy, you know, so it was not guaranteed that you would have placement.
Story_ID: 656918
Speaker 1: Marc had, fina- I mean, he met Robert Duffy, saw his senior project [at Parsons School of Design, New York, New York] and he had, he was able to start his own collection immediately for Reuben, Reuben--
Speaker 2: So tell, tell me who Robert Duffy is.
Speaker 1: Robert Duffy was Marc Jacobs' business partner for decades, and he just exited the business what, about two years ago now, a year and a half, maybe two years.  But, at the time he was vice president of sales at Reuben--what's it called, Reuben Thomas, Reuben something--
Speaker 2: I can't remember.
Speaker 1: And they were looking for a new direction for their collection and when he saw Marc's senior work, he was blown away and then invited him to design a collection for Reuben, I think it was Reuben Thomas [Reuben Thomas Inc.], anyway.
Speaker 2: But so what happened for him is--
Speaker 1: And that's where that story began.
Speaker 2: --unusual too.
Speaker 1: Extremely--
Speaker 2: Even for a cute boy.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, even for a cute--but he was super talented--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, of course.
Speaker 1: --no doubt about it, and also was very much, you know, he was on the scene.
Speaker 2: He was plugged in socially, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, his boyfriend was very connected.  He had, knew nightclubs.  I loved that man, Robert Boykin, and Marc, he loved to be on the scene.  I remember one time we were, you know, the first to complete our senior projects and some of his work wasn't done and we were all gonna get together and help each other finish, so we're over at, he was living with Robert Boykin in the Dorilton on Broadway, the giant pre-war Upper West Side [New York, New York], and he had this amazing apartment and we were over there, me and still best friends to this day, Chris Isles, and Susan Martin, and we were all sewing on Marc's senior project and he had gone to, Vidal Sassoon was doing like a, they had like some kind of like student haircut event or whatever, and somebody had invited him, because he had like this long mane and he had gone there because it was like the place to be and get his hair cut.  We were sitting up in the apartment working on his stuff, and I remember Robert was so mad at him, he was like, "What do you mean, you're like doing this Vidal Sassoon thing and your friends and you are working on your shop?  Are you out of your mind?"  But you know, he always had a knack at being at the right place at the right time, and, you know, he became pretty well known, especially for such a young person, you know.  But, we were happy to do it.  He was our friend and he helped us out a lot too; I mean, getting me that job alone, you know, when I was, about the summer before junior year he got me that job at Charivari [New York, New York] and they just took me on because he said I'd be good, you know, and he used to always look out for me and Robert would take us out to dinner and, you know, it was just like that little something to look forward to and that icing on the cake when you're on a student budget and--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --you know, basically I'd like fifteen dollars a week for groceries and, you know, like ten dollars a week for lunch.  So, it was like those were always like he would just take us out to the best restaurants and you know, it was, it was like a fairy godfather kind of figure.
Story_ID: 656919
Speaker 1: So, back to Martine Sitbon.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was your, what was your job exactly?
Speaker 2: I was the assistant designer, so at the time she, I'm trying to think if, she had already started her own collection, but to support it she did freelance for a different company, so we were her, her American company and then she also worked for a company in the UK [United Kingdom] and she had an Italian thing going on too, and she would come in and she would have concepts laid out and, you know, we, our vice president, her name was Meryl Nessenbaum at the time, became Mandelbaum [Meryl Mandelbaum].  She was like a really, really strong merchandiser and so she would, you know, kind of safeguard the vision and make sure we had what we needed to on the line.  Martine would bring the creative and she would give me, you know, design projects.  You know, she'd give me research projects, "Oh, I want you to do some research on '70s [1970s]," and she loved the fact that, you know, I could go to the FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] library or Parsons [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York] or we used to use the midtown photo library [Mid-Manhattan Library, New York, New York], remember that?  This is all before the Internet, and I would gather research and send her packets, express mail to Paris [France], you know.
Speaker 1: She was living in Paris at the time?
Speaker 2: Yup.  She would come to New York [New York] probably about six times a year and I would go there two to four times a year.
Speaker 1: Now, was this your first time going to Paris?
Speaker 2: Yup.  Very exciting.
Speaker 1: So before we get into that, let me ask you, because I want you to talk about Paris, but what was her design aesthetic and how did that complement your growing design aesthetic?
Speaker 2: You know what, she, Martine was always really strong on textiles and color and she naturally had a feminine style but she really understood what it meant to, you know, consult with other companies and, sort of really, it wasn't really about just her vision.  You know, she wanted it to be right for our market, and it was a contemporary brand [Arlequin] which, you know, this was the beginning of contemporary.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 656920
Speaker 1: And what does contemporary mean in the fashion line of (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well accessible, it was basically accessible fashion.  You know, I mean at the time this was the '80s [1980s], probably eighty--I got that job in '84 [1984], I believe.  I'm trying to think about what prices were like.  I mean probably most of what we sold retailed under $100.
Speaker 1: Right, because contemporary was affordable; is affordable.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  But it was, it was like the very beginning of that sector of the market, so there was a lot of excitement surrounding, you know, contemporary and brands were, like, you know starting and, you know, kind of booming, because it wasn't as staid as bridge.  It's a younger customer, you know, it could be more fashionable, more fun, more colorful.
Speaker 1: Now what's interesting is at this same time, so this is fashion wise or culturally, we are coming, this is Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] time.
Speaker 2: I guess, yes it was.
Speaker 1: You know, the blue suit, the shoulder pad, you know, this kind of push for women to be taken seriously in the workplace is very strong.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: While there's a wave of conservatism happening.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But remember this is when the shoulder pads got bigger and bigger--
Speaker 2: Bigger and bigger, yup.
Speaker 1: --and with this kind of march into Corporate America.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, what you're describing now with the contemporary market, more affordable, but also kind of an antidote to this kind of very strong edge.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was definitely more fun.  It was like, a little new wave, a little this, that, and the other, and you know, and also at the time was the birth of DKNY.
Speaker 1: Right, because she was the queen of that.
Speaker 2: Ralph Lauren was huge.  I mean, not that he always hasn't been huge, but it was, that was like the top, and it was a very interesting time, because DKNY changed the language a lot and I remember when that line launched and it was probably a year or two into my first job [at Arlequin] and I remember everybody was a little upset.  I remember my boss [Meryl Mandelbaum] being upset because basically what DKNY was, was what a really smart, savvy shopper, usually a New Yorker, would put together for themselves.  You know, it's like you had to have that, Ralph Lauren floral shirt dress and you would go to Brooks Brothers and buy a boys navy blazer and you would, you know, get the just right khakis from wherever, and there was this kind of list of things that was the perfect wardrobe.  You know, you wanted that Gaultier [Jean-Paul Gaultier] floral (unclear) sweater.  You had to have jeans that, you know, fit a certain way and all of that was sort of together in that DKNY collection and so, that was what she was promoting and that was the whole idea behind it as this--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --merchandised look, so it wasn't really a collection look as from a designer perspective.  It was like more this merchandise, the best from the best white shirt and the best navy blazer and, you know, but it was like exposing insider secrets and making it available to the masses, so I think a lot of people in the industry were sort of like, hey, or Silas [Silas Chou] and people who consider themselves great merchandisers, you're like giving away you know, secrets here.
Speaker 1: It's interesting you say that, because another thing, Donna Karan had, at that same time with her collection, I think it was at the height that she made those pinstripe suits with the shoulder pads and the matte black pantyhose.  Remember that?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, that's huge.  You had to have those tights.
Speaker 1: At the same time.
Speaker 2: I remember saving up for those tights.
Speaker 1: Oh, they were so expensive.  I mean, they lasted a long time, though.  And you darned them if they got a hole (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yup, yes you did (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, grandma taught me how to do--
Speaker 2: Remember that?
Speaker 1: But so, so at that, at the height of Donna Karan, is when she launched DKNY.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --which is really very, very different, for a different customer.
Speaker 2: And it was supposed to be bridge, but it was much more, it had a younger spirit than Ellen Tracy or all those other lines that were already bridge--
Speaker 1: So the price was bridge but the sensibility was contemporary (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was more contemporary, yeah.
Story_ID: 656921
Speaker 1: And so, in that environment, as you're working with Martine Sitbon, what, what's happening in terms of product being placed in stores?  Is, is there an opening?  Does it feel like, is it more opportunity for--?
Speaker 2: There was a lot of opportunity, I mean, working with Martine was so much fun and I learned so much, you know, about my craft from her, but I also learned from Meryl [Meryl Mandelbaum] because she was a really strong merchant, or merchandiser, I should say.
Speaker 1: Meryl was who?
Speaker 2: She was my boss actually--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and she, she was vice president of a company and she was the merchandiser, you know, and she was always in the stores and in the market, just kind of you know, looking at competition and finding the niches for us, but I remember we sold to a lot of the department stores, and I remember Ann Taylor, at the time, used to buy (air quotes) fashion, you know, and they were a huge customer of ours, but it was--
Speaker 1: But wait.  What do you mean?
Speaker 2: Ann Taylor, Ann Taylor used to be a multi-brand store.
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell me more.
Speaker 2: Ann Taylor used to buy fashion.  They did.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: They used to buy Martine, if you can get to that.
Speaker 1: I don't remember that.
Speaker 2: But yeah they used to buy fashion, European fashion and American fashion, and it was, it was like toward like the late '80s [1980s] that they changed their whole thing and became own brand.
Speaker 1: And so was, so Ann Taylor as a store was--
Speaker 2: It was a huge chain.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  It still is a huge chain but it's different.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I didn't realize that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, how long did you work for Martine Sitbon?
Speaker 2: I worked for Arlequin for three years.
Speaker 1: For Arlequin, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 656922
Speaker 1: And where did you go after that?
Speaker 2: I started my own business, and that was my dad's bright idea.  He was like, he was like, "It's time for you to do your own thing," and I was like, I remember looking at him like, "It is? (Laughter) Really?  Do I have to?"  But, at the time, you know, it was '87 [1987], '86 [1986], '87 [1987], and everybody was doing, it's true, everybody was doing their own thing and you know, there was always like a midnight fashion show at some club, you know, and there'd be like, you know, like twelve people showing.  We were forever going to these events, like oh boy, helping a friend dress their models or whatever, and I remember Chris had a store with her business partner--
Speaker 1: Chris Isles (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Angel Zimick, yup Chris Isles, and they had a store called Trenton and Gilligan [ph.] on 1st Avenue and 1st Street.  It was on 1st Street, between 2nd and 1st Avenues.  And, obviously Marc [Marc Jacobs] had, was doing his thing and a lot of people had just jumped out and we were sort of going for it and I thought about it and I was like, huh, you know, do I want to get a job someplace else, and I wasn't---Arlequin always had financial challenges.  I remember we had a bookkeeper and on you know, payday he would tell us to run to the bank and cash our checks you know, to make sure that we got paid before he had to deal with the creditors. So, you know, I was used to sort of living on a, on shoestring on entry level salary. And, you know, I think you think you're pretty invincible when you're twenty-three, twenty-four years olds, and I thought I know, "Okay, maybe I do need to be doing my own thing," and I started writing a business plan with the help of the Small Business Development Center at Pace University [New York, New York], and I used to go down there a couple days a week and, you know, get coached on the whole written part and then they would help me with, run the financials and all that, and about three months I did that.  I spent the summer like writing my business plan and then I presented it to my family and I remember my dad [Claude Reese], he was already on board, and my Aunt Rose [ph.], who was also an entrepreneur, she had like two beauty shops in Detroit [Michigan].  She was like, "Wow, I don't have a lot, but I can give you this," you know, and so I got started and by then my old boss was, she had left Arlequin--had Arlequin closed--she had left, and her husband had a multiline showroom, and they were, he was in 80 West 40th [Street], which is, you know, that really pretty little building off of Park--off of Bryant Park [New York, New York], and I went to them to see if he would take on my collection and she sort of strong armed him into taking it and she helped to merchandise the collection.  We had some little deal, I forget how I paid--
Speaker 1: And who was this (unclear) again?
Speaker 2: Her name was Meryl Nessenbaum who became Meryl Mandelbaum, and her husband was Ed [Ed Mandelbaum], and the showroom was called the Aubrey Company and he had a great relationships with Ann Taylor and with Barneys [Barneys New York] and Bergdorfs [Bergdorf Goodman], and he had a lot of great specialty stores and I remember making that first collection, like I had to make my own patterns.  Actually, I found a patternmaker who lives, like in the depths of Queens [New York] and she would make the difficult styles and I'd make the easy styles and together we would sew the samples and we got the sample I made and got it into the showroom and Meryl had already merchandised it, so it was, you know, sort of like a done deal, but they placed it in Barneys and, you know, a few other really good stores right off the bat.
Speaker 1: And who did production?
Speaker 2: I did.  I didn't sew it, but I, I found, I had to find some factories that would you know, take me on--
Speaker 1: So would, was it local (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) with my little orders, local factories right in the garment center [Garment District, New York, New York], and I got, and I was factoring with Hilldun [Hilldun Corporation, New York, New York].
Story_ID: 656923
Speaker 1: Hilldun [Hilldun Corporation, New York, New York] had that you know, small designer factoring army so, like Gary Wassner, who is like you know, this other man now was at Hilldun and dealt with all of the young designers and--
Speaker 2: So, explain what factoring is because I don't think a lot of people know what that means.
Speaker 1: Factoring basically is purchase order financing, so I would, you know, once they sold the season and I had orders in hand, I could go to the factor, which was Hilldun with my orders, and basically would sell them my orders and they would advance me a percentage of the value of the orders and I would use that to buy piece goods and to, it wasn't enough to really pay the factory but it was enough to initiate production and once it shipped, then an invoice, I would take them my invoices and they owned my invoices basically, and after they collected they would pay me.  So, and they took a percentage, I forget how much it was.  And, it was like a very, you know, there was no way to really make any money because the percentage they took was a little hefty because, you know, young designers were more risky.
Speaker 2: But you were able to live?
Speaker 1: Sort of, yeah.  (Laughter) Hand to mouth, because you pretty much had to pay everybody first.  I had to pay, you know, the factory.  I had to pay the showroom and I wouldn't--I don't think I ever made any money, but I was able to just sort of keep scrapping along and, you know, you pick up some freelance jobs and stuff along the side (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 656924
Speaker 1: You were telling me about your line that you started after leaving Ar- Arlequin in '86 [1986], '87 [1987]. In the first season, so, it actually sold through?
Speaker 2: It actually did sell.  I mean, this was before all the, you know, markdown money drama, and all the things that happen now and I think contemporary was still young enough that, you know, it was well priced.  It was in the, you know, co-op was like in its infancy at the time, and it was there--
Speaker 1: Barneys [Barneys New York].
Speaker 2: --in Barneys and I remember I sold to Ann Taylor because I remember driving down to Connecticut to--where's Yale [Yale University]?
Speaker 1: New Haven [Connecticut].
Speaker 2: That's where their warehouse was.  And I remember we also sold to Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue] because I remember driving up to Tuckahoe Road in Yonkers [New York] to drop off my production on cancellation day because it was always like that, but my very first season I remember my mom [Patricia Dayle Reese] drove to New York [New York] with my younger sister Erin [Erin Reese Burks], my dad [Claude Reese] had gotten the van and they drove to New York in this van, picked me up at the factory.  We loaded the production into this van, drove up to my apartment, I lived on 103rd [Street] off of Central Park West at the time, I had, I had nailed these like rods into, onto all the walls.  I had a long hallway.  It was like we're gonna get the clothes here and hang them on these racks, and Ellen [ph.], who sold my collection at the Aubrey Company and they worked with Arlequin came to help and Chris [Chris Isles] came to help, and so my mom and Erin and Chris and Ellen were loading these clothes up this fourth floor walkup--
Speaker 1: Fourth floor walkup?
Speaker 2: --and we hand them on these racks that I've put on these paper thin walls and the racks all, you know, the walls just were paper thin and so the racks fell down, but I remember we were packing and let it all back in the van and went to UPS [United Parcel Service] to get it shipped out, but thankfully at my first job, we had to spend, everybody had to spend one day a month at the warehouse and we had a warehouse on 39th Street between 8th [Avenue] and 9th [Avenue], which used to be like the scary blocks; now it's like full Holiday Inn.  And, I learned how to pick and pack, because we, you know, everybody had to put in a little time there, and I was so thankful for that because I used to my own pick and pack, and write my invoices, write my own packing lists, do my own shipping documents and all that, but my family, they were just like with me the whole way.  And, it was a family adventure, but, you know, my dad, he just always had the faith, you know, and he was ready to take the gamble.  I mean, he was a gambler at heart, and I think also if he had had the opportunity to be an entrepreneur himself, if he hadn't had the responsibilities that he had and been raised in the time that he way, you know, I think he loved the idea of being able to give me the opportunity that he never could have had, you know, so bless his heart he was like, he was fair, and he would send me a little money every month, you know, and to keep me going but after about a year and a half, I just ran aground.  It was just like, oh, my god.  I was like so behind on rent and I was going down to landlord, tenant court because I would have to pay, or I would buy fabric or I would pay the pattern maker, or I would, I always had to pay somebody else before I could pay my own bills, and it just was like a vicious circle, and it wasn't making any money, and I was like a nervous wreck, you know, because I didn't want to disappoint my family or anybody else for that matter, and I just remember like living on Rolaids.  That was like, you know, it was like oh, my god.  It was just all a little bit too much, and I realized, you know, then the market crashed in '88 [1988] and a lot of us were just like, it, it affected us all greatly.  You know, you just, if you didn't have stability and security at that moment, it was just not a pretty sight.

Speaker 1: And I remember after I closed my business, Marc [Marc Jacobs] had his own business.  He was still in business with Robert [Robert Duffy], but it was all under his name and they were doing their thing.  He was getting a lot of great publicity but he was doing so much of everything himself.  It was like kind of hilarious and insane, and Robert was doing all the front work, all the sales, and all the schmoozing, and Marc was responsible for design and production, so he was in the factories too, every day, checking on his production, trying to get everything done and out, and it was just like a nightmare.  I remember he was like, he was like, "I've been interviewing to take over design of Perry Ellis and this show, my next show, has to be perfect, has to be really good because this is--," he knew this was the deciding factor, you know, and I was at loose ends.  I was like, "I can help, you know.  I'd rather be doing something than nothing," so we used to go over to the studio every day and we would like, you know, sew buttons and run over to the factory and you know, do all of the lead up to the show stuff--
Speaker 2: And this was still Marc's collection.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: As he's being courted by Perry Ellis.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: So they're waiting to see what he's going to do to determine if they are gonna invite him to be a guest designer.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And just for context, the Perry Ellis brand was huge (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Huge at the time.
Speaker 2: And it wasn't--when did Perry Ellis die?
Speaker 1: He died, good question.  It was after we got out of school [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York], so he must have died, it must have been like '82 [1982].  No '84 [1984], '85 [1985], '86 [1986].
Speaker 2: It was the early days of the AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] epidemic, but it was at the very (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, '85 [1985], '86 [1986], something like that, and, yeah.
Speaker 2: So we're not too many years after he's been there.
Speaker 1: Nope.
Speaker 2: So, the Perry Ellis brand was still huge and--
Speaker 1: And Portfolio [Perry Ellis Portfolio], which was the bridge brand, was huge and they also had Perry Ellis America, which was a contemporary brand.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And had there been, I should remember, was there someone designing it then, or was it just kind of--
Speaker 1: I think that before Marc, was it Jed, Jed Krascella?  I'm trying to remember who was in the interim.  It was part of his staff.  It was--
Speaker 2: I feel like it wasn't named. That person's name wasn't out front.
Speaker 1: The team was--it was the team.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because Isaac was there for a little space of time.
Speaker 2: Isaac Mizrahi, right.
Speaker 1: Our friend, William Frawley was there.  I mean there were people that we knew that were on the team.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Anyway--
Speaker 2: So what year is this that you were tal--
Speaker 1: This was '88 [1988].
Story_ID: 656926
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1988.  So you're helping--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and when you're helping (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And it was--
Speaker 1: --does this include getting any kind of compensation?
Speaker 2: Well, my compensation was we would literally (laughter) and this--we would--every night we would leave the office at ten [o'clock], and we would go to Cafe Luxembourg [New York, New York] for dinner, and Marc [Marc Jacobs] would charge it.  Now, he didn't know how he was gonna pay the credit card bill.  He was just hoping that things were gonna work out, and it was like a super miserable time because Robert Boykin, his boyfriend, had AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], and he was the first person I knew to get AIDS, or that I knew of who had AIDS, I'll put it that way, and he had gone home because it had really advanced and he was with his family in Mobile [Alabama], and then Marc's grandmother had just--had Mrs. Leigh Rhodes [ph.] passed?  I think she had just passed away, and she was like his, the only family member that he really had a very strong connection to, and so he was really in, you know, a tender emotional place and we were just, we were like, sometimes we would just sit there and like cry, and so, you know, I remember the night before, well, Cafe Luxembourg, but that was the compensation for both of us.
Speaker 1: That was the compensation.
Speaker 2: He didn't have any money.  He would just charge it anyway and, and we would get there and we would sit and Patience--there is a waitress named Patience Simon [ph.]--and she was an island girl and she was so nice and we would sit in her section every night and she knew exactly what we wanted.  We'd get the same thing every single night and sit there and laugh and talk and cry, and then go home and like hit it again the next morning and I remember that show the night before, we slept on the pattern table, and I remember we got up and it was just like that raw like I've had three hours of sleep and my body hurts and what's going on, and I remember I think Robert called from Mobile, and he wanted to wish Marc good luck, and I got to talk to him on the phone and we're all crying and it's like we got, you know, this show has to really be good and it was the (air quotes) Miami show and it was so charming and all the big girls--I remember Naomi [Naomi Campbell] like, "Oh please, don't make me wear sandals.  My feet are so ugly."  (Laughter) It's like, girl.  You're gorgeous.  Don't worry about a pair of sandals, you know, and Cindy Crawford and Christy [Christy Turlington] and all of the girls were in that show, and it was right there in the showroom because that's how it was done--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in the '80s [1980s], and it was a smash.
Speaker 1: I mean, so this was before the CFDA [Council of Fashion Designers of America] and (unclear) put together (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Before, before, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Fashion Week [New York Fashion Week] as something organized--
Speaker 2: This is when there would be twenty shows a week.
Speaker 1: Right, yep.
Speaker 2: You know?
Story_ID: 656927
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so what happened, you said it--
Speaker 1: It was a smash.  Everybody, I mean he, you know, everybody loved that show.  It was super charming and Perry Ellis offered him the job and he was like, "Do you want to come work at Perry Ellis?  You can sign Portfolio [Perry Ellis Portfolio]." And I was like, wow, the idea of a paycheck sounded amazing, and so we all decamped to Perry Ellis by the next season and he brought Tom Ford in to do America [Perry Ellis America] and it was a very interesting experience, like that big company experience and I remember Marc [Marc Jacobs] telling me, he was like, "Okay, listen.  You're gonna have to go to these things, they call them buy meetings, and they're gonna sit down and buy huge quantities of things and you're gonna be looking around like this doesn't make any sense, but it'll be all the suits and you just have to, you know, explain the collection to them and blah, blah, blah."  And, it's true.  They would just like sit down and they would pre-buy the whole collection at the design stage, but they were buying it for like Loehmann's, you know.
Speaker 2: Wow.  They would buy--
Speaker 1: They were buying, like 70 percent of it would be planned to go to Loehmann's.  It was crazy.  But also--yeah.
Speaker 2: And Loehmann's being probably the biggest discounter at that time.
Speaker 1: The bigger, they were a designer discounter.
Speaker 2: Right, that's true.
Speaker 1: But, the pricing and stuff, too, was just mind blowing because, I guess when Perry was alive, the rule of the house was design was not to be total cost of piece go to textiles.  They were just supposed to be free to design and there was a whole huge production department that was supposed to just take it and make it happen, and so I remember sitting in one of these buy meetings and making you hold a dirndl skirt and this is going to retail for $558, and it's like a dirndl skirt on Portfolio.  This wasn't Collection [Perry Ellis Collection] and it's like, really?  And this sweater's gonna be $550 and they would buy thousands in advance, you know, and I mean of course they had, you know, it was in all the department stores and (unclear) but it still, it just didn't seem to make a lot of sense, you know.  So, after the first season or two, it got, it started to get rough already, you know, for Marc and for everybody, because he was doing what he felt was best, but then the suits would clamp down on it and I remember him being frustrated because the whole tech department, design tech, would take over the fitting process and he'd, you know, I remember the first season he did those suede jeans and he was like these are, these have to be tight.  They have to be really fitted and they're like, no, it has to be Perry Ellis fit, which was like a messier fit at the time, and he was like, "Their suede jeans are gonna stretch out.  They have to be--," you know, and I just remember the whole fight back and forth, and he was so dissatisfied with the final fit, but they would just take everything, like they didn't, they didn't want design to do any specifications at all.  You're supposed to just give pass a design sketch and then all the layers of production and tech would reinterpret your design sketch, and they would be upset if you put, you gave the measurements or too many specifications--
Speaker 2: Because it was corporate.
Speaker 1: --because that was cutting in somebody else's work and there were so many layers of people there that everybody was very protective of their turf, but it was, it was an interesting company at the time.  There was a lot of graft and a lot of like just drama like, that we had never experienced, you know, so it was definitely a learning experience and I basically learned that I didn't like working for a big company like that, because they're, it really came down to a lot of other politics and stuff like that, and you're sort of like ooh.  This is not, you know, you don't have any control over your destiny at all.
Speaker 2: How long did you work there?
Speaker 1: Probably about eighteen months.
Story_ID: 656928
Speaker 1: And I did, what was fun was alongside Perry Ellis or, and afterwards, 'cause--not Perry Ellis--Portfolio [Perry Ellis Portfolio].  Portfolio was actually winding down, which we didn't know at the time, but they were winding down, and so they gave me license work to do, so I used to do, because they had a huge coat license, so I used to design coats--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, right.
Speaker 1: --and I used to work on shoes and all these other things that I hadn't, you know, had a chance to do, so from a learning perspective it was good, and from a creativity perspective, I mean you were just free to create all day long, you know.  You could sketch, you could source, you could whatever, and you know, I met some great people there.  I met Tom [Tom Ford].  He was so much fun to work with and there was a really good fabric merchandiser, Sarah Lord, and she, you know, she taught me a lot too, about textiles, and just, you know, maneuvering the big fabric shows and all that, so you know, it was really good in terms of relationships and just like, it was like kind of a designers paradise if you didn't, if you weren't interested in the business and the brass tacks of things, because you were really left just free to create, but for me, that's not, I like the whole picture.  I want to know where it's going.  I want to know how it's getting done.  I want to know that I'm making, you know, the right choices and I'm interested in knowing, you know, what makes something cost what it costs, and how can I improve that or do I need to change that or how do we do it next season, differently if we need to?  So, it's hard to, I don't like designing in a bubble.  I like the full picture.
Story_ID: 656929
Speaker 1: So, as you are becoming, you know, antsy, ready to go because of its not being exactly what you want, what's happening for Marc [Marc Jacobs]?
Speaker 2: Stress.  Stress, stress, stress, stress, stress, and you know, because they have their expectations and there were so many licenses, but there was excitement too; I remember, you know, like the first ads that came out when there were like six page ads in Vogue and all shot by Steven Meisel and you know, it was, oh that was exciting.  I mean, he'd never had that kind of budget to work with, and you know, the big runway shows and all of that.  So I think that part was great, but like the pressure from the suits for him to sort of walk the line, toe the line, and you know, do the type of collection that he's just not known for, it's like oh, "Why did you hire me if you wanted me to not be me?" Well--
Speaker 1: Well, it was an odd fit to be hon- I mean, Perry Ellis, Perry Ellis America that Americana, classic Americana design.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right. Which is not, even though Marc was new, that wasn't what he was known for.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But he was darling seemingly from the moment he came on the scene.
Speaker 2: Right. And he brought great press to the company, you know, at a critical time.
Speaker 1: Right. Did the company make money during this time?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  There were so many layers and it was, the company was owned by, it was sold from Manhattan Industries [Manhattan Industries Inc.] to Salant [Salant Corporation] and there was just, there was a lot of gray area in terms of financial.
Speaker 1: Did you all leave around the same time?
Speaker 2: No, he stayed.  I, I left and went to a bridge company in Magaschoni and he was there for a good, like maybe two, two year, two--maybe two more years. A year and a half?
Story_ID: 656930
Speaker 1: I met you when you were at Magaschoni.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, tell me, what--so Magaschoni compared to Perry Ellis is a small company (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, owned by a Chinese woman who did a lot of production for other people and had, like done a lot of production for Calvin Klein and a lot of big names and had her own factories in Hong Kong and, I think, also in China and, you know, wanted her own brand, so like her name is in the brand, and I was hired by a friend of hers who was sort of minding the shop for her because she was really based in Hong Kong, and I think when she met me, she was surprised that, you know, (gesture) (laughter), but I learned a lot from her.  She was extremely tough, extremely tough.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: She was just very dictatorial and, you know, a lot of seasons I would design two collections, because I would do one and I would have to send it to her for approval and she would say, "Oh no, I don't like this, I don't like that, whatever."  And I'd be like okay, it's easier for me to start fresh than to try to put this back together, and I would just do a whole second collection, and then I would see parts of the old one like in the Neiman Marcus catalog under their own brand or whatever, you know, so it's like okay, whatever game you're working, I guess, you know, it is what it is, but I learned a lot about production and a lot about construction and more about knit wear and some areas than I had exposure to in my other jobs.
Speaker 1: So a lot it was primarily knit wear, wasn't it? Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was, oh, about 30 percent.  There was a lot of silk at the time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, silk was huge and it was something that you know, she had direct access to, so it made us more vertical and our prices were really good because of that, although it was like more of a, I wouldn't say a luxury product, but to some extent you know, silk and cashmere and cashmere blends and all so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --it was definitely a more mature customer and true you know, bridge customer, so lots of suits and especially for the times.  I mean, it was the '90s [1990s].  So, the good part was eventually she put my name on the label and we had started having you know, runway shows and stuff, so it was good exposure for me and, you know, I continued to meet more people in the industry, on the retail side, and you know also on the wholesale side, so it was a good, it was a good career move that kind of rounded me out, I think, as a designer and also gave me the exposure that I needed, you know, to start my business again.
Speaker 1: Well, I, I mean I remember that was when I--you, I think you sa- what year was it that you started there?
Speaker 2: Eighty-nine [1989] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Eighty-nine [1989]? Eighty-nine [1989], right.
Story_ID: 656931
Speaker 1: 'Cause it was '90 [1990] that I took over the fashion department at Essence.
Speaker 2: Essence, yep.
Speaker 1: And it was around then that CFDA [Council of Fashion Designers of America]--
Speaker 2: Started--
Speaker 1: --starting Fashion Week [New York Fashion Week] in Bryant Park [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I convinced Essence to sponsor your show.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that was when your name went on, in '90 [1990], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And for, you know, for--
Speaker 2: But that was even, I feel like they made that calendar even before Bryant Park.
Speaker 1: Did they?
Speaker 2: Because I remember we showed at Parsons [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because Parsons was one of the venues.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they hadn't started building the tents yet, because I remember when they first had the meeting about the tents, and at the time there were still only about thirty shows, thirty or forty shows on the calendar--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, it was small.
Speaker 2: --for the whole week, and I remember the whole pitch about, you know, we're gonna build these tents.  We're gonna have these venues, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and, but we showed at Parsons for--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: First our show was in the showroom and then we showed at Parsons at least two or three times after that, before they started the venues.
Speaker 1: Well, because Stan Herman and--
Speaker 2: Fern?
Speaker 1: --Fern Mallis--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who, and Fern had come from the, from the interior design world, and, because I remember her from there, and they put together, I mean to bring the shows together so that more people could come--
Speaker 2: Huge, when you think that was the birth of that whole, what has now become like an international you know, circus, but it made all kinds of--
Speaker 1: So people would come primarily to one location as opposed to shows and all over the city--
Speaker 2: All over the city.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, for a designer, for a company coming into that bigger environment, in the beginning because it's changed now, but in the beginning was that helpful in terms of making it easier for buyers to come for, you know, to sell the line?
Speaker 2: Oh definitely, and there was a lot of excitement there and it was before it became overly commercialized, so it was definitely more exclusive and, you know, it was exciting for everybody, you know.  Those venues in the beginning were so great and, you know, another venue, because even when the tent started, we showed in the library [Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because that was part of--
Speaker 1: Celeste Bartos Forum [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Celeste, I loved that theater.  We showed there for years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was beautiful. It was beautiful.
Speaker 2: Yep. Loved that forum.
Story_ID: 656932
Speaker 1: How long were you at Magaschoni?
Speaker 2: Five years?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Five years.
Speaker 1: And, when you left there, where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went on vacation.  I went to Italy for (laughter).  And I just had, you know, I remember I started interviewing after a while.  I didn't do it right away, and I, I was trying to decide what I wanted to do next.  You know, did I want to go into another company and I think the interview process, you know, I got offered a couple of jobs and I just remember trying to make a decision, you know, am I gonna do this and--
Speaker 1: And, and excuse me.  You got, you had already joined the Council of Fashion Designers of America.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, as designer of Magaschoni.
Speaker 2: At, exactly.
Speaker 1: Which, can you just explain what is the CFDA?
Speaker 2: Council of Fashion Designers of America; well, it's the governing body of all fashion design in the U.S.A., but it's actually, it's a not-for-profit that was formed to promote American fashion and to get us all together to not just promote American fashion but to share information to strengthen the industry as a whole and also to be able to give back, to work with students, to provide scholarships for students, to, you know, work for some of the philanthropic sides of the organization, which is the CFDA Foundation, which raises money for breast cancer research and for AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] prevention and research, among other things.  Also, you know, disaster relief and whatever needs to be done, but you know, it's grown you know, exponentially over the past eight to ten years or so.  But, at the time, it was more like a clique, you know, and it was like the big boys were on top and, you know, and there were the rest of us and it was a very exclusive organization and, you know, it's been through its ups and downs.  It started to go stale because it was too exclusive and it was really only about the top tier--
Speaker 1: And the same people get awards every year.
Speaker 2: Over and over again, and then they really, you know, had to sort of step back and as the membership kept dwindling, young designers didn't care to join because they didn't feel like they were really a part of anything, you know.  They felt sort of just on the fringe and they really made an effort to make it more enveloping and you know, the membership is probably the biggest it's ever been now.
Speaker 1: Right.  And now, for a number of years it's been under the leadership of Diane von Furstenberg.
Speaker 2: And I've been on the board also for a number of years, so it's nice to see the inner workings and to be involved in, you know, for me I love the philanthropy part.  That's my favorite part.  I mean all the rest of it is super interesting.  I think the educational programs are really important, and scholarship programs, but those are the parts of the organization that I tend to like the most.
Speaker 1: And in terms of diversity--
Speaker 2: Working on it.
Speaker 1: --who are the, I think the list is short enough for you to even name them.
Speaker 2: I think unfortunately so.
Speaker 1: Who are the African American designers who are part of CFDA right now?
Speaker 2: Maxwell Osborne, and--
Speaker 1: Jeffrey?
Speaker 2: Of course Jeffrey Banks.  He's emeritus.  Who's the young lady [Monique Pean] who does the jewelry who was in Fashion Fund [CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund]?
Speaker 1: Not sure.
Speaker 2: She just got honored by Voss Foundation [Voss Foundation, Inc.].  I'm drawing a blank, oh my goodness.  It'll come to me.  She does beautiful organic jewelry and pooled some resources from Africa, and speaking of, a young lady from Brother Vellies who was also in Fashion Fund?  She's a member.  Edward Wilkerson is a member.  Byron [HistoryMaker Byron Lars] isn't just because he's not an organization person, to be honest, and then I think Charles Harbison was inducted this year.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: There's not many.  There's probably less than twenty out of five hundred.
Speaker 1: And in, in terms of the five hundred, what's the balance women to men?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's probably 50/50.
Speaker 1: Is it?
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 656933
Speaker 1: Okay, so you said you went on vacation--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --to Italy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I actually went and I visited Tina [Tina Chow] and we, like, did all the fabric fairs that season, like that February we were running from like Florence [Italy] to Paris [France] to whatever, and--
Speaker 1: And what year is this now?
Speaker 2: This was '89 [1989]?  Maybe '89 [1989]. No, no, no. No.
Speaker 1: Skip that, ninety--'95 [1995].
Speaker 2: Right, 'cause, yeah.
Speaker 1: Ninety-five [1995], '96 [1996]?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Ninety-five [1995]--'95 [1995]?  I think so.  Either '95 [1995] or '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: How long did you take off before you made your next move?
Speaker 1: About three or four months.
Speaker 2: Okay. So then, because it's--
Speaker 1: And most of that was in planning. 'Cause I launched--
Speaker 2: And planning ended up being to launch Tracy Reese.
Speaker 1: Yup.
Speaker 2: Now you had already had your line once before.  What informed the decision to launch again?
Speaker 1: I think I just realized I didn't want to work for anybody.  I wanted to tell my own story.  I didn't want everything to get, you know, run through the cycle and dumbed down and I was ready to, and I knew what it meant, too; I think, more so than the first time around.  It was more important for me to just follow my own voice, and, you know, it meant, you know my dad [Claude Reese] actually was right there again with finance and I also was consulting, so I like consulted for Liz Claiborne.  I consulted for Jones New York, so basically I worked at least three days full time for somebody, and then I shared a little office with another young designer who was kind of getting along the same way I was, and I'd go there, you know, at the end of the day and work on my own stuff, work on patterns, work on samples, you know, run around to the factories and just--
Speaker 2: Now how tough was that to just energetically--
Speaker 1: Oh, it was a huge strain.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you'd have another, you have other jobs.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And you have to put in a huge amount of focus.
Speaker 1: But you know, I was thirty-two.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So, is there any social life at all?
Speaker 1: Not a whole lot.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, and that's like the story of my life, but, and I think, you know certain professions you end up, it's personality driven too; you know, you kind of grow into the parts that you are most comfortable with or, you know, enjoy the most and I think this work is time consuming, especially if you're, if you're hands on.  I mean, for a lot of people they progress through and it's like, you know what, I don't want to do the sketching or this, that, or the other myself any more.  I want to direct others in, in the work and definitely in certain aspects of the work I would prefer to delegate to others and mentor them through it, but I still enjoy sketching and you know, coming up with a vision and concepts and all that myself, and I think it does, as times change and you grow older and the industry shifts, there is a certain amount of pressure to, like, kind of hand it off, you know, because it's just the audience changes to some degree, and you might not be changing with them, you know, so I think everybody's a little bit different in that respect to the parts of the work that they want to do, like to do, or feel are their responsibility to do.  I think since the brand is my name, I think there's, for me, extra added responsibility.  You know, and I go back and forth sometimes, and I'm like I should have named this something else.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, it'd be easier to release certain aspects of it if my name weren't on every single item.

Speaker 1: What year did you launch?
Speaker 2: Ninety-six [1996].
Speaker 1: In '96 [1996].  And at this point, people know you.  You know, you--it's totally different from before, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: People know you in the press, they know you in retail.  You, you launch to--tell me about the launch.
Speaker 2: I found another show room, also on 80 West 40th [Street], and they, they sold the collection right away to, like Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue] and Nordstrom and quite a few specialty stores and it's true that people knew my name and they knew my name because of Magaschoni and some knew from before Magaschoni.  So, that was easier but I decided to launch in dresses because basically I was making my own patterns and that's what I knew I could handle.  I'm not gonna tackle a jacket pattern.  I am not that good.  And I was making my own samples too at that time around, and so it was like let's just, you know, kind of keep this to one commodity and, and expand as we grow, because I was also making my samples, which I am not the best seamstress, you know, but it was good enough.  So, dresses, contemporary dresses, were exploding at the moment and it was becoming a really important category, so you know, those buyers were looking for new resources and so it was a really good, a well timed you know, launch and was able to get the right attention really quickly.
Story_ID: 656935
Speaker 1: You launch in '96 [1996] and what is the look of Tracy Reese collection as it begins?
Speaker 2: I think I launched on, I definitely launched on a spring season, so I think I sort of incorporated in June of July and opened the collection probably in August or September, and it was, I feel like it was classic me; I mean, there were, I had prints and I'm trying to remember how I even used to get prints.  I mean, I worked with the printer, a Korean printer at Magaschoni for years and I think they did me a solid; you know, they did me some favors because we had a good relationship and printed sample yardage for me, which is not cheap when you're cutting screens, and I found things.  I mean, I used to get super creative.  I would find closed out fabrics and all kinds of stuff.  It was like, how can I, you know, it was sort of like make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, which can be one of my favorite projects.  I have to remember that.  But, I remember I--
Speaker 1: But when you do that how, how can you do production on it?
Speaker 2: Well, I would have to find enough to--
Speaker 1: For production?
Speaker 2: --so, yeah.  I'd have to find a couple, you know, two or three hundred yards of something at a time and just be like okay, that means I can do two styles, or I can do one style.  But, I remember I had done a lot of what they called (air quotes) new length of time dresses, slip dresses and little vintage-y looking things and I remember Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue] came in and she really wanted to take home a collection and she was like, "But you have to shorten all this for me because my customer loves a nineteen inch skirt," and she says, "No longer than twenty-one, and all of yours are like just below the knee," and I don't if you remember the (air quotes) dowdy period, because Calvin Klein had launched the dowdy and, it, but you know of course for fashion people we all thought it was the coolest thing and it just, for me, it made everything look new and so I shipped it to her shorter and I remember when she came into the showroom the next season, she was like, "You were so right.  I shouldn't have had you do that."  It was really, you know, we should have gone on with the original length, but she was, she stayed supportive, you know, and she bought every season, but it was, we, I really had to scrape by and find, you know, suppliers.  I used to work with a lot of converters and (unclear) people who had, you know, stock of a certain amount of fabric and that's how I knew I could get sample yardage without having to pay a premium and you know, that there would be stock yardage when it was time to produce.
Speaker 1: And then were you still working with factors?  Is that just how it works?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) yeah.  I actually was introduced to this purchase order financer, so it wasn't a classic factor, but he had factories and he used to do a lot of private label business, so I would do, in exchange for his purchase order financing, I would do some little, special programs.  I would sketch for him, but he would pitch to his other customers and he would finance my production.
Story_ID: 656936
Speaker 1: You know, we did that for at least a year, back and forth, and it worked out and then, luckily, I, through my lawyer and accountant, I met my business partner now, Om [Om Batheja] and we had the same lawyer and accountant for all these years and we decided to start T.R. Designs [T.R. Designs, Inc.] and that's how Plenty came about, because you know, Om is Indian and he was like our other partner, B.J. [ph.] is based in Mumbai [India], and he's like "If you want to go to India, you know, and you see what you think and if you think you want to produce anything in India, we'll start a second collection."  I said, "You know, I don't know if we should try to produce T.R. there because it's not an exact science," which was very true, especially at the time, and we don't want to, you know, damage the brand with late deliveries or anything you know, that might happen. So I remember going to India that first time and it was just incredible, you know, I mean just the high highs and the low lows, and but so much incredible craftsmanship and artistry and beautiful textiles and--
Speaker 2: Colors--
Speaker 1: --beautiful people, yeah, and just, it was just amazing.  Everywhere you look there's an idea.  You know, so, it's like I can definitely do something here.
Speaker 2: And it's extremely affordable for production.  Yeah. And at the time, much more so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, I think that, you know, India has progressed just like the rest of the world and they want what everybody else wants.  Same thing with China, you know.  It's like you can't, like, there shouldn't be a double standard for you know, the value of labor.  But, through our Indian partners, we had an office there and, you know, worked with some really, character of a patternmaker and, you know, just had a whole crew so I would fly to India like, you know, four or five times a year and develop collections there, and, you know, literally hand carry the samples back to New York [New York].
Speaker 1: And the Plenty line is considered what--
Speaker 2: Plenty is, we always call it our little sister line, but it's more entry level price point for contemporary, so less expensive, more casual, and it's sort of like, you know, if Tracy Reese is a weekday, then Plenty is weekend.  So, it's a little more casual and carefree and it's more item driven.
Speaker 1: And, is it through Plenty that you entered Anthropologie?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they actually took 'em both on at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember, I knew that it was right for them.  I knew Plenty, especially, was right for them, and we were at COTERIE, and at the time COTERIE--big you know trade show twice a year--was in the Plaza Hotel [New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: I remember that, yep.
Speaker 2: And they used to, remember, they all used to be hotel sales and we're set up and at the first collection of Plenty and I was standing at the doorway and I see the buyer, the Anthropologie buyer, Sandy Crow, walking down the hall and I was like, "Sandy, I've got something I think you might like," and she, you know, she wandered into the room and she sat down and then she, you know, the more we showed her the more serious she got, and they like, she picked almost the entire collection, but so did, you know, Fred Segal, so did you know, all the Japanese stores, so did, I mean, that first season and it was at the--
Speaker 1: Which was in 2006?
Speaker 2: It was--oh, no, '97 [1997] was the first season for Plenty (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wait oh, oh you mean of Trace- really?
Speaker 2: Ninety-seven [1997].
Speaker 1: Re- oh, okay, so I have this totally wrong--'97 [1997] is the first season of Plenty.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 656937
Speaker 1: It was, we, we called that sari summer, because it was like Indian summer.  I mean, the India trend was just starting (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And we had everything; I mean, all the little dresses and tops were made from saris and, you know, we had little yarn dyes and madras and it was like just the timing was perfect and we sold everywhere, but then we had to get it produced and that was an absolute nightmare.  We must have shipped that stuff thirty days late, but everybody took it because they wanted it so bad and, literally, we limped through like the first two or three years of Plenty like that.  It was just like, there was just so little organization production wise out of India and you know, it was just like a Murphy's law kind of business.  Whatever could go wrong, definitely did go wrong, you know, but people liked the line enough that they just stuck with it, you know, through a lot of bumps.  So, it took us a while to really, and we had to set up our own office.  We'd have our own QC [quality control] people, but you still can't control what's going on inside of the factory.  You know, you can send as many people there as you want.  You can't really completely control their timeline.  So, it was a struggle and ultimately about, one about ten years and we just pulled out.  We were like we cannot do this, even though you know, these were our business partners, we can't like jeopardize our future.
Speaker 2: So, meaning you stopped working with those particular--
Speaker 1: Stopped working in India, stopped working with those factories and we moved all the production to China.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we had been producing Tracy Reese in New York [New York] and we probably, we didn't shift T.R. [T.R. Designs, Inc.] production to China until probably 2004 or 2005, because we were trying to do it here and it was so, that was also difficult.  I mean, we were doing better in terms of shipping and quality, but just vertical, nothing is vertical in New York, you know, and everything is a separate factory and there's factory for pleating, there's factory for embroidery, there's factory for cutting, this guy for marketing, grading, move everything over to this factory to put it all together.  You know, it's just like a quagmire.  And, ultimately we shifted to China just so we could go vertical and have, you know, a little bit better needle and more access to materials and stuff; so, but we, we held out as long as we could.  I think we probably shifted it, you know, about 2005.
Speaker 2: For T.R.?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then, everything? Did Pl- everything (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Pretty much everything. Okay.
Story_ID: 656938
Speaker 1: What I had for 2006 was Frock!.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your store in, in--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So what is Frock! (cough)?
Speaker 2: Frock!, which, we developed Frock!, this was a request from dress departments, because by then Tracy Reese had moved into sportswear departments, and Plenty was also in sportswear departments and we got requests from Nordstrom and from Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue].  They wanted T.R. [T.R. Designs, Inc.] look dresses at Plenty prices for the dress department and, you know, it was like, well if we do it in the beginning, we're really much more focused on cocktail, so that it wouldn't cannibalize any of our other business, you know.  We decided to call it Frock!, it's what I love, and it was, again, you know it was at the request of the retailers and kind of picked up steam quickly.  So, but also the dress departments, I mean, I feel like now is like now is probably in my career, it's the weakest time for dresses, just because everybody is just so much more casual now and I think that most of the dress departments are also housed like more on the mumsy floor and I think, like a young woman doesn't want to go to the mumsy department to buy her clothes.  She wants to be where, you know, the music is fun and there's activity and she's buying a pair of jeans but maybe if she needs a dress for something she'll buy that too.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, that landscape has changed a lot, but at the time that Frock! was launched, you know, dress departments were still quite strong.
Story_ID: 656939
Speaker 1: And then, in terms of your store, you launched Tracy Reese flagship store in the Meatpacking District [New York, New York] which--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --by this point in 2006, is jumping. I mean it's, it's a (simultanoeus)--
Speaker 2: (Simultanoeus) Right.  Kind of the, the place to be.  It's like the new frontier, but well located because it's within walking distance to the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] and all that, so there's a lot of activity there and we were like do we want to be in the Village or do we want to be in the Meatpacking and we were actually, you know, very close to signing the lease on Bleecker Street, because Bleecker was really where we wanted to be and the deal fell through and that actually became like a (unclear) purse store.  It was the old Paris Commune [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And we were a little worried because it was definitely at a premium and didn't have a lot of square footage, and then we found this other space on Hudson Street and we felt like it was a nice kind of in between and, you know, Calypso [Calypso St. Barth] was sort of across the street, and Catherine Malandrino and Charles Nolan and Elizabeth Charles and so it was like a nice little batch of stores in the area at the time, so we took that space, but it had a fair amount of square footage.
Speaker 1: And, it was an opportunity to showcase the Tracy Reese lifestyle customer--
Speaker 2: The, all the brands, exactly.
Speaker 1: And at this point, when did you start the home collection in (unclear)?
Speaker 2: We, we had already started home.  We had done it a couple of times on our own.  It's just something I really wanted to do and we were crazy.  We were like printing fabric in Korea and like putting the sheets together in India and it was a creed of effort and we had also been doing shoes because of the runway shows and I don't think, did we have a shoe license at the time?  We've had a couple and I'm trying, I think we had our first shoe license.  At the time we were making, I think we were making them ourselves.  We had like a little outfit in Florence [Italy].  This guy from Alabama, Jeff Parker [ph.], had a little business doing small production for U.S. designers in Italy and I remember, you know, just like, flying to Florence and running around to all the tanneries and the glass factories and everything with him, heel factories and just like really learning shoes from the, the ground up.  But yeah, we were doing it ourselves, actually, and we had a showroom.  We were in like an accessory showroom with the shows and we had one or two handbags at the time, but it was like a big bag collection.
Speaker 1: Well, but over time.  I mean, big is relative, but you definitely created these accessories to complete, to merchandise to look through your vision.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And ultimately those became like licenses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then we had a license for shoes and handbags, and that was, that was fun.  I mean, it was a lot of, a lot of work but it was also a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Is that something you continue to do?
Speaker 2: No.  It's funny.  I think that for us we found that our customer, you know, I mean we gained a certain amount of traction with shoes and bags, but I feel like our customer, yeah, she really wants like a Chloe purse and some Prada shoes and then she'll wear, you know, contemporary clothes but she wants the luxury brand accessories and so you kind of fall in the gap and I find that a lot of contemporary designers, it's a struggle, you know, to make the customer lust after those middle range, and even though the quality was good, the letters were good, the design was there, I think she's always reaching, you know, a little further beyond you know, and she wants that big brand recognizable handbag you know, and those designer shoes.
Speaker 1: And do you consider Tracy Reese brand contemporary?
Speaker 2: I do.  I mean, we're still in the--
Speaker 1: I thought of it as bridge?
Speaker 2: Not quite.  We always honestly, it kind of falls in between sometimes, because I feel like it's a little more sophisticated than a lot of the other contemporary brands, but it's not as sedate as classical bridge.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fair.  And the price points kind of go between the two.
Speaker 2: Price points are contemporary, contemporary yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 656940
Speaker 1: How long did you have the store in New York [New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had the store for like nine and a half years. And--
Speaker 1: Which is a long time for retail for--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Our lease was running down and we didn't want to re-sign because the neighborhood [Meatpacking District, New York, New York] was just like slowing down and foot traffic was like really off--
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: --and it was like okay, what, what is the key to success, and I really feel that if we had started with a smaller space it might have been a smarter move, you know, because we had, what did we have, about twenty-four hundred square feet--
Speaker 1: A big store.
Speaker 2: --and I think it just didn't need that much.  It would have been better to be like tight and have a separate store for each; you know, one for Plenty, one for T.R. [T.R. Designs, Inc.], because the overall look and mood for each brand is a little different and it would have been easier to showcase them correctly in separate environments.
Speaker 1: Now you did launch a store in 2011 in Tokyo [Japan].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is that store still there?
Speaker 2: No, because that was through our Japanese distributor--
Speaker 1: Ah.
Speaker 2: --so when that relationship finished up, then they closed the store as well.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Story_ID: 656941
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about the first lady.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, obviously, for many reasons, there was a lot of excitement with the Obamas coming into office.  There was also a lot of scrutiny in the beginning in particular--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as to what and who Michelle Obama was wearing.  And every constituency had its arguments about what she should be wearing and is she wearing African American designers and how much and you remember all of that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And when, the first dress that I remember her wearing of yours was on the cover of People magazine.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So, Michelle Obama, the first dress that I remember seeing of yours that she wore was on the cover of People magazine, which is huge.  It's the biggest magazine covering people, celebrities--
Speaker 1: Right. (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 2: And what year was that?
Speaker 1: Ooh, that must have been 2000, what, '9 [2009]?
Speaker 2: It was, yeah--
Speaker 1: It was like the summer of 2009, I think, in April or May.
Speaker 2: Which is--they had been in office for a while but not that long.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: What reaction did you get to Michelle Obama wearing your dress?
Speaker 1: Well, just first, personally thrilled.  Great reaction from the press and you know, a lot of requests from customers.  I think the biggest customer reaction we got was definitely from the dress she wore to the DNC, you know, when she made her speech at the 2012 election [2012 Democratic National Convention, Charlotte, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because, that was like the most public moment when people like saw her moving, you know, speaking and you know, 100 percent front and center, because I think, it's funny, I think that there's definitely more interest in her, the stuff she's wearing live than the stuff that she wears for photographs; at least, for us that's always been the case, but the People thing was, was huge.  That was like the beginning, you know, and she started wearing things relatively regularly after that.
Speaker 2: Yes. And, you know, when a celebrity, when the first lady wears a designer's clothes, and in your clothes, do you find direct relationship to sales?
Speaker 1: To some extent, yeah.  It really, and you know, certain styles just catch fire once she has worn them.  I mean, the DNC dress was custom and we had to begin production post.  We literally had to weave fabric and, you know, we weren't able to ship that for about three months, but we sold over two thousand units of it.  People were willing to wait and we had, you know, tons of preorders.  All the stores wanted it.
Speaker 2: And so you were able to sell it at regular price, even though it was delayed--
Speaker 1: Oh definitely, definitely, because it had never been at retail at any other points.
Speaker 2: Right. And typically, what is the, how many units of the dress do you normally sell?
Speaker 1: Oh, god.  Usually, like.  It depends.  It goes anywhere from like 100 to a thousand, or twelve hundred. Two thousand--
Speaker 2: Right, so two thousand is a huge difference.
Speaker 1: Yes, definitely.
Speaker 2: And you know, pre-Michelle Obama, first ladies did wear American designers, like Carolina Herrera, Oscar de la Renta.
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely, and much more mature look.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, I think that Mrs. Obama has been such a modern first lady and, you know, she's always appropriate but there's like a, like a youthful feminine energy to the things that she selects and wears.  And I think she's just been much more herself, I guess, and she hasn't stepped into that typical first lady mold.  I don't think we've seen her in one red suit (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Or blue suit for that matter.
Speaker 2: Don't remember that.  Actually she wears a lot of prints and patterns and flowers and mixed prints.
Speaker 1: Yup.  Abstracts, you name it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Which, and feminine, so in terms of your collection, which, I mean feminine is part of your signature.
Speaker 1: Exactly, and, you know what I love about how she wears clothes is, you know, she is still, she still is powerful even though she is, you know, dressing as a woman and not afraid to assert her femininity and I think it's speaks to the times too, where I think we, as professional women, we don't feel so much that we have to you know, be working a power suit or some uniform to be taken seriously.
Story_ID: 656942
Speaker 1: What other celebrities have worn your clothes?
Speaker 2: Wow.  Angela Bassett, and Tracee Ellis Ross, and Sarah Jessica Parker, and J-Lo [Jennifer Lopez], and Beyonce [Beyonce Knowles], and well there are a lot.  There are a lot, and I'm so thankful you know, for that.  But, we've been having (unclear).  I went to see Ana Gasteyer at The Carlyle [New York, New York] a few weeks ago, because she has been wearing a lot of our stuff on her press tour and she was so funny, and she had a really good show.  I was like okay.  You know, this is fun.  I just like did it on a whim but I was glad I did.
Story_ID: 656943
Speaker 1: I want to talk for a moment about the fashion show itself, because the, what--when you started, there was a fashion show in a showroom and there were a couple of editors and a couple of buyers.  It was quite small.  That's what fashion shows used to be.  Now they're huge productions with front rows filled, if you're lucky, with a lot of celebrities and you have been very fortunate to have a deep first row, front row.  In addition to having to get the samples ready, booking the season in terms of the models and all of that production, there's the handling of that celebrity situation.  Can you describe that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and honestly I don't get involved in that part of it very much.  I think that it's nice and I think it's you know, interesting for people to be able to see celebrities while they're waiting for things to commence.  I kind of feel like if you want to be there and you happen to be a celebrity, then that's great but the rules of that game have changed drastically and a lot of them want to be paid to turn up, and that I don't, I'm not into that idea.  I'm happy to give you clothing and, you know, and very honored if you're wearing our clothing sitting in a front row, but the idea of like paying people to fill seats doesn't make sense to me.  So, that part I really can't, I'm not--but it's the shows in general have kind of evolved into, you know, sort of a circus that gets away from the original point, which is you know, to show the collection to buyers and press, and there are so many in a week, too, that I think that everybody is sort of numb, you know--and if a publication has to cover more than 100 shows in a week, for a lot of them, it's like a couple hundred--they have to divide and conquer, so there's just, you know, I don't know, you spend so much time preparing for a show, long hours, long, long days, long nights, you know, and you know, it's a huge expense as well, and then to sort of get to that day and sort of feel like, I don't say that nobody cares but there is a little bit of that feeling now, that if you're not like putting on a spectacle, then why bother?  You know, you're only gonna get 30 percent of the editors you wanted to get because they had to split up and go to the few other events that are on in your same time slot.  I mean, the list goes on and on.  So, it's not as fun as it used to be and I feel like the payoff for the trade of, of you know, a chunk of your life is not as, it's not as much worth it as it used to be.  So, these days I'm much more interested in, you know, different types of experiences that are less stressful for my team and different and more interesting for our guests.
Story_ID: 656944
Speaker 1: And so you've done, like the film.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did a film ['A Detroit Love Song'].  Shot in my hometown in Detroit [Michigan], which that was such a great experience and, you know, it was sort of like a, stepping off of a cliff, because we had no idea what we were doing, but we were blessed with a you know, great young director [Ali Nasser] and we were able to tell our little story and we've got our little piece of history, you know, in (unclear) or in digital format, and last season we did a garden party.  Same thing, it was more enjoyable for us and less stressful to undertake, and we also got to showcase some really amazing real women who, you know, really want to address more and more how real women look in the clothes, not just models, because the models are amazing, but it is a little bit of a fantasy you know, how they look in clothes, and the things that they're able to wear, and I really want to emphasize that these clothes are for real people and they're supposed to solve real problems in your life and be comfortable and flatter you, and X, Y, and Z, and also, you know, we were launching inclusive sizing, which for us means expanding our size ranges, so we wanted to show, you know, models and women, real women who wear, you know, size eighteen or, you know a lot of our customers are a little older, you know.  An amazing sixty year old wearing our clothes because, yeah, there still could be a twenty year old, there could be a sixty year old.  It's kind of all women and I'm not one of those designers who, you know, has this single muse that, you know, I'm trying to fantasy dress all the time.  I want real women of all races, ages, sizes to be able to wear the clothes and look good in them.
Story_ID: 656945
Speaker 1: I want to ask you a question about casting.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Because you just mentioned the real women in your spring show that you just had.  Also over the years, when you've had more traditional fashion shows, you've been one of the designers to show ethnic models in the midst of your casting, which has been a real issue over the years.  Very few ethnic models have shown.  How, how have you made your casting choices?
Speaker 2: You know, I think being the minority makes it, of course, super important for me because I'm always looking like, how come I'm not represented in this or that or the other show even though I am a customer, so it's always been important for me and casting is tough.  I mean, the whole idea of having like, you know, a gaggle of girls come up and you're like judging them on their looks is sort of archaic, you know.  So that, that's the first thing.  It's sort of, it's a tough process, you know, and everybody is beautiful in their own way, but you know, who fits the clothes is pretty much how I make my decisions, but I always want to have a diverse runway.  I want to have, you know, obviously black girls, but Latinas, Asian girls, and maybe you can find an Indian girl, or sometimes you have to make a request.  It's a bit better now in terms of the, you know, variety of girls we see.  The agencies are sending a deeper pool of girls, which is great, because for a while we'd have to call and say, you know, "You didn't send me enough others."
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 2: And, you know, we, we need to see those girls so the pool is definitely deeper and a lot of the agencies, especially the newer ones, they just have interesting girls, you know, not like that old standard of beauty but, you know, girls who are unique and, you know, just off the classical mold and I think that's really cool.

Speaker 1: To my knowledge, you are the only black woman designer in America with your own label nationally sold at the level where you are, and it's been like that for a while. Is that true (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There are Cushnie et Ochs and I know there are two of them (unclear), probably.
Speaker 1: So that's, so that's a pair who are relatively new but doing well.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: And also CFDA [Council of Fashion Designers of America].
Speaker 1: Excellent.  But as a solo designer, this has been many years of you being alone and so I'm wondering, what is the level of responsibility that you feel, is there any pressure that you feel, and, and, and as a member of CFDA, what are you doing to try to open those doors?
Speaker 2: I think that, in terms of pressure, I mean I think that just the pressure to succeed and be a good example, I think I would have regardless of race.  Sustaining the business, I think I would have regardless, so I don't feel like it brings additional pressure.  I choose not really dwell on anything that I might not be getting because of my race or sex.  I'm really much more focused on the gifts that have come my way because of my race and sex and many other reasons.  So, I don't know, I don't wear that as a, as a mantle of what I've achieved or have not achieved.  In terms of my responsibility, it's interesting because we've, you know, I've talked a little to Steven, who is the CEO of CFDA, about--
Speaker 1: What's his full name?
Speaker 2: Steven Kolb, and I think the criteria for acceptance into CFDA is a little steep because you have to show that you've been in business and shipping consistently for at least three years, and then you have to have retail references and press references and also a reference of a member.  And then you have to, you know, obviously present and if we look at, I'm not on the membership committee, but those are, those are high--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: And it's--for anybody, that's a challenge to be able to say yes, I've been in business and shipping under my own, or a big brand you know as the head designer for at least three years, and I think that that really is the hardest, the biggest hurdle.

Speaker 1: When you look at your career, where you are to date, and obviously you're still got, still looking ahead, but what do you consider your legacy to be as a designer today?
Speaker 2: Interesting.  My legacy.  Wow.  (Laughter) I think I've made some beautiful clothes that were affordable and tried to put the customer at the forefront of my vision, hopefully consistently.  I think, yes I'm like one of the only known African American designers, although there are many of us working in the industry, and there are just as many, I suppose, white designers whose, whose names we do not know, you know, that are working within other companies, so it's not an issue that's uniquely ours, but I think opportunity to have your own business, to be financed, those opportunities were more rare for us.  I was lucky to have a dad [Claude Reese] who was willing to take a chance on me, you know, and I think especially if you're young and you don't have a lot of experience behind you and if you're not well known within the industry, it's hard to get someone to invest.  I mean, it's hard if you're, you're seasoned, you know, so I think that my dad giving me my start sort of helped secure you know my place in history.  That and obviously having Mrs. Obama [Michelle Obama] wear clothes and you know all the years that we've been shipping and showing and whatever.  So, I'm you know grateful for all these gifts you know, and always looking forward to my next adventure.

Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: You know, from time to time I, I do regret, if anything, having spent so much time working that, you know, it has you know, taken a huge chunk out of my personal life, but you know, at the same time I don't really believe in regrets.  We each have our own path and, you know, everything is in divine order and I'm kind of, you know, I feel that I've done what I was meant to be doing.

Speaker 1: What advice would you give to young designers who are starting out today?
Speaker 2: You know, it kind of goes back to what Ann Keagy said, "You have to eat, drink, sleep, and breathe fashion."  It's not the kind of career that you can get into and be successful, and sustain yourself if you, you know put limits on what you're willing to devote to it.  I find that a lot of young people are very, they want to get there quickly and they want to do, do everything on their own terms, and I think you have to be open to gaining experience, to putting in the time to give yourself a chance to learn your craft and master your craft.  I think that we're in a very fast society now, where everybody has, like, expectations of almost immediate gratification.  It's like you don't even know what you're doing yet.  You're not, just like me starting out the first time when I was twenty-three years old.  It's like I didn't know what I was doing.  I mean, I learned hard and quick and, you know, it was trial by fire, but I didn't know, and I needed that time to go back and get more experience before I was ready to start again, and that's not a bad thing.
Speaker 1: Is there anything you'd like to share that I haven't asked you (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Not really.  You've been quite thorough, Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, thank you very much.  This has been great (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thank you.  Yeah.  Loved catching up with you.
Speaker 1: Same here.
