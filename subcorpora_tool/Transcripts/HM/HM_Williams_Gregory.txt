Speaker 1: Dr. Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams], I wanna start out by asking five People magazine-ish questions, just short answers.  I'd like to know your favorite food.
Speaker 2: My favorite food.  I guess I hadn't thought about that for a while.  I love barbecue.  So barbecued ribs I guess would be my favorite, although I can't eat quite as much of those as I used to.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite color?
Speaker 2: You know that's really interesting.  My daughter [Natalia Williams] used to have a list of favorite colors.  And we went back and forth.  I guess my favorite color would probably be blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I, I enjoy the spring.
Speaker 1: Favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: Well that's kind of changed over the years.  I really--years ago really loved being in San Francisco [California].  And now I've--there's a lot of other places where I like to be.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: The transformative power of higher education.
Story_ID: 466185
Speaker 1: I want to first ask you to talk about your mother [Mary Williams].  And her name and what you know about her growing up.
Speaker 2: Well I lived with my mother 'til I was about nine years old, so my memories of her are, you know, somewhat distant and she was not with me during my formative years.  She was a woman who was from Indiana and, and grew up in Indiana.  Best I can recollect, that she dropped out of high school and became pregnant by my father [James Williams].  And so they were together for about ten years.  I was the first the first child that was born and like I said, then she left when I was about nine.  It was a very difficult time that we had because my dad was a very successful businessman and so they were trying to run a business and live in Virginia, which at that time, it was illegal for blacks and whites to be married in that state under state statute.  In, in essence they really were violating a law, and there was some fear that they were going to be discovered and people were in fact prosecuted under the Virginia anti-miscegenation law.  And so there was always a lot of tension around from that issue and as well as the business, and then of course ultimately my father's drinking led to a lot of problems as well.  So it was a, it was a time that I remember, basically a time full of, of tension.  Some really, some fun times and, but there was a--it was a difficult time and that's the, the best that I can remember about (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 466186
Speaker 1: Dr. Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] can you give her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Mary [Mary Williams].  I, I don't really like to give her whole name (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I did not divulge that in the book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams] and so I--I'm--
Speaker 1: Okay, I understand, okay.
Speaker 2: Try not to do that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Under- understand.  Did you, do you know anything about her growing up at all?  I mean like you say somewhere in, in Indiana.  Wasn't it Muncie, was it?
Speaker 2: No, actually she grew up in Tipton [Indiana] if I remember correctly, and she was very intelligent.  In fact, they sent her to a, a private school somewhere around the--northeastern Indiana.  And, you know, had a lot of expectations that she was going to be a really kind of a bright star, maybe go to college because no one else in her family ever went to college.  And many of them had dropped out of high school.  And so she was I guess one could say the, the hope of the family.  But obviously that disintegrated.
Speaker 1: And do you in your--
Speaker 2: In terms of her education.
Speaker 1: Right. Did you know much about her family at all?  You know, in ter- I mean I know you know a grandma--
Speaker 2: Yeah well actually in the early years we would go back to Indiana.  We were living in Virginia.  That's where I lived the first ten years of my life.  We would go back to Indiana and we would spend holidays with them.  And I remember my grandmother and my grandfather.  My grandfather was a conductor, well not a conductor, he was an engineer on the Nickel Plate railroad [New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad].  And so we spent time there.  In fact, they sent me to Indiana to live with my grand- my mother's father and mother during my first year in school.  So I did the first grade in Indiana.  Primarily because my, my birthday is in November and so I was too--wasn't old enough when school started in September and I could go to Indiana and start school.  And so I lived with them for a year.  I mean that's the place away from my family and so I felt that we had a good, a real good relationship.  But there was always some tension there as well.  And there was always kind of like well I felt even at the time as a kid, you know, seven or eight years old, that there's something going on here.  There's some, there's some great mystery that, that I was not privy to and I, you know I was a pretty smart kid.  And trying to figure out what was going on.  Something just didn't seem right to me and that I could--so it was a puzzle that I simply could not solve.
Speaker 1: Now did, did, did they talk about their background at all, their heritage?  I mean whether it was, you know, you know was there discussion?
Speaker 2: They did, they did.  I mean they talked about their being--I think my grandmother was part Irish and I think there was some German in there as well.  So there was some discussion about that as I was growing up.  I didn't really pay a lot of attention to it, but I remember they were very proud of that.  They were proud--there was one member of the family, my, I think my grandmother's family, who had been superintendent of schools in--somewhere in north central Indiana.
Speaker 1: But they had been in Indiana for some time.
Speaker 2: They'd been in Indiana for a long time.  Actually I think there was a--I had relatives on my mother's side who fought in the Civil War on the Union side.  And they talked about that very proudly.  They were Catholics, and in fact Indiana was a hotbed of Ku Klux Klan [KKK] and I was--in later years I remember my grandmother used to tell me and I would see her from time to time, that, that she would be--she would love--she would think very seriously about being a member of the Ku Klux Klan if they weren't anti-Catholic.  And (laughter) so I was, I was pretty much taken aback by that.  And actually Klan was, was really strong in Indiana.  I remember seeing a picture of--maybe about fifteen or twenty years ago, the picture was taken in my hometown.  In Muncie, Indiana in 1924 when my, my black grandmother [Sallie Higginbotham Williams] was about, she was about twenty-seven, twenty-eight, something like that.  It was a picture of six hundred white women in Klan robes walking in downtown Muncie, Indiana.  And my grandmother, my black grandmother, was a woman who was--had never gone to school, worked as a domestic.  And, and I finally realized all the stories that she had told me about what it must have been like as a, as a young black woman, uneducated, in a city where you have six hundred women who come out to support the Klan in full regalia.  And when I saw that picture, everything that she'd ever told me just kind of hit me in a way that it just hadn't hit me before.
Speaker 1: I don't think I've ever seen women in regalia.  I mean I, I've seen always men or I assume were men, but I don't--
Speaker 2: No, it was just, it was just arresting.
Speaker 1: Now was there anything else that you remember that stuck about your mother's background or growing up or that you heard about?  You know, or your--the family on that side that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well I don't remember a lot about that, other than that she was close to a couple of her sisters, or at least one sister in particular.  I remember that sister would come and visit us in Virginia, and then there was one brother.  She had several brothers and sisters, but I remember only really one came to Virginia in the early days and, and maybe a, a sister came from time to time and one other brother.  But she--when we were there in Virginia, I just remember her being estranged from the family at that time.
Story_ID: 466187
Speaker 1: Do you know how they got to Virginia, your parents [Mary Williams and James Williams]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually my dad was in the [U.S.] Army.  My dad had been drafted and he was serving at Fort Belvoir [Virginia] in the--which is now basically where they have all the engineers go.  I don't know how they sent him, he was a clerk.  Kind of worked in the, in the general's office there at Fort Belvoir.  Actually is a general I think was Lehman W. Miller.  And actually my brother was named after, after General Miller.  My brother's name is Lehman Mark Alain Williams [Mike Williams], Alain after Dr. Alain LeRoy Locke, who was one of my father's teachers at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  I was named Gregory Howard Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] after Gregory, Captain Gregory Barnes and Major Howard Schultz, people who I've never met.  But my dad was--always wanted to kind of do that type of thing.
Story_ID: 466188
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father [James Williams] and his name and you know what you know if his growing up.
Speaker 2: He was born in Kentucky around January of 1914.  He was an illegitimate child to the best that I've been able to resurrect it.  My grandmother became pregnant from a--the, one of the members of the white family for whom she worked.  And you know, Kentucky was a very racially divided place and Bowling Green [Kentucky] was certainly in those years.  And so my dad was born in Kentucky, then there was a question of whether, whether they were going to stay there.  Some--I think one of her sisters had migrated to Indiana, to Muncie, Indiana for hopefully jobs and, and a--some better opportunities.  I always wondered where the name Williams came from because my grandmother's name was Higginbotham, Sallie Higginbotham [Sallie Higginbotham Williams].  And which turns out, and I've done some checking back on that, is they came from Virginia in the 1830s, their ancestors did as slaves.  Which interestingly enough, they came from the same area where Judge Leon Higginbotham [A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr.] was from.  And you know I--first time I met the judge, I told my name was Higginbotham, but I didn't really realize that we had been in Virginia.  I knew we were in Kentucky.  But then I later discovered, tracing us back, that my family was from Virginia.  And I talked with the judge's wife about that, and it was the same area that Judge Higginbotham was from.  So we got the name kind of from the slave masters, Higginbotham.  And so I wondered how did they, you know how did we get the name Williams?  Where did, where did Williams come from?  And I was doing some research on that and found out that actually I was looking at this kind of a census tract and found that the Higginbothams lived next door to the Williamses in the black community.  Now the Higginbothams had about five or six daughters in the family.  Shannon Higginbotham [ph.] who was the, the patriarch of the family.  And the Williamses had about seven sons.  And so apparently after my dad was born, my grandmother married one of the Williamses.  And so that's how we got the name Williams.  And then they migrated to, to Indiana and taking my dad along.  And they--the marriage didn't last very long.  I think it was Robert Williams [ph.] was his name and he left maybe after a year.  So my dad in essence pretty much grew up with his, his mother.
Story_ID: 466189
Speaker 1: And she [Sallie Higginbotham Williams] was a domestic all of her life.  She never received any education in Kentucky or certainly not in Indiana when she arrived there.  But it's really interesting as to how this happened in terms of my dad's interest in education.  And my dad [James Williams] used to talk about he and his, some of his buddies would sit around the, the, the kitchen table in the little shacks where they lived and study under the coal oil lamp.  And my grandmother used to complain about it, they were using too much coal oil keeping the light on while my dad was trying to read, and trying to study.  But my dad someone or another, developed this thirst for education and was able to transmit that to, to a number of his friends and one of them--he--they were so interested in education.  Well let me back up a little bit.  Is that in those years in Indiana, they put all the blacks in the vocational education program.  So if you were a black woman, you were in home economics.  If you were a black man, then you went to the, the buildings and trade.  In fact my dad used to, when I was walking to Ball State University [Ball State Teachers College; Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana] because I didn't have money to ride the bus, sometimes my dad would walk with me and we'd walk past this house right near the university.  And he pointed out this house where he had spent his entire senior year building that house.  That was his, that was his research project.  But he wanted to go to school, and so he went back for what he likes, like to, what he liked to characterize as his post-graduate work at high school to take the courses he would need to take to go to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And so he did that and then ended up at Howard University.  Actually it was interesting how they got there.  He and another buddy, Arnold Robbins, hitchhiked six hundred miles from Muncie, Indiana to Washington, D.C. to go to Howard.  And it was a fascinating story and actually Arnold told me about this before he died, just a, you know a few years ago.  That Arnold was very dark skinned, my father was very light skinned.  My father could really get a ride pretty easily when they were hitchhiking, but he said, "Your dad would always wait until I had a ride.  And then when I had a ride, he would then put out his thumb and he would get in, get in the car and ride as well.  And if he saw me by the side of the road where my car had stopped and I was out waiting by the side.  He would stop the driver of his car.  He would get out and he would wait for me until I got the next ride."  And so they hop scotched over 650 miles from Muncie, Indiana to Washington, D.C. to go to Howard University.  So I think that, that was an incredible commitment to higher education.
Story_ID: 466190
Speaker 1: My dad [James Williams] spent a year at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  He was on the boxing team.  But he really had a lot of problems at Howard because being this, you know, white looking boy and it was not an easy time for him.  But you know he never really shared that with me.  That was not something that, that I, that I knew about until many years later when I was talking with folks about how difficult his life was at Howard.  And you know he did try to support himself.  He worked as a, as a telephone operator at a place called Gunston Hall [Gunston Hall School for Girls, Washington, D.C.] which interestingly enough, was where Harry Truman's daughter, and Harry Truman [Harry S. Truman] at that time was a United States senator.  And so he would tell me stories about Truman would come in at night to spend time with his daughter, but you could not interrupt the women when they were eating dinner.  They spoke French during dinner and it was kind of a special time.  So Harry Truman used to sit there with my dad and tell him off-color jokes.  But he had some interesting classmates at Howard University.  Walter Washington, who was the first black mayor of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] was a very close friend of his.  And I remember as a kid growing up, even though we were living in this little shack, every, every year would arrive a Christmas card from Walter Washington and some of the other folks that he met during that year that he spent at Howard University.
Speaker 2: Who were some the others you said?  Was there anyone you remember besides Walter Washington?
Speaker 1: There was one guy and I'm blanking on his name right now.  Paul [ph.], something or another, who started the first black postal employees union [National Alliance of Federal and Postal Employees].  There was a lawyer by the name of Lincoln Johnson [Henry Lincoln Johnson, Jr.] who was a very prominent lawyer in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] and onto the '50s [1950s] in Washington, D.C.  And when Dad would come to, to Washington, we would have a chance to, to visit with them.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: And Ralph Bunche was one of his teachers, Alain Locke [Alain LeRoy Locke] was one of his teachers--
Story_ID: 466191
Speaker 1: Well in fact I have a letter right here on my, on my shelf from Alain Locke [Alain LeRoy Locke] to my dad [James Williams], which interestingly enough, and I have a picture here.  My dad after that year at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], decided that you know, his life was really hard there, so he, he moved to Atlantic City [New Jersey] and spent the summer in Atlantic City and decided that, that he was gonna pass.  He decided he was gonna become Greek.  And he took the name Jimmy Willmatis, and got a Greek roommate and kind of passed.  And he wrote a letter to Alain Locke telling Dr. Locke that he had decided to try to pass for white.  That his, he felt his life was gonna be a lot easier if he passed for white.  And Locke wrote back to him saying Jimmy, you know I wish the very best for you.  I do feel a little distant, but I as always want the very best for you.  I had talked to Arnold Robbins about my dad's experiences at, at Howard University.  And Robbins graduated with a bachelor's [degree] and went on and got a master's degree as well.  But he was--he told me that he, in later years he had conversations with, with Locke and I think even with Bunche [Ralph Bunche] because he and his wife both worked at the UN [United Nations].  And he asked him, he said, "Why did you spend so much time with my buddy Jimmy and not with me?  Because I'm the one that finished school and I'm the one that went over, you know, went on to get a master's degree."  And apparently Locke told him, said, "Well Arnold, we knew that Jimmy was gonna have a lot of problems and we wanted to be helpful and supportive of him."
Speaker 2: You know that, that, that--first of all Alain Locke is viewed as a taskmast- you know he was, he was legendary.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: On, on Howard's--I mean legendary in the black community, but definitely legendary on, on Howard's campus, so he, he must have seen something in your father too because I, you know I'm just saying that you know he--I've heard other people talk about him, you know.  And that, you know that's--anyway, you know they--in fact I remember, was it [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis you know, spoke of Alain Locke.  But you know he--let me ask--
Speaker 1: Finish on that point.  Actually, Locke was very close to my dad.  In fact my home town, Muncie, Indiana, was the site of the Middletown, the first Middletown studies, which is study of sociological power in American communities.  And it was done by this very liberal--a husband and wife team [Robert Staughton Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd] out of Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and called Middletown, and then a book called 'Middletown Revisited' ['Middletown Revisited: Social Change in Twentieth Century American Society,' Dwight W. Hoover].  So they came to kind of look at community power.  My dad was a student in the high school when they came in to do that first Middletown study.  I've looked at the Middletown study and what's very interesting about that was that they have a note in terms of how they did their research.  They surveyed all the students in the high school to try to get a better fix on community power.  But they did not tabulate the response of the Negro students, according to their, you know, their research, which was kind of interesting because my dad was in that class.  Well interestingly enough, Locke knew about the Middletown study, so Locke traveled with my dad from Washington, D.C. to Muncie, Indiana because Locke wanted to come to Muncie to see what this town was like that had totally excluded the black population, which at that time and still today is about 10 to 12 percent of the population.  And then they went on to Boley, Oklahoma.  There was a classmate from Boley, Oklahoma which you know is an all-black town in Oklahoma where my dad had some friends from Howard.  So he and Locke did spend some time together and, and got to know each other very well.  Which is I think one of the reasons why my dad named my younger brother [Mike Williams] after Dr. Locke.
Story_ID: 466192
Speaker 1: Now did your father [James Williams] share any other stories of his growing up?  You know did--I mean did he talk about that, or you know at any time, you know, in his conversations?
Speaker 2: He did, he did.  He talked about it lot and I have a, a lot of stories.  One for instance was the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK].  My dad remembers one event where they had the march downtown and there was a very, very prosperous lawyer in my hometown, White [ph.], who was the head of the Klan in my hometown.  And so my grandmother [Sallie Higginbotham Williams] was standing on the side of the street as they were riding by on the horses, and, and my--and this guy shouts at my grandmother who's standing there kind of trembling, "Nigger salute this flag."  You know it had a Con- Confederate flag.  And so she's there saluting and she's so nervous that actually she urinated on herself and so my dad, about a block down the road, picked up a rock and threw a rock and hit this guy.  Didn't knock him off the horse, but you know, but then took off running.  Later years, it--when I was a deputy sheriff in Muncie [Indiana], this same lawyer, you know this guy was about half my size and would come into the jail to interview his clients.  And I'm looking at this guy, you know, thinking this is the guy that just frightened my grandmother almost to death.  And here's this guy stumbling in there and I would bring out the--his clients, inmates for him to see.  And he, once he tried to give me a tip.  I'm thinking, you know, I--this is--forget this, this is not working for me.  But Dad would talk about that and what it was like growing up in Indiana and in Muncie and the things that, that he had to deal with growing up in, in that really divided community.
Story_ID: 466193
Speaker 1: Let me ask.  Do you think his [Williams' father, James Williams] experience at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] was worse than his experience growing up?  See I'm just--'cause I, you know, both, you know black communities.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And did he address any of that?  I mean do you have a sense?  'Cause you know you've said he left, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --school, that it was hard, you know, for him and I was just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was hard.  The adjustment was really hard for him at Howard.  He did ultimately--he went to--he really wanted to try to, to finish school.  And he, when he arrived home, he--was partly money problems as well.  They had no, no financial support whatsoever.  But when he arrived back in Muncie [Indiana], he went to the public library and he flipping through these college catalogs, and he wanted to find the cheapest school he could go to in the country.  And it turned out there was the University of Wyoming [Laramie, Wyoming].  And so I think he went to Laramie, Wyoming.  He was out there in the middle of the winter.  Said it was the coldest place he'd ever been in his life.  He left, you know after, after a semester, then came to Ball State [Ball State Teachers College; Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana] and I think spent maybe about a semester at Ball State and then just dropped out of school.  And then, then was drafted in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he--where do you think his thirst from, for education came from?  Because you know, it doesn't sound like your description of your grandmother [Sallie Higginbotham Williams] that that was there, but I'm not sure.  You know, I don't wanna shortchange--
Speaker 2: No, I think that's exactly right.  There was not--it certainly didn't come from my grandmother.  And she didn't really value education.  I mean she had no education.  Virtually no one in her family could really read or write.  Actually, my Aunt Bess [Bess Pharris] could read and write, I guess Aunt Roxie in later years.  But, but no one older than, I guess my Aunt Bess was older than my grandmother.  But it just wasn't a high priority in the family.  So I've often tried to figure out where did this thirst for education come from?  And, and I don't know.  I think it may have been his buddy Arnold Robbins, the two of them together.  And actually my dad was, my dad was very popular in our hometown.  I mean I have a picture of him. He was kind of the, the, you know kind of the smart guy, the leader of the group and very facile, very eloquent guy.  So it just emerged from that background wanting to--wanting something different and wanting to be able to kind of shape his life in a way that he just didn't feel that he could do when he was in Muncie or in the circumstances that he was facing.
Speaker 1: Do you think that he was called out of name growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have no doubt.
Speaker 1: All the time, all the time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have no doubt about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: There was just no, no question about that.
Speaker 1: Well maybe because it was home it didn't affect him as much.  Do you think that was the case?
Speaker 2: I think he was, he was accepted as part of the black community.  I mean he was important part.  I mean I had so many people over the years, even when I was a teenager, would come up to me and my dad would be staggering home and I was a teenager and I would be upset and mad and angry and say why does my dad have to be the town drunk?  Now why am I embarrassed like this?  I got enough embarrassment having no money, living on welfare with holes in my shoes.  And why do I--and so people would come up to me said, you know, don't be mad at your dad.  Because if your dad was white, he'd have been governor of Indiana.  You know he had, he had that kind of ability.  And you know I have had even teenagers older than me would come and tell me how much they learned from my dad, sitting down with my dad.  And how I had--when I was back in Muncie just last year, I, I saw one of my boyhood playmates that I grew up with and, and his father died when we were about thirteen.  And he said to me, he said, "Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams], after my dad died, your dad was the closest thing I had to a father."  And said, "You don't know this, but we used to sit down on the railroad track and he would, would give me lessons and talk to me about what I was doing in life.  And if it hadn't been for him, I would not have been able to survive."  So he was really--all the kids would call him Uncle Buster.  And that was his nickname because he was in the Golden Gloves.  He used to box and then after, after that he trained boxers.  But all the kids growing up, they always called him Uncle Buster.
Story_ID: 466194
Speaker 1: Tell me what your earliest memory is of growing up.  Earliest memory (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My old- earliest memory are being at the Open House Cafe [Gum Springs, Virginia], (laughter) being--setting at that cash register, figuring out, okay what do we, you know, what are we doing here?  And running around there and all that chaos and you know trying to figure out what was going on.  And actually when I did talk to my mother [Mary Williams] in later years, and she said well you always were a little man.  And I guess I was a little man, parading around there trying to kind of help in my own silly ways, trying to help keep the business together.
Story_ID: 466195
Speaker 1: We were talking about your earliest, you know--
Speaker 2: My earliest memories, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Mem--right, and you know you're always being described as little old man.  Let's talk about just the experience in the open--
Speaker 2: Open House Cafe [Gum Springs, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Open, Open House Cafe.
Speaker 2: Well it was always something exciting.  My dad [James Williams] loved excitement.  I mean he was just a raconteur, I mean people gravitated to him.  As I said earlier, he was a really eloquent guy.  He had a lot of jokes.  He could keep a crowd together.  Meaning it was really hilarious because in those days, there was the white section of the, of the tavern, and then there was the back section of the tavern which is where blacks went.  And under Virginia law, you could not serve blacks and whites together in the late '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s].  And actually they weren't even supposed to be in the same building.  So he was always--he always liked to kind of skate as close to the line as he could.  So he would be racing back and forth.  He would--you know, telling the whites up there, you know, some kind of joke.  And he'd go back and with the blacks and tell them another kind of, you know, joke.  And actually a few years ago I--when the book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams] came out, I went back to Gum Springs [Alexandria, Virginia], which is where this was, which was, you know, an area used to be an all-black enclave and said to them, I said--and a lot of people came out.  And they remembered me and they remembered my brother [Mike Williams], they remembered my dad, they remembered my mother [Mary Williams].  And I said, "Did you know that my dad was black?"  And they said, "Yeah, we all knew, but we knew it was a big secret and we had to, you know we had to keep it all a secret," because of the, of the laws at that time.  But it was just--there was always excitement, things happened.  But it was danger there as well because there was a lot of fights in both the front end and the back end as we would say.  My dad got slashed with a razor once and he had to have something like ninety stitches and I thought for sure that he was dead that night as the--'cause the ambulance would come down.  And of course the ambulance was gonna be late coming to Gum Springs because that was the black area.  And I remember this guy on the phone said you know, said well be sure to tell 'em it's a white man that got, got cut down here in Gum Springs, and they'll come quicker.  But you know those were the kinds of things that, that I experienced as this, as this little kid.  Going there and kind of walking my way through the, through the tavern and, and trying to figure out what was going on.
Story_ID: 466196
Speaker 1: And we lived in a little--first of all we lived in a little anteroom off the tavern [Open House Cafe, Gum Springs, Virginia] where we had bunk beds for me and my brother [Mike Williams] and then a little crib for my sister [Rita Chiles] and my, and my brother [Rick Williams (ph.)] came along a little bit later.  And then we moved into one of these prefab houses, which I discovered later my dad [James Williams] had been able to buy from Walter Washington, who was head of the D.C. Housing Authority [District of Columbia Housing Authority] at that time.  And so they brought this house out from Washington, D.C. to Gum Springs [Alexandria, Virginia] and set it right down on our property.  But my dad would--I mean like for instance the gypsies would come through and they would just be, you know, be a lot of racism and antagonism towards them.  But they would come and stay on our place.  Put all their trailers because my dad had several acres of land there.  So that was the refuge.  That's where people came to kind of be part of this Tony Williams [James Williams]--in essence kind of a three ring circus.
Story_ID: 466197
Speaker 1: Do you know how he came to own the, the, the place?  Can you talk about--do you know how--
Speaker 2: I have an idea.  Actually what--my dad [James Williams] had a lot of talents.  One of the talents is he was a incredible gambler.  And so when he was at Fort Belvoir [Virginia] on every payday, he would go around the post, he would hire an MP [military police] to go around the post with him, and he would get in all the gambling games.  And so he would win.  I mean he was very, very good at--probably a little shady if the truth be told, I mean you're just, you're just not that good.  I mean he had a few tricks up his sleeve.  And so he was able to invest in a business.  Actually invested in, in trailers at first.  He and a guy became a partner in this trailer business where they had the house trailers.  They would--carrying all around the country.  And that was gonna be incredibly successful.  Ultimately it was very successful.  But apparently according to my dad, my mother [Mary Williams] could not get along with the wife of his partner.  So then he kind of cashed out of that business and then bought this former black schoolhouse in Gum Springs [Alexandria, Virginia], which, you know is the--'cause the schools were segregated, former black schoolhouse, and then turned it into the Open House Cafe.
Speaker 1: Who were--what were the whites who were coming into the, into the place?
Speaker 2: They were mostly soldiers from Fort Belvoir.  Remember this was right around the time of the Korean War.  And so this was the place where the soldiers came.  I mean they were there.  I mean I had--they would all give me their helmets or the webbed belts, their web gun belts and other things.  So I was marching around there, little soldier's uniform.  So they would come to Fort Belvoir right before they would ship out to Korea.  And so this was the time of the Korean conflict.  And so I was up on that.  I knew about world events, although I was only six or seven years old at the time.  And so the soldiers, black soldiers as well as white soldiers, would come.  And so it was largely that business.  And then a lot of people from the area would, would come around as well.  But it was mostly soldiers.
Story_ID: 466198
Speaker 1: Now how far was Gum Springs [Alexandria, Virginia] from Washington, D.C.?  How far is--?
Speaker 2: Gum Springs is probably about maybe ten miles from D.C.  It's right in Fairfax County [Virginia].  It's right--we were just, just two miles north of Mount Vernon, which is [President] George Washington's home.  In fact we would go on little hikes.  I would go--there was the kind of black Cub Scout group, and I would go along with them to hike, actually most of my playmates in those years were black because we lived on the black side of the highway.  Across the street was the trailer park where whites lived.  But it was U.S. 1 [U.S. Route 1], which was very interesting, which was the first north/south road in the United States.  And it was so symbolic.  We were right on U.S. 1.  Kind of like we were straddling right there in the middle.
Speaker 1: So essentially you grew up thinking you were white because that's how your, your father [James Williams] and your mother [Mary Williams] were positioning you for the white customers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know because in the Atlantic City [New Jersey] days, my dad was passing for Greek.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: By the time we got to Virginia, he'd been passing for Italian, you know.  And he would try to kind of carry that charade.
Speaker 1: Now why do you think he changed from Greek to Italian?  I thought, I mean--
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I mean I just have no idea.  It just seemed more convenient.  He had a Greek roommate, and he didn't really like this guy.  I don't know whether there--that was it, but ultimately--and actually it was charade that my mother continued when she--'cause I have a brother who is much darker than I am.  And people--
Speaker 1: The younger br-
Speaker 2: The younger brother is, you know, very dark skinned.  And people would ask him well what he is and what was he and there's--his background.  He'd always say well I'm, I'm Italian.  And that's a charade that my mother continued for years, that, that our father was Italian.
Speaker 1: Now what about your sister?  What, what complexion was she?  'Cause you don't--
Speaker 2: We look a lot alike, actually (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 466199
Speaker 1: Anything else you wanna talk about in those, you know, early years, you know, growing up in Gum Springs [Alexandria, Virginia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I do remember going to segregated schools.  Went to the whites only schools in Virginia.  And--but I also--we had, we had kind of an army that worked with us in the restaurant [Open House Cafe, Gum Springs, Virginia].  There was the cooks, there was the waitresses, there were the handymen that were around there.  And one of them, a guy named Raymond Coleman [ph.], who drove the bus to the black school.  Actually I think was probably down near Manassas, Virginia if I remember correctly.  And so once I had a chance to go down and visit the black schools with him.  And they were just--it was just a shock because it was very different than the, than the white Woodley Hills School [Woodley Hills Elementary School, Alexandria, Virginia] that I, that I attended.  And so it was really when things started hitting me that, that blacks were treated different than I was.  And then I saw the black swimming pools, then the skating rink that were segregated as well.  So I got a little picture of that.  And I would--went into Washington, D.C.  Actually Raymond would take me in and I remember being in Washington, D.C., there was all these kids and kind of junior patrol.  We had our little badges on, everything like that.  So I'm the only little white looking kid setting in this sea of black kids in, in Washington.  And so you know, those were, those were experiences that I, that I remember.  But I, but I never really paid a lot of attention to it.  I recognized that--and was, and was smart enough.  You know I was pretty perceptive for my age, that something was wrong.  But I just never kind of put my finger on it or, or never thought about it a lot until my own life changed.
Story_ID: 466200
Speaker 1: Your earliest memory, though. H- what age were you, you think with your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: I think I was probably about six or seven.
Speaker 1: Okay.  At seven you went to live in--
Speaker 2: Well seven, you know I went to, I went to Indiana.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: To spend the year.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember anything about that year that sort of sticks out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do remember some things about that year.  I, I was--I enjoyed school.  I had a great teacher who absolutely loved me.  And I went to this school, Royerton [Royerton Elementary School, Muncie, Indiana], which was a, a school in the suburbs of my hometown of Muncie [Indiana], both my dad [James Williams] and mother [Mary Williams] were from Muncie, that's where they met.  And you know it was--I enjoyed it, it was a much more peaceful time than I remembered, you know.  It was not the, the chaos and the, and the activity that we had at the tavern, at the Open House Cafe [Gum Springs, Virginia].  And there were times that I did long to be part of that, but it was just a very peaceful time for me.  And my [maternal] grandmother--I never really liked her that much.  She was a very cold, hard woman.  My [maternal] grandfather, I really did like.  And, and actually I think later on that he either developed cancer or had some stroke or something like that.  I felt as growing up in later years that had he not been ill, that he would have tried to help us a lot more than my grandmother did.
Speaker 1: So this is Grandma and Grandpa Cook.
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Which is not their real name, it's just the name I use in the book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I see, okay I got you.  So now with--anything else about that year that you--I mean because I'm just--that you remember?  I know you said you liked school and you had--
Speaker 2: I liked school, I loved my teachers.  I was there with my mother's youngest sister, who I was in the first grade and she was about the tenth grade.  So I developed a relationship with her.  And you know we had kind of a, you know, a big sister, little brother relationship.  Although she was in tenth grade, didn't wanna spend too much time with the first graders.  She used to tell the story that, that I would come home and the teacher would, you know, always send notes about how great I was to have in class.  And she said you know you'd come home just dressed as immaculately as you were when you went to school in the morning.  She says I'm in the tenth grade, I'm coming home and I'm all disheveled and everything like that, but you were, you know you look exactly the same when you got off that bus in the afternoon as you did when you got on it at seven o'clock in the morning.
Speaker 1: So now did you--when you think about the things you were experiencing that year, let's take that year, was the, the black--you didn't really have any consideration about the black community.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't really even relevant.  It was not anything that--
Speaker 2: It was not relevant, it was not--I mean there was no, no--we were living in an all-white neighborhood.  I went to an all-white school.  Even though it wasn't segregated, the suburbs at that time, there were no blacks in that school.  And so it was just kind of--it was my existence was all white and shopped in a grocery store where I, I can't even recall seeing any black people during those years.  I mean I did in, in Virginia, they were really, you know, part of my life.  But, but in Indiana, no it was, it was all white.
Story_ID: 466201
Speaker 1: We ask this question, but I'm wondering if you're gonna give me different answers.  I mean I should ask you what it was like in, you know, Virginia or you know.  But what sights, smells and sounds remind you of your childhood?  And it's just--you, you know if you--and I would like sights, smells and sounds if I could.
Speaker 2: Well in Virginia, you know I do remember my mother [Mary Williams] used to fix cinnamon toast.  And you know that was very special for me.  I have a little cinnamon toast and oatmeal, I remember that.  The--when we, when we went to Indiana, my, my [maternal] white grandmother, you know I enjoyed eating her--I hated--she used to fix brains.  I hated brains.  I never wanted to touch them.  But other than that, she was a pretty good cook.  She made mashed potatoes, I love mashed potatoes.  When I went--we went back to Indiana to live, are you--am I getting ahead of my story here?  You know my Aunt Bess [Bess Pharris] would--and we were starving all the time because we had virtually no money whatsoever.  My Aunt Bess, every day no matter what, would fix a pot of beans.  And I'd have those white navy beans every day.  So--I mean she could also be fixing a little piece of steak or something like that, but then she's gonna have those white beans.  She was gonna make cornbread.  In the mornings she makes the--those biscuits.  You know the kind, the southern biscuits.  In fact I was down at Duke University [Durham, North Carolina] last week, my son just graduated from the M.B.A. program.  And so I walk in there and I see these home cooked biscuits and I said I remember those.  Aunt Bess used to make bread pudding, I love bread pudding.  She made jello, kind of, you know, fruit jello and tea cakes, I remember that.  And the Ms. Starr [ph.], the woman who raised me, she made--in fact when I got married, I said to my, to Ms. Starr, the woman who raised me, I said, "Will you tell Sara [Sara Whitney Williams] how to make that ice box pie?"  And you know really it was, it was--I just loved it, but you know it was just kind of a little, you know mix and a little graham cracker crust.  But it was something that I loved.  And then Ms. Starr always fixed every Sunday we'd have fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, we'd have greens and sometimes she would fix the biscuits and we'd have the icebox pie.
Speaker 1: Now what--do you have sounds that you think of too?
Speaker 2: I--well I don't know.  I can't really think of sounds that I have.  I guess--
Speaker 1: Smells?
Speaker 2: Sounds, I remember music in the church because we belonged to the Pentecostal church, and so I'd be there.  And then every Sunday with the--Bishop Sanders [Oscar E. Sanders] was doing as he would, you know, just drove everyone in the neighborhood crazy, is he'd put the speakers in the windows and just absolutely blast the entire neighborhood.  So I could hear that and I remember the church bells and Ms. Starr said, "Look, you know when those bells start ringing, you know, you're not supposed to be here in bed.  You're supposed to be setting in church.  You're not supposed to be on the way."  So I would always try to make sure I was in church when the bells, the bells starting ringing.
Speaker 1: And, and any smells that you can think--
Speaker 2: Smells, we lived right across from Roach's Cafe [Muncie, Indiana], it was the proprietor was Amon Roach, who was a member of the Christ Temple Church [Christ Temple Apostolic Faith Church; Christ Temple Global Ministries, Muncie, Indiana].  And so we lived right across.  So there was always this fried catfish, sometimes he would fix the chitlins and I just hated the smell of chitlins.  I mean that was going to pervade everything for days.  But I'd go over there and get my fried fish sandwich, usually catfish.  And then he would, you know I'd have a pie and as well which I remember.  I think the, I think the, the fried fish sandwich was about a quarter.  And so we struggled to pay it, find a quarter, find enough money to go over there and get that sandwich.  But the smells always came out of there.  And of course he had chitlins, he had greens, he had sweet potato pie.  I mean there was just all southern, down home cooking that the people just, you know, would gravitate there.
Story_ID: 466202
Speaker 1: I wanna take you back to Virginia just a little bit.  And your, your brother, his name.  You wanna give his name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Well his name is Lehman Mark Alain Williams, but we all called him Mike.
Speaker 1: And where does the Lehman, Mark--you said the name was--
Speaker 2: Lehman is from General Lehman Miller [Lehman W. Miller] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) General Lehman, okay.
Speaker 2: Mark, my dad [James Williams] was a big [U.S.] Army guy, it was General Mark Clark [Mark W. Clark].  Alain is Dr. Alain LeRoy Locke.
Speaker 1: And that--you think that's Catholic?  'Cause Catholics often have like four, you know--
Speaker 2: Well my mother [Mary Williams] was Catholic.  My father was not Catholic, so I don't, I just don't know.  I mean my--I'm Gregory Howard Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams], so he was the only one that got three names.  I, I got two.
Speaker 1: And now how was he--in the early years, what was your relationship, you know, back in Virginia?  The two of--you were the classic older brother, right?
Speaker 2: I was the older brother.  He was, he was a problem in--well it wasn't really a problem.  But he was always into something.  But he was really--he was, he was game to do anything my dad wanted him to do.  And I, you know even in those years, was a little skeptical and I was pretty precocious kid.  I was, you know I was, I was always analyzing and thinking about what was going on.  My brother--I remember, I remember the schoolhouse.  We--Virginia has a lot of snakes, you know rattlesnakes around.  And so there was something that we needed to do--and we'd seen them right around the area because we were right, you know, near a, a kind of wooded area.  So we had seen these snakes around there.  And so there was a need to, to go into the foundation of the, of the tavern one time.  And so my dad wanted me to crawl under to see, you know, some pipe or something like that.  I said I'm not gonna do that.  And so my brother, you know he didn't care, he crawled right under there.  He was always with Dad.  Dad had a septic tank truck that he--in addition, you know, supplemented his income by going and cleaning out septic tanks throughout the area.  Made a lot of money doing that.  My brother would always go with him.  In fact once, you know my dad I think was probably drinking.  And you know, went around this corner.  There's no--there were no seatbelts in those days.  My brother fell out of the truck, broke his collarbone and was in a cast for a long period of time.  But my brother started school and always had a lot of problems in school.  And I'm convinced today that there was a learning disability.  I mean he failed the first grade.  You don't fail the first grade unless there's something really wrong.  It just simply was not diagnosed at that time.  But it kind of marked him in a way for school.  And I knew he was not stupid.  He was a smart kid because you know, we, we had a lot of exchange.  But something just was not clicking for him.  And so that really started him on a path that ultimately led him to drop out of school when he was about in the, in the tenth grade.
Story_ID: 466203
Speaker 1: In the Open House, Open House Cafe [Gum Springs, Virginia], was there--it was constant activity I take it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean so--
Speaker 2: It was always something happening.
Speaker 1: So you were still going to school though, in the day, but were your parents getting--were they were early risers with all of this?  Even though they were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were up.  I mean my mother [Mary Williams] would sleep in, my dad [James Williams] was up and gone.  I mean my dad really worked 24/7.  I mean he always--he had some kind of scheme or deal.  It was the tavern, it was the septic tank business.  He was hanging out at Weschler's Auctions [Weschler's Auctioneers and Appraisers LLC] in, in Washington, D.C.  Or, you know, some kind of property deal he was gonna be involved in.  It was just--it was everything.  I mean he was just kind of like a whirling dervish.  There was always something going on.  My mother was a little bit balanced and you know was, was kind of an anchor to a certain extent.  But she had her own issues as well and, and ultimately it just didn't work.
Speaker 1: So tell, tell me about--'cause I remember the, the funny story about leaving the gas--it's the gas--
Speaker 2: The gas mask, right, yeah.  Actually my dad went to--he used to hang out at Weschler's, and I remember he would drag us around every place if it was during the summer or school was not out--we were, we were with him.  We were going with him.  And I remember he dragged us down to Weschler's auction every, every time he would go down there.  And so one time when he was down there, right around Christmastime, they for some reason had been able to get the, you know, maybe several hundred surplus army gas masks.  And my dad bought all of them, you know, what in the world is he going to do with these gas masks?  But then he would come back and we would set up a little shop in the, in the tavern or out front, selling these gas masks as Christmas presents for kids.  I mean it was also the time, you know, everybody was concerned about the Soviet Union and the Soviet threat.  And my dad, you know, parlayed that fear and concern into selling all these gas masks.  The same thing with the watermelons.  I remember once there was a watermelon truck that broke down pretty much in front of our house and so my dad bought all the watermelons.  And so he's setting--had me and my brother [Mike Williams] setting out there in the front of the place selling watermelons for two days.  And so that was the type of thing that he would do.  He always had--he was a very creative guy, and always had, you know, one scheme or another.  Now he didn't have a lot of, of perseverance.  He was--this had to be a, a hit it quick scheme because his attention span was always on the next thing.  And so in the final analysis, I think that also proved part of his undoing.
Speaker 1: Now you talk about, in the book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams] about you know, him making a lot of money.  Was it mainly with the septic tank business?  Was that--
Speaker 2: Well the septic tank, it was the tavern.  We made a lot of money with the tavern.  I remember seeing a tax return in the early '50s [1950s], a tax return of around fifty thousand dollars, which was just--
Speaker 1: A lot of money (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) absolutely incredible.  I mean if you, if you extrapolate it to present terms, you know that's close to, somewhere between five hundred thousand to a million dollars.  So he was able to parlay everything.  In fact I was talking to one of my mother's sisters who--I'm sorry, one of my mother's brothers who currently lives with my youngest brother [Rick Williams (ph.)] right now.  And he was saying--said he remembers it well you had, you had everything.  I mean you could buy anything you wanted to do.  I mean and they spent money just as quick as they made it.  They just bought everything.  We had, we had one of the first cars that came off the production line after the war.  So money was just spent.  There was not really much saving.
Story_ID: 466204
Speaker 1: Now what about your parents arguing?  How did that--they argued quite a bit (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They argued a lot, and they fought a lot.  And then I remember the physical abuse of my mother [Mary Williams] by my dad [James Williams], you know, knocking her around.  And I do remember those days and then, you know in the middle of the night of being awakened, shaken, then put in the car to, you know, race off to some place, some motel or something like that, to try to get away from my dad.
Speaker 1: Now how did that make you feel, though, as--I mean you know you point--what is happening internally, you know, during this time with you?  I mean you're a kid.
Speaker 2: Well I'm a kid and, and this is a lot of turmoil going on around me and I'm certainly fearful and concerned and worried about my safety, my family's safety.  Worrying about you know what crazy thing is my dad doing.  And of course my dad wasn't the only crazy around there; there were some others.  Because people were starting to drink and a lot of things really come out about that.  And so, yeah it was, it was kind of a tension, high tension filled time.
Speaker 1: So what is happening inside you though, at this point?  Are you--like what kind of child are you?  You know what is, what is the, what is the little Gregory Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams]?  What is he thinking, feeling?  Is he, you know, does he--is he inside his head?  You know is he, you know, gregarious like his fa- I mean what, what is happening?
Speaker 2: Well a little Gregory Williams is trying to be a man to figure how he can sort all this out.  I mean it's really amazing, and I think that's pretty much what happened is that I became the man.  I became--my, my father was unstable.  My mother, you know, had a lot of issues as well and she was unstable.  So where is the stability going to come from?  It's gonna come from me.  So I mean as silly as it sounds, I am trying to be the little man around there.  And in fact when the family split up, and I remember my mother's sister telling me that her father, my grandfather and her mother, my grandmother had a conversation about well what's gonna happen to the kids?  And I remember her sharing with me that my grandfather said well, "Mike [Mike Williams] is really gonna have a lot of problems.  The rest of the kids are gonna have a lot of problems.  But Greg will be able to survive this."  You know which obviously I was able to kind of--even to I guess appear to them as a person who had some stability and was again, I hate the phrase, kind of the little man who said okay, well that's just, that's just a hardship you have to deal with.  And so ultimately that's--I kind of--I didn't like it, but took it as well.  It's just the world that I have to live with and it's the world that I have to try to survive in.
Story_ID: 466205
Speaker 1: You were aware of a world outside because of the soldiers.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean with, you know, I'm--did your father [James Williams] talk at all about going to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?  No, he wouldn't have talked about going to Howard.
Speaker 2: He did not talk about going to Howard.  But you know as I reflect back on it, every once in a while we would have you know, blacks come by and people he would introduce me to.  And I know in the past there was one cousin that came by, but I didn't realize he was a cousin of mine at the time.  Then there was a, a number of light complexion blacks who would come by and he would introduce them to me.  Then there was this very light skinned guy we used to visit in Pennsylvania, Jimmy Fisher.  And so as I look back, there was always kind of folks on the edge that were part of my life and I just didn't know kind of who they were, what their background was.  But they were, they were part of my greater family unit.
Story_ID: 466206
Speaker 1: Okay so I was asking what kind of person you were.  Did you dream of things, you know, in that you know, that was really--I'm talking about Virginia, we'll get back, but did you dream of anything or you know, fantasize about anything, or you know wanna--decide that you wanted to--
Speaker 2: Well I was a big military buff in those years.  It's kind of funny is of course obviously all the soldiers around there.  And I remember watching television.  We had one of the first televisions in the area and I remember when Truman [President Harry S. Truman] had fired MacArthur [Douglas MacArthur] and brought him back to the United States.  I was just so mad with, with Harry Truman because I thought MacArthur was a, a great military hero and, and should have been recognized and of course Truman was absolutely right in firing MacArthur.  But, but I was really a big military buff and, and I guess you know what I kind of did, and I thought about this a little bit.  I played army a lot and always wanted to be the general.  I mean I always wanted to be in charge of the army.  And, and so it was--it was fun to, to kind of do that.  I don't know whether I ever thought about going to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] or something like that.  Maybe I did.  But, but I was really fascinated with the [U.S.] Army.  Fascinated with war.  Fascinated with kind of bringing the people together and kind of, you know organizing this, this huge effort to fight a war [Korean War].
Story_ID: 466207
Speaker 1: Now was church part of your life in, in Virginia?
Speaker 2: No, it really wasn't.  There was a Catholic church nearby, there was a number of black churches in Gum Springs [Alexandria, Virginia].  I cannot really recall ever--any time that we ever went to a church.  My mother [Mary Williams] said that, you know, we were going, but you know we, we never really went to church at all.
Speaker 1: Do you remember holidays at all?
Speaker 2: I don't really remember.  We didn't really spend holidays--you know we may have.  I mean oftentimes, the special times when we were going to Indiana to spend time with my mother's parents because we would be there oftentimes at Christmas or sometime in the summer.  Those really were the special times.  We would go to Atlantic City [New Jersey] from time to time during the summer.  I do remember my dad [James Williams] being drunk as we were going up there and everybody being nervous and me being nervous about was he gonna get in a car accident.  He got stopped for drunken driving at least once when we went up there.  I don't remember, I don't remember celebrating much.  I remember a Christmas tree in that little place off the Open House Cafe [Gum Springs, Virginia], and maybe one in our, in our little house we had that, that Walter Washington gave us.
Speaker 1: Was there any tradition at your grandparents' place in Indiana around the holidays that your remember?
Speaker 2: Not any special tradition.  I remember being there with them for Thanksgiving.  That year that I was there and Christmas, and that was a, you know that was a special time and people would kind of come and, and gather together.  But they, they weren't really big churchgoers either.
Speaker 1: Did the food differ there at your grandparents' home?
Speaker 2: Yeah it, like I said it was the brains.  We didn't, we didn't have brains in Virginia.  In the--we did have a cook in, in Virginia, you know work--worked at the restaurant.  So basically he would fix the dinners and we would eat in there in the, in the kitchen pretty much at the wood block table.  That's really where we'd eat.  And then sometimes we'd had, we had a kitchen table in the, in the little area where we stayed right off the restaurant.

Speaker 1: Can you describe Gum Springs [Alexandria, Virginia]?  Just physically what it looked like?
Speaker 2: Gum Springs was really in those days was kind of a tattered, rundown area.  The Open House Cafe [Gum Springs, Virginia] sat right on Route 1 [U.S. Route 1].  Right behind it was kind of forest, a lot of rundown shacks.  There was only one well, and it was a minister, I can't remember the minister's name right now, who really pretty much had control of the well and everybody kind of came there.  There was one place right next to us which was a very nice place and there was very--kept up very well, it was a black family living there.  They had two sons that we played with.  They kind of looked down on us because our place, you know, looked a little trashy and my dad [James Williams] wasn't, wasn't mowing the grass too much.  It was mostly dirt and we had a few cabins that we rented out as well.  And I remember one time we--they wanted to keep us away from one of the cabins because a guy died in there and they discovered that he had tuberculosis.  And so you know they put all kinds of special candles in there to do that.  But it was a really, it was a community of poverty.  There was just absolutely no question about it.  Really rundown at the heels.  There was one little, one little store where people bought their groceries.  And you know the people were nice, but they were very, very poor.
Story_ID: 466209
Speaker 1: When your father [James Williams] drank, was your mother [Mary Williams] usually drinking too?
Speaker 2: I never remember my mother drinking, but I'm sure she did probably drink a little bit.
Speaker 1: But she was not--
Speaker 2: She was not drunk.  No she--I never recall her getting drunk.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the night that your, you know, mother left?  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: No, we weren't there that night, actually.  What happened was that we, we had been sent to Indiana to spend the summer in Indiana.  And so my mother left with two young children.  And we were gone at that time.  Now according to my mother, she called my grandmother, my white grandmother and said, "Don't give the boys to Tony [James Williams]."  And, "I'm coming to get them."  But my dad showed up and, and my grandmother, my grandmother gave us to my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So and we didn't, we didn't have a clue as to what was going on at the time.  And then he turned around and took us right--he drove overnight immediately after she left.  He got in the car immediately and drove to Indiana to get us and you know so he turned around and took us back to Virginia.
Speaker 1: So he took you back to Virginia.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then how long were you in Virginia?
Speaker 2: I think we were there, you know, probably--so it was in the summer would be my guess.  So it was at least nine, ten months we left.  I'm a little foggy on this, but we were there at least seven or eight months, maybe a year there when she was gone.  Probably about seven or eight months would be my guess.
Story_ID: 466210
Speaker 1: So how was that then?  Te- describe how you know, everything had changed in that summer --
Speaker 2: Everything had changed at that time.  Everything had changed.  First of all the war [Korean War] was drawing to a close. And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So there weren't as many customers.
Speaker 2: There weren't as many customers.  Secondly, my dad [James Williams] was drunk all the time, so you know, he couldn't take care of 'em.  The waitresses left one by one.  The beer distributor cut off supplies and so we went pretty quickly to pretty much a hand-to-mouth existence.  And I remember being hungry most of that time.  I mean we had nothing to eat, to cook with 'cause the cook was a good friend of my mother's [Mary Williams].  And Percy and then left after my mother left.  And so it was just basically me and my dad, then there was this one guy from Pennsylvania who came.  And then there was a, you know, a couple women who hung around.  My dad, you know, had all kinds of girlfriends.  So you know they kind of cycled through and out and they get kind of tired of him, and that was pretty easy to do, particularly when he was drinking.  So really we were hungry, we were absolutely starving.  And the meal that I remember was that we would--when we would scrape together enough money to have a hot meal, we would go to this Italian restaurant and have spaghetti and meatballs and two slices of white bread with butter on it.  And that, that was the meal.  And most of the time when I would go to school, we didn't eat.  I mean we didn't, we didn't have anything for breakfast.  And so unless my dad you know, was able to kind of come up with a couple of quarters, one for me and my brother, we didn't eat.  And so when--and this was before the hot lunches or the free lunch or anything like that.  But I do remember that school meal where they had shepherd's pie.  You know I just love the shepherd's pie, which is you know the, the ham and the bacon and the, and the mashed potatoes.  But we were basically starving.  We were starving.  And I look at pictures of myself and I can see that, you know, I lost a lot of weight in those, at that time.
Speaker 1: So are you--you're still going to school during this time.
Speaker 2: Still going to school.  I was about in the fourth grade at that time, starting the fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Did any of the teachers express concern?  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: No, I never had any teacher express any concern to me about that, no.
Speaker 1: And did you--were you asking your father, you know, what was going on, or was he--or you were just--
Speaker 2: He was just drunk most of the time.  And he did get a job.  He got a job as security guard at the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.].  And so he worked nights and then so we would have, you know, some women would come in and spend the night with him, his girlfriends and you know, sometimes they'd leave in the middle of the night.  So it was me and Mike [Mike Williams].  We had moved out of the house and back to the tavern [Open House Cafe, Gum Springs, Virginia].  You know and I'm putting--I'm scared to death because we're there by ourselves at night, just me and my brother because these girls, you know, women would you know, drunk and take off.  And, and so here I am, I guess how old would I be at the time?  I guess I was probably, you know about nine years old.  Then maybe close to ten by that time.  And I'm shoving chest o'drawers in front of the doors to kind of try to keep us safe because we'd have people to come looking for my dad.  Knocking on the door, barging in as we were there trying to sleep in the middle of the night.  And I was terrified because they'd always be drunk and unfriendly and looking for something to drink.  Looking for my dad and he wasn't there.  And so here I am, trying to kind of control the situation, situation which I had absolutely no control over.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you--did you ever get in an argument with your father during that time, or not?  It was just not--
Speaker 2: I don't remember arguing with Dad during that time.  I mean it was just, it just seemed so hopeless.  I mean our lives seemed hopeless.
Story_ID: 466211
Speaker 1: And so do you remember when he [Williams' father, James Williams] made the decision to, you know, that he was just leaving, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was really right around his birthday.  He was born on January the 9th, 1914, and so it was January the--right around January of 1954.  He was forty years old.  And you know he kind of hit us with the fact that, you know, we lost everything.  Of course we know, we knew we had lost everything.  We lost the townhouse--we had been living in a townhouse.  And we lost that, we moved out of that, back to the tavern [Open House Cafe, Gum Springs, Virginia].  We had no hope whatsoever.  And so he said well we're going to Indiana.  I'm selling everything, or getting rid of everything and we're, we're gonna head to Indiana.  And I think, you know, we all kind of pretty much broke down crying at that time.
Speaker 1: Do you think that--why did he--why do you think it had such a debilitating effect on him?  Was he really in love with your mother [Mary Williams], or what, or was that--I mean 'cause think about all that stuff that he was sort of dealing with, sort of, you know.  He had been passing, you know, coming back.  I'm just, I'm just wondering what was, you know I mean obviously he had a lot of pain. You know, alcohol.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, but I'm just--
Speaker 2: I think he cared about my mother, but he adored the children.  I mean my sister [Rita Chiles], I told my sister about this in later years, you know after my book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams] came out.  And I said--and she's been married for thirty years.  I said I want you to understand that you have two men in your life who absolutely adore the ground you walked on.  One is your husband, and the other was your father.  I mean he just adored the ground.  He would take her every place he ever went.  I mean, you know my brother [Mike Williams] and I would go along with him, but my sister--and you know he would--we'd make this money and he'd go in and buy her these beautiful dresses.  Can you imagine buying a five year old, you know, just absolutely exquisite clothes.  I mean and everything he could do for her.  And so she was so special to him.  And so the family--and then my youngest brother, the baby, Rick [Rick Williams (ph.)], you know he just adored him.  I mean he cared about us, but I mean he just--he adored his family.  And even though he made a lot of mistakes, he really cared about it.  I don't know how much he cared about my mother, and I think you know obviously there was a lot of affection at one time between the two of them because--and you think about it, they were real pioneers.  I mean they crossed a racial line when it--when there was a cost for doing that.  And they struck out on their own together and they made that decision to do that.  And I have enormous respect for them doing that.  But in the final analysis, it just kind of disintegrated.  But my dad lost everything and I think he realized that he had tried to change his life and he had been able to kind of see what the possibilities were.  And then just have that all just tumble down.  This is a guy who made fifty thousand dollars a year.  And then go back to Muncie [Indiana] and he never made more than fifty dollars and fifty cents a week.  I mean it just destroyed him.
Speaker 1: But what, what made him lose all of it?  Do you think that would have happened anyway had your mother not left (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think it would have happened.
Speaker 1: You think it would have happened.
Speaker 2: I think it ultimately happened; he couldn't control the drinking.  He was living a lie to a certain extent because he couldn't say this is who I am, you know my--this is my mother, I'm black, you know.  And this is my heritage and my family and friends.  I can't really recognize them and I can't, I can't have them together.  I can't put my arms around 'em and say well look at what I've created.  It's just--it was just--you know and I've talked with a lot of other folks like that because when they go and pass for white, I mean that's the life.  And then so you come back, you know come back to Harlem [New York, New York] or you're with the relatives or whatever and say well you know, I'm, I'm doing well out there, but I'm sorry you can't come with me on that trip.  And, and so you know that takes its--that takes away the, the pride of that accomplishment and achievement.
Story_ID: 466212
Speaker 1: You're saying as you were dr- driving, that's when he [Williams' father, James Williams] told you.
Speaker 2: That's when he told us.  We were on the bus, we were on the Greyhound bus--
Speaker 1: I--I, yeah, that's fine.
Speaker 2: --you know headed, headed back to Muncie [Indiana].  And see my brother [Mike Williams] and I, like I said, we were starving.  We were literally starving.  And actually I guess as you read my book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams], you'll see there's a lot of allusions to food.  In fact I've had some people say well after reading your book, I wanted to come over and cook for you.  I wanted to bring groceries for this little starving kid.  And you know I did think it had--you know it stunted my growth to a certain extent and my, my development.  But, but so we were just, we were looking for some kind of relief from this just, just, just rapid falling into the abyss after my mother [Mary Williams] left and after we lost everything.  So we thought we were going to go and live with my [maternal] white grandparents then because we knew that we're gonna eat there.  And was probably gonna be stable.  And so that was a real attractive thing for us.  But it was about midway in the trip and I've tried to always figure out where that was.  And, and the best I can figure it out, somewhere between Columbus, Ohio and Dayton, Ohio.  And it was very ironic that, you know, basically fifty years later I became dean of The Ohio State law school [The Ohio State University College of Law; Michael E. Moritz College of Law] in Columbus [Ohio].  But when Dad told us the story and said look, he asked us if I remembered Miss Sallie [Sallie Higginbotham Williams] and I had met her, she'd been at the restaurant [Open House Cafe, Gum Springs, Virginia] and you know actually I remember I'd been introduced to her in Indiana because from time to time when we would go to Indiana, my mother would take me by this little diner in Indiana and tell me to go up and knock on the door and ask for Sallie.  And so I would go up and knock on the door and ask for Sallie and she'd come out.  And you know they never told me who she was.  She would just come out and see us, and then we'd go off.  I never paid any attention to that.  And then she was in Virginia for a period of time, you know, working as, as the cook there.  And he said, he said, "Well do you remember Miss Sallie?"  And I said, "Yeah, I remember her."  And some--I remember her and my dad said, "Well that's my grandmother.  And--," I'm sorry, "that's my mother and that's your grandmother."  And then this was 1954.  He said, "In Virginia you're white boys, but in Indiana you're gonna be colored boys.  And your life is gonna be different, but you're just gonna have to learn how to deal with it.  That's because we don't have anything else to go to or anything else to help us."  So I knew immediately because I had seen the segregated schools and I had seen the way that blacks were treated, but it never really resonated with me that one day that I would be treated the same way.  But I immediately on the bus realized my life's gone be different.
Speaker 1: So here you're--so okay that's what I'm--you know psychologically what is happening because you know you're--how--all of a sudden you're one thing, and then you're another.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean that takes--it's one to hear it, it's another to experience it.  But what you saw and experienced wasn't anything like--I mean you had seen it, but you hadn't been a part of it.
Speaker 2: I had seen it, but I'd not been a part of it, you know and it just didn't really register with me.  You know I mean our--I guess maybe I said wow, that doesn't seem right, you know, and that's not nice.  But it didn't mean anything to me because here I am, the son of Tony Williams, the owner of the Open House Cafe [Alexandria, Virginia], the captain of industry in the, in the northern Virginia area.  I mean a man who could do anything in the world and convinced me that he had the ability to change whatever he wanted to change, or to do whatever he wanted to do.  I mean I didn't, I didn't worry about that 'cause I had confidence in my dad and his abilities.
Story_ID: 466213
Speaker 1: So here, so here you go, you, you live--go, go in and first you move with, with--did you move with--no, you moved--
Speaker 2: We went to Aunt Bess' [Bess Pharris] first.
Speaker 1: Aunt Bess and Aunt Bess didn't really--right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, no we, we, got off that bus and we walked down this railroad track and you know that was a part of Muncie [Indiana] we'd never been in before.  And then we kind of--we went to my [paternal] grandmother's [Sallie Higginbotham Williams] house first.  I didn't realize what it was because we were just coming down off the railroad track and it was a fairly nice house.  And then right behind it was a tool shed.  And so with the tar paper siding and the, you know tar paper roof.  And so my dad [James Williams] opens the door and starts knocking on the door there.  And I'm wondering what is this, why is he knocking on the door of a tool shed?  And so he said, "This is where Mom lives."  And you know immediately I think my God, what is this?  This is a tool shed that she was living in here.  And she wasn't home.  But he looked in--they had, she had a, an icebox, I mean truly an icebox.  And he found a beer in the icebox and you know opened the beer and then said, "Well let's go up to Aunt Bess'."  So we walked through the projects.  Actually the projects were right next to where we lived.  So we see these projects and actually it was lot of glass on the ground and there was, you know, things were pretty shabby.  And we walked, walked up to the hill and we go into this house, go in through this gate, this ficket- you know picket fence that, you know had kind of peeling paint on it and kind of run down.  And I noticed there was an outhouse in the back, you know they didn't have running water, which was even unusual for Indiana at that time.  And so we all knock on the door and this big, husky, you know, coffee colored skinned woman comes and opens the door.  And Dad says, "Boys, I wanna introduce you to Aunt Bess."  And I'm thinking what in the world is this all about?
Speaker 1: But you didn't really ask a lot of questions.  You had to observe more?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know I learned very quickly that I had to observe.  I mean I couldn't ask questions because I didn't know.  I mean I knew that I was kind of walking on eggshells here a little bit and I, and I knew that my life depended on how other people responded to me.  And so I did not wanna do anything to alienate anyone because I'm hungry, I'm starving.  I haven't eaten for the last twenty-four hours.  And it's like whoa, you know I gotta just set here and figure out what this is all about.
Speaker 1: So this is really survival.  What you--when people are in a survival mode, right?
Speaker 2: Absolute survival.  You know figuring out how you're going to be able to make it.
Story_ID: 466214
Speaker 1: So Aunt Bess [Bess Pharris], you hear them talking, you know they're--her, her husband is Uncle--
Speaker 2: Uncle Osco.
Speaker 1: Uncle Oscar. Os- Osc- Osco.
Speaker 2: Osco Pharris, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, Osco Pharris.  And what kind of people were they would you say?  So what kind of people were they?
Speaker 2: Well Aunt Bess, I really loved Aunt Bess.  She was a good hearted woman.  She really wanted to do the best she could for us.  She fed us that day, first day I ate the white beans and the cornbread and the biscuits that were left over from breakfast, sorghum molasses.  I mean we were starving, we were absolutely starving.  And (crying)--
Speaker 1: It's okay, it's okay.  Must be hard.
Speaker 2: --still cared about us.  So we didn't know what was gonna happen.  I was introduced to my cousin, Mary Lou, black girl, you know who had buck teeth and she wasn't that friendly to us.  But you know and I can understand that.  Grandma [Sallie Higginbotham Williams] when we first met her, wasn't that friendly to us.  I mean because my dad [James Williams] had pretty much ignored them and so we, we were the ones that were there to bear the brunt of that lack of recognition.  But Aunt Bess fed us.  We stayed there.  Actually my dad said what he was going to do is that he was going back to Virginia to try to get what he could out of the business, to sell whatever he could sell, and left us there with Aunt Bess.  And you know talking about new sights and smells and things like that.  They had an outdoor toilet.  They had the slop jar, you know. (Laughter) This was a totally new experience for me.  You know I mean 'cause I'm, you know, living the privileged life before we arrive at Aunt Bess'.
Story_ID: 466215
Speaker 1: And so it was really kind of new adjustment. So Dad [James Williams] leaves.  I mean he leaves after he registers us.  He goes to Garfield Elementary School [Muncie, Indiana] and registers us at Garfield Elementary School.  And you know af- and I notice something, you know again precocious Greg Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] looking over his shoulder as he's signing us in there in C, in the category for race, he puts W down for white.  And I'm looking at him and said, "Dad, you just told us we're colored, we're not white."  And you know I don't say anything, but I kind of nudge him, you know, to try again, the little man trying to get my dad on the right track here.  But so he registers us in school.  I'm in the fourth grade, my brother I guess Mike [Mike Williams] is in the, in the first.  I guess I take that back.  He was in the, in the second grade.  And then we go back home and he says he's leaving.  And so here I am, you know, with people that I don't know.  With black people that I don't know and I, I wasn't fearful 'cause I mean I had, you know black people had been part of my life and had, you know, taken care of me as a kid growing up.  And so I didn't have that problem, but I don't know these people and they're a little angry with me.  I mean I'm thinking what did I do here?  You know I'm--I didn't do anything here.  But Aunt Bess [Bess Pharris], you know really embraced us.  But again, this is now right in the middle of the black housing projects; that's where we are.  Right next to the playground, right next to all the little buildings and so we're there.  And we go out in the evenings or after school in the playground and people--well who are these little white boys on there?  And so then the fights began.  Because you know the projects were divided.  There was the black projects and there was the white projects.  And, and we were in the black projects, these little white looking boys in the black projects.  So you know there was a, there was a lot of fights in those early days.  Mike would go over there first.  He was the one that'd venture out.  I would set on the, on the porch and I had my little clay.  I think Uncle Osco [Osco Pharris] or Aunt Bess gave me some clay and so I was making my armies and you know soldiers and things like that and playing with that.  I didn't go over there 'cause I was timid about doing that.  But ultimately Aunt Bess said get over there.  And so I would go over there.  And so then I started having, you know, a lot of fights on the, on the projects as well.  So then I go to school and my, and my cousin Mary Lou, she, you know I'm still trying to be this little white boy at school.  My cousin Mary Lou I know blows my cover there going around telling everybody, "You know my cousin is Greg Williams and Mike Williams, they're my cousins."  And I'm thinking God, right, you know, thank you.  And so I'm even trying to hit on this little white girl in this class you know, who was pretty cute that I liked.  And then I'm trying to shut Mary Lou up who's in the, you know in the third grade, I'm in the fourth, she's in third and Mike's in the second, or something like that.  But, but then pretty much, pretty soon it's, it's out.  And in fact one of the memories, I remember one time, and which I have in the book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of A White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams], about where I was having lunch at Aunt Bess' and I see, you know we're right there, we're right on the borderline between the black and white areas.  And I see these two white girls standing down at the bottom of the hill where the safety patrol is, as I walk out of the out of Aunt Bess' with Mary Lou and Mike.  And I said (gesture) that's over.  And so then from them, from then on, we were, we began to be ostracized by the white community.
Story_ID: 466216
Speaker 1: Still, there were still the fights. But ultimately we did get accepted by the blacks 'cause I had a lot, in addition to Mary Lou, I had a lot of other cousins as well.  And so then, then actually there was this one kid that shows up on one Saturday afternoon, very light skinned kid, tall, about six foot tall, got face all broken out in pimples.  But he's there to see us.  And say well--so Aunt Bess [Bess Pharris] says, "Well Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams]," actually they called me Billy, that was my nickname, Billy.  Said, "Billy the--your brother's here to see you."  I said, "What?"  I don't--my brother Mike [Mike Williams] is setting right here and Rick [Rick Williams (ph.)], or Anthony [Anthony Creasy] is with my mother [Mary Williams].  They said no this is your brother.  And so what it was, it was my brother Jimmy, Jimmy Johnson [James Johnson], who had--was an illegitimate child of my dad [James Williams] from this black woman in Muncie [Indiana].  And so he was there.  He was a--he was in high school, Muncie Central [Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana], about the tenth grade.  So he was there and so we spent some time with him.  He was great.  He would take us around and he took us out to the woman who raised him.  His mother had left and gone to California.  And, and we were introduced to Aunt Ceola who became our Aunt Ceola.  And so I thought okay I got someone who's here with us.  And then about six months later he leaves to go to California.  So we're again on our own.  But at the same time we stay with Aunt Bess for a while and Uncle Osco [Osco Pharris] you know, really gets upset with this because you know who get these two little raggedy boys in their--and so they call for Grandma [Sallie Higginbotham Williams].  And, and, and tell her to come up and get us.  Because see my dad said he was gonna be back within, within a week, two weeks at most.  And so he left us there right about the middle of January.
Story_ID: 466217
Speaker 1: So Dad [James Williams] didn't come back.  And so they called for Grandma.  We called her Grandma Sallie [Sallie Higginbotham Williams] in those days, my father's mother.  And so she--they told her, said she's gotta take us because Osco [Osco Pharris] really put the pressure on Aunt Bess [Bess Pharris].  Said, you know, you gotta take these boys.  I can't, I can't take care of 'em.  So she had that little shack, which was basically to call it a three room shack, is a exaggeration.  Basically it was a kind of an area where you walked in, kind of it did have cold, running water.  You know only cold.  And then there was a little hot plate and there was a potbellied stove, and then there was kind of a little ante-way for another room where there was Grandma had her bed and there was a couch in there and a chest of drawers and a radio, that was all could get in that room.  And then kind of this other little room was the, was a toilet stool in there.  And it was a closet.  And so it wasn't much.  And so Grandma comes after us and Aunt Bess, I remember Aunt Bess just vividly taking down two brown shopping bags, two grocery bags, and we put everything we owned in those two grocery bags.  And walked down to 601 1/2 Railroad Street.  Grandma had found a cot, army cot.  We slept right next to the toilet.  My brother [Mike Williams] slept on one end of the cot and I slept at the other end of the cot.  She had no food, she had that icebox.  The only food that we had down there was that sometimes she would, in her little purse, and this wasn't the time that women had big purses.  This was this little purse that she would put in a couple of hamburger patties and some French fries and bring it home and fix it on the hot plate.  And that was what we ate.  From time to time I'd be out there playing at the playground up near Aunt Bess', and Aunt Bess would go to the grocery and she'd come home and she'd call me off the basketball court to come over before she got to the house, before Osco could see her.  And she'd give me, you know a pound of bacon or some bread or something like that, said take it home right now.  And so I'd have to get out of my basketball game and, and take it home.  And so she really did--and then I would go, you know, to their house from time to time and you know, have some beans, something like that.  But I had to be very careful because I couldn't get it there all the time because Osco did not wanna be feeding us.  And he was really, you know, pretty adamant about that.

Speaker 1: So we stayed down there with Grandma [Sallie Higginbotham Williams] so Dad [James Williams] as I said, left in January.  I mean it's, it's a (laughter)--I mean I couldn't have scripted this better.  My dad shows up on Good Friday, right before Easter.  I mean here I am, you know, trying to cope with all this and this man leaves us there in January and then shows up at Easter.  And then wants to know what's, what's going on?  How you boys doing?  And then I'm thinking where in the world have you been?  And I was angry, I was really mad at him because I thought he had let us down and just abandoned us.  You know it's one thing to be abandoned by our mother [Mary Williams], but then, you know, our father abandoned us as well.  I mean and I thought what is this?  And you know talking about dreams, I did have some dreams.  Sometimes I thought, I thought well this is just all a fantasy and it was a test.  It was a test to see whether or not my brother [Mike Williams] and I could survive.  One of those days that, you know, my mom and my dad were gonna show up in our new car with the, you know with my sister [Rita Chiles] and brother [Rick Williams (ph.)] and we we're all gonna go back to India- or to Virginia and to live that life that we had left.  But little did I know.
Speaker 2: And so he shows up and he then moves in als- right?
Speaker 1: Then he moves in also.  He starts sleeping on the couch.  So then it gets even worse down there because his drinking is--gets worse.  My grandmother's an alcoholic as well.  And so they're drunk all the time and so my dad again is the type that draws people to him.  So we've got people, you know in that little shack, you know, fighting and hollering and gambling and you know just a, it was just absolutely incredible.  I remember going to sleep at night and hearing all the, the arguments and the threats from the people that were there.  Who's got some money to buy some wine?  You know what's, what's going on?
Story_ID: 466219
Speaker 1: I mean the only time I felt safe there was when Grandma's [Sallie Higginbotham Williams] boyfriend, Joe Turnipseed, and actually such a great name.  People think I made that name up.  But it is a true name and actually I really, I felt a little bad about, about using that name because I was sure--I knew Joe was dead and I was sure that his wife was dead as well.  So after my book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams] comes out, about four or five years after my book comes out, I have a friend of mine said, "Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams]," he said, "I was in church in Muncie [Indiana] and you will never guess who walked in that church at ninety-five years old, other than Mrs. Turnipseed [Eula Turnipseed]."  And so everybody in Muncie is talking about you didn't have to tell all those stories about Muncie in those days.  But Joe Turnipseed was a big, husky guy.  He was a hod carrier, you know carrying those, those bricks around.  And so when Joe was there, I felt safe because of the silliness my dad was involved in.  I mean he could, you know you thought well I'm Buster Williams [James Williams], a fighter, and so I know what I'm doing, which is just absolutely ludicrous because he barely weighed 140 pounds.  And so I felt safe in that situation.  But otherwise, we really felt unsafe on that.
Story_ID: 466220
Speaker 1: And what happened was that people started coming around and actually what was, what was kind of funny about this in later years.  I would have--we were--what my dad would do as he would go around and talk to the women in the neighborhood and say, "You know I need to be with you.  I've got two sons to take care of and if I was with you, I would change my life.  I mean you're the person that I need."  And so I had so many women in later years who would come to me and said, "You know, I almost became your mama because Buster [James Williams] was talking to me and he--and you guys were gonna move.  I was gonna take you in if Dora [Dora Terry Smith] hadn't taken you in."  Well what happened was that Ms. Dora, we call her Ms. Dora, it was Dora Terry at the time that she married later, came down and saw us and, and I remember her telling me why was she interested in us.  And she said well one day after work, and she got off usually around 6:30.  She said, "I came by 601 1/2 Railroad Street and saw you two boys sitting there on a plank bench.  And your grandmother [Sallie Higginbotham Williams] and your father were passed out drunk on this little dirt yard there."  She said, "I gotta do something for this."  So she made--what she did is that she felt--she was only making twenty-five dollars a week, this around 1954 or '55 [1955], which was not any money even then.  And she said, "I want you boys to come up to stay with me one at a time."  And so--and she was trying to decide which one of us to take because she couldn't take care of both of us.  And so I think Mike [Mike Williams] went up first.  I mean he was always more gregarious.  I was kind of the timid, laid back, always trying to figure out what's going on and how I can, you know, best protect myself in a situation over which I had no control.  And, and so--then I went up the next night.  And she was telling me that, that I was crying, you know, in my sleep.  Talking about my brother.  And so she came back and she said, "I'm gonna take both the boys."  And Dad said, "Well when do I move in?"  She said, "No.  You do not move in.  I'm--."  She was a member of Christ Temple Church [Christ Temple Apostolic Faith Church; Christ Temple Global Ministries, Muncie, Indiana].  "I'm just gonna take the boys, but I need you to help me take the boys."  He said, "Well I'm not gone let the boys move in if I can't come in."  She said, "Buster, I cannot believe you would do that to your boys."  And so my dad relented and we moved up with her and you know, we in essence became her boys.
Speaker 2: That started the normal, some normalcy then.
Speaker 1: That started the normalcy.  Although we were still hungry most of the time because then she made twenty-five dollars a week, which wasn't enough money to go and buy groceries for two rapidly growing boys.  And she worked as a, as a maid herself and cooked for this family.  And so she would bring food home that was leftover from the table of this white family for whom she worked.  She'd bring that home in a shopping bag and so we'd meet her at the railroad track every night, you know which separated the black area from the white area, and walk home with her.
Speaker 2: Now this is 1954, right?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-four [1954], yeah.
Speaker 2: And with--and your father is still living with your mother.
Speaker 1: My grandmother (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean with his mo- with your grandmother.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah with his mother, yeah.
Speaker 2: And how--where is school in this?  Because he comes January, then you know he comes Easter. You have the summer off.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Are you with Miss Dora by the time school begins?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're with her by the time school begins.  I think I was trying to figure out how long we stayed with her.  I think we, I think we're, we're at her house by the time school begins if I remember correctly, it's kind of foggy. But I think that's pretty much the case.
Speaker 2: But he registered, okay, but--
Speaker 1: He registered us when we first arrived.
Speaker 2: First got there, okay
Speaker 1: In Muncie [Indiana], right.
Speaker 2: And you were--the name of the school was--
Speaker 1: Garfield Elementary [Garfield Elementary School, Muncie, Indiana], right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Garfield--now had he gone to Garfield himself, do you know?
Speaker 1: No, actually he hadn't.  He, he'd gone to a school which was pretty much an all-black school right next to where my Aunt Bess [Bess Pharris] lived on that old playground, Jackson Elementary [Jackson Elementary School, Muncie, Indiana].  So he had gone to Jackson Elementary, which was for kids in the neighborhood, mostly black, but there were some white kids there as well.  But Jackson had been torn down.  And so we went to, we went to Garfield.  I don't know where--I think he also went to--he may have gone to Blaine Junior High School [Muncie, Indiana], I went to Wilson Junior High School [Muncie, Indiana].  And, but he did go to Muncie Central [Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana].  He graduated in '32 [1932] from Muncie Central High School, and I graduated in '62 [1962], thirty years later.
Story_ID: 466221
Speaker 1: So is Miss Dora [Dora Terry Smith] your prime person that you're interacting with at, at some point?  At, at this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well yes and no because Dad [James Williams] still was a big influence in our lives.  We, you know we'd beat a path back and forth down to 601 1/2 Railroad Street.  We were down there--
Speaker 1: And how far was it?  Was it just--
Speaker 2: It's about a block and a half, something like that; it was not far, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you're sort of in and out of there, they're drink--you know there's always activity.
Speaker 2: There's always activity.  There's fights, there's always some scam or another and a lot of little gangster wannabes are hanging out down there as well.  My dad is kind of really on the edge and you know, hanging out with the, the drunks and the winos and the prostitutes and the others.  But he does also get involved with the politicians as well.
Speaker 1: And you told that whole story about him identifying the Republican Party as--
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  And he, you know he was one of the first black candidates for the state senate in Indiana in the 1930s.  And, and there's some interesting stories about that and about, about that experience.  But when we came back, Republicans were in control and so he was trying to, to find a job.  And--but the drinking was a problem.  But he did, he did try to get involved with the party and I think he got involved with the Republican Party a little bit.  And then he, after they won the election and took office, he looked for a job and then you know the job gave him in spite of the fact he was writing position papers and speeches and everything like that.  They gave him a job as a janitor at city hall.  But never a guy to be the shrinking violet, my brother [Mike Williams] and I, we were down there and down there city hall.  And I remember, you know sometimes from time to time, as we would go by there.  We would go by the council chambers and he would introduce us to the mayor.  You know this is the janitor of city hall.  He was stopping mayor, he stopped the council members, said I want to introduce you to my boys.  My son Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] and I remember, you know, as we would go and clean out the council chambers, you know, and the private rooms where the councilmen and everything like that.  I remember Dad saying to me once, said, "Greg one of these days I want you in this room."  And so I had no idea what he was talking about 'til much later.
Speaker 1: Now did he--so was he talking about education in between this?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All the time.
Speaker 2: All the time he was talking about education.  He said education--the way you're gonna be able to change your life is education, you know, that's the key.  I wanted--he said he want--he said, "I wanted to be a lawyer and you're gonna be the lawyer that I wanted to be.  You're gonna do the things that I could never do."  And so it's kind of like, you know, I took on the mantle for the black community Muncie [Indiana].  And interestingly enough, I get--I'm a hero in Muncie these days and, and particularly in the black community there and actually the mayor gave me the key to the city and a lot of other things recently.  But you know I thought, you know by this time, what, I'm ten or eleven years old, maybe twelve after we'd been there for a while.  But you know this is the mantle that, that has been handed me.  That somehow or another I'm gonna write all these wrongs that have been done to my family, to black people in Muncie, to people everywhere.
Story_ID: 466222
Speaker 1: So Miss Dora's [Dora Terry Smith] life is church, that's a big part.
Speaker 2: That's a big part.  That was her life.  It was, it was work and church.  There was really not much else.
Speaker 1: And, and it was--now how many black churches were there in town?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  You know I guess--I would say probably about fifteen or twenty.  There were a lot of, there were a lot of churches and the Christ Temple [Christ Temple Apostolic Faith Church; Christ Temple Global Ministries, Muncie, Indiana] was Pentecostal church, and then there was the more, there was Calvary Baptist [Calvary Baptist Church, Muncie, Indiana] and the more, you know kind of genteel type churches.  But Christ Temple, you're talking in tongues.  I mean these are the people that are lower down on the socioeconomic ladder.  There were not a lot of black professionals in Muncie [Indiana], but there were people who had some, you know so-called good jobs.  But they were not, they were not really professional jobs.  I think Muncie had two black doctors, one black dentist.  We had about three black funeral homes.  There was maybe a few handful of black teachers in spite of the fact there was Ball State Teachers College [Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana] there, that the school system in Muncie had a policy of never hiring more than one black a year.  And so (laughter) you know that, that had some impact.  I never had a black teacher all my years in Muncie.
Speaker 1: So at Garfield [Garfield Elementary School, Muncie, Indiana] no, no, okay, it was all white (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, there was no black teachers.  All white teachers at Garfield, at Wilson [Wilson Junior High School, Muncie, Indiana] and at Muncie Central [Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana].
Story_ID: 466223
Speaker 1: So how were the teachers, how did they treat you then?  That's what--I mean you talk about some in the book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story Of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams], but I, I don't know if I thought they were all white.  I wasn't sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah they're all white.  You know some of them really liked me.  I mean like for instance my--the teacher that I had in the fourth grade, he didn't really like me that much, but I was a very good student.  The woman that I had, Miss Newman [ph.] in the fifth and sixth grade, she was terrific.  She really liked me.  In fact she was the woman who told me that I was gonna receive the DAR award, the Daughters of American Revolution award [Daughters of the American Revolution] when I was in the sixth grade.  And Dad [James Williams], you know I, I got a rummage sale suit, you know and I had this blue gabardine suit and I even had--my dad had found a white sport coat to with it, so I'm walking in there with my white sport coat and my blue gabardine pants on, ready to accept the DAR award.  But needless to say, I didn't get the DAR award, in spite of being the, the top student in the elementary school.  What's hilarious about this is a few years later, I go back.  When my book comes out I go back to Garfield Elementary School [Muncie, Indiana] and I have these, this banner's across there, "Welcome Home Dr. Gregory Howard Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams].  We're sorry you didn't get the award" (laughter).  And I said, "This is better," you know 'cause I come in with the NBC cameras to my elementary school.
Speaker 1: So did you--in, in that whole--so you're saying that--okay first of all, I'm trying to understand how are you able to keep focused to have good grades in all of this?  Is it just that you have a natural, you know you're naturally bright and--
Speaker 2: I'm not naturally bright.  I work really hard.  You know I was telling my kids the other day because--about something and I said no, I work and interact with people who are a lot smarter than I am.  But there's been very few people who ever worked, out-worked Greg Williams.  In fact, one of the kids that I grew up with who was really bright.  I mean you know Malcolm X talks about, you know all the talented people who didn't go to school.  This was a young man who was just an absolute whiz in math.  I have no doubt, and I've spent thirty years in higher education.  I have no doubt that he could have received a Ph.D. in high mathematics.  No question in my mind whatsoever, but he dropped out of school.  But, but we were kind of competitors in those early days.  And, and once--I don't know how he discovered it.  But I was working, I was sitting on Miss Dora's [Dora Terry Smith] porch and they wanted me to go someplace with them.  I said, "No, I gotta get this, this math done."  And so Chico [ph.] said to me, he said, "Well Greg I thought you were smart, but you just work hard." (Laughter) I said, "Yeah, I'm not smart, I just work hard."  And so that's what I did and so to a certain extent, it also was a way to keep me out of the mainstream.  I didn't--I could avoid other things.  I could avoid confrontations.  And if I was working and, you know, focused on what I wanted to do.  On the other hand I liked you know, and I believe what my dad said to me.  We stood there on that railroad tracks and my dad said right in front of 601 1/2 Railroad Street.  He said "Greg, you've got the ability to change your life.  But it's only gonna come through education.  You have to get as much education as you can."  And so my dad was an incredible salesman, and I believed him.  And so I was gonna do everything I could to change my life to get back to the lifestyle that I knew existed.  That I had seen a piece of in Virginia.  I didn't wanna go back to Virginia, but I wanted to go back to the types of things where I had enough money to live on.  I didn't have to worry about where the next meal was coming from.  I didn't have to worry about if I had holes in my shoes or holes in the seat of my pants.  That I wanted to be able to have, you know, economic situation to be able to do what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Now what subjects did you gravitate to?
Speaker 2: Well I loved history.  You know again my MacArthur [Douglas MacArthur], war, I mean that was my--I loved, absolutely loved history.  I was a pretty good student in, in math.  I was a kind of mediocre student in science.  But history and literature.  I read books.  In fact, they--I went to this little library right next to Garfield Elementary School and I spent a lot of time there.  And you know and my teacher when I was in about the fifth or sixth grade, every time, every time we would go to the library, we'd have the class picking out books and I would pick out, you know, three or four books.  And the teacher would single me out and, and remark to the rest of the class, says, "Do you see the books that Gregory is picking out?  These are incredible books he's picking out."  And I loved reading biographies.  I mean I read about, you know, George Washington Carver who had nothing.  I read about [President] Abraham Lincoln, you know and I, and I felt my life kind of resonated with people who had absolutely nothing but--and I drew, I drew a lot of sustenance from that.  Years later actually when they were getting ready to close down that library in my hometown, there was a kind of a plea to keep it open.  And part of the plea to keep it open was you know around the community, say remember this is the library where Greg Williams studied.
Story_ID: 466224
Speaker 1: I'm just wondering how--so some of the teachers were encouraging. You got that--
Speaker 2: Some of them were encouraging (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Encouraging.
Speaker 2: --right, yes, and some of them were not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have the--were there--was there any tracking of students back then?  Do you know if there was--were you on a track or--
Speaker 2: Yes, there was tracking of students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was tracking of students.  Well first of all what happened, and I didn't realize it when I was in elementary school [Garfield Elementary School, Muncie, Indiana].  My brother had fallen off the fire escape.  And so the principal, you know he banged his head up and was bleeding, everything like that.  The principal drove him home and we were living at 1001 South Monroe Street at that time, which is my Aunt Bess' [Bess Pharris] place.  So it was very early on.  And so Mike [Mike Williams] was showing him the way home and so Aunt Bess apparently was standing out front when the principal drove up and, and said, Mike said, "Well this is the place."  He said--principal said, "No, you don't live here."  He said, "Yeah I do live here."  He said, "No, no you don't live here, you don't live with that colored woman."  And Mike said, "Yeah, that's my Aunt Bess."  And so you know he finds out that that is where he lives.  So apparently the principal goes back and the W for race that my dad [James Williams] had put on there is crossed out with a C for colored that's put on there.  And then, I assume it's the principal, then there was a note that was appended that said well, the boys are--what's, how to phrase, something like the boys are--even though the boys appear white, they are colored, which was the terminology that everybody used.  It said and that they live--actually I guess at that time we lived with Miss Dora [Dora Smith Terry] because actually he took him home to Aunt Bess, but we lived with Miss Dora.  It said they live with Dora Terry who they claim is no relation to them.  I mean, you know I would have claimed a relationship, but I was being, I guess it was the--even the little lawyer in me at the time, even though she saved our lives.  I mean said well she's not really related to us, but she's taking care of us.  But they had that note appended that followed me through the rest of my school career in Muncie [Indiana].  And, and only when I was ninth grade getting ready to go to high school, I had--the only time I ever talked to a guidance counselor, was this guidance counselor, Ms. White [ph.].  And that is her name.  I mean I (laughter) couldn't make up a better name.  Ms. White calls me in and she had heard that I was trying to date these white girls and she was saying, said, "Well you know that's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable in my time, it's gonna be unacceptable in your time as well.  And so you know you have to stay with your own people.  And you don't be dating these white girls.  In fact, when you go to high school at Central High School [Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana], you need to go around and tell all your teachers about your problem."  And (laughter) I'm thinking to myself well this is the last thing that I'm going to do is gonna be going around talking to my teachers at Central High School about my problem.  But she has a place of infamy in my book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams].
Speaker 1: Right. Well guidance counselors often have places in infamy.
Story_ID: 466225
Speaker 1: Your father is stressing education, but there's also negative messaging going on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So how do you--what are you--how are you filtering that?  You know, because there's a lot of negative messages (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There's a lot of negative messages, there's a lot of negative messages and--
Speaker 1: Does it--isn't there you're not gonna amount to anything?
Speaker 2: Well it was more directed towards my brother [Mike Williams] than it was to me.  Now my dad did have a lot of confidence in my ability and I think one of the reasons for that was that I would be a kid that would disagree with him.  Once we got back to Muncie [Indiana] and once he kind of let us down, Greg Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] became very doubtful about Buster [James Williams].  But you know, he could always weave a good story for me and really convince me--I guess I wanted to be convinced as well.  But, but there were negative messages and he was certainly not supportive.  He was not the father he should have been.  He was drunk most of the time.  Even if he did have a job, he would lose--this was time in which he lost all his money gambling and Miss Dora [Dora Terry Smith] would send us down to place, this one place that we knew that he would go on Saturday after he got paid by city hall and try to get down to this place before he lost all of his money.  And so I'm walking in there, you know really a timid kid with all these old guys in there trying to take all my dad's money away from him and get him drunk.  You know, "Say Buster, hey take another drink."  Because once he was drinking, he was not gonna be sharp and he was gonna lose the money.  And so I'm there trying to get money from my dad and, and these guys are growling at me to get out of there.  What the hell am I doing there?  And I'm just trying to get enough money to, to live next week.  So I became very disappointed and disillusioned with my dad.  Although I loved him and cared about him.  But he really let us down.  So I realized that--and Miss Dora wanted to be supportive, but you know but she, you know she was--had limited abilities to kind of give us the help and guidance and she was doing the best she could.  So it just--it devolved to me.
Story_ID: 466226
Speaker 1: I remember you saying she wasn't--these are not the exact words, but she wasn't emotionally avail- I mean she, she was caring but to a point. She wasn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she was caring.  You know I mean and she cared about us, I have no doubt about that.
Speaker 1: She wasn't demonstrative.
Speaker 2: She wasn't really demonstrative.  My mother was certainly have not been demonstrative as well.  But I mean she cared about us.  But she was, you know she didn't put her arm around my shoulder, but I mean if I needed help, she would, she would always be there.  I never, I never had to worry about that.  But she was not really demonstrative.  I don't think she really realized what we were going through.  I was very reluctant to share that with her because you know I didn't wanna tell her how much I missed my mother [Mary Williams]; how much I missed my sister [Rita Chiles] and brother [Rick Williams (ph.)].  Because she'd been there when everybody else had left us.  And so why--I'm not gonna tell her that well you know I appreciate what you're doing, but I really miss my family.  And so I didn't want to, I didn't wanna make her feel bad because of all the sacrifices that she had made for us.  And she made enormous sacrifices for us.  And what's really interesting about it is that the church [Christ Temple Apostolic Faith Church; Christ Temple Global Ministries, Muncie, Indiana], all these brothers and sisters in the church, they were not supportive of her.  They would come and say, "Well what are you doing taking these two little white boys in?  They've got the grandmother [Sallie Higginbotham Williams] and they've got a father.  They're just drunks.  They should be taking care of these kids themselves, and why you old widow woman, you know, not making any money.  Why are you taking this on?"  And I remember when ultimately she got married when I was about in the tenth grade [at Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana].  And so I remember sitting in the other room, sitting in the kitchen, listening her, her fiance talk to her.  And he, he--his wife had died, actually it was her best friend's husband and he--the woman had died, Nettie [ph.] had died.  And so A.D. Smith [ph.] was there and said, "Well I don't understand why you're taking care of these boys."  Again, you know, they got somebody to take care of 'em.  And I remember her saying, I remember hearing this.  She said, "Look A.D., those boys were here when you got here, and they gone be here when you're gone.  And if you can't handle that, then there's no reason for us to get married."  Now what was interesting about that is she was about ready to retire.  She had no income.  I mean she was gonna get maybe a little social security check.  But by being married to A.D., and that was his--that's the thing he had to offer.  Is if she was his wife, she would get his social security the rest of her life after A.D. died.  And so she was willing to give that up if it came down to us or that social security check, or then, or the retirement check that she was gonna be able to get.  I thought whoa, this is the woman who believes in me.  And actually as ironically, I remember coming home one day after I was playing basketball.  And I saw all the church elders in front, and I saw the morticians, kind of the ambulance or what do you call, the hearse.  I saw the hearse in front of the house.  And I said my God, I hope Miss Dora [Dora Terry Smith] has not died.  And so I walk in there and you can't believe the relief when I saw her setting up and A.D. had died.  You know I said thank you, Jesus because it was, it would have been very hard for us.  'Cause that meant we would go back to the alley.  'Cause 601 1/2 Railroad Street was really right on the all-.  I said we go back to the alley, who knows what would happen to us.  But so she was right, we were there when A.D. got there and we were there when he left.

Speaker 1: I made his game weak because he was trying, he was trying to be accepted in the black community, you know just kind of being this very light skinned kid there.  And so here I come along and I'm the whitest thing in the neighborhood.  And so here he is, you know sometimes we would, they--when we'd go play basketball, then it was in friendly and just--we'd walk on the basketball court in the, you know in the, in the neighborhood.  And people would say, "Well here come the white boys."  So, but we're both great basketball players, so we were always on, on the teams.  But--
Speaker 2: Well did you guys talk about how you felt (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know we never really talked about that.
Speaker 2: Men (laughter).
Speaker 1: I mean we never talked about that.  But I mean we felt this bond, but we never talked--but we talked about it a lot today.  And we talked about a lot more in college because Brian ultimately, you know kind of like I did with Miss Dora [Dora Terry Smith].  He, he--Miss Bernice [Bernice Settles], we called her Miss Bernice, she liked to be called Mrs. Settles, she was one of the few black professionals.  She was a, a librarian at the public library because she couldn't get a job teaching in the high school [Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana].  But he, you know disavowed any interest.  And he knew that he and his sister Vicki [Vicki Settles], both of 'em were adopted.  Disavowed any interest in finding his mother or father.  And it wasn't until later years that he did, he did find his mother and so we had a lot of conversations about it.  But as kids growing up, we, we knew we shared that bond.  You know we knew we both had white mothers.  And but we never, we never really talked about, but we were close.  I mean you go back to Muncie [Indiana] now, anyone will say too close people--the closest person to Greg Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] is Brian Settles and vice versa.  So we spent a lot of time together, but it was not--you know it was not something that we, that we really talked about a lot.
Speaker 2: And he was the better--he was better in sports than you, even though you were good (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was better in sports, right.  He was better in sports.  He was a natural athlete, and, and of course he had the nutrition that I didn't have.  I mean I'd go over their house and eat from time to time, but, but he was better in sports than I was.  Although we played--I was the quarterback on the football team, he was the end on the football team.  He was the starting forward on the basketball team, I was the, I was the guy who came in to relieve him on the basketball team.  But no he was an incredible athlete and he got--he had a lot of problems in high school as, as I talk about, and a lot of issues that he's, that he's dealt with.
Story_ID: 466228
Speaker 1: So who's influencing you in your teenage years, then?  That's what I'm-like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it's really interesting.  I think it's Miss Dora [Dora Terry Smith] of course
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: in terms of this very moral, the moral compass.
Speaker 1: And you're learning through church [Christ Temple Apostolic Faith Church; Christ Temple Global Ministries, Muncie, Indiana]. You have--
Speaker 2: Learning through church.  My dad, my dad really did as well.  My dad, you know my dad had a basic belief in fair play and honesty.  And so that was part of the moral fiber.  Mrs. Settles [Bernice Settles] did as well.  And so I got in a group of, of boys that really had aspirations.  Brian [Brian Settles] you know, Settles--actually he became one of the first black fighter pilots in Vietnam, and actually he's writing a book about it.  One of these days you might want to interview Brian because that's a incredible experience that he had in Vietnam.  So it's Brian Settles, it was Melvin Jolly, it was Carl Brown who had lost his father, I was talking about earlier.  And so the four of us really became a clique together where we, now we shared aspirations and talked about school and--but there was a lot of people in the neighborhood too that were very supportive.  I remember, you know my dad would always go around when I'd get my grades, go around to the bars and show everybody.  "Well look, Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] got an A plus, plus in this course."  So it wasn't too long--by my teenage years, I would have some of these, some of these older, you know, black men and women in the neighborhood who would greet me by saying, "Hello Congressman, how are you doing?"  Even my Aunt Bess [Bess Pharris] and, and Aunt Lucy and others say, "Well Greg you know when you're president, you're gonna invite us to the White House [Washington, D.C.]."  And so people really did start to believe in me and my achievements.  And so that really reinforced my belief of well you know I--maybe I can do some of these things and I really have to do it.  And so there was a, a lot of, a lot of people that were very supportive of my desire to, to be the best student that I could because they saw possibilities out there.  In fact, you know the thing that surprised me about this.  When my book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams] came out and I was interviewed on Tom Brokaw, on 'Dateline.'  I got a--I received a call from Miss Dora's nephew, who I'd not seen or talked to for forty years.  And he said, "Greg, I'm so glad to hear you and I read your book and you talk about Miss Dora because you were always her boys."  He said, "But you'll never r- you never knew that once you--she came down to Arkansas one summer," and she would take two weeks off and go down to Arkansas.  We would be in Muncie [Indiana] by ourselves and, you know, taking care of the house, keeping Dad out of the house.  And 'cause he always wanted to have a party and everything like that and just totally irresponsible.  He said, "But she came down there once and I said--," and he said, "Greg you probably couldn't have been more than thirteen or fourteen years old.  And I remember what she said to me.  She said, 'Joseph [ph.], I wanna tell you one thing.  Mark my words on this.  That one of these days Greg Williams is gonna be a great man.'"  And I was just floored that somehow or another she saw that you know I had a lot of interest and a lot of ambition and the ability to, to achieve those things even when I had nothing.
Speaker 1: You know it's interesting because you know that was a phenomenon in the black community about, you know, people identifying.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And raising them up.  So--but at the same time, people--you weren't affected because your father was the town drunk, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the town drunk.
Speaker 1: Right.  So it wasn't--you weren't affected in that--I mean it's a very--okay.  I mean different people handle things different, or maybe--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I always think about what was it--first of all it was again being Mr. Responsible and saying okay, I'm in charge of this, what happens here.  I'm trying to be--in fact oftentimes when I go back to Muncie and I talk with people, and they would say, they'd say to me, "Well Greg, you were the daddy.  You raised both Buster [James Williams] and Mike [Mike Williams]."  And I felt just incredible responsibility.  And in fact after leaving Muncie, I remember I saw a friend in Washington [D.C.] and she said, "Greg, you look like the weight of the world has been lifted from your shoulders because you don't have to take care of your brother and your father any longer."  And, and so there was that feeling, the responsibility of trying to do the best I could to keep this family unit all together.
Story_ID: 466229
Speaker 1: Was there a longing in you to be white ever?  You know, I mean was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well at times there was because that was an easier life for me and I knew, you know, what that was like when I was in, in Virginia.  And actually that's what my dad [James Williams] really, you know, my dad preached to me.  He said look, you might have to live in the ghetto, but you don't have to subsist on its food.  And one of these days you can do whatever you wanna do.  And, and basically in essence my dad wanted me to be white.  Wanted me to kind of leave Muncie [Indiana] and never look back and to be part of that, that white community, which is the only place where he found success.  And so yeah, and so that, you know that had a lot of appeal to me.  You know, you know, at various times.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the whole thing.  But here you have, you know you're, you're of age, you know, puberty.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You're attracted to girls, but there's--you can't really, you know you're identified as black.  So it's sort of forbidden.  You know you're aware of all that going, going on.
Speaker 2: Right, I mean you know, and I would be--first of all I was not supposed to be dating white girls.  That was clear from the school.  And if I would be dating black girls, if I was walking down the street with a black girl, and this happened a number of times.  We're going to a movie or going to a dance or something like that.  Cars would kind of, you know, people would slow down and yell, you know, racial epithets at us as we were walking down the street.  So I mean I'm just (laughter)--situation, I mean what, you know, what's this all about?  That's the reason why I played basketball fifteen hours a day and did my homework.
Story_ID: 466230
Speaker 1: But you're thinking that you wanna go on to college, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: But you're not--no one--
Speaker 2: My dad [James Williams] made that clear.  I mean there was just never any question I was gonna go to college.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Had no idea how that was gonna happen.
Speaker 1: And there's that whole story about you getting in that math, you know, fighting really to get into that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Getting into that, right, exactly, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The math class.  But what, what--but you did--no one was cou- counseling you on how you apply to school.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Even though your father had.  He had, he had--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he didn't--Dad didn't counsel me.  Dad didn't, you know he'd forgotten all that and, and then no counselors.  I mean in spite of being--I ranked out of something like--when I went to high school [Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana]--had a thousand students in there and I think I ranked about, you know fifty first out of a thousand students academically.  And I graduated I think I was, I don't know, out six hundred students who graduated, so we had a huge dropout rate.  I was, I was about sixtieth in there.  I was in, I think I was in the top ten.  But that may have been, I may have been fiftieth, I don't remember where I was in it, but I was really at the top.  I should have been in the advanced honors program.  But I was not.  Actually a program we called the Shakespeare English class, I wasn't in that class.  I had the highest grade point average on all of the teams, on the football team, the basketball team, even though they were some pretty smart kids on those teams.  But no one ever counseled me about going to college.  Just, just no one.
Speaker 1: So you didn't understand that you had to apply.
Speaker 2: I didn't understand that I had to apply.  I thought it just was gonna happen and, and then it kind of hit me my senior year.  You know my senior year I said well I even graduated, I said well I'm going to college.  Well what do I need to do?  And while I had a good grade point average, I didn't do well on the, on the SAT exams.  But so then it just kind of--'bout the early part of the summer, there was this one--the, the father of one of my fellow football coaches that used to be a football coach in Muncie [Indiana] had talked to me about playing football at Ball State [Ball State College; Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana].  And so he got me a summer job out there and I worked on the grounds making something like a dollar fifty an hour.  Up to that time, I'd been making about seventy-five cents an hour as a dishwasher with the--at the fast food place where my dad was also the night janitor and I was working as a dishwasher at the place.  And so I went out and applied to Ball State and was admitted to the college, but I, you know I'd always had fancy--the idea I was going to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] or someplace like that.  But--and I, I think I may have, I may have sent off for some applications.  I do--actually I think I remember sending off for some applications.  I do remember that after I graduated from Ball State and I was still living at home to send off for law school applications as well, but you know--
Speaker 1: But tell me about the four boys.  Where did they end up, your--the friends?  Where did they end up?
Speaker 2: Well Brian Settles ended up at Ball State.  He had a knee injury.  He would--he had numerous offers to go to Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.], to Michigan State [Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science; Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and other schools, but he had this knee injury.  And then there was a hazing incident that got him kicked off the basketball team.  So he ended up at Ball State with me, and then ultimately graduated from Ball State.  Then went into the [U.S.] Air Force, was I said, one of the first black fighter pilots.  Got a master's degree from Southern Cal [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] when he was stationed at the University of California Riverside [Riverside, California].  Melvin Jolly went to DePauw [DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana] on a basketball scholarship, but there was a lot of racism down there at DePauw, which you know of course Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] talks about it in his book 'cause he went to DePauw as well.  And so Melvin transferred back to Ball State and then got his master- his bachelor's [degree], and then a master's, and then was a teacher for many years in the Detroit [Michigan] public school system.  Actually he went to the Air Force and he was doing ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  Brian was an airline pilot after getting out of the, out of, out of Vietnam.  Carl [Carl Brown] went to play basketball at--got a scholarship, played basketball New Mexico Highlands [New Mexico Highlands University, Las Vegas, Nevada] and was down there for a couple of years, and then came back and I think he graduated from Ball State as well.  And he's living in Tennessee these days.  So all, all four of 'em, we, we all graduated from college.
Speaker 1: So now did you--so you're at Ball State, were, were--now you and Brian entered the same--no--
Speaker 2: We entered the same time, yes.
Speaker 1: The same time, okay, just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, both the fall of 1962, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And, but did you finish the same time?
Speaker 2: No, actually I finished in four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Brian I think took an extra semester or something like that.  Because our--you know the Greg Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] plan was four years, get this job done.
Story_ID: 466231
Speaker 1: Even though I went to summer schools and I was also working forty hours a week as a deputy sheriff because I got hired as a deputy sheriff.  And so I was working the afternoon shift from three 'til eleven which meant usually if I got a call after nine o'clock at night, I wasn't gonna be home 'til one or two o'clock in the morning.  And, but I carried something like seventeen hours a quarter and graduated in four years.  So that's what I can tell these students at City College [City College of New York, New York, New York], that I know it's hard.  But I know it can be done.
Speaker 2: So you, you were the youngest sheriff that they had had.
Speaker 1: I was the youngest in the State of Indiana--I was nineteen years old.  Actually I was so young, they couldn't put me out on the road.  So I was in charge of the jail at the time I started.  And actually, we usually had a pretty semi-permanent population in jail, about seventy or eighty people.  When I started there, I knew at least half of them and I'd grown up with them.  And so I took some of them to state prison.  I--they were playmates of mine and some of them were older guys who used to buy ice cream cones for me and my brother [Mike Williams] when we first arrived in Muncie [Indiana].  They were there for crimes like murder and rape and robbery and people that I'd grown up with.
Speaker 2: Now did your--remember there had been that concern that your father might bring an element, or you know he would, you know, how would you be objective if your father, you know, (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.  The sheriff said to me, he said, he said, "Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams], I'm willing to hire you, but I cannot have your dad around this jail drunk."  And, and so I went to my dad and I had a conversation with him.  And, and you know he knew when I was serious.  I said, "Dad, this is my opportunity.  This is the way--" 'cause I had finished that first year and run out of money.  I had no money.  I'd finished my freshman year at Ball State [Ball State College; Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana], I had something like a 3.5 grade point average, and I was washing dishes in the hospital on the weekends, doing janitorial work at the college.  But making seventy-five cents an hour and tuition was a hundred dollars a quarter and I did not have that and I didn't have any way to get that money.  And so this job came up as a possibility of me being a deputy sheriff.  And so I went to Dad and I said, "Dad, this is the only chance I have.  I cannot afford you making me lose this chance.  And the sheriff has made it clear if you hang out at the jail, that, that I'm gonna lose this job.  And I wanna tell you if I find you at the jail drunk, I'm going to arrest you and I'm gonna put you in jail.  So I want that to be very clear to you; I will do that."  And you know my dad (laughter), my dad believed me.  And he should have believed me 'cause it was absolutely right.  I would have done it.  So that didn't mean he stopped drinking.  He didn't get arrested, and I'm sure some deputies probably saw him drunk and you know kind of gave him a break.  I have no doubt about that.  He would go to Anderson [Indiana] and New Castle [Indiana] and Richmond [Indiana] and other places and get drunk.  And I remember once I was setting in the jail one night.  It was about, I think it was about nine or ten o'clock.  And they called over from Anderson, Madison County Jail [Anderson, Indiana] and said, "Is there a Deputy Greg Williams there?"  And, and I was, I said yes.  He said--well actually I wasn't on the radio, someone gave it to me.  Said I'm supposed to call Madison County Jail.  So I called Madison County Jail.  And so they say, "There's a man here in the drunk tank that says he's your father.  His name's James Williams."  I said, "Yes, that's my father."  And they said, "Well we need to--he's got, he's been arrested for public intoxication and he's got this fine," I think, you know fifteen or twenty-five dollars or whatever.  And I said, "Well can I come and get him after I get off?"  I said, "I don't get off 'til eleven o'clock at night."  And he said, "Well generally we don't release people that late, but since you're a deputy in Muncie, we will, we'll let you come."  So I go over there, you know after I get off, and I'm steaming because I've got class the next day.  It's about, you know it's after midnight.  I'm driving to Anderson to get my dad out of the drunk tank.  And so first of all they weren't gonna do it, but then--'cause I went to one place to pay the fine, then go to the jail.  And so then I have all my uniform back on 'cause I'd taken my uniform off, put my uniform back on with my gun and everything like that.  So I walk in there in full regalia and say, "Well I'm here to pick up, you know, Buster Williams."  And so he said, "Well I can't do that."  So this is, this is now about two o'clock in the morning.  Said, "Well I have to get the sheriff."  They call the sheriff for Madison County [Indiana] to wake him up.  And I talk to the sheriff, I said, "Sheriff I'm really sorry about this.  But Dad was drunk, I'm going to Ball State.  This is the only time I could get over here to take him back."  He said, "Okay well you have to go in, you gotta go in with the deputy," because the deputy was there by himself because everybody else was out patrolling, all the other deputies were out patrolling around Madison County.  So I go in and they open the bullpen there and I'm standing there, you know, in my hat and my guns and everything like that.  And so I hear the conversation.  Said, somebody said, "Who's that new deputy?  Who's that new deputy?"  Referring to me.  And so I hear this voice at the back, it's this voice kind of come, comes to the front, it says, "That's my son, that's my son."  So my dad (laughter), my dad comes out and, and so we go out, we get in the car.  Said, he said, "I wanna stop and get a drink."  I said, "Look there is no drinks in this car.  You are going back to Muncie and I'm dropping you off at Grandma's [Sallie Higginbotham Williams] and that's it."  And so I took him back home.

Speaker 1: What did you learn with that job?
Speaker 2: What did I earn?
Speaker 1: Learn, learn.
Speaker 2: Learned.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I learned how to deal with crisis situations.  I learned how to be in a situation where you were in charge and you had to make a decision.  I remember my first case that I was on by myself was a domestic violence situation where this husband and wife who'd been married about thirty years were, were in a fight and actually the wife had called and I went out there.  And so I go out there and this husband says, "Are you married?"  I said, "No I'm not."  He said, "Have you ever been married?"  I said, "No I haven't."  And I was, you know, just twenty-one years old at the time.  He said, "Well you can't understand this situation."  I said, "Well that may be true that I may not understand this situation.  But I'm in charge of it and there's not gonna be any violence here.  And so you're going with me, whether you like that or not."  And you know so I learned how to take charge of situations.  I learned how to deal with crisis, which actually has been very important in my work.  I was at the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] in 1991 when, November, when five people were murdered on the University of Iowa campus and I was associate vice president of academic affairs.  So you know a lot of the police training I had dealing with crisis situations came into play there.  I had been president of City College [City College of New York, New York, New York] only six weeks when we had 9/11 [September 11, 2001], and so I had to deal with that, had to deal with the campus really in crisis and concern about that.  So I learned a lot of things as a deputy sheriff dealing.  I learned also that I could not arrest everyone that I thought should be arrested; that I had to figure out ways to deal with problems and solve those problems without using the, the power of arrest and authority that I had.
Speaker 1: Now why was that?
Speaker 2: Well you just can't--
Speaker 1: That make, that makes sense, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can't fill the jails.  You can't take everybody to jail.  You gotta make some decisions, you gotta make some discretions.  In fact, ultimately I wrote a book on police discretion, police decision making as to kind of how you make those decisions as to who you will arrest and who you won't arrest.  Now of course one of the takes on that is we know in the past race played a large role in who was gonna get arrested and who wasn't going to get arrested.  And so, you know that was something that I was very sensitized to as a kid growing up and seeing the way that police dealt with, you know, folks in my neighborhood.  And then also when I was a deputy sheriff [in Muncie, Indiana], seeing how city police officers, even some people in my own department, dealt with this.  Although when I was there, I think I made a difference in how people were treated and things were not acceptable.  And fortunately the sheriff who I worked for was a guy who believed in even handed treatment, even though he was a very conservative Republican.
Story_ID: 466233
Speaker 1: The other thing, we're in 1964, '65 [1965] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we're--I was deputy sheriff in, in--from '63 [1963] to '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay, so in this, in, in Muncie [Indiana] it's not like the Civil Rights Movement is, you know, is it having a great affect?
Speaker 2: It's having some impact, but still there's these places that are segregated (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Conservative pockets.
Speaker 2: You know you still could--I mean to give you some idea, I was a deputy sheriff and I was taking up golf.  You know I wasn't interested--the sheriff gave me his golf clubs.  He had bought a new set of golf clubs, so they had this one deputy, this white deputy that--there was a public course and there was a couple of private courses.  There was the Green Hills [Green Hills Country Club; Cardinal Hills Golf Course, Muncie, Indiana]--and there's the Delaware Country Club [Muncie, Indiana], which was exclusive, private club, whites only.  But actually the Green Hill, Green Hills Club was established because the Delaware Country Club would exclude Jews.  And so they started their own club.  So I'm out there playing golf at the Green Hills Country Club, which had been built because of exclusion.  And, you know, having a pretty good time.  And then this deputy that I'm with who's there, he comes to me about a week later, and we had a great time out there.  He said--I said, I said, "Gary [ph.], when we're gonna go back and play some more?"  He said, "Well Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] people saw you on the course and told me that I was not allowed to bring you back to the, to the country club."  And I'm thinking now what is, what is this all about?  I knew what it was about.
Speaker 1: Right.  So did you become part of the community in a elevated manner sort of through being deputy sheriff?  Or you were--this was sort of a means to an end and you were in school and--?
Speaker 2: Well it was a means to an end, but I did become kind of elevated to a certain extent because there was one black deputy sheriff, that was me.  And there was something like on the city police department, there were about a hundred officers, and maybe there were about ten black officers.  So basically the eleven of us were black law enforcement in Muncie.  And so people knew me.  Actually, people always knew me.  I stood out in the crowds.  You know being the, the white looking boy in the middle of this, you know, black crowd.  But they always knew me, but this kind of gave me a, another element of, of respect and in, in, particularly in the black community.
Story_ID: 466234
Speaker 1: Now when you graduate [from Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana], can you describe graduation that day?
Speaker 2: The, the college graduation?
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Because high school graduation was your, your--you didn't have your father [James Williams]--you had Ms. Do- he sort of came at the end (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Showed up, he came at the end.  Dad showed up at the end and, and so you know that was a, a little depressing.  College graduation was a little depressing as well.  Dad came out for the graduation, and so he and I were there.  And Sara [Sara Whitney Williams] who I'd been dating, but we had broken off, she was there.  And we, the three of us went out to dinner.  The--I was gonna leave Muncie [Indiana] and--to go to law school is what I wanted to do.  And so actually I had, I had, had been talking with my mother [Mary Williams] and I was gonna see them and maybe spend some time with them in Virginia, 'cause they were living in Virginia at that time.  And so Dad really got kind of mad at me because it said Gregory Howard Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams], and it had my, my home as Annandale, Virginia because I had put their address down 'cause that's where I wanted them to send the diplomas and everything like that.  So it was kind of a, it was gonna be kind of a white phase of my life to a certain extent.  And so--
Speaker 1: Well you were following your father's instructions.
Speaker 2: I was, I was really didn't go in that, but what I was trying to do was to try to have a connection with my mother and with my sister and brother [Rick Williams (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I hadn't really bought into all of the rest of it.
Story_ID: 466235
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But Sara [Sara Whitney Williams] now, where's Sara's fitting in the thing because Sara you had met, she was white (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had met in high school [Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana], you know and we had dated clandestinely in high school and people really were mean to her, you know.  She'd be walking down the halls and people would spit on her and they'll call her family late at night saying, you know, your daughter's dating this, you know, N. And, and so that was really hard and ultimately we did kind of separate and went our own ways.  And I thought when I left Muncie [Indiana] that I would never really see her again.
Speaker 1: You mean after you graduated (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After I graduated, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 466236
Speaker 1: And then what happened with--so tell--your mother [Mary Williams] had come back in your life.
Speaker 2: My mother had come back in my life after that, right, yes.
Speaker 1: But no, but she had come right around--after high school graduation.
Speaker 2: After high school [Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana], I was a deputy sheriff and her sister had died, actually.  And so my dad [James Williams] called me and said it was her oldest sister, and said you know your mother's gonna be in Muncie [Indiana].  And I said well how do you know that?  Said she was very close to Esther [ph.] and, and so I, I didn't pay any attention to that.  But then a couple days later I get this call at the jail from one of my uncles, my, one of my mother's, my mother's oldest brother, actually.  And he said, "Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams], your mother's in town and she wants to know whether or not you would be willing to meet with her."  And I was hot 'cause we hadn't heard from her for well over a decade.  I was angry and, and she sai- he said, "Well she'd like to meet with you and Mike [Mike Williams]."  And I said, "Well, I don't know.  I will talk to Mike and see what Mike wants to do."
Story_ID: 466237
Speaker 1: I go to Washington [D.C.] after graduation [from Ball State Univeristy, Muncie, Indiana] and start (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No we, no, we were talking about your mother [Mary Williams].
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE: Your mom's coming--
Speaker 2: Your mother came.
Speaker 1: My mother came, right, yeah my mom came.  And so I didn't--I was not, I was not--I was almost ready to say no, I don't wanna see you.  'Cause I was angry.  I mean what is this now?  I mean my feeling is I've made it.  I mean I have, I have survived the worst that Muncie [Indiana] could throw at me.  I'm gonna graduate from college, I'm doing well.  Why are you coming back in my life now?  I needed you a long time ago and you weren't there for me.  And so I was, you know I was pretty angry about that.  But I talked to Mike [Mike Williams], and Mike really wanted to see her and you know and I kind of wanted to see her as well.  And so I called and said okay, we'll come and see you.  And so we went to my brother--my--her brother's house and that was where we kind of reunited.  And I remember her standing out there, you know I--first time I saw her, I remember she was a tall, attractive looking woman as a kid.  Now when I was--you know last time I'd seen her, I was nine years old.  Although later on she tries to, tried to say when the book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams] came out, she said well I saw you in all those years.  And I was thinking look, I'm a smart guy and even if I wasn't smart, I would not have forgotten that I saw my mother.  But that's, you know, another whole story.  But you know and I look at this woman, and this is kind of, you know, a woman that's really aged.  Kind of pock, a pock marked face.  She's not attractive.  Her hair is kind of, you know, limp and I almost didn't even recognize her at first.  But then I realized that I was looking at my mother.
Speaker 2: And what, what, what was the conversation like?  It's hard--I mean you don't even know where to begin.  Was, was she, she almost wanted it as if there--no time had passed.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  I mean you know it's the type of thing which ultimately led to the split between us, that is kind of like with her, well did you get the milk while you were out?  It was just like kind of no time had passed and she always act--tried to act like she knew exactly what we were going through and all of those things we had to deal with.  But she never, ever wanted to talk about it.  She never wanted to talk about Miss Dora [Dora Terry Smith].  And she was so angry with me when I called her to tell her my daughter had been born and I said Natalia Dora Williams [Natalia Williams] is in the world.  And she was hot.  But I called Miss Dora, told Miss Dora.  I couldn't have given Miss Dora a million dollars, it wouldn't have made her happier than to name my daughter after her.
Speaker 2: That's wonderful.
Speaker 1: But, but there was not a lot of talking.  There was just, you know, we were all crying and embracing each other and it was a very emotional time.
Story_ID: 466238
Speaker 1: And so she [Williams' mother, Mary Williams] said, "Well I want you guys to come and live with us."  She said, "You know by the way, when we had the divor- divorce that I had the rights to you.  You were in my custody."  I'm thinking what, what the hell is this all about?  She said, "Yeah you know the judge gave me rights and custody of you."  And I'm thinking well I didn't even see the woman, so I don't know what this is all about.  So you're really mine and I want you to come and live with us and I want you to change your name and take you know, the man she had married, his name, 'cause he had adopted the other two children as well.  And so you know I, I flirted with that idea for a minute to say was my life gonna get better, but decided this--I wanted to believe her, you know.  I wanted to believe that, that, that there was a kernel of truth in what she was saying.  That you know my life could get better.  Mike [Mike Williams] is the one that really needed some help.  And so she, she offered for Mike to come and, and live with them and actually he did go and it was just an absolute disaster.
Speaker 2: Now why was it--
Speaker 1: Absolute disaster.
Speaker 2: Because he, his life had spun--wait, let me ask you.  Was, was her--was the family that she had, you know that was there--first of all, the guy she had run off with, was that same--
Speaker 1: He left her, no.  This is a black guy that she ran off with (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A black--right.
Speaker 1: Right, but he left and so she in the--he, he pretty much abandoned her and so she was there with two kids on her own, trying to survive in Washington, D.C.  And I think she had two or three jobs that she was working.  Remember she was a high school dropout.  And so with the--a woman with two kids, it was really, it was hard for her.  I have no qualms about that.  She was doing the best she could.  And my concern was why didn't I hear, you know I mean why is a letter or something like that.  Now she later on said that she sent letters and she sent money to her mother for her mother to give to us.  And as mean as my white grandmother was, I don't think she would be that mean to not give us the money, or not give us the letter.  And she would ne- we knew, we knew our grandmother, white grandmother knew where she was.  And I would ask for her address so I could write to her, but she always refused to give us the address.
Speaker 2: So do you think--so she was messaging to you that you could not--it was the rever- you know reverse of your fa- I mean you couldn't really spill the beans.  Her husband--
Speaker 1: Yeah, her husband didn't know.  See she had maintained the charade with her husband, that her first husband, my dad [James Williams], was Italian.  And so I come into this situation and Mike went in the situation as well.  And of course I mean the, the--her husband, you know would, would make these kind of little racist statements.  And like Mike was telling me once they were--had some coffee and say want some coffee and how do you like it?  He said well I like my coffee black just like I like my women, you know (laughter).  And so you know there would be those little things.  And he was from, he was from Virginia, you know, middle Virginia.  I mean there's not--kind of benign, but you know just the kind of type of thing that was kind of part of how he approached life and the things that he said which--and things which were hurtful, but you know he was totally unconscious of that.  And so my mother had not told him, and so there was that charade that was going on.  And so part of the implicit deal is if we would come and stay with them was that we couldn't, we couldn't spill the beans.  We couldn't tell that you know all this B.S. about being Italian is just B.S.  And that your father really is black and that he really wants to see you.  But you know, so that was part of the deal there and ultimately I decided I just couldn't handle it because she wanted me to be white, and then, and then it was just I really had a conflict about that because then I remember, you know the people like Miss Dora [Dora Terry Smith], like Aunt Bess [Bess Pharris], like Grandma [Sallie Higginbotham Williams], even you know Brian [Brian Settles] and the others who were really such an important part of my life and I couldn't turn my back on the people who had been with me when it was really there was a price they had to pay for being a friend and a colleague and a supporter.  I mean you know it's not something I ever did.  So ultimately we really pretty much split.  I moved out and moved into D.C. and got my own place and you know, started teaching high school and, and getting--working on my master's degree.  And then, and then going to law school [George Washington University Law School, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 466239
Speaker 1: How long were you with her [Williams' mother, Mary Williams]?
Speaker 2: I was with her maybe seven to nine months, something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not very long.  How 'bout Mike [Mike Williams]?
Speaker 2: Mike was with them for about three months, two or three months, max.
Speaker 1: So what was disastrous about that?  Just because his lifestyle was so like counter to what their lifestyle was?  Mike was on the fringes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it was counter, you know Mike had been off on his own.  You know he had been doing these things on his own.  And so--
Speaker 1: Marrying a forty year old woman.
Speaker 2: Right, married a forty year old woman, he's sixteen years old and how do you go, how do you go home again after that?  And then he was there and then--but, and, and Mike, Mike developed a lot of the playground mentality is what it boils down to.  And so that played well in Muncie [Indiana] on the playgrounds, but it didn't play well in this white suburb in Virginia.  And so once my little brother Rick [Rick Williams (ph.)], you know someone--he'd gone--they were living in this apartment complex and so Mike was at the house.  And so Rick comes home crying.  And then so Mike says, "Well why are you crying?"  Said, "Well this, this guy wouldn't let me in."  He said, "He wouldn't let me go swim."  And so Mike said well I'll take care of that.  So Mike swaggers back to the pool and the lifeguard you know tries to be adamant about well you can't swim, you know you need this or that, I don't know, whatever it is.  And he says he's gonna swim whether you like it or not.  And so this guy I think tried to push Mike out of the way, which is the worst thing this guy could ever do 'cause then Mike starts fighting him and breaks his jaw, actually.  And so then once that happens, then the police are called in.  Now Mike is technically over eighteen at that time.  I mean he may be eighteen or nineteen at the time.  But my mother lies about this and says he's seventeen years old and so he's treated in, in juvenile court for breaking this kid's jaw.  And so he, he goes back to--so they, they, they had to get him out of, out of Virginia.  I mean it's just, it's just not gonna work.  So then he's back, he's back to Muncie hanging around, so it was kind of a short period of time.
Speaker 1: Now does your sister and brother--what are they--what is the relationship with them during this, you know, eight to nine, you know, period.
Speaker 2: During that period?  Well they're both at home and I'm there and I'm, I'm spending a little time--
Speaker 1: Do they have any memory of you?
Speaker 2: They do.  They remember their older brothers, that they had big, older brothers and you know that's what my brother fantasized, my little brother fantasized about.  So when kids in the neighborhood would pick on him, he said, "Well I'm gonna get my older brothers after you."  And so--but that's the memories they have.  And they remember--I mean they don't, they don't have a lot of memories because I think when the family split, my sister was probably about six, and my brother was about maybe four or five.  So there's not, there's not a lot, I mean, but they do know we were out there somewhere.
Story_ID: 466240
Speaker 1: Did you ever slip like with your, your, with her husband?  You know was--did anything subconsciously come out that would have, you know, sort of betrayed the fact that you were in a--no.
Speaker 2: No.  But if he'd been smart, he would have listened to what I had to say and because I didn't really hide who my friends were.  For instance, there was one of my buddies was playing professional football at the time with the Los Angeles Rams.  And when he'd come to town, you know I'd call him up, you know and he's wondering well how, how do you know all these people?  I said well I grew up with them.  We were in the same neighborhood.  And so if he really had been adept, you know there were things that I would say that, you know, well you know you just--little white boy is not gonna have these experiences that, that you say that you have.  But, but I never told him the story and, and she [Williams' mother, Mary Williams] didn't want the story to be told.  And so I, I respected her for that, or at least I didn't necessarily respect her, but acceded to her wishes.  I did not want to disrupt that family situation because I knew, I mean the kids were still in--I think they were both in high school by the time I returned.  And so I know what--how disruptive being on your own could be.  And so I did not wish that for them.
Story_ID: 466241
Speaker 1: So you taught, you taught still for ten years, right--?
Speaker 2: No, I taught for--
Speaker 1: Sixty--
Speaker 2: Four years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wait, I'm sorry, sorry, '66 [1966] to '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: Sixty- I taught '66 [1966] to '70 [1970] something like that.
Speaker 1: To '70 [1970], okay.  So you ta- I'm sorry, I was reading it wrong.  So you, you taught and then is Sara [Sara Whitney Williams] in your life at this point?
Speaker 2: Well Sara comes back in my life in, in the late '60s [1960s], around '68 [1968], '69 [1969], something like that.  She had gone off to New York [New York] and was working in New York, and then had gone to Spain for a year and then came back, and then was just kind of driving through to go back to New York City and called me.  And she said she was hoping against hope that I was not yet married.  So (laughter)--and I wasn't.  But I, you know, I wasn't that interested in her, actually.  She was a good friend from, from Muncie [Indiana], but you know we had--our relationship had really ended because she got a lot of pressure from her family and I understood that.  But you know I, I'm--Greg Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] remembers those who stand with him and those who don't.
Speaker 1: That's right. That's right.  So, so did your, your relationship picked up in the--at--while you were still teaching (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, while I was still teaching, right.
Speaker 1: And then--
Story_ID: 466242
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Then, now how did you go from teaching to the, to an aide at the U.S. Senate?
Speaker 2: Well I finished law school.
Speaker 1: So wait a minute.  So you, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I--My first two years of teaching, I was working my master's degree at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland].  The second two years of teaching, I was in law school at night at George Washington University [George Washington University Law School, Washington, D.C.].  And then I went full time for one year, so I graduated in three years in what was supposed to be a four year program.  And going to school summer and really, now this was--I was a driven guy.  And wanted to get this all behind me.
Speaker 1: So now what were you thinking you wanted to--I mean law, law school--let's listen to this, had been your father's [James Williams] dream for you.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense of what kind of lawyer you wanted to be, or you know, or what you know, did certain courses, you know, you take to versus others.
Speaker 2: I did, yeah.  There was--well of course I was--had been a former deputy sheriff, so I was very interested in criminal law, criminal procedure.  And I ultimately became a, a law professor teaching criminal law and criminal procedure.
Story_ID: 466243
Speaker 1: You know I never really had a lot of interest in, in corporate law.  I was more interested in politics.  I saw the law degree take me to politics.  And that's the thing that I really wanted to do.  My dad [James Williams] was I said, you know, active in, in politics when I was growing up in Indiana.  For a few minutes after graduating from law school [George Washington University Law School, Washington, D.C.], I--and actually I worked for this law firm.  My law practice was two weeks that I worked for this law firm.  And--
Speaker 2: Is that after graduation from law school?
Speaker 1: This was after graduation from law school.  I worked for this law firm for two weeks.  And then I was in Washington, D.C. at the time, that's where we were living.  And I was reading this article in the, in the, in The Washington Post, Jack Anderson.  You remember the kind of the muckraker.  And there was an article in the, in The Washington Post, his article, that said that Vance Hartke, the senator from Indiana, had been critical of the Civil Service Commission because there were no blacks in policy making positions on you know, at the Civil Service Commission.  He said but Hartke really you know, needs to be careful about this because there are no blacks in policy making positions on his staff.  And so I saw an opportunity.  So I write to Vance Hartke and I say well I just graduated from law school.  Actually, I, I'd written to Walter Washington about getting a job in Washington, D.C., and he was ready to do it.  And I just, you know, never pursued that.  But I go and I write this letter to Vance Hartke and I said well I just graduated from law school.  I grew up in Indiana and my dad was one of Indiana's first black elected officials.  And almost by return mail, I get a letter from the senator's office to come in and talk with them, and send my resume.  And I did pretty well in law school.  I'd been, you know, I, I was very interested in urban legal poverty, you know urban law and those things, housing for the poor, that type of thing, international human rights were courses that I took and I did pretty well in.  Although again remember I'm working forty to fifty hours a week and carrying full time load in law school.  So I didn't do quite as well overall as I did during the one year that I worked full time, or went to school full time.  So I show up at Hartke's office.  And so I'm sitting out there in the anteroom.  And they're look at the resume and I see the senator and the top aides running back and forth, trying to figure out who's this guy in the anteroom, and who's this guy who wrote us this letter.  You know do they, do they match?  And so finally they decide they match.  And so the first thing they try to do is to try to say well you know, you say you're from Indiana, what kind of connections do you have in the, in the black political community in Indiana?  And so they start throwing out some names.  The first names they throw out is, "Well do you know Benny Grant [ph.] from Gary [Indiana]?"  I said, "Yes, I know him.  In fact Dr. Grant was a classmate of my dad's at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] in 1936."  At that time they, the only black state senator was a guy named Pat, Pat Chavis [Patrick Chavis].  You may remember from constitutional law, there's a case called Whitcomb versus Chavis [Whitcomb v. Chavis, 1971], which deals with multi-member districts in, in the country, particularly in Indiana.  Well what happened was to, to limit the voting power of blacks, what they would do is they would go from single member districts where blacks would be elected, to multi-member districts where blacks had to run at large, which effectively deluded the black vote.  This case went to the Supreme Court of the United States.  Governor Whitcomb [Edgar Whitcomb] of Indiana against Patrick Chavis, who was the named plaintiff on that.  Interestingly enough, when they did that case, Pat Chavis was the Indiana, only Indiana state senator.  But Chavis no longer lived in the inner city.  He had become wealthy and moved to the suburbs.  So they had Chavis as the lead plaintiff in that case.  And then they had some other folks from the inner city of Indianapolis [Indiana].  Well so they asked me, they said, "Well do you know Pat Chavis?"  I said, "Yes I do."  I said, "In fact, last year I was best man at his oldest daughter's wedding."  Brian Settles married Pat Chavis' daughter (laughter).  And so then, and so I got to know Senator Chavis pretty well.  Now Senator Chavis is a big, robust, very, very dark skinned guy.  You know just a kind of a huge presence in the State of Indiana.  So then immediately the sent- senator calls Pat Chavis and says, said--and Chavis related this to me later.  Said, said, "Pat is Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] really black?"  You see now Pat who'd moved from the inner city to the suburbs, said, said, "Vance, Greg is blacker than I am."  'Cause he had changed his whole life.  And so actually they decided that, that I was legitimate and so then I got a job as an aide to Vance Hartke and then handled a lot of his civil rights issues and of course what the senator and I just got a little joke about this because this was the time of busing.  So they would bring--in order to have these white mothers from Jacksonville, Florida and other places, wanna come in to talk to Senator Vance Hartke about being anti-busing.  And of course who did they send out to talk to them?  None other than Greg Williams.
Story_ID: 466244
Speaker 1: How did you enjoy your time on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed it.  Again, it was, you know there was a lot of jockeying for position (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause this is what year?  Let's talk about-
Speaker 2: This is '71 [1971] to '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] had just started, and actually I became close friends with one of Rangel's staff who is now his chief of staff--
Speaker 1: Who's-
Speaker 2: --George Dalley.
Speaker 1: George Dalley, yes.
Speaker 2: And George, although George seems to forget about the times we were there, but I reminded him about a couple of things we did together.  I was--actually and I was accepted among the black staff members.  Actually we formed the first black staff members association called the Pendulum Ink [ph.].  And I was director of communications of the Pendulum Ink, which meant I put out the newsletter.  And so it was a, it was a lot of fun to do that.
Speaker 1: Who was on the Hill that was black then?  I mean there were--
Speaker 2: In terms of, well Gus Hawkins [HistoryMaker Augustus F. "Gus" Hawkins] was there, which actually was a mixed race guy and they were gonna offer me a job with Gus Hawkins because Gus was the, was the chair of the education committee of the House welfare and labor and public welfare committee [House Committee on Education and Labor; House Committee on Education and the Workforce].  I don't--
Speaker 1: Was Shirley Chisholm there?
Speaker 2: Shirley Chisholm was not there, she came later.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: I think Rangel was there.
Speaker 1: Okay and you had Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Conyers was there.  When I was in [U.S.] Senate, so there were no--there was only one black, there's only one black senator.
Speaker 1: That's right, you're in the Senate, okay.
Speaker 2: And that was, you know that was Ed Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And but Birch Bayh was the other senator from Indiana, he had a lot of black staff members that I got to know very well.  In fact one woman that I grew up with was one of my ex-girlfriends from high school [Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana], worked on, on Bayh's staff.  The--so there were a few black congressmen, there were not, there were not a lot.  But there was more and more growing number of black staff members.
Story_ID: 466245
Speaker 1: Did that turn you off towards politics, that experience?  No?
Speaker 2: No it didn't.  Hartke [Vance Hartke], you know it was a great experience working for him.  But he was more interested in, in, in style rather than substance.  I mean he voted the, for the, on the right issues.  But he really didn't really put the, the time and effort in that it took.  So I didn't, I wasn't really turned off on that.  In fact, you know I was very excited about it, but it became clear to me that, that my future was not--my feeling was that you either stayed on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] for two years or twenty years, and I didn't wanna stay there for twenty years.  And actually it was my last year of law school that I really had my goal.  My goal was I wanted to be a law professor.  That's what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: So now who was advising you on this and how did you end up at George Washington [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.] in administra- you know, in administration?  That's--you ended--
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  The--one of my friends, the guy that I had helped hire in Hartke's office, was--had done some teaching, part time teaching at GW [George Washington University] and so there was a community service program that he was familiar with and they were looking for someone to run this community service program, which had offices in Anacostia [Washington, D.C.], you know which is an area that went from something like, you know 90 percent white to 90 percent black in about a decade, and then Adams Morgan [Washington, D.C.], which was a large Hispanic community.  And so they were looking for someone to be the director of it.  And so he came to me one day.  I remember he came to--we were--Sunday, we were living in my--Sara [Sara Whitney Williams] and I were living in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.], Natalia [Natalia Williams] was born.  And, and so one Sunday afternoon he comes barreling down Q Street and stops in front of my house and said, "Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams], I understand this is coming up.  You can teach.  This is an open door for you to kind of teach a service learning course."  And, and then you can get your foot in the door at George Washington.  So then I began that process of, of interviewing at GW.  And again you know I ran into the same problems again.  Well, you know is he black enough?  In fact there's this one famous professor who was at GW, now--
Speaker 1: Who, who is he?
Speaker 2: Steve Wayne [Stephen Wayne].  Actually he's not at GW, he's at Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.], who was an expert on the presidency.  You know who admittedly there was me, and then there was this very obviously black guy from Chicago [Illinois] who was ultimately the two people vying for the job.  And, and Steve said well you know, he really wanted to go for the real black guy.  But ultimately I was hired and head of the project.  And then this project was ranked as one of the most outstanding community service projects in the country.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the project again?
Speaker 2: It was the GW-Washington Project.  And we worked with Anacostia Community Development Consortium.  We had the law school, urban planning, the medical school, school of education, and others doing things in the community (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 466246
Speaker 1: So now was the, was the program [GW-Washington Project] out of the undergraduate, or was the college [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.], or was it out of the--
Speaker 2: Well it was its own special office.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't--we were--we had undergraduate courses and we had you know, graduate courses as well.  It was really through the--great name, the Office of Program Development, and later it became the, what was it--the Office of Experiential Programs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so we had received a mi- a Mellon grant [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Grant.
Speaker 2: --to run this program.
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry was mayor, right?
Speaker 2: No, actually he wasn't mayor at the time.
Speaker 1: Was Walter Wa--
Speaker 2: Walter Washington was still mayor at the time.  And Marion Barry, I met him shortly after I started.  Marion Barry was just running for the school board, beginning his career.  And actually he spent a lot of time in Anacostia [Washington, D.C.] and I met him a few times down there.  I'm sure he would never remember me.  But John Kinard, who was head--I'm sure remember the, the Smithsonian African American museum that's located in Anacostia.  John was a great friend and he died I think a few years ago.  But they--Anacostia Neighborhood Museum [Anacostia Community Museum, Washington, D.C.], and so I, you know, got to meet the people down there and you know again it was a think of kind of you know, coming in, proving myself and showing that I understood what I was all about and that I had the ability to make a difference.
Speaker 1: And then--so you did that for four years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you were--s- would you consider yourself at that point a community activist?  Was it, or was it--now was it--it wasn't really--
Speaker 2: Well it was.  I mean we were the, we were the activists in many respects.  I was--my job was to have the university interact with the community.  And so provide services and resources, and we did that.  For instance give you one example.  We--there was, there was this--Anacostia nei- Anacostia Naval Station, this Bolling--Anacostia Bolling Air Force [Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, Washington, D.C.], or Anacostia Bolling--I think it was a naval station down there in the--I think the [U.S.] Navy had flights in and out of there.  But ultimately, they discovered that the flights, because the increase of flights at National Airport [Washington National Airport; Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Washington, D.C.] was gonna conflict with Anacostia-Bolling, so they could not use that any longer for a, for an airfield.  And so the desire was--it was about five hundred acres of land, maybe a thousand acres of land, actually down there.  And the desire was just to give that land to the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.].  Well at that time, Mendel Rivers [L. Mendel Rivers], very conservative congressman from Georgia, was chair of the House Armed Services Committee and he, you know, basically apparently what was translated to me; he said look, you're not gonna give that land to those people.  And so then he told the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] to find a way to use this land.  And so they were gonna have a little Pentagon, you know, boat people down the Anacostia River to this as kind of the sub-Pentagon.  And we were teaching a course on urban ecology, kind of environment issues in the urban community.  Whereas for instance, the suburbs, we're talking about well should I have two or three air conditioners.  People in the community were saying well can I have a fan?  And so that was of course we were teaching, and what's really interesting how this came up in one of these course that we talked NEPA [National Environmental Policy Act of 1970] statements.  National environmental impact statements.  And so one person said well you know everybody's supposed to file, everybody's supposed to file an environmental impact statement.  And it said what, what about this Anacostia-Bolling?  The government didn't file an environmental impact statement.  So we discovered they didn't file an environmental impact statement.  So we brought in GW Law School [George Washington University Law School, Washington, D.C.] folks to stop this project in its tracks because they had not filed an environmental impact statement, which then meant the negotiations began.  At that time then it was clear, then the fight became for, you know, this land.  And then the city council took over because then, you know, then that became a, a city council issue.  But those are the kinds of things that, that we did.  Our urban regional planning department did studies.  There was--when you did the Metro, there was not gonna be any line into Anacostia.  And still this day I don't think there's a line into Anacostia, but they're supposed to be building one.  And of course that was an area where incredibly high poverty, a lot of women were working in that area who were riding buses to Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] and far northwest to work in the homes up there and they were on the buses.  They couldn't, they couldn't have access to the Metro.  So those are the kinds of things that, that we were involved in, assisting the community.
Story_ID: 466247
Speaker 1: My question is how did you go from doing really an administrative job to going to the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa]?  And I wanna know what was happening there, but you went there to teach, right?
Speaker 2: Well yes and no.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: The job I had at the University of Iowa in essence was an administrative job.  I went there as assistant dean, director of admissions and associate professor of law.  And so the deal that I had with them was that I would do my admissions work, but also teach one course a semester or one course a year, and be on the tenure track to, to become a full professor ultimately.  It was a very hard thing, but you know it was clear to me that was the only way I was gonna get in.  And actually a lot of--that was a route for a lot of African Americans and a lot of other minorities to get into the law school world.  Because I didn't graduate at the top of my class.  And didn't, I didn't go to a great law school.  I mean George Washington [George Washington University Law School, Washington, D.C.] is, is a very good law school in these days (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's a good school.
Speaker 2: But it was, it's not Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], it's not Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], which is where a lot of law schools choose their people from.  And so I had that against me and I was not, as I said, at the top of the class because I was really working and, and pretty much struggling to get through law school.  So I said well this is the--this is what I gotta do.
Speaker 1: Now who was, who was the, who was the president of University of Iowa at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At that time it was Sandy Boyd [Willard L. Boyd] who was just a great guy and was very actively involved with American Bar Association on civil rights issues and just a tremendous guy.  The dean of the law school was a guy by the name of Bill Hines [N. William Hines], who really was incredibly supportive of me and really wanted me to be there.  And you know he--I told him a little bit about my life story and they felt that I was the guy that could do it at the University of Iowa.
Story_ID: 466248
Speaker 1: When I arrived [at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa], we had something like four minority students.  In addition, I was in charge of admissions for the entire law school [University of Iowa College of Law, Iowa City, Iowa], but a special assignment I had was to increase the number of minority students at the law school.  And when I arrived, there was something like four students in that entering class out of 225 students at the law school that year that I arrived.  When I left that ten years later, about 27, 28 percent of the entering class were students of color.
Speaker 2: That's very amazing. How did--
Speaker 1: Well in a state that has less than 2 percent minority population.
Speaker 2: Now that, that's in Du- Du- Du--
Speaker 1: It's in Iowa City [Iowa].
Speaker 2: Iowa City, okay.
Speaker 1: Iowa City, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: And what--okay so how did you go about doing that?
Speaker 1: Just hard work.  I spent a lot of that first year, I didn't teach really that first semester when we were doing recruiting.  And so I would just get in the car and I would go visit schools in Iowa, schools in Illinois, schools in Indiana.  I went, I went to--I visited about seventy-five to eighty different schools.  We had a black faculty member who was head of the library at University of Iowa at the time, a guy by the name of George Strait who incidentally, had been a student at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] the same time my dad [James Williams] was there.  And they shared a lot of the same characteristics, both good and bad.  But so he was helpful to me and a lot of the faculty were helpful as well.  And so it was really a, a lot of effort being out there, meeting the people, convincing them that Iowa was the place that they really wanted to go to pursue their education because Iowa has a great reputation of being open and accessible.  If you look, if you look at a lot of--now I guess they're advanced in years, a lot of blacks in the South who have Ph.D. degrees or other advanced degrees, they received a lot, a lot of them received their degrees at the University of Iowa because it was a school that had that kind of reputation of being open and accessible.  And so James McPherson who is a good friend of mine, was teaching in the Writers' Workshop [Iowa Writers' Workshop] at that time.  And Jim would do recruiting for us from time to time as well.  So it was a lot of effort out there talking with the students, basically reinventing the wheel every year.  We had a, a pre-law conference for minority students at the University of Iowa that started out.  We had something like twenty-five students there in, in January of 19--or March of 1977.  Ten years later, we were running four or five hundred students.  They were coming from Chicago [Illinois], from St. Louis [Missouri], from Kansas City [Missouri], even from New York [New York] and other places to be there at this minority pre-law conference.
Speaker 2: Now did they have a ba- they didn't have a BALSA [Black American Law Students Association; National Black Law Students Association (NBLSA)] when you arrived fro--
Speaker 1: Yeah they did.
Speaker 2: They did?
Speaker 1: Well they did, yeah they had a BALSA.  They had a BALSA when I arrived, right, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They did? Okay, okay. With a few students, okay. Okay (laughter) okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  They--well I'm talking about in the first class.  In the second year and third (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Third
Speaker 1: --year class there were, there were some students of color and black students in those classes as well.
Speaker 2: (Cough) Okay.
Story_ID: 466249
Speaker 1: Now what class did you teach?
Speaker 2: I taught criminal law and criminal procedure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But then I taught legislation later and what else, then I taught of course on police discretion based on my dissertation and the book that I wrote.
Speaker 1: Did you write a book while you were there?
Speaker 2: I wrote two books while I was there.  I wrote a book, one book called, immodestly titled 'The Iowa Guide to Search and Seizure' [Gregory Howard Williams].  And then I wrote 'The Law and Politics of Police Discretion' [Gregory Howard Williams].  I finished that up, that was my dissertation topic, and I'd turned the dissertation topic into a, into a book.
Speaker 1: And--okay but you were there, you were at Iowa almost--
Speaker 2: I was at Iowa for sixteen years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Years, okay.
Speaker 2: I was there from 1977 to 1993, and actually I began my most famous book, 'Life on The Color Line' ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams], while I was there.  I received a faculty scholar award that gave me some release time to, to begin the work on that book.
Story_ID: 466250
Speaker 1: When did you start germinating about the book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams]?  I mean when did that--was it, was it James McPherson that played a role?  I mean or what, when--
Speaker 2: Well not really, not at first.  What happened was about 1985, well first of all I would go around and I would talk a lot and tell people my story.  And that was how, you know, people would gravitate to me.  And a lot of students would come up to me and say, "Professor Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] you got an incredible story, you should write that down."  Because I mean I can tell the story about overcoming poverty, obstacles, whatever it is, I, I've dealt with it in most cases.  And so I would tell that story to inspire and to energize people that--you know like I remember this number of kids that came out of Chicago [Illinois] housing projects.  This one, what's the--one famous in addition to Cabrini-Green [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois], I can't remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Robert Taylor Homes.  One young girl, just absolutely love her, came out of there.  And you know and I spent a lot of time with her, encouraging her.  Her sister was a drug addict, her mother was an alcoholic.  And she was there struggling and, and you know she took a lot of energy and inspiration from what I said.  And so she and a lot of other people says you know, you really should write this book.  So I thought about it.  And then even some of the faculty wives who I had talked to, they were very tuned into this as well, even though the dean who loves me dearly.  You know he just, just didn't hit on his radar screen.  He knew I was good at what I did, but he just wasn't interested in, in the whole story.  But I did once I wrote thirty pages.  A thirty page story about this and shared it with the wife of the dean.  She says, "Greg this is incredible.  You have to write a book."  So I was on leave. We--the family had--
Speaker 1: Now what year was this?
Speaker 2: This is about 1985.  We were on leave--I'd written my two other books, law books, and so I felt--and I'd written a number of law review articles and I thought okay, I did what I had to do to show people that I could be a law professor.  I knew how to do this.  I could write those lawyer articles.  I wrote one that was published in Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] Law and Contemporary Problems and you know, Howard [Howard Law Journal], and Iowa Law Review and other, you know, great law reviews.  Harvard BlackLetter Journal [Harvard BlackLetter Law Journal; Harvard Journal on Racial and Ethnic Justice]. The--and so I said it's time for me to do this project.  So I was in England, there teaching criminal law.  We had a faculty exchange program.  My wife [Sara Whitney Williams] and daughter [Natalia Williams] had gone off to Spain to spend a couple of weeks; we had an interim period of about four or five weeks between classes.  And my oldest son [Zachary Williams], we didn't have the twins yet, was in--skiing in France.  And I didn't really wanna go to Spain 'cause my wife wanted to see an old boyfriend down there.  I had no interest in that.  And I didn't wanna ski 'cause my--all those basketball years playing on the courts really hurt my knees and so I couldn't do a lot of skiing.  So I sat down and I said I'm forty- how old was I?  I guess I was forty-two years old.  I said I'm forty-two years old right now and if I don't write this book now, I will never write this book.  And it's important for me to write this book because I felt I wanted to tell the story about Miss Dora [Dora Terry Smith].  I wanted to tell the story about dad [James Williams].  I wanted to tell the story about you know, other people who were special to me.  Because I'd seen that being an inspiring story to a lot of people that I would talk to.
Story_ID: 466251
Speaker 1: So I sat down and I had the first draft of the book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams] done in six weeks.  And, and so I had some friends read it that actually is--a couple, she was an English professor and her partner was a woman from New York, actually a mixed race woman herself from New York who knew this story.  And so I had them read it and they said, "Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams], this is an incredibly powerful book, but you're not in it."  And I was thinking well what, what's that mean?  And, and then it hit me.  What I had done is I had written the first draft of the book in the third person.  And, and it hit me that's how I lived my life in Muncie [Indiana].  Because all these crazy things happened to me, I had to step outside and say okay, here's Greg Williams evaluating all these crazies around here, and that's the only way that I was able to maintain stability--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --to maintain a sense of perspective as to what was going on.  So then I said I've gotta go back and write this book again.  And I said I'm gonna write this book and I'm gonna write a book where I'm gonna have people standing right there with me, that they're going to smell the blood, they're going to feel the pain I feel.  There's not--I don't wanna write a book that a person cannot put down and, and a person--everyone--if a person does not shed a tear in reading this book, then something's gotta be wrong with them about that.  Now that took me ten years to develop that writing skill.  I worked with Jim [James McPherson], I worked with a lot of other writers and other people, you know would look at this and kind of give me feedback.  Some people were incredibly helpful.  I had a number of--you know even the, the race comes through a little bit even in the writing aspect of this.  Because I had one white woman who was just, I just love her and adore her.  And she would read the things that I would write and then she would critique and send them back to me and, and she said, "Greg I will work with you as long as you need me.  And at the point you don't need me, then we'll part our ways."  And so one, one time she sent me something back and she was saying to me, she said, "Greg, I think you got this wrong.  This is not the way black people really think."  And I'm saying Christina [ph.], I think the time has come.  You don't have these experiences that I have.  This is my life that I'm talking about and like I told the people on 'Oprah' ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'] when I was on there, where they were trying to prep me to go on.  I said look, you relax.  I know this story.  And I can tell this story.  And at that point I, you know I kind of went in a different direction.  But I had a lot of people that were very helpful.  My agent really believed in this project because I had a lot of people who really wanted, 'cause you know the book goes from my life 'bout nine to really pretty much when I graduated from college [Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana].  And I have a little bit of postscript.  But a lot of people--at the time I was the dean of the law school [The Ohio State University College of Law; Michael E. Moritz College of Law, Columbus, Ohio] when this was coming out, so people wanted to know well how did I end up being a dean of the law school.  And I said that's not what this story's about.  This story is about two little boys who were trying to di- survive in a racially divided world, and it was a day-to-day crisis and concern as to whether they were going to make it or not.  That's the book that I wrote.  That's the book that I'm publishing.  I said I will write other books.  In fact you know I'm working on another book now.  But this is the story that I wanna tell.
Speaker 2: And in that--what did she say about black, you know what was her, what was she saying?
Speaker 1: I don't remember.  It was something, you know, some, something I, I'd developed a little scene and a scenario and she said it just doesn't sound right.  And I knew--I'd developed enough expertise by that time--to be honest, I felt like I developed--got a Ph.D. while writing this book because as I said earlier, it's one thing to have a story to tell, it's something else to be able to tell it in a way that's compelling and that draws people to you.  And actually I loved this quote on the, on the back cover of the book by Alex Kotlowitz who wrote the book 'There Are No Children Here' ['There Are No Children Here: The Story of Two Boys Growing Up in The Other America,' Alex Kotlowitz] about the housing projects in, in Chicago [Illinois].  And he says life on the, "Life on the color line is a triumph of storytelling, as well as a triumph of spirit.  And I can't decide (laughter) which I like better."
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  No, it's, it's, it's a really well written, amazing book that brings you to tears.
Story_ID: 466252
Speaker 1: So why did you decide to leave Iowa [University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa]?  I mean did you get recruited by Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I was recruited by Ohio State.  Over the years, you know I was a very successful administrator and I had a lot of opportunities to leave Iowa to go be dean here and there.  And ultimately decided that Ohio State had interest, a lot of interest for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you went there, you went there first as a--what were you going as?
Speaker 2: I went as the dean.
Speaker 1: As the dean, okay.
Speaker 2: I was the dean, the dean and professor.
Speaker 1: So, so had you--dean and professor.  Okay so you weren't--'cause some people just go the administrative track.
Speaker 2: That's true but to be honest, if you're an administrator in a law school world, you're a second class citizen.  And so it's important for you to, to have legitimacy to be a tenured professor.  And you know I did all the things, I spent the time in the library writing the law review articles, making sure they were published because I, I'd learned that at Iowa, that you, you really--if you wanna be a law school leader, it's very hard to be a law school leader if you are not a tenured faculty member.
Speaker 1: So what, what was the deal that you negotiated them with?  With--
Speaker 2: At Iowa?
Speaker 1: Iowa then, but Ohio State.
Speaker 2: Well the deal I negotiated at Iowa was that I would be a, an administrator, asso- assistant dean, then later promoted associate dean.  And I would be on the tenure track starting as associate professor and be promoted ultimately if I did the articles, my teaching was satisfactory and did the service, I would be promoted as a tenured professor.  And actually they gave me--normally I think it's four years, so they gave me eight years to do it.  Since I would be half time administrator, half time faculty member, although what we like to say is I spent 75 percent of my time administration, and 75 percent of my time teaching.  And actually some faculty members got a little jealous because I, I completed it in six years.  And I was promoted in six years.
Speaker 1: Isn't that driven spirit once again?  Is that what--
Speaker 2: It is driven.  You know I mean it's just so many people, you know it's a thing that I picked up in, in Indiana.  When people would tell me I can't do something, that's the challenge.  And you know over the years I would really react in a way well I'm gonna show you I can do it.  And sometimes that would lead me to do things that in final analysis I really didn't wanna do just to show people.  Just like the fundraising that I have done here that people said well this is what you can do.  And then of course I write to my friends about that and tell them the success I've had and they said well the only problem is they didn't know Greg Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams].  If they knew Greg Williams, they knew that this was gonna be a very different situation.
Speaker 1: So you got recruited, it was 19--when did they start talking to you?  Was it 1992 that they started talking and you moved in '93 [1993], or was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was about--they started talking to me in 'round December I think of '92 [1992].  We just adopted the boys, the twins [Anthony Williams and Carlos Williams].  And they, you know they, they started talking to me and it seemed that, seemed the right time.  I could have gone, I could have stayed there.  They were grooming me to be the provost of the University of Iowa.  That was one track.  But I felt--I ultimately decide--I decided when I first went to Iowa in 1977 I took a time management and set down my career goals.  A time management course, set down my lifetime career goals.  My lifetime career goals in 1977 were to finish my Ph.D. program, to write a bestselling book, to become a, a tenured professor, and to either become a, and become a president of a university.  And--or, or United States senator.  And that was the goal that I set for myself in 1977.  And of course I've achieved all of those.
Speaker 1: And you had it as your goal to do all those, or what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, all those.  Plus I wanted to do a lot of international travel as well.  I was telling someone about that recently and they said, "Well Greg, you need some new goals."
Story_ID: 466253
Speaker 1: What attracted you though, to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio]?  I mean besides the fact that it was--what, what, what was it the opportunity--that you weren't gonna move up at Iowa [University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa].  You had gone as far (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was not gonna move up at Iowa, you know the--my boss, the dean of the law school and I well--had been there for a long time.  Actually he was the longest serving dean.  He just retired about three years ago and actually I guess about six or seven years ago now.  And they even called me and said, "Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams], everybody wants you to come back to Iowa and be the dean."  I said, "That train's left the station."  But he was gonna be there for a while and he's a great guy, I have tremendous respect for him.  So this was an opportunity for me.  I could have stayed on that provost track and been the provost and probably been president earlier than it turns out that I became president, or that I could go to Ohio State.  I love the law school.  I love the law.  I love using the law as an instrument of change.  And I love training students and develop--helping them develop the skills to go back and make a difference in their communities.  And that's something that has always energized me.
Speaker 1: So what was law school that you came to?  What shape was it in at Ohio State?  How long had the previous dean--
Speaker 2: The previous dean had been there about eight or nine years.  And it was in okay shape.  It--but, but there had--there was a real financial crisis.  They had built a new building and they owed something like maybe $8 or 10 million on the building.  The law school was in debt, had a debt about, you know, $3 or 4 million, somewhere, somewhere in that range.  And so I came there to kind of resurrect the law school.  And the dean at that time had just alienated everyone.  He had alienated the president's office, he had alienated you know, politicians and others.  He was a very difficult guy to deal with, although he pointed out how he was number one in his class at the University of Michigan Law School [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I knew that within five minutes of meeting him.  And what I was really mad about was that he and his wife invited me and my wife [Sara Whitney Williams] to dinner.  And that was very cordial and, and a nice gesture when we first arrived.  Then during the dinner, there were about four or five people, businesspeople who were graduates of the law school that came through.  He did not introduce me to them as the new dean of the law school.  And in fact, and in front of my wife, he made it clear to me that he did not think that I was up to the challenge of leading the law school, and that I could not, I could not manage money.  I mean see that's always the rap on black administrators, is you can't manage the money.  And so my response was look, I grew up on five dollars and fifty cents a week on welfare; I know how to manage money.  I can take care of these things.  And in the final analysis my record of getting them out of debt, being the best fundraiser that the college had ever had, and I hired something like 50 percent of the faculty while I was there because we went through an early retirement program.  We had lost a lot of faculty members.  So I think the law school was in a substantially different place when I left than it was when I arrived.
Story_ID: 466254
Speaker 1: So what had you learned in Iowa [at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa] that you put into motion there?  Because you had not done fundraising.
Speaker 2: I had not done fundraising, that's exactly right.  I had not done fundraising--
Speaker 1: And not everyone can be a good fundraiser.
Speaker 2: And not everyone can be a good fundraiser, but, but fundraising depends a lot on developing personal relationships.  And I trace that developing personal relationships to being this little kid in Muncie, Indiana, you know trying to find out who I could trust, who I had confidence in, who I, you know, would be truthful to me and for me to be truthful to them, and developing those relationships that at that time, saved my life.  And those are skills that I've been using my entire life.
Speaker 1: And how did you go about that there, though?  I mean because you, you obviously came into a situation where you knew there was debt, and there were problems (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, yes, there were debt and problems, and so I, I worked closely with the president.  I worked with the provost.  What I've been fortunate in--as the people that I've worked with, I've been able to work with some great people who believe in me and my ability, and wanna be helpful and supportive.  And so I found that virtually every place that I've gone.  And you know some places I have found that's not the case, and I've tried to move away from them as quickly as I could.  But I had people that wanted to be supportive, people that--in fact when I first arrived at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], I had this first meeting with the, with the board of trust--well not the trustees, but this board for the law school.  And afterwards one of the leading lawyers in Toledo [Ohio] who was on the board came up to me and he said, you know, "We listened to two deans today.  We listened to the old dean.  He talked for fifteen minutes and no one understood a word of what he was saying.  The new dean talked for five minutes and everyone understood exactly what he was saying and what he was going to do."
Speaker 1: Now in this--let me, let me try to understand how--just if you could sort of just give an idea of how you went about--'cause you were there like--
Speaker 2: Eight years.  Eight years at Ohio State, yeah.
Speaker 1: Eight years.  So is that common, the eight year?  Is it--sometimes I hear four years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually think the average, the average stay for a law school dean was about three and a half years.  And so I used to kid my faculty, you know after I passed the four year mark, I said, "Look, I'm making history every day here now because I'm staying past this time."  But I liked it and I had a number of offers to go to some really great other law schools.  Because I was also elected as president of the Association of American Law Schools.  And my--the recognition that I was developing around the country was growing.  And so that was something that was of consequence.

Speaker 1: Was there any difference in terms of being in, why do I wanna call it top ten, you know, sports.  Top--is it the Big Ten [Big Ten Conference]?
Speaker 2: The Big Ten, the Big Ten, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Sorry the Big Ten, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: The Big Ten, yeah.
Speaker 1: You hadn't been in that kind of environment before.  And did that--
Speaker 2: When I was at Iowa [University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa], Iowa's Big Ten.
Speaker 1: Iowa's Big Ten.
Speaker 2: University of Iowa was in the Big Ten.
Speaker 1: So it's the same thing, okay.
Speaker 2: And but it's not the same thing.  But that was very--that's a very interesting question.  I thought I was gonna go from Iowa to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], they both are Big Ten schools and, you know I knew what life was like in--at the University of Iowa.  But there was a very different culture at Ohio State than there was at the University of Iowa.  So it required me to kind of adapt to that different culture. Columbus [Ohio] for instance (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you speak to that, because that's what I was trying--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Columbus is a, is a much more conservative place than the University of Iowa is.  And so--and of course Columbus is in--Ohio State's in Columbus, which is a huge city.  Whereas Iowa City [Iowa] is a very small city.  And there was different focus in terms of admission and priority of the institution.  You know it's a lot of similarities, but there were, there were some differences.  The faculty was, was probably a more conservative faculty at Ohio State than we had at the University of Iowa, so you know that required some adjustment as well in figuring out kind of what--how am I going to lead this faculty that's, that's a lot different than, than we had at the, at the University of Iowa.
Story_ID: 466256
Speaker 1: So your book ['Life on The Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,' Gregory Howard Williams] comes out though, during this time period (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Is there any--do, do all the faculty take to the book in the same way?  'Cause it's a very personal--
Speaker 2: It's a very personal book.  And--well no one ever admitted that they didn't really like it.  I guess they wouldn't 'cause I'm, since I decide salaries.  But, but you know actually the faculty at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] really, really gravitated to the book, I mean they really did like it.  There was a lot of support.  There was some people at Ohio State who didn't like me.  They didn't like me before the book came out, they didn't like me after the book came out.  Because in being an administrator, you've got to be able to make the hard decisions.  And there're gonna be people who simply--are going to be people who simply do not like you.  And of course again, I've grown (laughter), grown up with a lot of people who just didn't like me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now one of the things that I saw in 1998 you got invited for the whole focus on pro bono and diversity.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And in the legal profession, this has been you know, a newer--well pro bono when I came out of law school, was sort of a focus.  I don't know if it was window dressing.  But I see now that there is really you know, a stronger focus--
Story_ID: 466257
Speaker 1: It seemed the natural thing for me because you know I remember the days growing up.  There were no black lawyers in my hometown.  And so if we needed some help or support, it just did not exist.  I mean if you had a car that broke down just minutes after you got home, you were just out of luck.  There was not going to be any lawyer that was going to represent you or take your case.  And so I had always been very interested in this.  You know when I, when I was--and when I was in law school [George Washington University Law School, Washington, D.C.], this really hit me when I was in law school and studying housing for the poor and studying these civil rights cases, studying these criminal law cases and realized that look, there was a lot of legal violations, violations of the laws, statutes and constitution that took place when I was growing up in Indiana.  And there was no lawyer there to say wait a minute, no, this is, this is totally inappropriate.  And so that started me gravitating to public service and the pro bono work.  And even though I, you know, didn't do a lot of it myself, I ultimately ended up training the students.  What was really kind of a, a--something I value a lot is talking about the one girl from Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois].  Once I was talking with her a few years ago, and, and she went with legal services.  I'm not sure what it's called in Chicago [Illinois], but basically--
Speaker 2: Legal services.
Speaker 1: It's legal services.  And so I said, I said you know, "Why are all these kids who were in my class, why are they going to legal services in Chicago?"  And she said, "Professor Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] don't you know?"  And I said, "No, why are they going?"  Said, "They wanna be you.  They want to have an impact in the way you've had an impact."  And that was just was shocked with that.
Speaker 2: Well the laws that's supposed to serve too.
Speaker 1: Exactly, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It is, it is. That's all.
Story_ID: 466258
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the gift that you were able to get, you know the thirty million [dollars].
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was a--how did you go about that, and was it a, was it a gift that was un- unnamed donor, or was the donor known?
Speaker 2: No, it was known.  His name is Michael Moritz [Michael E. Moritz].  He's a graduate of Ohio State law school [The Ohio State University College of Law; Michael E. Moritz College of Law, Columbus, Ohio].  Really a very nice guy.  He was--worked with Baker and Hostetler [BakerHostetler] in Columbus [Ohio].  Graduate of the law school.  And I met him, him and his, he and his wife when I first arrived in Columbus.  But he was really more interested in the business school because he was--did his business undergrad at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] and then he went to law school.  And so everybody was trying to push me out of the way, saying this guy's interested in business and that's, that's where it's all coming from.  And, and actually he made a gift of about two hundred thousand dollars to the business school.  And I think what I did when he did that is I sent him a note of congratulations.  And the business school dean, actually who is still the business school dean, was, you know, very proud of that.  And that's great.  But--and I'd known Mike over the years, but then he had some health issues and was in an accident and you know, had to stop practicing law.  And people started paying less attention to him.  And so he started coming to some events we were doing at the law school, he and his wife.  And I love his wife, she's just a fantastic woman.  And, and so she, she wanted to make a gift to the law school in his name and so she made a million dollar gift and we named the library after him.  And, and so he loved that when he was there, although I'm not sure he was really aware that, you know, this gift had been made.  And but then ultimately he did realize that the gift had been made and he spent more time at the law school.  And then he wrote to us that kind of so-called anonymous letter, but we knew who it was from.  That he was thinking about making a $10 million gift to the law school.  And so I said well, $10 million gift is great, but it's not going to change the law school.  So he and I began a series of discussions.  Actually he wrote a gift saying he was gonna give the $10 million.  And I, and I told my staff ignore the letter, and we're not gonna respond to that letter.  Had I--had lunch at my house.  He didn't live too far away.  And so I said, "Mike come over and let's talk about the law school."  And so he rolled up on one Saturday afternoon, just me and him, no--the kids weren't there and my wife [Sara Whitney Williams] was gone.  And I said, "Mike, I wanna change this law school.  I think Ohio State law school has the ability to be one of the top ten public law schools in the United States.  But it's going to take a lot of money to do that.  But I, and I know you care about the law school."  He was number one in his first year class, he was number one in his second year class, he was number one in his third year class.  And of course had had a successful career.  Actually he was--if you're familiar with Cardinal Health.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: He was the guy who established corporate papers for Cardinal Health and one time owned 50 percent of Cardinal Health.  And then sold it, but he was, you know, very well-to-do.  Not, you know not, not incredibly wealthy.  I mean he gave me a fairly high percentage of his family income.  I mean they're still doing very well.  And so I said, "Mike, it's gonna take $30 million to do this."  And so he said, "Well, okay.  I'll do it."  And I could have fallen out of my chair when he agreed to do that.  And I said, "Okay, that's great.  But you need to talk to Lou Ann [Lou Ann Moritz]," his wife, "and you need to talk to your family about this, 'cause this is a huge gift.  We want everybody to feel positive about this."  And so he did that and they all did feel very positive about it.  And we renamed the law school.  And I did this actually--this pretty much happened after the decision had been made and announced that I was leaving Ohio State and coming to City College [City College of New York, New York, New York].  And so he knew that I was not gonna be steward of this $30 million.  And so, although they did pull a surprise on me.  I said what I really want to do is with $10 million for, was for named professors.  There was a $10 million dean's discretionary fund which he named after me, and there was $10 million dollars for student scholarships.  And so I said, "Well I wanna name one professor, one chair after you, the Michael Moritz chair, I wanna name one after Frank Strong, who was the first president of the Association of American Law Schools, former dean, I wanna, wanna name one after someone else and then whoever you wanna do for the fourth."  And he said, "Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams], you're interested in civil liberties, right?"  I said, "Well I'm interested in civil liberties and civil rights."  And so he said, "Well would you mind," and actually it happened the vice president for development was there with me when we had this conversation.  He said, "Would you mind if I name one of these the Gregory H. Williams Chair in Civil Rights and Civil Liberties?"  And I turned to the vice president and said, "Jerry [Jerry May], I did not ask for this."  And he said, "I know you did not ask for this, but Mike wants to name this chair after you as well as the dean, the $10 million dean's discretionary fund."  So it was just a shock.  So now there is a Gregory H. Williams Chair, and the chair holder at The Ohio State University law school.
Story_ID: 466259
Speaker 1: And the sad part of it, though, is that about a year later he [Michael E. Moritz] and his wife were having--were on vacation in Florida and, and he--a hit and run driver hit his car, he and his wife were in the car, hit and killed him.  And, and so I flew back to Columbus [Ohio] for the funeral and Lou Ann [Lou Ann Moritz] came up to me, you know, and of course this is a woman that I've taken $30 million away from her.  But she said to me, she said, "Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams]," I--and when I told 'em, I said, "Mike and Lou Ann this is a gift that will last forever."  And she said to me, she said, "Greg when we had that conversation, none of us knew how soon forever was gonna come.  But I want you to know that the last year of Mike's life, being involved with the law school [The Ohio State University College of Law; Michael E. Moritz College of Law, Columbus, Ohio], having the law school named for him, was the most joyous time of his life."
Speaker 2: That's a pretty amazing story.  (Laughter) That's, that's pretty--so you had that--that's amazing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'd say incredible.  I mean and they're very special.  I still get cards every year from Lou Ann.  She tells me how much she misses me and Columbus, and she's just an incredible person.
Story_ID: 466260
Speaker 1: So you had been recruit--why this, why, why, why CUNY [City University of New York, New York, New York], right?
Speaker 2: City College [City College of New York, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: City College.  Why am I--?
Speaker 2: Right, it's part of CUNY.  We're part of the CUNY system, but City University of New York (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is where, this is where I'm not--
Speaker 2: City College--City College is the, is the landmark.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean we're--and the flagship.  Well I wanted, like I said 1977 I wrote down there I either wanted to be a United States senator, I wanted to be a governor, I wanted to be a college president.  And so it seemed like the next logical step for me.  I mean where do you go (laughter) after you had such success?  There's--and, and City College had an appeal for me because one of the things that I talked about when I was president of the Association of American Law Schools.  It was about building the pipeline.  And that's what I wanted to do.  I wanted to build that pipeline like you were saying earlier, get more minority students into, into the college.  Get them into the law schools, get them into these white shoe law firms.  That's what I really wanted to do and I felt City College is the place that I can build this pipeline.  And not only for law school, but for sciences and other areas as well.  Because you know we basically are majority, minority institution.  I mean you know close to 85 percent of our students are students of color.  And so that had a real appeal for me, although a lot of my friends said, "Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams], why are you taking this job?"  Because they have fired the last two presidents of City College.  "I mean it is a incredibly difficult and impossible, and here you are at the top of your game.  You're the former president of the Association of American Law Schools.  You're the dean of a law school, of a great law school.  You've got $60 million in your pocket that you can use to do whatever you want to do with at Ohio State [The Ohio State University College of Law; Michael E. Moritz College of Law, Columbus, Ohio].  Why are you doing this?  This is really crazy."  But I did feel compelled, you know, to do this and to take on this challenge.  I mean and to a certain extent, I wanted to show to my kids that as their mom [Sara Whitney Williams] and dad approached sixty when a lot of people were thinking about retiring, that mom and dad were still willing to take on a major challenge.  And that I was never--I mean I'm talking about a lot of my colleagues, they're thinking about well their 401(k) plans and retirement and things like that, and it just wasn't where I wanted to go.  So I took this on with a lot of trepidation and a lot of concern.  There were a lot of people when I arrived here said well, this--what's this guy from the Midwest, from Indiana, you know what does he know about running a major urban institution that is just in the middle of political crisis and turmoil and problems and, and he wants to--think he can somehow come in there and deal with that.  Again my friend said they didn't reckon on having Greg Williams.  But it's, it's been one of the most difficult jobs I've ever had in my life.  It also has been one of the most energizing jobs I've had in my life.  It's been a job where I've been able to see firsthand in a way that I have not seen at other schools, transformation.
Story_ID: 466261
Speaker 1: You know I can give you one example.  About, about three years ago our class valedictorian was a woman by the name of Silvia Arredondo from Guatemala who came to the United States and spent four and a half years as a live-in maid.  And was talking with some of the family members about her desire to go to college.  And so you know, I mean as a maid she did what maids do.  She cleaned the toilets, she did the cooking and took the kids, bought the groceries, whatever was done.  And so they talked to her and to say well what 'bout about City College [City College of New York, New York, New York]?  So she came to City College and she majored in chemical engineering here at City College.  During the time she was here at City College, she lived in the Bronx [New York] and her boyfriend was shot and killed on the street, but that still did not deter her.  She graduates with a, with a, I think a 3.8, 3.9 grade point average, and then receives an offer to go to the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] for a Ph.D. in chemical engineering.  Well some folks were able to put the money together to bring her family up from Guatemala.  And her parents were there, you know, very modest education, I don't think they were educated at all.  I think their Spanish wasn't even that great.  I think they're, you know basically Indian [Native American].  And I sat there, stood there and, and greeted their mother and father and, and saw sisters and brothers.  And it hit me that we had changed the life of that family forever.  That Silvia's life was gonna be different.  Her children's lives were going to be different.  Her sisters and brothers' lives were gonna be different.  Her mother and father's life was gonna be different.  Even that little village in Guatemala was gonna be different because there was gonna be talk about Silvia Arredondo came to the United Sates and graduated at the top of her class at City College, getting a Ph.D. from the University of Texas.  That's transformation.  And that's something you see it in the, in the palpable, you know, way that you can see it, you can taste it, you can smell it.  And that's the thing.  And, and that's just one example.  I mean just last--two years ago we had a young man who came to the United States from Russia, about fourteen years ago.  And it's a long, long story and one of these days hopefully he will write that story.  But they were refugees from Russia and they end up here with absolutely nothing.  And they live homeless for a year and a half under the George Washington Bridge.  And the only way they'd get out of the weather at night is they make friends with the person at the Port Authority Bus Terminal [New York, New York], who allows them to come in and set up.  They can't even go to sleep there, so they set up and read all night.  He learns English, you know, playing pickup baseball in Central Park [New York, New York].  This is a kid who is now in his third year as the first Rhodes Scholar from City College since 1939, getting his Ph.D.  So I say his address has gone from under the George Washington Bridge, to New College, Oxford University [University of Oxford, Oxford, England].  That's what City College does for you.
Speaker 2: So there are a lot of, a lot of yous here. Okay--
Speaker 1: That's true, actually.  One faculty member came to me and said, "Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams], you are more like our students than any other president we've ever had."
Story_ID: 466262
Speaker 1: Now I wanna ask what, what has been difficult about it?
Speaker 2: Well there's been a lot of things that have been difficult.  The faculty oftentimes been very difficult because the faculty have been used to kind of doing what they wanted to do.  There's a lot of faculty members here who are drawn to City College [City College of New York, New York, New York] for a lot of the same reasons that I'm drawn to City College.  But sometimes there's a lot of paternalism, you know saying well these are black students and they can't really do that course.  Or they take, they need to take longer because they have to work and it's gonna be a problem.  I said look, being paternalistic is not helping these students.  We need to be clear what our expectations are, help them in every way we can to say this is what has to happen.  So I've had that battle.  I've had, you know, battles with our alums.  Because they say well you've still got Leonard Jeffries on your campus, you know who is a, a--said some pretty racist things in his life.  And so to try to kind of keep that up and establish--I knew if I was gonna be able to raise money, I had to establish credibility in relationships with our alums.  Most of whom are, are white and Jewish and to show them that the students we have today at City College are just like them.  I mean they had, they have no money, they have great ambition and this is the only opportunity they have to move forward in their lives.  For our students it's not City College or Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] or City College or Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], or City College or Michin- Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  It's City College or nothing.  And that's historic at City College.  So I need to kind of build that bridge between the alums and the students that we have here today.  And that was a, you know that was a hard thing 'cause I had all these people telling me all about all the problems and the things they didn't like about City College.  Then of course you know we have a lot of the politicians that just were resisting as to what we were trying to do here as well.  And then you got open admissions, which is kind of a carryover, which was really--while it may have been a good idea to try to make it accessible, it was bad in the sense that one, you're bringing in students who have no chance of succeeding here.  But more importantly, it was a public relations disaster.  A school that turns out nine Nobel Prize winners is now admitting students who can't even, you know, read.  And so we had to turn that around and change all of that.  And so you know I've got the very, very liberal students and, you know kind of the, the diehard radicals saying what are you doing?  You're changing this.  I said I'm trying to move this institution forward to make it a viable institution for the students come--who come here so that they can succeed.
Story_ID: 466263
Speaker 1: You arrived here in what year?
Speaker 2: I arrived here in August of 2001, six weeks before 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  I was president of City College [City College of New York, New York, New York] when 9/11 happened.  And that was an incredible experience.
Speaker 1: So when did your fundraising start at that point?  Then you couldn't do anything about fundraising or even changing--
Speaker 2: Well I started meeting people.,  The fundraising is you know, is developing relationships, getting to know people, letting them know you, telling them what my plans were and saying okay, stay with me.  I need you, I need your help.  And you know I, I've been gifted to be you know, pretty persuasive guy.  I've picked up some of my dad's [James Williams] skills and techniques.  But I--but what I say is genuine and I, I told them--I would go around and I would talk with the politicians and you know who some of them really wanted to go back to the open admissions days.  And I said, "Look, you need to understand something about me.  That I will always do what I think is best for the City College of New York.  It's not personal, but sometimes it may be different than what you like.  But I want you to know that is always my motivator, and that's what I will always do."  And I think people believe me and then that's the way I've, I've carried myself.  And now, I mean I have just enormously positive relationships.  In fact Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] came here a couple of years ago and, and we started talking about something.  So now we're establishing the Charlie Ran- or the Rangel Center for Public Service [Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service] at City College.  Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell], I met him when he was secretary of state, and actually we had it--had the Colin Powell Center [Colin L. Powell Center for Leadership and Service; Colin L. Powell School for Civic and Global Leadership].  But now that's been beefed up.  We raised $17 million for the Powell Center in the last, last two years.  And so I've got people like that.  I've had Senator Schumer [Chuck Schumer] and Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton], Governor Pataki's [George Pataki] been here, Governor Spitzer's dad [Bernard Spitzer] is a graduate of City College and been incredibly supportive of, of what we're doing here.  So I've met a lot of people and have drawn them to City College and, and they've embraced the mission and the things we've tried to do here.
Story_ID: 466264
Speaker 1: What haven't you done that you want to do here [City College of New York, New York, New York] (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well one of the things we have to do is we have to sustain our achievements.  They're still--there's a number of things that I really wanna do.  I mean one obviously is a scholarship.  Our students still have, have a lot of, a lot of need, and so we need to deal with that.  The school has a lot of need.  But one thing that I really hit on recently that I think is so incredibly important, and so much really beyond the reach of a lot of our students, but I want to make it possible.  And that is, well we call ourselves an urban institution, we are an urban institution.  And we are a great urban institution.  But you know when you think about that, talking about you're being an urban institution is, and I like to say it's so much 20th century.  I mean it's dated.  What we need to think about ourselves as an international institution.  A global institution because that's the world these students are going to live in.  What we have here because of the diversity of experience and background, and we have students from 120 different countries on this campus speaking well over a, you know a hundred different languages.  We are incredibly diverse, but our students are not diverse in terms of their world experience.  And so the thing that I'm trying to do is to enhance that world experience.  To give you some idea, last year I took thirty-five City College students in science and engineering, along with the dean of science, who's a, a woman who was born in Cuba, and the dean of engineering who is a Mexican immigrant here.  We went to Austria where our students participated in a junior research conference of about 135 students.  And so for many students that was the first time they'd ever been outside the United States.  They've been in the five boroughs, but you know New Yorkers, they really like to think they're sophisticated.  But when you peal that onion, they haven't been anywhere.  They haven't had experiences outside of New York [New York] and other places.  But taking those students over there, letting them meet scientists who are doing the same kind of research they're doing, working on those projects, developing friendships with people around the world.  So when the future comes when they're a scientist and they're working for some company or something like that, this is not gonna be a new experience.  They will have done that.  They will have a chance to interact.  So that's what I'm trying to do.  I was in Spain in March talking with the Crown Prince of Spain [Felipe VI], the next king of Spain, telling him that he's associated with Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.], he's associated with Tufts [Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts].  I said look, you think you know that you're interested in education, the place you want to be associated with is City College.  That is a microcosm of the world, and that's what we're doing.  We have for instance last summer we sent fifteen students to the Universit- Universidad of Dade La Rioja in Lagrono, Spain.  This summer fifty students are going from City College to Lagrono.  We're sending, sending students to (unclear).  We're sending students to Sierra Leone to work in those communities.  We're sending students to China.  We're sending students to India, other places around the world.  That's the thing that I want for these experience- students, because when--that's the experience I want for these students because when they have that experience, then their own ethnic background and what they bring to the table, that empowers them in a way.  And you think about this.  Now a lot of private schools are really going global.  But when you look at that, they don't have the student body we have.  They do not have the ability we have to kind of really add power and to, to that, that exchange.  I mean we can own this globalization issue.  We've got it on this campus and we send those kids abroad, that's a thing, that's an experience they're gonna have.

Speaker 1: I wanna ask you just three more questions.  One, your--what are your, I don't know, let me see.  Okay what are your--I don't know--your family.  Let me just ask you.  You adopted two children [Anthony Williams and Carlos Williams].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they were--
Speaker 2: They were from Honduras, they're twin brothers who were living in an orphanage in Honduras.  And my wife [Sara Whitney Williams] had worked down there a number of years.  She studied Spanish at the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] and she wanted to perfect her Spanish, so she has a very much of a social worker bent.  And so she went down there and, and every time she'd go down there, she'd come back and say well let's adopt this kid or that kid.  And I said, "Look, I'm not interested.  We've got two kids [Natalia Williams and Zachary Williams] that turned out great," but, but finally she came back and I guess she saw my defenses going down and said she saw these twin boys and she said, "I found Billy [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] and Mike [Mike Williams]."  And so (laughter) that was a--that, that was a, that was a hard thing.  And so I went down to see the boys and they were good boys.  They had a lot of problems.  They'd been in an orphanage for about four or five years.  And so I thought well Miss Dora [Dora Terry Smith] was fifty-two years old when she adopted me and Mike.  And I said she making twenty-five dollars a week.  If she could do that at age fifty-two, making the kind of money she was making to take on that responsibility, I guess I have to have a big enough heart to try to do that for someone else.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be President Williams [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams]?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I thought about that.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: And you should think of that in terms of Miss Dora [Dora Terry Smith] and your father [James Williams] and your mother [Mary Williams] and, you know that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I think my legacy would be that, you know, I, I played the hand that was dealt me.  That the help, support and love and affection that I, that many people had for me in those years growing up, that I did the best I could to pay that back.  And pay that back in a way by helping others in the way that I was helped.  That, that I made a difference.  That I opened doors for people who simply would not have had those doors opened for them if Greg Williams had not been there.  That, that I've really helped people think about possibilities in their lives that they could not even conceive or imagine.  That, that I really have--that I was worthy of the help that I received when I was a kid.

Speaker 1: And one last question.  For those of African American descent, what message do you have for them?  I mean in, in terms of the testament of your life, I guess is what I--
Speaker 2: I think I would not be here today unless the culture and values of the African American community were not--did not resonate in my life.  The willingness to reach out and help people.  You know when I go around and I talk to audiences around the country and I do that a lot, and people cannot understand how Miss Dora [Dora Terry Smith], who was not related to us, would step forward.  You know how Aunt Bess [Bess Pharris] and how others would do the things that they did for me.  And I say look, that's part of the black experience, trying to take care of each other.  You know there's not any jealousy.  When I go back to Muncie [Indiana], actually I was back to Muncie reunion this summer, and I go back to Muncie and, and just last week I received an email, an urgent email to my office telling me there's a reunion this summer, and to make sure that I'm there.  And so they sent a, they sent a note to one of my staff people says, Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory H. Williams] is our hero.  You know we love him.  He means so much to us.  I mean that's the type of community that really gave me--when I was sitting there at George Washington University [George Washington University Law School, Washington, D.C.] not sure if I was gonna get through law school and I thought back to the people who stood up for me, really wanting to make a difference in my life.  There's no way, there's no way I could give up.  You know when people say well why didn't you become white?  Why didn't you just pass over?  I said there's no way that I could do that because then I, I would just be totally dishonest with myself and I would be ignoring and disrespecting the people who were so important to me.  And that's what this African American community means to me.  It's just as strong for me today as it was you know, January 1954 when I arrived in Muncie.
