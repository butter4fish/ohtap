Speaker 1: Which soldiers?
Speaker 2: The 9th [9th Cavalry Regiment] and 10th Cavalry [10th Cavalry Regiment], who had been sent to Huntsville, Alabama to get them out of the way while the white boys stole his--their glory.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  The Rough Riders.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, the Rough Riders did not, did not make anything except for thievery.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now tell me about your grandparents on your mother's side.  What were their names?
Speaker 1: Brandon, I think we had about five children.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Your grandmother.
Speaker 1: Grandmother was Idella [Idella Brandon].
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Grandfather was?
Speaker 1: Grandfather was Claude Samuel Brandon [Claude Brandon].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was a contractor, a working man.
Speaker 2: Did you have interaction with your grandparents?
Speaker 1: With, with my grandfather yes, because he lived to be ninety-six.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I can remember my grandmother 'cause she had a, she had a silk dress, not a, but I can remember the aura of her body fragrance, you know.
Speaker 2: What did it remind you of?
Speaker 1: Heaven on earth, I guess you say, because she was my sanctuary.  I mean I loved her.  I guess, everybody has to love their grandmother.
Speaker 2: So you spent more time with your grandfather?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Do you remember any times with him?
Speaker 1: With my grandfather?
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Speaker 1: Oh, Lord, I can remember, I was his assistant.  And the first job I had was delivering mortar in a bucket.  Actually it was two buckets, while he had a little cushy job that he got paid for.
Speaker 2: What did he do?
Speaker 1: He was a contractor.
Speaker 2: Okay. So he had--
Speaker 1: Building, building contractor.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he was--I guess you could--artisan, but he also was a entrepreneur.  He, he made his mark really in rental housing.  He must have owned what, fifteen or twenty substandard houses (laughter).
Speaker 2: Substandard, okay.  What other stories can you tell me about your grandfather?
Speaker 1: A piece, a piece of real estate, I guess you'd say, but a piece of very important advice that he gave me, and sometimes I find it at liberty in my conversations because he said, "John [HistoryMaker Dr. John Cashin], one of the things that I want you to understand is that the best way to get rid of your enemies is to outlive them. Take care of yourself, your body, and you can outlive most of them."  So from a man who's ninety, died at age ninety-six, a pretty good person to follow.
Story_ID: 544942
Speaker 1: Your [maternal] grandfather [Claude Brandon] and your grandmother [Idella Brandon].  You said they lived in Brandontown [Huntsville, Alabama]?  Was the town named after your family?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any information about that?
Speaker 2: Well, the house, not the house, the area is still known as Brandontown.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Brandontown Road, Brandontown this, that.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Why was it Brandontown daddy?
Speaker 2: Because there probably was a couple hundred people lived in the neighborhood named Brandon.
Speaker 1: Do you know how they came to live in that area?
Speaker 2: I have heard it discussed that they were Mestizos, you heard that name before?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Okay, good.  Well, the Indians [Native American], the Indian Spring [ph.] property, you know a little bit about them, they were Mestizos, but, you know, working people, and there were some prominent folks.
Speaker 1: So they owned the land where they lived and they settled the town there called Brandontown?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, the house that I call my home a lot is Lydia Drive, its 1815 Lydia Drive, Northwest, Huntsville, Alabama.  Actually, that is, not the last, but that's one of the last remaining jewels in the Brandon, under the Brandon name.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  It's located where Brandontown was located.
Speaker 2: There, that's right, it's Brandontown.  That's the reason she knows so much, she lived there.  You weren't born there in the hospital.
Story_ID: 544943
Speaker 1: Tell me how much education did your [maternal] grandmother [Idella Brandon] and grandparents have, your grandmother and grandfather [Claude Brandon]?  If you know.
Speaker 2: They were probably self-educated, but you see Brandontown [Huntsville, Alabama] is also jammed up with Oakwood College [Oakwood Junior College; Oakwood University, Huntsville, Alabama].  You've heard of them I hope.  My Grandfather Brandon was a staunch Seventh-day Adventist.  As a matter of fact, he would, he would try the patients who were Jehovah's Witnesses.  That's putting it rather mildly.  I remember Jehovah's Witnesses decided to attack him on our own home turf there.  And they got in mixed up discussing the Bible and all the various things.  And after about half an hour, forty-five minutes, I notice this Jehovah Witness was checking his watch (laughter).
Speaker 1: So they were self-educated?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  What about your mother [Grace Brandon Cashin]?
Speaker 2: Well now, when you say self-educated, she was, my mother was the youngest, younger daughter in that fam- and baby in that family.
Story_ID: 544944
Speaker 1: They moved into town [Huntsville, Alabama] to, Grandpa started a grocery store [Brandon's Grocery].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In down- in the downtown, what they call it, Nigger Main.  Have you ever, have you heard that term?
Speaker 2: No, sir.  Say it again?
Speaker 1: Nigger Main.
Speaker 2: No, I hadn't heard that term.  But that's where his store was?
Speaker 1: Well, get acquainted with the culture.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean, how dare you (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  But, you meaning the main street of the black community?
Speaker 1: That is--that's exactly what it means, yeah.  The main street of the black community.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it was known fondly as Nigger Main, Holmes Street [sic. Holmes Avenue] and Church [Street].  That was the, that was--
Speaker 2: So he opened the grocery store there and so the family started going to school in the city, or in the town?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well we had, we had another successful entrepreneur and, old timer fellow, that was my, Uncle Dan Brandon [Daniel Brandon], his first, he was a first cousin to my, and Dan was, one of my grandfather's first cousins, and they had a, on the main street there, Holmes Street, Andrew Herndon [ph.] and Claude Brandon were two of the property owners and business owners on Holmes Street, and Joe Lowery's [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph Lowery] daddy was a pool, owned a pool hall I'm sure you know Joe Lowery, the Reverend Joseph Echols Lowery.
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: You interviewed him?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Joe Lowery taught me all the wrong things I know.  As a matter of fact, I was prob- I was probably three or four years old before I ever began to realize Joe Lowery was not my older brother.
Story_ID: 544945
Speaker 1: So we were talking about your mother's education.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I know that she got her bachelor's, her undergraduate degree.  She was a classmate of, what was the name of that new stadium that they built, A and M football stadium? Louis Crews [Louis Crews Stadium, Normal, Alabama], yeah.  It was named after Louis Crews.  She and Louis graduated from A and M [The State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama] together, so that goes back--
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  But where did she start out?  Her education?
Speaker 2: Oakwood [Oakwood Junior College; Oakwood University, Huntsville, Alabama].
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  I thought she went somewhere else her freshman year.
Speaker 2: Oh, see, I need you here, my memory.  She started out, I'm shooting a blank on this.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Where did you go to college, where did you start out?
Speaker 2: Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Exactly.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right.  Mom was--my mother had a very, she was a singer.  And she--
Speaker 1: She was a singer?
Speaker 2: And she was very good at it.  As a matter of fact, every time they had any kind of a program in black Huntsville [Alabama], they had to have Grace Cashin [Grace Brandon Cashin] singing, just like Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was in town.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Was she a Jubilee Singer [Fisk Jubilee Singers]?
Speaker 2: She was a Jubilee Singer, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  (Simultaneous) At Fisk?
Speaker 2: At Fisk University, that's right.  Up until 1925 when they had the student strike, as a matter of fact. Jimmie Lunceford and his gang.  Just left Fisk in 1925 because of the student strike, because of, but anyhow, that interrupted my mother's tenure as a Jubilee Singer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was--they were very upset when she decided she was gonna marry my father [John Cashin, Sr.], and strike out in another direction.
Story_ID: 544946
Speaker 1: Tell me about your relationship, your personal relationship with your mother [Grace Brandon Cashin].
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't incestuous. But, but--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Tell me what type of person she was.
Speaker 2: She was as straight laced as they come.  I mean she was school principal, okay, and all of, all of my creative scenes, I never really could get one over on her.  But, sometimes I'm reminded by my daughter [Sheryll Cashin] and my, my daughter and my wife [Louise White Cashin], I'll just say it like that, that, see I got married, my mother almost because they were both school teachers and the school teachers have a way of having things all planned for you, you know, and they, they just always making suggestions, "It sure would be nice if you would do this, that and the other." So, hinting to me: if you don't I'll break your arm.
Story_ID: 544947
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: John Logan, Jr.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  No.
Speaker 2: Dr. John L. Cashin [John Cashin, Sr.].
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Senior.
Speaker 2: Senior.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN): You're junior.
Speaker 2: John Logan Cashin--
Speaker 1: Junior.
Speaker 2: Senior.  That's your father.
Speaker 1: I thought I was senior.  I was the senior in that one
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Now daddy your father was senior, right, and you're junior?
Speaker 1: There ya go.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Now tell me about--
Speaker 2: I don't argue with her because--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me your--about your grandparents on your father's side.  Do you know their names?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your grandmother's name, your father's mother?
Speaker 2: I wish you hadn't asked right then.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Start with his grandfather.
Speaker 1: With my grandfather?
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Herschel V. Cashin.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was the first black lawyer in the State of Alabama.  He was sent down from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to help in the education of the newly freed slaves, 19--1863. He became the receiver of public lands.  He and Frederick Douglass were very close friends.
Speaker 2: So he had, he received free public land.
Speaker 1: He was the dispenser of free land (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, dispenser, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: He was giving it away as fast as he could.  As a matter of fact, some of the, as I understand it there was some controversy about how free he was, that they was giving it to the black folks for five cents an acre and if you decided you wanted to have some adversarial bartering, he'd go down to two cents an acre, and loan them the two cents (laughter).  So there are a number of, I guess you call them, plant- there are at least twenty families in Huntsville [Alabama], Madison County, and in north Alabama, that are still alive and prosperous because of the grants that Grandpa Cashin gave.  As a matter of fact, he's the reason that Alabama A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama] sets out there on that hill.  There are a lot of people that don't want the run of the rank and file, black folks, to know about these.  Just like they don't want you to know about the 10th Cavalry [10th Cavalry Regiment].
Speaker 2: Tell me some of the other things that you remember about your grandfather, Herschel Cashin.
Speaker 1: I never knew Herschel.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I knew Claude [Claude Brandon], my maternal grand- grandfather.
Speaker 2: Your grandmother.  Do you remember your grandmother's name?
Speaker 1: Yes, I do, but it's--
Speaker 2: Was it Brewster [Minnie Brewster Cashin]?
Speaker 1: Brewster.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Brewster from out of Montgomery [Alabama], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Do you remember her at all?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She died, she died about six months to nine months after Herschel died.  She didn't want to live without him.
Story_ID: 544948
Speaker 1: In continuing to talk about your Grandfather Herschel [Herschel V. Cashin], you mentioned the 10th Cavalry [10th Cavalry Regiment], and he wrote a book.  Do you want to talk (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That is cavalry, C-A-V-A-L-R-Y, not C-A-L-V.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It's not the place of the skull.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  You want to talk about the book that he wrote?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened is that this is part of a political sellout that the powers that be wanted, they have their ways of seeing to it that the real story is never told.
Speaker 1: She he wrote a book, 'Under Fire with the Tenth' ['Under Fire with the Tenth U.S. Cavalry,' Herschel V. Cashin]?
Speaker 2: 'Under Fire with the Tenth Cavalry.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now I got a copy of that sitting over there if you want to see it.
Speaker 1: And it was first published in?
Speaker 2: Eighteen ninety-nine [1899].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me about the story that he told.  What was the discrepancy between the Rough Riders, you were telling me a story earlier, tell me the story (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Rough Riders were a bunch of political parasites that--okay, let's do it like this.  The Rough Riders took credit for something, for a victory that they did not win.  It was the Battle of San Juan Hill, this is what most people only think of as Spanish American War, as the Battle of San Juan Hill I mean nations became identified with this, with these Rough Riders.  They were political parasites, I call them, because it was the lying troops of the 9th [9th Cavalry Regiment] and 10th Cavalry that won the Battle of San Juan Hill, and they won it on foot.  The cavalry--
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Not the story that that the book tells?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Then the book tells the story of the 10th Cavalry and remnants of the 9th Cavalry also, that they were sent to Huntsville, Alabama, Camp Albert T. Force [sic. Camp Albert G. Forse, Huntsville, Alabama]. F-O-R-S-A [sic.].  They were sent to Huntsville, Alabama to get them out of the way so that no one would know that the Rough Riders were lying.  They were just, victims, not victims, how would I--the 10th Cavalry that won the Battle of San Juan Hill was sent to Huntsville, Alabama to get them out of the way while the Rough Riders took credit for what they had done.  And my grandfather noticed the discrepancy and, that's putting it mildly, because I'm working with a severe language handicap, because this is not my native language.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Keep going daddy.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay baby.  I'm just apologizing for not being able to get, to--
Speaker 1: That's okay, continue.  Is there anything else about the book the reason why he wrote the book was because there was a discrepancy?
Speaker 2: The introduction and the forward are impeccable, having some of the beautiful, beautiful language at that.  As a matter of fact, I can read it off for you, I got it setting over there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you don't wanna, you don't wanna interrupt right now?
Speaker 1: No, it--that'll be fine.
Story_ID: 544949
Speaker 1: Now tell me where your, your grandparents on your father's side, do you know where they were born.  Well you said your grandmother [Minnie Brewster Cashin] was from Montgomery [Alabama].
Speaker 2: Montgomery, yeah.
Speaker 1: What about your grandfather?  You said he came to Huntsville [Alabama], but where did he come from?
Speaker 2: He was sent, he was sent to Huntsville.  He was one of the early graduates of Cheyney State [Institute for Colored Youth; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania].  It was a Cath- not Catholic, Quaker, Quaker school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But where did he come from?  Do you know where he was born?
Speaker 2: I think he was born in Ireland [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Your grandfather?
Speaker 1: That's Grandfather Herschel [Herschel V. Cashin].
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Not yet.
Speaker 1: He was fresh out of Cheyney State.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  You don't remember what, what state he was born in?  Remember the family story about, about him growing, you were in--
Speaker 1: In Georgia?
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Yeah.  You remember your family story?
Speaker 1: Yes, I do remember it.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Tell her the family story (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me the story.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN): --about Grandpa Herschel.
Speaker 1: He was the, I guess, he was the family secretary, and it seems as if he got married and had, he and his wife had some six children.  Now Sheryll [Sheryll Cashin] I think that--
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  This is a--
Speaker 1: I'm getting, I'm getting foggy.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN): Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, well that's fine if you can't remember.
Story_ID: 544950
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the Cashin name.  Where did Cashin originate from?
Speaker 2: An Ireland man.
Speaker 1: Okay, from Ireland.
Speaker 2: The isle, there's a little piece of, piece of smuggler's territory right in the Irish Sea.  Equidistant from Wales, Scotland and Ireland, smuggler's paradise.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me about your ancestors who came from Ireland.  Was--who was the first one who came?  John Cashin?
Speaker 2: John and two brothers came simultaneously I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's just some cereal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they settled?  Where did they settle?
Speaker 2: In County Cork, Ireland I believe.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but when they came to America they came to Georgia?
Speaker 2: I don't know if they came to Georgia.  All I really get from my father [John Cashin, Sr.] telling me when I was, you know, a little boy, the history of the family, one of the things that I remember so well, and this is where the memory kicks in, was dad hated the British empire.  He said he was just pray that if God would let him live a little longer so he can kill more Englishmen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You got that part too, huh?  Dad used to grit his teeth, he hated the English, the British empire. I found out later (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, let's, let's really talk.  I'm trying to establish the family lineage, and I understand that the Cashins came to America and settled in Augusta, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the son of the Cashins who came here from Ireland married a mulatto woman [Lucenda Boudre Cashin].  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's as close as anybody ever got.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And then Herschel V. Cashin was their sibling, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  It's their son.
Speaker 2: Son.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, their son.  Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: So you got the structure?
Speaker 1: So we got the structure.  Thank you.
Story_ID: 544951
Speaker 1: Tell me, what, what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My third birthday.
Speaker 1: Your third (laughter)--tell me about it. What do you remember?
Speaker 2: I was a prized student in Miss Annie's kindergarten, and on Pulaski Pike, Hunts- there on Huntsville [Alabama], I, I learned, let's see, what is the prime example?  Miss Annie had us doing such things as (singing), "Lift every voice and sing 'til earth and heaven ring, ring with the harmonies of liberty" ['Lift Every Voice and Sing'].  You recognize that song?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.  Well that's my early years, age two and a half, three, three and a half were Miss Annie's kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Now that's something that we need to talk about.  You said you were three and you were in kindergarten.  You went to school very early, is that right?
Speaker 2: I feel like I was picked green, yeah.  That's how I earned my (laughter), my nickname, Mr. Do.  I'd do it, all do, so.
Speaker 1: So you went to kindergarten at three years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, not quite three.  Matter of fact, my third birthday party was, all of the other kids had to be turned loose out in, and brought back after recess and I had the whole yard to myself.  It was my, that was my reward for having done so well in my singing at age three or two point nine.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Who taught you to read daddy?
Speaker 2: Oh boy.  Thanks.
Speaker 1: She taught us how to read on a Ouija board.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Who is she?
Speaker 1: Miss Annie.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  And how old were you when you learned to read?
Speaker 1: Three.  I could do pretty good at age three.  Like I said, I--
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  And who did you compete with all your life, as a young boy?
Speaker 1: My brother.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Who was your brother?
Speaker 1: Herschel V. Cashin--Herschel B. Cashin [Herschel Cashin].  He was.  See, it's little irritants like that (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, so you had already learned to read when you started kindergarten.  Tell me more about your elementary school years.  What school did you go to?
Speaker 1: Councill High School [William Hooper Councill High School, Huntsville, Alabama]
Speaker 2: No, elementary school.
Speaker 1: Elementary School.  They had one school for colored boys and children.  So, Miss Annie ran a--oh gosh.
Speaker 2: Was it the elementary school--?
Speaker 1: In those days, they had elementary school, was first grade.  We just didn't have no elementary division and things like that.  Miss Annie's kindergarten went on up to fourth or fifth.  The children that were going to go to high school were funneled into the system under Miss Annie.
Speaker 2: So Miss Annie's school, the school went from kindergarten to the fourth grade.  Did you go there through the fourth grade?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I didn't know what I was doing.
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: I mean that the organization of formal education was very poorly organized but it was held together with love because every, all of the children knew that Miss Annie was something like a goddess.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Councill School.
Speaker 2: William Hooper Councill School.
Speaker 1: Say it again.
Speaker 2: William Hooper Councill School.  That was the beginning of an organized tax paid institution.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  When did you start Councill?
Speaker 2: I guess you could say at eight.  Oh, boy, thank you.  They tried to get--as a matter of fact, I was so precocious that they, they tried to get me to function at the third grade level in entering into the formal system of education.  They started me in the third grade.
Speaker 1: And you were how old?
Speaker 2: Five.
Speaker 1: Five.  So at five years old you were in the third grade?
Speaker 2: But it was a little bit too much for me, I couldn't hold it.
Story_ID: 544952
Speaker 1: What happened is Herschel [Herschel Cashin] flunked third grade and he dropped back and I caught up.  So we were educated as, as twins (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Together. Okay.
Speaker 1: We were together from then on up.
Speaker 2: Well, let's talk about your brothers and sisters.  Did you--how many brothers and sisters did you have?
Speaker 1: One.
Speaker 2: Just one brother?
Speaker 1: One brother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so that's why you competed a lot because you were in the same grade, yet you were younger than him, is that right?
Speaker 1: Well I, I was so competitive.  I mean I thought that that was my job, to, whatever Herschel did, I'd say I could do it just one better.  That's why I said sometimes I feel like I was picked green and I was serious about that.  I have had to interface with some of Sheryll's [Sheryll Cashin] friends.
Speaker 2: Tell me about the--
Speaker 1: I was full--I was put into the second, third grade with my, with my brother (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Your brother.
Story_ID: 544953
Speaker 1: Tell me about the community where you lived in Huntsville [Alabama] at that time.  When you were in the third grade, tell me about the people who lived around where you lived.
Speaker 2: Well all of the colored folks lived in the same place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about your friends and their parents.  What were the occupations of some of your friends' parents?
Speaker 2: Generally supportive of--it was a slave existence.  The way that my schoolmates, here's a good little anecdote, but my mother [Grace Brandon Cashin] was a school teacher and we were on 509 Oak Avenue.  Our house was kind of headquarters for (unclear) activities.  It was headquarters.  We'd be in the garage and places.  They were just several very interesting old houses that were in that area.  We had a, it was our headquarters, our gang.  I don't know if you can remember, what they call it, not the dead end boys, but what, the little guys.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  'Our Gang'?
Speaker 2: 'Our Gang,' there you go.  But anyhow, in our gang, this was funny, this was really funny.  The white members of our gang were sorely deficient so far as education is concerned.  As a matter of fact, Herschel [Herschel Cashin] and I used to wait on them to come home from school 'cause Herschel and I would do their homework for them.  These two white members, well there were three white members.
Speaker 1: Do you remember their names?
Speaker 2: I remember, it was like they was little brothers.  Dick McCullough [Richard McCullough], who was the son, was the second son of the grocer on the corner.  The other, James Euclid [ph.], we called him Squirt.  Those were the two that was just regular members of the gang.
Story_ID: 544954
Speaker 1: Up comes eleven, eleven and twelve years old. And at age twelve Herschel [Herschel Cashin] and I were confronted with this racist image that they were white and we were black and if we're going to keep this thing together, we gonna have to call, y'all call Dick [Richard McCullough] and Squirt [James Euclid (ph.)] mister, when that announcement was made by Shelby McCullough, a grocer.  Herschel and I started laughing and I don't think we quit laughing yet.
Speaker 2: So you had played with these boys all your life and then when you become eleven and twelve, was it their father's idea to tell them that they needed to start calling (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was their father, their whole family.
Speaker 2: The whole family.  Okay.  So they decided that you needed to call them Mr. So and So.
Speaker 1: Mr. Euclid and Mr.--what, I can't remember what Dick's, Richard, that was Dick's name.  It's funny.
Speaker 2: Did that stop the friendship because you refused to call them mister?
Speaker 1: Of course.  Like I said, it was all over but the laughing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was funny.  So, oh man.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We were talking about the community.  So you had this group even though you played together, even though you were--
Speaker 1: Up to the point that we were lectured by the white grocer's wife, to be sure they understood that we were colored and they were white and Herschel and I, if we were gonna keep your group together, you have to call them mister.
Speaker 2: Where did you play together?
Speaker 1: All over the backyard.  We had a big backyard [in Huntsville, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So they came to your house?
Speaker 1: Yeah, house, like I said our house was the--
Speaker 2: Was the place to hang out.
Speaker 1: --it was the headquarters.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  How was your house compared to the other houses on the block?
Speaker 2: We were two story brick.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Were there any other houses like that?
Speaker 2: Not two story brick, no.
Speaker 1: So think of the, a square block of where you lived.  Tell me what you see or what you smelled or what you hear if you walk that square block from your house all the way around the block.
Speaker 2: Well I'll say--I'm still trying to get around the, the language handicap.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like I said, mixed in with that laughter. (Laughter) These idiots couldn't draw a straight line without referring to me and Herschel and here we have to call them mister.  Where did they get this from?  Heck, the only place they could get it from was from the white supremacists. Yeah. And these people actually believed that crap (laughter).
Story_ID: 544955
Speaker 1: So now take me around the block, take me on a trip around your block.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right. Womack's Grocery [ph.], and let's see, Womack's Grocery was across the street.  McCullough's grocery was over actually on the block.  Okay, now, Drake Taxicab [Drake Taxi Company] was the first one, yeah, Drake and she was, what did we call that woman?  Anyhow she didn't count.  Mrs. Drake, she was trying, a (unclear), trying to get together enough money to, to buy a house up on the mountain.  That was the thing.
Speaker 1: What mountain are you talking about?
Speaker 2: Monte Sano [Monte Sano Mountain].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of them healthy mountains.  Okay.  Headed south, okay, William Street [sic. Williams Avenue] was a dead end.  Williams, okay, McCullough Grocery was right there in the corner, then next to that was the carriage street.  Oh yes, this gave us a whole lot of territory because Dr. McInally [ph.] had undergone a very serious emotional trauma, and his property was just laying there for the kids to--Dr. Ira's [ph.] headquarters.  As a matter of fact, the bats hung out in our cave.  We could go into the carriage house and stir it with a stick and get five or six bats flying around, the flying foxes.  It was a great thing, but anyhow McInally thing went around the corner and ended in a large play- a large acreage, and that was our baseball field and everything.  So now.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  What was the name of the neighborhood daddy?
Speaker 2: What did we call that?
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Where all the black people lived in Huntsville [Alabama].
Speaker 2: What you asking about is not Nigger Main, but what the heck is the name of that?
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  What kind of trees was in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Oak.  Oak Avenue [sic. Oak Street] was the name of it.  One of those oak trees was three, four times the size at the bole of the tree, huge.  Man those oak trees, but you were talking about the Grove.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Right.
Speaker 2: Is it Oak Grove, the name of the community?
Speaker 1: It was just called the Grove.
Speaker 2: Oh, the Grove, okay.
Speaker 1: But we had a pecan tree and I can remember, I can remember right now it had a better taste to any pecan I ever had.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  There was a grove of pecan trees wasn't there?
Speaker 1: Grove that's on the other side of Oak Avenue and Church Street.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  And everybody black in the town lived in the Grove?
Speaker 2: Pretty much. Had, had--in the Grove.  That was, that was the neighborhood.
Story_ID: 544956
Speaker 1: Tell me about your, your father's [John Cashin, Sr.] business.  What did your father do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a dentist.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where did he go to school?
Speaker 2: Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and Meharry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he tell you any stories about the times that he spent at Meharry?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: You want to share?
Speaker 2: Oh, I will.  First of all, understand that I did not want to be a dentist in the first place.  I wanted to be a lawyer.  But Herschel [Herschel Cashin] was thirteen months older.  He was the elder son in the family and in those days, I mean you did what you were told to do.  I say when I'm knee high to a bicycle pump I knew I was going to Fisk and possibly Meharry.  Whenever we were introduced to anybody, one's gonna be a doctor, the other gonna be a lawyer.  I listened to that so many times, I knew one's gonna be a doctor and I was, and one was gonna be a lawyer.  When Herschel came of age, he applied to take the Alabama bar.
Story_ID: 544957
Speaker 1: Before we get there, let's, let's go to high school for you before we talk about, because he had to have gone already to college, but--
Speaker 2: High school was fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me what high school you went to.
Speaker 2: Alabama A and M High School [Normal, Alabama].
Speaker 1: And tell me about your experiences there.
Speaker 2: Well, this was the reason I feel like I married my, my mother [Grace Brandon Cashin], because of Louise [Louise White Cashin], my mother was a high school principal too.
Speaker 1: When was she a principal?
Speaker 2: She was director of the Teacher Corps.  I mean the big one, the international--Louise, what's this thing--?
Speaker 1: (LOUISE WHITE CASHIN):  National Teacher Corps.
Speaker 2: National Teacher Corps.  You got two Ph.D.'s?
Speaker 1: (LOUISE WHITE CASHIN):  No, one was sufficient.
Speaker 2: So you went to Alabama A and M High School.
Speaker 1: I went to Alabama A and M, yeah.
Speaker 2: And tell me how were your high school days?  Did you play sports, were you on the debate club?  Tell me about your experience during high school.
Speaker 1: Well, I lived on the dormitory.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I pursued the Eagle Scouts constituency.  I was, I was a little too young to enjoy the full fruits of the organization that I found myself invigorated by.  So--
Speaker 2: Which organization are we talking about?
Speaker 1: National Honor Society and little things like that.  But like I said, at that time I was, I felt like I was picked green and I was going to enjoy everything that came down the pipe because they kept me so busy.  I mean every time they ring a damn bell--
Speaker 2: How old were you when you went to high school?
Speaker 1: Fifteen.
Speaker 2: Fifteen.  Okay.  And you belonged to the honor society.  What other organizations?
Speaker 1: Between Herschel [Herschel Cashin] and Helen [ph.], we had three, how can I forget that girl's name?
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  You talking about who you graduated with?
Speaker 1: Graduated with. We had three valedictorians.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Ethel?
Speaker 1: Ethel Harris [Ethel Harris Hall], yeah.  So, yeah--
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  You got, you got to tell the story.  What is it you're trying to tell her?
Speaker 1: How did the school wind up with three valedictorians?
Speaker 2: Because we had a very small class to start with.  There was only nineteen in the whole high school.  And it was really easy.  My brother was my roommate and we was living on the campus, and Ethel was, was so, so--
Speaker 1: Who graduated at the top of the class?
Speaker 2: Herschel, Ethel and me.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  What were your grades like?
Speaker 2: Straight A's.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Why?
Speaker 2: Because I, (laughter) because I was a smart ass.
Story_ID: 544958
Speaker 1: All right.  We were--
Speaker 2: Boo (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) talking about high school [Alabama A and M High School, Normal, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Well, actually, the commitment to--thanks baby. When Herschel [Herschel Cashin] and I were just, just little, there was room for us under the dining room table.  We would, Herschel and I would just listen to the old folks.  We knew their voices, but dad [John Cashin, Sr.] had his song, story.  Uncle Lulyn [sic.] who was a comic, Newlyn Sykes, Leo Sykes.  It was children, who understood that we were in a racist society.  We didn't know it, but I can remember my dad when he, he would take a little swig of Canadian Club and somewhere down the line after the second, third ablution, something would have to be done about the colonial empire of Great Britain.  But the main trouble that we had and this is 1901, Alabama, and oh boy, this comes back and it comes back hard too.  The Alabama Constitution of 1901 was a contrivance to put, to neutralize any of the political assets and then political results or consequences of progress of the Civil War.  They botched it.  Our so called friends.  They were more interested in money and power than they were in liberation of 5 million people.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  What did the family call the Alabama Constitution of 1901?  What was the family joke?
Speaker 2: The liberation--cash and castration constitution.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Why did they call it that?
Speaker 2: Because Alabama adopted a constitution in 1901 that eradicated all of the, all of the features in the, in the Constitution of 19- of 1875.  But I have heard so many railments and my grandfather [Herschel V. Cashin] was dead, but he, the people that he was familiar with, his gang, which that included Frederick Douglass and it included William Hooper Councill who is glorified as the, as the messiah for blacks in this native country.
Speaker 1: So you and your brother would sit under the table and listen to stories that the older people would talk about?  And what did you and your brother decide to do as you got older?
Speaker 2: We said that we were going to finish, yeah, finish the job because they, they adopted this new constitution that really violated every doggone thing, oh gosh.  I don't know how to say it other than, it's just, our war and I was highly prepared because Herschel was the lawyer.  I was in the--what happened, and Herschel was, Herschel would have made a perfect candidate for anything he wanted to.  Herschel was so damn honest he made me sick.
Story_ID: 544959
Speaker 1: Now tell me about other activities because we're getting ready to get you out of high school [Alabama A and M High School, Normal, Alabama], graduating from high school.  What were some of the other activities that you participated in in school?  You said you were in the scouts.
Speaker 2: I was the first black Eagle Scout in Alabama.
Speaker 1: First black Eagle Scout.  Okay.  What about music?
Speaker 2: Music.  I was good enough to hold fifth trumpet at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was good ranking.  You know anything at all about Tennessee State collegiate?
Speaker 1: No, sir.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We won the career band award in 1940, '47 [1947], something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: I kind of halfway scored in that one, but my contribution was not professionally music (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 544960
Speaker 1: And in the neighborhood at that time, the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] was segregated.  Is that right?  Tell me about your experience with the YMCA.
Speaker 2: We have to go backwards on this one 'cause I was a model airplane enthusiast.  We built models but we had to buy this little box kits at the hardware stores and nothing even approached service on supplies and things of that kind, but I had a deal going with Paul Taylor.  Paul Taylor was our newsboy, Huntsville news, Huntsville Times [The Huntsville Times], so I would get Paul, get all the box of very specialist type of things I knew that I needed.  But it was only could be had not commercially, but it could be had at the YMCA program.  So I would have a list, pass it through the window to Paul and he would make up my commodity list and I'd pay him and then go on the next load.  Now--
Speaker 1: Where did you have to go because you couldn't go into the YMCA, right?
Speaker 2: That's exactly, that's exactly what I was getting to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The model access was through one of the front windows down (unclear) at the ground level.  It also was an entry for the cleaning effort from the, from the main part of the YMCA.  So this afternoon I was through the window, telling Paul what I wanted him to bring me out and all of a sudden here comes a cascade of filthy water splashed, mop bucket full and I said not joking, I said, "Hey, you better watch it too, you might get somebody wet."  Hardy, ha, ha, ha.  He said, "Right young nigger and if you stay there much longer I'm gonna drown your black ass."  This is what a white male Christian, you know, adult male Christian had to say to a nine year old boy, real Christianity.  I love him for it.  I love him to death.  And the sooner the better (laughter).
Speaker 1: So someone found out that Paul was helping you by selling you the parts for your model airplane, and didn't like that idea and didn't want you to come back?
Speaker 2: No, this guy didn't have, I don't know who he was, but I know he was--
Speaker 1: Just the fact that you were black and you were there.
Speaker 2: Hanging out the window.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was enough for him.  I don't think he put any thought into it, I think it was just spur of the moment.  Here's an opportunity to go egging some niggers, you know.
Story_ID: 544961
Speaker 1: I understand that your, your family is political, but what about religion?  Did your family attend church?
Speaker 2: I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everybody, everybody was part of the church.  I was looking around for my wife [Louise White Cashin] 'cause she's a deacon in the Baptist church, 60th Street, and I have to be very careful.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  What was your father's [John Cashin, Sr.] attitude about religion?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) He said, "John [HistoryMaker Dr. John Cashin], you gonna find as you grow older that colored folks' problem is not going to be freedom of religion, it's gonna be freedom from religion," and I found no reason to disagree with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  But your mom [Grace Brandon Cashin]?
Speaker 1: My mother was a saint.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Was she a churchgoer?
Speaker 1: She was a churchgoer, yeah.
Speaker 2: Where did she go to church?
Speaker 1: Lakeside [Lakeside United Methodist Church, Huntsville, Alabama].  I mean the super snob (unclear), Lakeside, it's out on Meridian Street now.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  What denomination?
Speaker 1: A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal].  Is that (unclear).
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  I don't know, I'm asking, I don't know.
Speaker 1: No, all your buddies--say by the way, how did--?
Speaker 2: Wait, wait. (Laughter) Let's finish talking about this.  So you did not go to church with your mother?
Speaker 1: I went with--I was sort of, I was the boy soprano in the choir.  That was on my mother's kind of sponsorship, but my career as a choir boy did not last. It lasted right up to my voice start to cracking.  This little thing called adolescence, and I kept telling my mother, "Hey baby, I ain't gonna be able to do this soprano for God no more."  "Oh yes, you can do anything."  I, so I front stage center right in the pulpit, my voice cracked, wouldn't come back.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: So I shed a few tears for my mother's embarrassment, but that was, that was about the end of my career as a choir boy.  Even my mother gave up on me.
Speaker 2: All right.  Let's get to the point.
Speaker 1: By the way, you recognize that song?
Speaker 2: What song?
Speaker 1: 'Lift Every Voice and Sing'?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just want to be sure.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 544962
Speaker 1: You and your brother [Herschel Cashin] are preparing to go to college and you are pretty sure that you would go where?
Speaker 2: Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So tell me how you prepared.  Before, wait, before we even get there, you told me that you were one of the valedictorians for your high school [Alabama A and M High School, Normal, Alabama].  Tell me about how your mother [Grace Brandon Cashin] made sure, or your mother and father [John Cashin, Sr.], your parents, made sure that you would become excellent students.  What was the rule of thumb at home (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The rule was if you didn't come back with A's, you got your ass whipped. (Laughter) That's just as close as I can get it, you know.  So no questions, I mean don't, don't bring me no bad news. So. That's the good short subject.
Speaker 1: Well, did you ever get a whipping for not bringing an A?
Speaker 2: Not after, not after I got grown.  See I was sort of free there for the two years I was in high school Mr. Elmore [T.M. Elmore], you get away with anything.  He was such a nice guy.  They named the gymnasium [T.M. Elmore Gymnasium, Normal, Alabama] after him.
Speaker 1: Mr. Elmore?
Speaker 2: T- yeah, T.J. Elmore [sic.].
Speaker 1: How did he influence you?
Speaker 2: Well he was a factor to being admired.  He was a good guy and very sympathetic, and if you didn't understand something, Mr. Elmore would straighten you out.
Story_ID: 544963
Speaker 1: I need to also tell you too that, I'm trying to figure out how I got--I went to Alabama A and M [Alabama A and M High School, Normal, Alabama], that's right, I had the hustle that we made, that Herschel [Herschel Cashin] and I did.  We both wanted to stay out on the campus of A and M.
Speaker 2: Did you go to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] first?  Did you ever go to Fisk?  Okay, well tell me about where you went to college first.
Speaker 1: Well, I thought I died and gone to heaven when I saw them pretty women at Fisk.  I mean, just royalty passing.
Speaker 2: Tell me about your first year in college.
Speaker 1: My first year?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It was a struggle to stay alive.  Alabama A and M High School did not prepare me for going to Fisk.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So my academic powers had severely curved shall we say.  I was not straight A.  I was passable.  I had some very decent grades, but it was not the stuff I used to and I was on the dormitory at Alabama A and M, so I did not have a mother to whip my behind, you know, so I became kind of lax, just putting it mild, but I became involved in giving little girls at play and since, how can I say this, giving music a chance, I became, this is through my frat, Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], as Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] was forming a collegiate marching band and the bandmaster was Chick Chavis [Jordan D. "Chick" Chavis] who was another fraternity brother of mine.  And Chick Chavis not only was the bandmaster, he was mission--
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  You're skipping ahead from Fisk to Tennessee State.  Tell us first about your experience at Fisk.
Story_ID: 544964
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I followed the family tradition there at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] 'cause back then they had expelled my father [John Cashin, Sr.] for being--actually, he was, he tells me and I have no reason to doubt him, that his expulsion was moved by an old professor that flunked him in Bible because he smelled smoke on his sweater and the sweater that he was, had been smoking weed.  But he confessed.  It was just tobacco, but anyhow he was a tobacco freak.
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  (Simultaneous) He wasn't expelled, he just, he got flunked in Bible, right.
Speaker 2: He got flunked in Bible, that's true.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  But he didn't get his Fisk degree.
Speaker 2: He did not, I can't figure what it was, there was some kind of compromise, had great controversy, you see, because my favorite aunt [Lillian Cashin] was the head of the English department at Fisk.  My Uncle James [James Cashin], my rich uncle, had a, was on the trustee board, and I was able to, I felt that I had enough clout that I could get away with having a big party in the dormitory.
Speaker 1: So this was at Fisk?
Speaker 2: This was at Fisk.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So this was in your first year.
Speaker 2: No, I finished the first year, this is in my second year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That I was confronted with a birthday and beautiful girls and spring weather.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a big party on campus?
Speaker 2: In the dormitory.
Speaker 1: In the dormitory, okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't all that big, it was probably six, seven couples.  They had nice apartments.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  But what was the significance of having this coed birthday party?  What did that lead to?
Speaker 1: It lead to some, some of my close friends having more than required noise, and right in the middle of the party, and we had, we had a fifth of Old Forester.  In those days liquor was hard to get.  But anyhow, we heard this knock, (makes sound).  Who is it?  It's the president.  I said, "The president? Piss on the floor and swim under him."
Speaker 2: Who was the president?
Speaker 1: It was the president.
Speaker 2: But what was his name?
Speaker 1: Jones.
Speaker 2: Okay, so tell me what happened when the president knocked on the door?
Speaker 1: Well finally, we evacuated everybody.  They tipped out the back stairs and I figured we had so much clout assembled there that they couldn't say no. You know, trustee board.  I'm the nephew of the chairman of the trustee board.  They showed me what that was worth.  So, Thomas Elsa Jones.  That was the name.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  The name of who?
Speaker 1: The president.
Speaker 2: The president.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Oh, Thomas Elsa Jones was the name of the president, okay.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: And Wilshire [ph.], the night watchman.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Were at the door?
Speaker 2: Were at the door, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So after everybody left, the president confronted you?
Speaker 2: Confronted, he had every man on campus go into his office and pass through there trying to get some signs of recognition 'cause if you got nine folks there partying, and I would come out and act like I don't know anything.  This is just, wonder what's going on here.  But they didn't buy it.  But to digress to some of the powers that I had, be they ever so shrunken.
Speaker 1: What did they decide?  Could you stay on campus, or leave school?  What was decided?
Speaker 2: The dean of men drove me home.  He wanted to be sure that this was delivered properly. So.
Speaker 1: So you were expelled?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I was expelled or not.
Story_ID: 544965
Speaker 1: There's some other part to this story (laughter) too, see.
Speaker 2: Okay, well tell me.  Tell me what, tell me the story.
Speaker 1: Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], no not Fisk per se, but Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], here it comes in, so I literally hit the streets with my trumpet, and I had--Tennessee State was doing this high school marching band and we--Tennessee State, and we were, we were the best over the country.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  So you left Fisk and enrolled into--
Speaker 1: I, I left Fisk with some encouragement, encouragement of absence.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So after you left Fisk you went home and then you were admitted to Tennessee State (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then--no.
Speaker 2: No.  Okay.
Speaker 1: There's a little, a little, what they called it, a little resting point.  I went out to Tennessee State, me and my horn became, I'll say like this, I was not the best trumpet player available, but I was the loudest.  That's very important when you're putting stuff on the front row.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  And that's how you got into Tennessee State?
Speaker 1: That's how I got into Tennessee State.  I played my way in there, but it was--
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  You got a music scholarship?
Speaker 1: Well, you can call it a scholarship if you want to.  We had some election.  Now I think I told you about this. Hemphill Press?
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Yeah, you told me.
Speaker 1: My fraternity ties began to come into a sympathetic movement, both the bandmaster and the guy who, Sonny Hemphill who owned the credit company in North Nashville [Nashville, Tennessee].  I had access to, I had taken printing in high school [Alabama A and M High School, Normal, Alabama], so it just so happen that around that time, they were having an election and black newspapers, the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] band--you never even heard of the, the Courier band poll.  You have?
Speaker 2: You can tell me about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The Courier, Pittsburgh Courier and the, what was the other one?  But in any case, both of them and they had this election coming up and I showed them what I did not apologize for was my propensity with friendships and officers.  I rigged the election okay?  Just as plain and simple.  Okay, good.  We had some rather, you seen that--.  Louise [Louise White Cashin], would you tell our listeners what your reaction was when I introduced you to Tennessee State, the election.
Speaker 2: (LOUISE WHITE CASHIN):  He had more votes than they had voters.  That's the essence of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Tennessee State won that poll.  That's all that counts they say.
Speaker 1: So tell me more about your experience at Tennessee State now that that's where you are.  How are you doing academically?
Speaker 2: I was serious.  I was confronted with top drawer.  These were the top black youngsters in the country.  I mean Chick Chavis [Jordan D. "Chick" Chavis] was all over the country.  He the best ones in Chicago [Illinois], Birmingham [Alabama], Memphis [Tennessee], I mean, I was real proud.  But like I said, the guy that did the body snatching was Chick Chavis and here we had a president at Tennessee State that was quite sympathetic with the Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] scholarship.
Speaker 1: Who was the president at that time?
Speaker 2: Walter Davis [Walter S. Davis].
Story_ID: 544966
Speaker 1: We were talking about Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], but you talked about Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Omega Psi Phi?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  When did you pledge?
Speaker 2: In spring of 1942, '43 [1943], '42 [1942].
Speaker 1: This was your first year at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: First year at Fisk, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now also you enjoy flying, right?
Speaker 2: That's putting it mildly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about that.  Tell me when was the first time you decided that this was something you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: It was something I almost had to do.  I helped set up the model airplane program at Tennessee State.  And the deal was they wanted to get a flying program started there, so they took all of my models and stuff like that and Bill Clark [ph.] stuff too, and that's part of a museum now at Tennessee State.  Now to compensate me for my antique--I had, I had some pretty nice little models and including some of the one cylinder Olsen 16s [ph.], those are the one cylinder gasoline engine.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So anyhow and we had two link trainers, it was, it was not all that elaborate but it was something that, I don't know if it, it didn't even exist at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] when it should have, but we set up that program and--there.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  But to compensate you for giving the planes you were saying--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I gave, they gave me forty hours of free time flying the little link trainer, the, oh, god, what was that, Ercoupe.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  You learned to fly in an Ercoupe?
Speaker 2: That was my first solo, yeah.  That's right, you weren't there as my witness.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about--
Speaker 2: I used to take her places.
Speaker 1: You used to fly her around?
Speaker 2: She's good company.
Story_ID: 544967
Speaker 1: Tell me about your double load of taking classes at both (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was easy.  It was if you could get past those the record keepers.  Just don't mention that you went somewhere else, just go on and do what you wanna do.
Speaker 1: Well, first, let's just, tell me about, well the fact that you had to leave Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] left you with a lot of incompletes.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I got a full load of incompletes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So tell me how, did you manage to be able to complete those incompletes at Fisk and go to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: It was easy.  It was already paid for.  Fisk did not particularly want to refund my dad's [John Cashin, Sr.] money, but, you know, in those days, we did believe in cash and so forth.  But it, it just fit in so nicely.
Speaker 1: So you appealed to them to allow you just to finish the incompletes?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  That's right, that's right.  I didn't mention any details or anything like that, but there were some people in there that were, they would hope that I was not be successful because I represented a little challenge on certain propensities shall we say, you know.
Speaker 1: So you took a full load at both schools.
Speaker 2: I took a full load and heavy, heavy stuff.
Speaker 1: What were some of the classes?  Do you remember, that you were taking?
Speaker 2: Physics, comparative anatomy, bacteriology, I mean you name it, all of the muscle stuff.  I mean I had a coach, Bob Ellis [Robert A. Ellis, Jr.], Bob was closest to, to a genius, he was the closest thing to a genius I ever met and Bob Ellis was my fraternity brother [in Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].  As a matter of fact, he's the man that discovered the Van Allen radiation belts.  You ever heard anything about that?
Speaker 1: So you were preparing to go to Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  Did you know that that's where you would go when you finished?
Speaker 2: I didn't know that, but it became apparent to us that's what I was gone do when Herschel [Herschel Cashin] chose to go into law.  So he matriculated into law at, what was that?
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Northwestern [Northwestern University School of Law; Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Northwestern, one of those (laughter) second rate law schools.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Stick with the story daddy about how you carried these two loads.
Speaker 2: Well, it was easy.  In preparing for entrance into the professional world, I had an opportunity, I took organic chemistry at Fisk and take organic chemistry at Tennessee State.  In those days, laboratory facilities were really short and they were taking classes, they were scheduling classes from seven o'clock in the morning 'til nine o'clock at night.  That's made to order for a thief (laughter).  So nothing dishonest, we just pushed things a bit, a little adjustment here, a little adjustment there.
Story_ID: 544968
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  But didn't you tell me about how you'd have to take a class at one place and then jump on the bus and--
Speaker 2: The Jefferson Street bus was--you don't know Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] at all, huh?  The Jefferson Street buses ran every five minutes.  And if you, if you could make the tail end of one, you'd be there for the start of the next one.  Didn't need, certainly didn't need a car.  Cars were rare in those days, very rare.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Who were your professors?  You had a professor at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]--
Speaker 2: Professor James Lawson [James R. Lawson].  He, a guy name Posey [Leroy R. Posey] was the, was the Tennessee State physics.  At Fisk it was James Lawson who became the president of Fisk, James Lawson.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Will you tell them the story about how you would get the homework assignment from one?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  That's easy, that was easy.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Tell her.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I went to the facilitate bus schedules.  It was easy to make the connection, but now with buses running every five minutes on five minute job.  There would always gonna be a, a bus leaving from five minutes.  You were never late.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  This was about the professors and how, remember you'd tell me the story about how, if you had a problem with the homework at Fisk, you'd go to your professor at Tennessee State.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well that's so obvious.  Not only so obvious, the thing was this fraternity I'm a member of, Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], has four cardinal principles.  Cardinal principles is manhood, scholarship, uplifting, perseverance.  Now I came off the hell week with, on my seventeenth birthday, and I was creature of academics.  As a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's go back now to Tennessee State and Fisk and what Sheryll [Sheryll Cashin] was saying was that you had it pretty easy even though it seemed like it would be hard to, to have two full loads, but you were able to--
Speaker 2: Play them off.  I kill this duck over here and when the ashes from that duck has got one over here, a pile of ashes here, fire them up there and sell them over here.
Speaker 1: All right.  So how long did, did this go on?
Speaker 2: Until I, until I--
Speaker 1: Was it only one semester that you had to do this?
Speaker 2: No, I was, it was more than one semester.  I did a quarter, I had a sweet thing going, I'll just say it like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 544969
Speaker 1: Once you have completed the incompletes at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville Tennessee] and you're at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], how do you begin to prepare for the next stage of education?
Speaker 2: The graduate work?  Well, I always wanted a degree from Tennessee State University.  This was in the days when Tennessee State was really pushing for university status and I had sympathy for that because the president of the school, Walter, Walter Lewis [sic. Walter S. Davis], he was an Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] and he would, and when we had a program that we were going to bring the very best that black education had to offer.  We were gonna bring them up and have a few things to say about what the future look like.  Walter Lewis was fully dedicated to that, to that program.  We had a program, social thing at the Omega ball, spring ball, and Dr. Davis and Dr. Singleton [J.B. Singleton], that's holy Joe.  Those two were, we were just exchanging greetings and Dr. Singleton was a provost at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], and like I said, just another Omega man.  I played it, I play it to the hilt, but I got great benefits out of it.  Jimmy Singleton said, "Look, you want, do you want this degree?"  I said, "Yeah, I do."  He said, "Well I'll, we'll get it for you, but you got to lead your class at Meharry."
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  You have to explain that you were admitted to Meharry before you actually graduated from Tennessee State.  They admitted you out of your junior year, right?
Speaker 2: That was their problem then (laughter).
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  You applied to Meharry in your junior year at Tennessee State, right?
Speaker 2: Sheryll [Sheryll Cashin], I'll, I'll be very honest with you.  I don't know how I got into Meharry.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  But you did.
Speaker 2: I know that I had one guy, no two, that went to bat for me, and that was Carl Henry, Cliff Dummett [Clifton O. Dummett, Jr.], I had to remember, Carl Henry, Cliff (unclear).  No, those two, I know they was some kind of, some kind of--
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  They admitted you based on how well you had done as an undergraduate?
Speaker 2: They admitted me at Meharry because Carl Henry told them that my grades were superior to anything else that was on there and if they did not accept me at Meharry he was going to resign as a faculty.  That's the kind of friend.  You put that down, I don't think you can.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  So this social you were talking about with--
Speaker 2: It was the spring.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN): --after your first year at Meharry, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Story_ID: 544970
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Now you can tell the story about the pleasantries were being exchanged between these two presidents.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And he said, he said you can have the degree, this is Walter Lewis [Sic. Walter S. Davis], president of Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], and he said, "You want that, we want to have scholarship in front rather than just a glory type thing."  I mean they were very sincere about having the, having broached, what they used to call, the cow college brand.  That cow college at Tennessee State.  So, like I said, I really don't know the details.
Speaker 1: But you went to Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] in your junior year at Tennessee State?  You were admitted?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  I was admitted and in my senior year, I--
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  You were admitted as a junior.  You skipped your senior year and went straight to Meharry.
Speaker 2: I caught, I caught the bus to Meharry.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Yeah, but you were saying that at this, the spring Omega ball [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity]--
Speaker 2: I made the deal with Singleton [J.B. Singleton] and Lewis and Walter, president of--
Speaker 1: Walter Lewis.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I made the deal--
Speaker 1: That you would still get your degree.  Is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: --that I would get the degree from Tennessee State, yeah.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  If you did what?
Speaker 2: If I lead the class.
Speaker 1: Class, at Meharry.
Speaker 2: At Meharry, yeah.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  And, what happened?
Speaker 2: Four years later I walked away with my degree.  Straight A's.  No, not straight A's, one C (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what did you get a C in?
Speaker 2: Dental materials.  It was held on Saturday morning and that Saturday morning was I was bootlegging dentistry (laughter) and--
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Tell her what award you got when you graduated from Meharry.
Speaker 2: Alpha Omega.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  And tell her what that is.
Speaker 2: Alpha Omega scholarship is given to a student that leads his class and prevails in class with the highest general average for four years and for the four years, and, of course, I did it.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Meharry?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-two [1952].
Story_ID: 544971
Speaker 1: Now tell me what happens next in your life, after you graduate from Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: I got drafted (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me about that experience.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: You went into what?
Speaker 2: I was drafted by the United States Army.  I was sent this beautiful letter: congratulations, for your information you have been appointed a first lieutenant in the United States Army.  If for any reason you refuse to accept this commission, if you accept this commission, we will be asking you to report for induction at Fort Sam Houston [San Antonio, Texas] on May the 30th.  If for any reason that you refuse this commission, you are to report immediately at Fort, some place in Georgia, immediately for induction into the army.  So--
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  As a?
Speaker 2: As--
Speaker 1: Oh, as captain.
Speaker 2: Okay, they, you were to accept a commission as first lieutenant or, or whatever?
Speaker 1: You'd be a buck private if you report for duty as a private, enlisted man.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They play rough when they want somebody.  And anybody with any sense, he, it ain't worth fighting for.  Go on and do what they want you to.
Speaker 2: Would there be a reason why you wouldn't accept the commission?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The thing was I had worked so hard to get an exemption.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  But the joke was that the letter, in theory, you weren't drafted, but basically they gave you a choice between accepting the officer commission or being a buck private.  You had to do one or the other.
Speaker 1: Psychological warfare is very prominent in the medical and dental career.  Is that the, is that the architecture you wish me to elaborate?
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Well, that was your joke.  That was the thing--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the thing I'm proudest of, hey, I made four years on top at Meharry.  Jeez, this creme de la creme.  Even if he is a crazy nigger.  You got to admit, put that star on him.  He earned it.
Speaker 2: So you accepted the commission and tell me what happens next.
Speaker 1: Two years of real, sure enough dental practice, 'cause they, the Army needed dentists bad, and they told, I was chief of dental services for eleven thousand people.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Where?
Speaker 1: In Fontainebleau, France.  That was an enjoyable trip too.
Speaker 2: Was it?  Tell me why.  What did you enjoy about the trip?
Speaker 1: Well, first of all I thought that I was, had had my exemption from the induction into the Army.  I thought I had that all arranged, but about a week after, about a week after I had gotten this appointment, they hit me with this letter of commission, so I had this brand new Chrysler 300 and it would turn heads back then and it would outrun anything except that damn Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz].  I took it to Europe with me I had a little, I had a whole lot of fun with that car, I'll just say it like that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 544972
Speaker 1: So tell me about France. (Background noise) Was this the first time you were out of the country?
Speaker 2: Other than Mexico.
Speaker 1: (Background noise) Tell me about France.  Can you remember?
Speaker 2: Every young man wants to go to France and I was no different.  But the one thing that, that I got from France was being a man in a foreign country, which is an entirely new different experience from what I had been taught in my home.  I was treated like a human being.  As soon as I got back from, from the [U.S.] Army, I started, started exhibiting one of my new forms, new found status as a human being.  I guess you can say that I--
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Tell her about some of ex-pats that you, the black ex-pats that you--
Speaker 2: Richard Wright.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Tell her the story about what Richard Wright (unclear) of you.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, that's--
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  First explain how you became friends with Richard Wright.
Speaker 2: Do you know who Richard Wright was?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Oh, you do.  Okay.  I have to stop and explain that to some people sometimes.
Speaker 1: Well, go ahead and explain who he is because there are some people that will be watching this that won't know who he is.
Speaker 2: Richard Wright was like the house mother (laughter).
Speaker 1: Wait, before you, before you go into that, let's change the tape so we can--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: All right tell us about Richard Wright.  Tell us who he is.
Speaker 1: He was.  He's not too alive these days.  Richard Wright was the author of the first international story of racial exploitation I guess, psychological--
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  What's the name of the book?
Speaker 1: 'Native Son' [Richard Wright].  'Native Son.'
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  He said he, the book was out, but--
Speaker 1: The book was a sensation all around the world.  Much more so than 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley].
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  And you said he was the mother hen of the ex-pat community.
Speaker 1: I just said the mother hen, really he was the emeritus of the group and let say the other group included Ollie Stewart.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Tell her who Ollie Stewart was.
Speaker 1: You don't know who Ollie Stewart was?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do you remember a character named Bootsie in black newspapers?
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Who Ollie Stewart write for?
Speaker 1: The Pittsburgh Courier [sic. Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers].
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  I thought it was the Chicago--
Speaker 1: Sure was, Chicago Defender, Chicago Defender [sic.], excuse me.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  And so?
Speaker 1: A lot of these little points are still rusty, you know.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Well explain to her how Ollie Stewart was at the center of the black (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, he was, he's, he's a writer.  He was probably had a sense of humor and he also had a brother who was practicing medicine in Gadsden, Alabama.  We were pretty close people.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  But he wrote for the Defender.
Speaker 1: He wrote. Yeah, he's, he wrote a regular column for the Defender.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  So all the black ex-pats who came through France would see Ollie, right?
Speaker 1: They had to go by and see Ollie.
Story_ID: 544973
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  And what was the restaurant you guys would hang out in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Big Ol-
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Where would you get your soul food?
Speaker 2: Etats Unis, the Chicago [Illinois] poor boy, the down home food.  It was very likeable place because Roughhouse Haynes [Leroy Haynes] was a star running back with Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and when he came out of the service, yeah, when he came out of the service, he married this French girl and they started, they started the restaurant [Chez Haynes, Paris, France].
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  And that's where all the black ex-pats would go in Paris [France] for their soul food?
Speaker 2: That is right.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  And did you tell me that if you wanted to see somebody--
Speaker 2: If you wanted to see somebody just hang around Ollie Stewart for a little while, they'll show up.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  And that's how you met Richard Wright?
Speaker 2: That is exactly how I met Richard Wright.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  And tell about the conversations you would have with Richard Wright.
Speaker 2: The conversation I had with Richard Wright was when I was ready to come home, at dinner the following Sunday he asked me to do something I didn't particularly--he knew that it was a distasteful thing to me, but he said that, "John [HistoryMaker Dr. John Cashin], would you do me the favor of wearing your uniform when you come to dinner for the last time?"  He said, "My girls have never seen a black [U.S.] Army officer."  He said, "I just like to show them who you are," and I've cried over this many a time.  But the suggestion was not lost on me. I've--
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  You used to eat dinner regularly with Richard Wright?
Speaker 2: Well not regularly, (laughter) but I'm not going to, I'm not gonna eat--but that's another way.  Surely you can get into French cooking and you get to fighting.
Speaker 1: So you wear your uniform and?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he asked me to, whether I had, I liked it or not.  I said that's something, it's a tearful experience.  I'll just say it like that.  Just like I think of the things that my brother [Herschel Cashin]--
Speaker 1: Your brother?
Speaker 2: --went through.
Story_ID: 544974
Speaker 1: You were talking about the fact that you were getting ready to go home and you had your last dinner with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My date of, my date of discharge [from the U.S. Army] was May the 12th.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And Richard Wright, you had conversations with him and he was--
Speaker 2: The last supper (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) very bitter.  (Laughter) Okay, the last supper.  Okay, and he was very bitter about the United States, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: Some bitterness rubbed off on me too.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you had, you were given the opportunity to take a commission in Tokyo [Japan] rather than come to the United States and you made a decision to come home.  Tell me why.
Speaker 2: Actually, they offered me, not just to, of course at that time I was a captain, but then they gave me what is called a kick in the pants sort of promotion.  In other words, you sign up for two more years.  I think they might have wanted four years.
Speaker 1: Stop for a minute.
Speaker 2: Telephone wire?
Speaker 1: Unh-uh.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Where was I at?
Speaker 1: You were saying they gave you a kick in the pants.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  They said if you signed up for another, I think, they went four years, we'll give you, give you Tokyo.  I wanted that.  I did want to see what Tokyo was like.  And the guy in personnel said, "We can see through that so easy."  There was a time that you--he was saying, "You are looking for a trip that everybody in the [U.S.] Army wants."  They said, "Well now, we ain't gonna give you Tokyo but say probably can give something closer to that."  But, I said, "Well if you can't give me Tokyo, I ain't going."  And they said, "We will send you home by row boat." (Laughter) Well, I came home by, we flew a DC-7 [Douglas DC-7] back.
Story_ID: 544975
Speaker 1: You wanted to come home, you were saying you wanted to be where the action was.  What was going on in the states?
Speaker 2: The Montgomery Bus Boycott (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Boycott, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Just pure and simple.  This is the battle, the struggle, that Herschel [Herschel Cashin] and I had given our lives to.  I mean that was, that was point of discussion.  That's everything and then Robert Ellis [Robert A. Ellis, Jr.] was standing in the shadows.
Speaker 1: Who was Robert Ellis?
Speaker 2: He is the black man who discovered the Van Allen radiation belts.  Van Allen radiation belt doesn't mean anything to you does it?  That's a single most important discovery in the whole space program, without contemplation, without the respect, due respect, to be paid to the Van Allen radiation belts.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  What was his relevance to the story you were telling daddy?
Speaker 2: Okay, when they were trying to get the satellite story (unclear).
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  No, no, no.  You're back in France about to go home to Alabama.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  You bring up Robert Ellis.  What's Robert Ellis' relevance?
Speaker 2: Robert Ellis, Robert Anderson Ellis was my fraternity brother, Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] which is the (unclear), but anyhow, Bob Ellis finished his first year at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], straight A's, and then he pulled out of Meharry, said did--he said I don't want to be involved in a merchant of human lives and he pulled out.  To punish him, they give him an impossible situation.  He studied under Van Allen [James Van Allen] at- in space manifestations, whatever you want to call it.  They gave him a project that was guaranteed to fail.  That was, they gave him all of the tapes.  This is piles upon piles of tapes recordings of a Vanguard satellite.  Are you familiar with the--? Anyhow, Ellis was given the dog shit, and we were just, they thought there was nobody in there, but it turned out, it was probably the important discovery of all, but Ellis did the work and made his report to Dr. Van Allen, and they said with glee, "Oh Dr. Ellis, this is the greatest, this is the greatest prize by any of, any of my students ever gave me.  This is who, we have to really make a place for you in history."
Story_ID: 544976
Speaker 1: Well let's, let's get back to you going home (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In other, in other words--
Speaker 1: Let's get back to you going home from, from France.  What--
Speaker 2: It was a come down.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter) tell me why.
Speaker 2: Well, having lived in a society where race, race didn't matter, it was quite a shock to me 'cause I didn't know people could get along like that, and I enjoyed being a human being.  Fifty million Frenchmen can't be all that wrong.
Speaker 1: So you decided to come home.  Did you know what you would do or how you would participate in what was going on--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in America?  Tell me (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I knew, I knew.  As a matter of fact, one of the first things when I hit the doggone concrete was right across from my office, Dr. Fearn, Helen Fearn, our next door across the street neighbor.  Told me when I was knocking on the door, within thirty days of the time I got back and Helen Fearn who was a high school principal, looked at me with tears in her eyes, said, "John [HistoryMaker Dr. John Cashin], I don't want you to get in any trouble now.  You don't need to get involved in all of that old stuff."  This is principal of the high school [William Hooper Councill High School, Huntsville, Alabama].  That I'm not man enough to take care of myself.  She don't know me at all.  The [U.S.] Army made a killer out of me, but they don't know that.  And nobody directs it but me.  So, I knew that I was going to take some active role, and I did.  And since I was a reformed Army officer, I was privy to a whole lot of things that they don't particularly care for any officers to make.

Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  (Simultaneous) Tell her before, there's something else that happened when you were in France.  You had a date with somebody, right, on Bastille Day?
Speaker 2: Yes, she looks like you.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  (Laughter) Tell her about your first date with mama and what happened?
Speaker 2: I kept her out all night and we got married and she was (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  You gotta say more than that.  It was Bastille Day.
Speaker 2: It was Bastille Day and, oh, boy.  Thanks baby.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  No, but this is important because it's part of your commitment, so tell her, tell her what happened.
Speaker 2: Well what happened is we got married.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Not the next day.
Speaker 2: Not the next day, but close as possible (laughter).
Speaker 1: How did you meet your first wife?
Speaker 2: Well she was part of a little group of, what did they call themselves?
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  The smart set or something?
Speaker 2: It was m- Charles [ph.], Sylvia [ph.], what was Little Charles--?
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  I don't know.
Speaker 2: What was that, he was Little Tex [ph.].
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Sydney [ph.] and Tex?
Speaker 2: Sydney and Tex, yeah.  It was Sydney that pushed me so hard.  "You need to know this girl. You need to," and I say, "Yeah, I do need to know her, but trying to get to her is the hardest job in the world," you know.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Where were you, you were at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] when mama was at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  So you had seen her, you were part of the same social circles.
Speaker 2: We were part of the same social circles and I think I was more determined, because, I mean Joan [Joan Carpenter Cashin] had everybody cracked up, you understand.  She was impervious.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Why did she, why was she in Europe?
Speaker 2: On a graduation day present.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Her parents sent her to Europe for a graduation present?
Speaker 2: That is, that is exactly the story.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN): And mutual friends put you guys in touch and you took her out on a date on Bastille Day?
Speaker 2: That is correct.  That was quite a date.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  But the next morn- you kept her out all night and then took her to breakfast and you proposed there.
Speaker 1: You got to let him tell the story.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Go ahead tell the story.
Speaker 1: Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.
Speaker 2: Well, tell us.
Speaker 1: Well, I just say it like this.  I had had my enough of white women.  I killed that appetite (laughter).
Story_ID: 544978
Speaker 1: And so you went out on a date, you stayed out all night and what happened?  When did you propose to her [Joan Carpenter Cashin]?
Speaker 2: I think I had, after the third glass of wine, something like that (laughter).
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  What was it about her that made you decide it's time to make this commitment?
Speaker 2: Well, it's about time for me to get married (laughter). But
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  What was the condition of you getting married?  What did you tell them?
Speaker 2: That we--oh there you go.  This is what you were getting at all along.  I made a deal with my brother [Herschel Cashin] that he could go on and get married and have babies to keep the Cashin name going.  I said but I would do the job whatever it needed, I'll get it done.  So she said that she can handle it 'cause I did not want to get married because of the vulnerability that you could expose yourself to on racists in Alabama.  And somebody had to change this shit and I was the, I was obviously the one standing in line, waiting.  So she said she could handle it and under those conditions--
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  What handle it?  What did you, what did you say to her as a condition to getting married?  For the people on the camera.  They don't know what you mean by that.
Speaker 2: What was the condition?  Tell us what the conditions were.
Speaker 1: The condition was that we wouldn't have children, but I mean she--
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Basically you said you wanted, she had to be committed to going back home, right?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, said we were going to go to Alabama and we were going to change it, and she was fool enough to say, "Okay, I'm with you."  And that one over there is one bit of evidence that she was serious.

Speaker 1: So when did you, when did you marry?  You came back to the states.
Speaker 2: Came--it was within thirty days.
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  No, no, no.
Speaker 2: Well I proposed to you.
Speaker 1: No, you proposed, but, you, you, well, I don't want to (unclear).
Speaker 2: What year did you get married, do you remember?
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957], '58 [1958], '56 [1956], somewhere in there.
Speaker 2: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-seven [1957].  And you were in the [U.S.] Army for two years?
Speaker 1: Two years.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so you came back to the states and then you married.  In Alabama?
Speaker 1: In Alabama.  Well, we got married in Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: In Nashville?
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  No.  Don't you remember you--
Speaker 2: We drove down to Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 1: (SHERYLL CASHIN):  Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: See? (Laughter) Joan [Joan Carpenter Cashin] said I kidnapped her.
Speaker 2: And tell me your wife's name?
Speaker 1: Joan.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And did you have a big wedding?
Speaker 1: No.  No, big wedding.  I take that from my grandfather because Herschel Cashin [Herschel V. Cashin], my grandfather, had a little security conscious behavior.  He would, he would not have, allow his picture to be taken 'cause he was fair skinned and he could pass for white, which he did, and he would go to the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] meetings and things like that.  That was, that was much later though.
