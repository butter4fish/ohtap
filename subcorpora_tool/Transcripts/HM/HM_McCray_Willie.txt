Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that I am compelled by management to ask, and they only require a short answer.  First one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Wow, that's a good one, I would say sweet potato pie.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have, okay (simultaneous)--

Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is, of this set is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Bring it on.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Bring it on (laughter).
Story_ID: 344119
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Willie C. McCray] side, but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Gussie, G-U-S-S-I-E, Pearl McCray her maiden name was Bussy B-U-S-S-Y [Gussie Bussy McCray].
Speaker 1: Okay, so her name was Gussie Bussy at one time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Is there a story behind that or anything everybody has a story about why they named her a rhyming name or--
Speaker 2: I don't know I guess, I, that's all I, no, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't even want to try to go there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, what's her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh Lord, I believe she was born in 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not--I want to say May of 1919, but I could be wrong.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Columbus, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Haralson County [Georgia], which is--if I'm correctly on that.
Speaker 1: Now is there--what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you go, can you trace them, first of all?
Speaker 2: With her side of the family I can just know--my grandfather is about as far as I can go, his name was Fred Bussy.  And that's--and he lived--many walking miles from where we did.  And we probably only saw him once a year during the summer.  We would go out for a week or so, and it was usually to help with the peanut harvest or something like that to get them into the barn and stuff like that.  So I didn't spend a lot of time just like I said, I went to see him once the year at the most.  He was remarried, had a second wife, and I don't--I can't recall her name now.  But my mother had one sister and three brothers, and they was, you know, very much older than I was, that's the reason it's no relationship there.  You know, because they was older than my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You see where I'm coming from, so, you know, but most so, on my dad's side, you know, I can go a little bit further.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are, are there any stories on your mother's side about the relatives, where they may have, have they always been in Columbus as far as you know?
Speaker 2: In the Manchester [Georgia] area, the Haralson County area, Talbot County [Georgia], Chattahoochee County [Georgia], down in that area, pretty much all I know.  After I got old enough to really get to know them, I had left and came here [Ohio].  And I guess that was a lot of years of knowledge left, you know, just because I--you know, didn't talk.  And we'll get into the reason is why I'm here and why I came here (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And that will show some light in terms of why the decision was made to do that.
Story_ID: 344120
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Gussie Bussy McCray] talk about growing up, what things were like for her when she was coming along?
Speaker 2: It was, it was difficult I mean we--pretty sure that her life was very difficult because of the sharecropping and type of work and labor that they had to perform.  And she knew that for us it would be different.  It had to be, you know, it wouldn't be the same status quo.  And I think that's one reason she moved to Columbus [Georgia] and tried to build her base there.  She worked as a public school cafeteria worker, she was a cook and--
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of the school in Columbus?
Speaker 2: That she worked in?
Speaker 1: Uh-hm.
Speaker 2: I--Oh Lord, all I can say one of the--
Speaker 1: Was it one of the white schools?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The white school there in Columbus I couldn't recall the name of it, I--
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to know--now we'll, so well go head.
Speaker 2: That's part of the story--the reason I'm here [Ohio] and not in Georgia, when I left SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The banners--Forman [HistoryMaker James Forman] was an interesting man, Jim Forman.
Speaker 1: Uh-hm.
Speaker 2: The executive secretary, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.  He had a brilliant mind, and he would think--do everything before he would encourage us or ask someone to do something.  And that's why today it's not very many photographs, and stuff on me, it's not very much publicity because my mother did work at a white school, she'd have been fired, and the kids would've been hungry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So Forman made sure that I didn't participate in anything in that area.  You know, if I was gonna go to jail it would be in Alabama, it would be in Atlanta [Georgia], not in the Columbus, Georgia area.  And that's the way he, you know, that went down so.
Speaker 1: That's well, that's well thought out.  Yeah 'cause that--people were at that kind of risk.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That do stuff, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he knew how I felt about it, you know, and he made sure that it wouldn't happen, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now so did your mother talk about race relations down there and about--
Speaker 2: Well, no more than (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: And when we was growing up, you know, there was certain rules, there was certain places, certain things we didn't do because of attitudes and feelings, you know.  You knew after dark to be on the other side of the railroad track, and that was the bottom line.  If you wasn't there, they'd come around and beat you back, back home.  I think my getting involved in the Civil Rights Movement was really encouraging for them.  I mean they just was so excited knowing that a wrong had to be fixed.  You know, it was everybody deciphered what the problem was and wanted to do something about it but just didn't know how.  And then SNCC came along--it kind of put a leaf out there and people was able to get on it and move with it.
Story_ID: 344121
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father was named Willie, W-I-L-L-I-E, C. I guess the C stands for--I don't know, Cedric I believe, McCray, M-C-C-R-A-Y [Willie C. McCray] and--
Speaker 1: Okay, now what is his date birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh it's on that photograph, what, nineteen--that photograph laying on the table (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, go on and take a stab at it, we'll just move on right now.
Speaker 2: I think it's 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He died in 1965, '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifteen [1915], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1965.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Chattahoochee County, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the seventh of fourteen.
Speaker 1: Chattahoochee County, did he grow up there too?
Speaker 2: Yes, I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the seventh of fourteen kids, and he worked as a laborer, plasterer, and block work, that was basically it, you know.
Speaker 1: Now what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side, how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can go back to my grandfather, to 1865.
Speaker 1: Oh that's further than your grandfather isn't it, I think, I mean 1865 should be--
Speaker 2: My dad's father (laughter).
Speaker 1: Your dad's father was born in 1865?
Speaker 2: No I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think my grandfather was born in 1865.
Speaker 1: Oh your great-grandfather you mean?
Speaker 2: Yes, my great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about him?
Speaker 2: All I know is he was a slave at one time, and he was a sharecropper, and married a young lady by the name of Mary Clark [ph.], I think, I think they married in 1865.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's your great-grand--okay, so he actually was, he was active around 18--he got married in 1865, your great-grandfather, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got it on that thing over there.
Speaker 1: Well we will try to get a copy of it and put it in a file.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Don't worry about trying to remember all the details right now.  But you said your great-grandfather was a--had been a slave and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then became a sharecropper?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In the same area where he was (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the Columbus [Georgia], Muscogee County [Georgia], Chattahoochee County area, right now Fort Benning [Georgia] is part of the home place.  We own some land there, and after the expansion of Fort Benning we ended up with two acres or five acres or something.  The house still exists.  I went back two, three years ago and drove down, and looked at it; it's beginning to grow up now with weeds and stuff coming all throughout of everything.  And part of that problem is that black people had a problem in terms of how to leave stuff.  Just like I say, my dad was the seventh child, and every one of those children is listed on the deed.  And then every one of the offsprings are listed on there.  So it was just so much confusion trying to get everybody in one spot at one time to deal with the piece of paper.  And, you know, so that's why it's falling apart.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, so not--if he'd left one person (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: In charge of it to parcel it out then it would have been better than--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Leaving it to so many people.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You have to argue about who's gonna do it, yep.
Speaker 2: Right, who's gonna get this slice, and there ain't nothing to slice (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yep, right.
Speaker 2: You know, but just like I say, it's still there.  And my dad lived there in the last part of his years, and he poured a slab out back and wrote his name in the slab, so we know it's the right spot--
Story_ID: 344122
Speaker 1: So are there any stories from your father's [Willie C. McCray] side of the family that they tell about slavery or sharecropping afterwards or Reconstruction or any of that?
Speaker 2: Not really, none that I can recall that was told, you know, it's like I say, it's just basically work stories.  You know, just going out, beating the pavement and trying to put sugar and flour on the table.  And, you know, my dad ended up in the '50s [1950s] having a heart attack and stroke.  So the last years of his life he suffered quite a bit.  And I guess it was, once again, it's those years where you really want--need to communicate and need to be absorbing a lot of stuff.  I didn't have that opportunity for various reasons.  Once he got sick, it wasn't no welfare in those days.  You know, you couldn't go down and apply for food stamps you--it just, it just wasn't (laughter) gonna be--
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: You know, if you want--if you were gonna eat, you had to get out there and shake some pecan trees or pick some barrels of cotton.  I mean, you know, cut some cane, you know, you know, that's what you had to do, and that's what we did.  As young people, I think that was one of the decisions I made when I left Columbus [Georgia] and went to Atlanta [Georgia], was to not grow up that way.  You know, it just had to be better, and so after my dad got real sick, it was just one less mouth to feed at home.  I had--it was eight of us--nine total in the family.
Speaker 1: So your father died at, what year was it?
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965] okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This was after a lot of the--right in the heart of all the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] activity?
Speaker 2: Right he--it was just less, less mouths for mom [Gussie Bussy McCray] to try to have to deal with, so I left.  And that opened up a slot, and I had relatives in Atlanta, and I moved there, and been on the move ever sense, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this was the--early 1960, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty [1960], you said.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1960.
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960] okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Not '65 [1965] he died--so he died in--
Speaker 2: I'm talking about when I left.
Speaker 1: Oh when you left.  You left in '60 [1960]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, to just to move on yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me ask you, who do you think you take after the most, your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: My mom I would assume, I think, I think so yeah, it would be my mom.
Speaker 1: What qualities do you share with your mother?
Speaker 2: The strength, she was strong, she was a strong lady.  And she had to be, you know, to go through what folks were going through in those days, you know.  Tie a kid on her side and wash a pile of clothes and then go in the kitchen and throw some corn--scrape corn and throw it in the skillet whatever, you know.  I mean, you know, it was 24/7, you know, every day.  She never had a vacation, that's why when you asked me the question, you know, it's kind of hard to have a vacation.  That would be something.
Speaker 1: It is, 'cause it's a--not everybody gets a vacation, that is true (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, it would, it would be something that's true.  Just to go and not worry about coming back and having to pick the newspaper up 'cause there's always something you forget to do and (laughter) it worries you more than you would if you had just stayed.
Story_ID: 344123
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, do you have an earliest childhood memory?  What's your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Being in a grocery store, and buying a Popsicle, and couldn't take the wrapper off.
Speaker 1: Couldn't get the wrapper off?
Speaker 2: No, they wouldn't allow it, I had to take it outside to eat it.  Better not open it up in here, and that stayed with me all my life.  I think that was part of what motivated me to go into the movement as deeply as I did, with the conviction that I did.  You know, it was a pain that would get into the pit of your stomach.
Story_ID: 344124
Speaker 1: You all lived in town in Columbus, Georgia, but it's still kind of rural, right, kind of?
Speaker 2: We lived out in the--I would say in the rural area out by the--what's now Columbus Airport [Columbus Metropolitan Airport, Columbus, Georgia] area.  The first school I went to was on the church property.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Green Hill Baptist Church [Green Hill Missionary Baptist Church] in Columbus, Georgia, it was just a wooden two-room wooden shed there on the school property and--
Speaker 1: Did it have a different name, or just Green Hill Church?
Speaker 2: Jenson School [ph.], I believe that was it, Jenson.
Speaker 1: Jenson.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One room was first through the seventh, and the other room was whatever grades that they were teaching beyond that point.  And if you would go back and remember, a lot of schools you didn't ever graduate, you know, you could only go so far.
Speaker 1: So was Jensen like that, you'd only go (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm pretty sure, because once you got into the sixth or seventh grade, you was back out on the farm anyway, you was too big to go to school.
Speaker 1: Uh-hm.
Speaker 2: You know, they made more money off of you being out there, you know, picking watermelons up to put them into the wagon and stuff like that, so it was discouraging.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was your father [Willie C. McCray] a sharecropper at that time, or did he have his own land?
Speaker 2: We lived on the man's place, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, so he kind of dictated what you all was doing on some level (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's right that's right.  It was pretty much them, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want a place to live you gotta do--
Speaker 2: What they want--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Help produce more goods and then he can get more.
Speaker 2: But you never caught up.
Speaker 1: So they would tell you--now how'd this system work, can you explain?  I don't wanna--yeah for the benefit of anybody listening to this, explain it as you know it.
Speaker 2: You know, you was always in debt, and, you know, you go in for a sack of sugar they put it on the book.  You go in for some cornmeal they put on the book.  And a pair of shoes, they put it on the book, and the book kept getting bigger and thicker.  And so you ended up working all summer and all year.  And all the kids worked all year, and at the end of the year you still didn't have nothing.  He comes around and gives everybody fifty cents or quarter, and you thought that was hot stuff because it was shiny.  And it was more than you had ever seen at one time in your life, don't let him give you a silver dollar.  You know, hot dog, you really worked all summer to get a silver dollar.  You know, we got fifty cents at Christmastime, something like that, but then some of the bigger fellows got a silver dollar, what they called a bow dollar in those days (laughter), you know.  But we knew what time of the day it was, and I think that's why so many of us left, and we can thank Korea for that.
Speaker 1: Korea, okay?
Speaker 2: Korea, because most of the older fellows ended up being drafted to go into the [U.S.] military and didn't leave anybody on the farm, but the young babies and the young ones running around, they just didn't have the expertise to keep it going.  So then some of the older folks couldn't handle it, so they began to sell a cow here a hog here.  And all of a sudden there wasn't no hogs, and there wasn't no cows and wasn't no chickens.  And now you got to go to the city because you done ate up everything out there.
Story_ID: 344125
Speaker 1: But I want to go back to when you were growing up, and tell me, like when you were growing up, what were some of the sights, sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh wow, well the smell of fish frying up, and the smell of homebrew and moonshine whiskey 'cause that that's what it was about, you know, we threw rent parties.  You know, people don't know about 'em today but, you know, if your rent was due next week you'd have a little get-together.  And everybody'd come over, feed the kettle, help you out and next week you come over and help them.  And it just went around the neighborhood like that, you know, that's what I remember, the rent parties.  And, you know, people got sick, and they needed money.  They'd pool the resources and do a little shindig to deal with it.  So I miss that, you know, it seems to be a lot more togetherness than it is today.  You knew who Ms. Jones was down the street, if she tells you to tie your shoestrings, you stopped, and you tied 'em, and you didn't talk back to her, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other sights, and sounds, and smells?
Speaker 2: None that are vivid in my mind.  I think moving from this into the city [Columbus, Georgia], I think the sounds and everything else took on a whole different smell--that's true because now things was moving faster.  I mean, you know, we was--we walked everywhere we went when we was there.   And then you get to the city now, you got buses and cabs and other means to get around.  So it's a fast--much more faster pace than--the smell of roasted peanuts, candy apples, you know, that's the--peoples barbecuing.  And let's see, I can't forget the fish frys 'cause I mean, you know, that was a Friday night thing, man, you know.
Story_ID: 342109
Speaker 1: What was your personality like as a young man growing up?  What were you interested in and what did you do?  What did you spend most of your time doing?
Speaker 2: A lot of time daydreaming I would assume, just like I say it was always the work that had to be done.  You know, the water had to be carried from the spring to the house.
Speaker 1: So you were in Columbus [Georgia], or?
Speaker 2: Yes, Columbus.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had to actually go to the spring to get water?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, in Columbus, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: So people think, oh he's living in town, all you have to do is turn on a faucet right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no (laughter) it's more than that.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: We had outhouses (laughter).  And, you know, and they just got rid of em in the '60s [1960s].  You know, all going out there on 355 [Georgia State Route 355] then going out, you know.  So, no, it was always work to be done and every day was a different chore.  Monday was wash day so then that meant wood had to be drug from the woods up to the pot, so you can make a fire around the pot so they could boil 'em.  You know, so it's, and that meant many trips to the spring to get water to bring it up to wash, so it was a job.
Speaker 1: Okay what was--I was asking you about what you, you know, what your personality was like, what kind of things you were doing and you were explaining the spring, that you had to go get water from the spring, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah I don't know, I guess that would have to be for someone else to ask.  How was my personality as a young kid, well hopefully that you can find someone that knew me then because it's kind of hard for me because I guess there's so many blanks there.  All I know we got up, walked six or seven miles to school, turned around and walked back, you know, and--
Speaker 1: Six or seven miles?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, every once in a while we would get a ride (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's like a couple hours--well about what--
Speaker 2: A long way.
Speaker 1: About how many hours did it take to get the school?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, took a long time, and my sister and I ended up in the same grade--class, and the reason for that, she was older than I am but they wouldn't let her go by herself.  So they held her back 'til I was able to walk with her, so she would have me to go with her.  So, and she never forgave me for that, right to today (laughter).  Yeah she didn't like that at all, her little brother tagging along behind her, boy, she didn't like that, but it was all good, it turned out well.  I lost her last year, so, it's all good.
Speaker 1: Okay so what was the name of the school you attended?
Speaker 2: That's Jenson School [ph.] there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah near the Green Hill Baptist Church [Green Hill Missionary Baptist Church, Columbus, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yes, right there on the church property.
Speaker 1: Now was this--this was not in Columbus then, this was--you had to walk from--
Speaker 2: It was out in the county part of the city.  I would say ten miles from the city.
Speaker 1: Well, and you said it's two rooms?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was just a two-room building--
Story_ID: 342110
Speaker 1: So there wasn't a black school in Columbus [Georgia] itself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was in the--I tell you, 1958 I would say, after the Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] decision, there was a lot of schools built in the South.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one of 'em that they built was Carver Vocational High School [sic. Carver High School, Columbus, Georgia].
Speaker 1: And that was (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My class--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --was the first class to attend that building when they built it.  And it would've been the class of '58 [1958], which we would've graduated in the class of '60 [1960].  Would've been the graduating class of '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well did you like school, well, you know, it takes a lot of effort to get there but--
Speaker 2: Yeah well, you know, I could take it or leave it, you know, we, just like I say it was something that was constantly preached to us that we had to learn as much as we could.  And some--I'm just glad that my brothers and younger sisters and all went on to not only graduate but to go on to different colleges.  So it was all good, you know, I guess I'm the one that sacrificed it, you know, made it possible, but I guess we all have our roles to play.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So did you--so did you stay in school the whole time--I mean did you end up going to Carver?
Speaker 2: I went to Carver a couple years, I left right after my father [Willie C. McCray] got sick and went to Atlanta [Georgia], this was a few, few days, a few months before graduation.  The time I did it, it had to be done, so I didn't graduate from Carver.  I, later on, graduated through a correspondence course, got my diploma that way.  I regretted it, but it was something that I couldn't change or do anything about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It had to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have a favorite subject at school at all?
Speaker 2: I like history, I really loved it.  I think the adventures of it kind of put me in the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] mood I guess, you know, because it's all adventure and going on to see other areas and how the folks live so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So did you did you have a good teacher--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: --that taught history?
Speaker 2: I had some of the some of the finest teachers.  I think one was, I can't recall her first name, Mrs. Alexander [ph.], just a couple I can remember now, but they was helpful, I mean, they stayed the course.  I mean, you know, they did what they could under the circumstances.  And you got to realize I'm still--I'm being bussed now by the yellow bus, you know.  So I can't stay, you know, I got to go with this bus go, or don't I'm gonna get left.  And the only way I'm gonna get there is a walk.  You know, I can't play football, I can't play baseball.  I mean none of the activities that the school had, you know I can't participate 'because I got no transportation to get back and forward, you know.  So it's one thing to--so just like I say I didn't--weren't able to participate in anything like that.  But my younger brothers did, and I'm thankful for that.  So I always wondered how--I could run to--I always wondered how good I could've been, you know, but I played a little, little pickup games and stuff, but nothing organized.
Story_ID: 342111
Speaker 1: So when you were in school, what did you see in your future in terms of jobs?  Did you think you'd be doing the same thing your father [Willie C. McCray] did, or did you see yourself doing something else?
Speaker 2: Well, the vocational thing was coming on to the market, and the woodwork shops and the metal shops, and all of these were supposed to be the key to the future.  And a lot of black males was pulled into vocation education, not so then high school education, so they would get into these sweatshops and not go in to college.  You know, it was a whole different teaching is what I'm trying to say.  You know, you didn't get your biology or your geometry, none of that.  You just got to basically learn how to read a line gauge, a ruler, and you know, five sixteenths, and you cut it at five sixteenths of an inch, you know.  So that's the difference that I've seen.  And then just like I say, the kids that came behind me, you know, was able to go on and make other choices, which was very few choices when I was a young man in my teen years.  You know, it was just out of the norm, and, you know, that's just the way it was so you didn't think about it really, you know.
Speaker 1: So when you left school [Carver High School, Columbus, Georgia], you said you went to Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's 1960?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now why did you move to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: My cousins, I had a couple of cousins that had moved few months prior.  And they came back to Columbus [Georgia], and I told 'em I wanted to go back, and I hopped in the car and took off.  Got a job a few days later, freight elevator operator, and I didn't think about it being long term, it was just a job at the time.  And I don't think I was even thinking about six months from that date or a year or twenty years, that was just, you know, I guess that's the same way young peoples are today.  You don't worry about making sure that you got enough points to get social security when you need it (laughter), you know.  I mean if you don't work you don't get the points (laughter), so, and I found that out real fast.  So, but I got there and I lived with my cousin for a couple of months.  And I was able to get, you know, my own rooming house in those days you could get a room for ten or fifteen dollars a week and one meal a day, you know, usually the supper meal, so it was good.  You know, in a new city that's on the move, and you're a part of it.  And didn't realize how much part of it I would become, you know, a few months after that.
Story_ID: 342112
Speaker 1: Now had you been keeping up with the Civil Rights Movement on, you know.  Did you all have a television or radio where you--or read what was going on in the papers?
Speaker 2: I had a first cousin that was a student down at Albany State College [Albany State University, Albany, Georgia] and when Albany Movement started, which was one of the first in the South--
Speaker 1: Albany, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I asked a couple of the adults, and they didn't really talk about it.  I think they was a little bit afraid to, to a certain degree.  And then on some degree they wasn't too sure what was really going on.  It's just something that wasn't talked about when it--at the very beginning.
Speaker 1: So did you end up going to Albany, I mean did you did your cousin talk to you about what they were doing in Albany?
Speaker 2: I ended up in Albany, but I didn't talk to my cousins.  Bernice Reagon [HistoryMaker Bernice Johnson Reagon] who was living in Atlanta [Georgia], who was a part of the Albany Movement.  I was a driver for the Freedom Singers, which she was attached to, and we would talk quite a bit, and I would take her back and forward (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let's not get too far ahead now.  Now how did you get--now you were down with your cousin, you went to Albany, and, to help your cousin out, was what was going on?
Speaker 2: Just to try to find out what was really going on, you know, and the--just like I say they wouldn't really talk about it.  And, you know, I'm concerned, you know, as a--but when I ended up in Albany, it was not to see my cousin but to deliver two workers, and they was both (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Both from Atlanta, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean well, how did you come in contact with them, were you involved with them in the movement in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: This was--yes, this was after I'd been hired by Forman [HistoryMaker James Forman] to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now wait a minute now, we got to get back to the beginning, how did you get involved with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] in the first place, so you got you in the middle now--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) At that bank, at that bank.
Speaker 1: At what bank now?
Speaker 2: At the bank I was working for.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was the freight elevator operator (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right, now what happened?
Speaker 2: And I went out to lunch one day, and the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] and the students was picketing.  And there was a confrontation there at Five Points [Atlanta, Georgia] in downtown Atlanta.  And as I was going past the commotion started, and I was snatched and thrown into the paddy wagon along with everybody else.  And the only thing that set me off differently is that symbol that I had on my shoulder that said Bank of Georgia.  And they weren't gonna have that.
Speaker 1: Oh what did the, did the Bank of Georgia fire you?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, right then, right now.
Speaker 1: And you didn't even intend to get arrested.
Speaker 2: I was just passing by at the wrong spot at the wrong time or the right place at the right time, but I, you know, and I was bitter for a long time.  I mean, I had an attitude a long time about the way I was treated and (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I can understand.
Speaker 2: And how it all played out in the end, and I'm still bitter about it, to some degree, yeah but at this--I worked, I worked the Lester Maddox restaurant [Pickrick Cafeteria, Atlanta, Georgia], the guy with the axe handle.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lester Maddox, he became the governor in Georgia.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he had a restaurant that--just explain that 'cause the people are gonna wanna know what that is.
Speaker 2: He just had his axe handle and started beating folks with it, because they wanted to come in and have a cup of coffee, and he wasn't gonna allow that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah a segregated restaurant--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And he said if you try to come in if you're black he'd pass out axe handles--
Speaker 2: He did, he did.
Speaker 1: --and he'd crack you upside the head him with them.
Speaker 2: And I worked the Krystal restaurants, who was the little five and ten cent sandwich shops scattered all over the city.  And then I worked the University Avenue area, and Pryor Road area, those were some of the areas in Atlanta that I was allowed to go on demonstrations.
Story_ID: 342113
Speaker 1: So when you were arrested, and were you recruited by Jim Forman [HistoryMaker James Forman] in jail or after you got out of jail?  How did he--when did you meet him, can you remember when you first met him?
Speaker 2: I--pretty sure I met Forman in jail 'cause I'm sure he was arrested also, and we talked.  And they went my bail, students did, and Forman say--asked me, would I come by and a couple of days went passed, and I finally went over to the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] office.  And he was telling me because I was familiar with the South and had a driver's license there was a need for it.  To get people to different projects, make sure that different projects had supplies of what they needed.  And, you know, I didn't think nothing of it I said, "I'll do it," you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a job he offered you a job?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was paid staff from day one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And at that junction what was the organization called?  It wasn't SNCC yet was it?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was SNCC, okay.
Speaker 2: Students was already formed.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it had already been formed?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Right and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was formed in 1960, '61 [1961], '60 [1960]?
Speaker 2: It was 1960.
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960], okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And that happened at Shaw, Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Yeah, in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Right, and--
Speaker 1: Now, did you meet Ella Baker?  I know she was in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Ella Baker was a great woman because she did so much for me that I've never talked about before.  But I had a problem with my letters, my Ds look like Bs, and my Bs look like Ds and she caught that.  She had me tested, sent me to New York University [New York, New York] to this program that they had, and all of that was done by Ella Baker.  So I didn't know anything about being dyslexic or whatever it is, you got some name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's what they call it, dyslexia (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think the--it has something to do with--
Speaker 1: Dyslexia.
Speaker 2: Slow, slow.
Speaker 1: Well, when you see things turned the wrong way.
Speaker 2: Right.  It takes me a while--I can read this book but I might put it down six times before I've absorbed it, and I'll just go back, you know.  I still have some of them problems today, you know.  But yeah, it was Ella Baker who found that out and encouraged me to do something about it; not only encouraged me, she went with me.
Speaker 1: Now in that office you had Ella Baker, and she was from New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And she was originally--I think she was originally from South Carolina [sic.], but she was in--well she went to school in New York, was a social worker and community organizer in New York.  And Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses], who was just coming out of school.  I think he was doing something in New York before he came down south (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: When he was invited down south to be in the SNCC office, James Forman--
Speaker 2: Then you have Ruby Doris [Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who was the head woman in charge, she was the lady.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my first experience being around a female with power.
Speaker 1: Okay, Ruby Doris?
Speaker 2: Robinson.
Speaker 1: Robinson, okay.
Speaker 2: She was a female with power.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she knew how to use it (laughter), and which is all good.  I mean she could talk the talk, but she could walk the walk, and I loved it, she was a great lady I mean sure enough.  She sent me on a couple trips.  She'd hand me a bus ticket, she said, "You go get him McCray [HistoryMaker Willie McCray], and you put him on the bus.  If you got some problems, you tell 'em to bring it to me."  You know, that's when somebody done did something they didn't supposed to do, you know, and we had strict rules.  If you was supposed to be at a place, that's where you were.  You didn't deviate from it because if your child was there and you called down there wanted to know where they were, we had to tell you right then that they're sitting over in the corner because we knew.  We made sure we knew.  And if somebody, you know, went out beyond that border, she'd put 'em on a bus in a heartbeat.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's for the volunteers that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: Came down--you had a lot of white students volunteering as well as black ones, so they'd come down to the South and their family was concerned because they could be hurt.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: They were at risk, right.
Speaker 2: There was a lot of a lot of folks hurt.
Story_ID: 342114
Speaker 1: So you meet these people, people in the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] office--
Speaker 2: And Forman [HistoryMaker James Forman], you know, offered me the job, I accepted it.  My first driving job would be going to Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  And this was a trip to pick up a truckload of supplies for Holly Springs, Mississippi.  This was--I would say November, December '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay now what kind of supplies did you--
Speaker 2: These was books because Mississippi had closed all the schools.  It was the only schools the kids could go to was the Freedom Schools.  There was no public schools opened in the state, and SNCC (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they sent you all the way to Cape Cod, that's a long--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the farthest trip that I took, and that was--that took me about seven days I think because if I remember correctly, I took 41 [U.S. Route 41], it was a nice ride.  But that supplies was--each white student that came down say from the Boston [Massachusetts] area probably went to Holly Springs or Benton County [Mississippi].  People from Antioch [Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio] probably went to Marshall County [Mississippi], Jackson [Mississippi], Marie [Mississippi], and some other cities within the state.  So it was--they were scattered, you know, in different groups and the power laid in the group that had the most voters 'cause that's how you got the power (laughter).  You know what I'm saying?  Majority rules.
Speaker 1: In SNCC itself.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they had a democracy in SNCC?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it was a good one (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They waited 'til midnight to vote but (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay, so in Atlanta [Georgia], you said Ruby Doris [Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson] was in charge of Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And James Forman was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was the executive secretary and--
Speaker 1: Okay, and Ella Baker was--what was her role?
Speaker 2: She was just the mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was the--she gave directions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She would put it out there, let you know what the pros and cons was gonna be and then strictly left it up to you to decide on whether or not you wanted to do it that way or this way.  Maybe she would think of a--some other tactics but yeah--
Speaker 1: Now Ruby Doris, what was her last name, what?
Speaker 2: Smith.
Speaker 1: Smith okay.
Speaker 2: She was Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson.
Speaker 1: Oh, Smith-Robinson, okay and she was--okay she was director and--Smith in one office, okay.  And you say Bernice Reagon [HistoryMaker Bernice Johnson Reagon] was down there too at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bernice was based in Atlanta, [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond was there in the Atlanta SNCC office.
Speaker 1: Was Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] there at that time?
Speaker 2: Bob was there, but he was in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He never really spent a lot of time in the Atlanta SNCC office because he pretty much went on into Mississippi, once he left New York [New York], and he went down to McComb [Mississippi], some of those other areas.  And just like SNCC being in Holly Springs--SNCC had went into Holly Springs in 1961.  And was there already, and that's interesting and funny about how the white Mississippians was planning to stop this mass of folks coming into the state.  They was sitting out on the highway in their cars and shit waiting on the parade to come--they was already there (laughter).  They'd been feeding them all winter; you know (laughter) it wasn't no--they just kept waiting.  Wasn't nobody showing man, something ain't right here--but they were--the students were already there.  They was in the dormitory, people like Dr. Frank Smith [HistoryMaker Frank Smith], who was the head of the black veterans thing [African American Civil War Memorial] in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], I might be pronouncing the organization wrong but anyway (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's the SNCC veterans group?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Larry Rubin, he was a white Jew guy.  Well, see they had--they had been there in Holly Springs since '61 [1961], was invited in by a bunch of professors, they was taking classes on campers, and going to get their meals on campus, and everything was right there.  And they kept waiting on people to come out of the SNCC office--when the people came out of the SNCC office it was too late, the show was already on the run (laughter).
Story_ID: 344126
Speaker 1: So the white people in Mississippi were up in arms, like in the movie 'Freedom On My Mind.'
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They showed--they had them interviewed, they said, "Well yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna turn them around," and the people were already there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Already there, man.
Speaker 1: They were looking for somebody to--
Speaker 2: Already there, we had already brought 'em in, dropped 'em off and all they had to do was wait, wait for the hour and--
Speaker 1: So SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], now tell me this now, now this raises an interesting point 'cause when we hear stories like, you know, Rosa Parks just died.  And we like to--for some reason, people like to think that she was just a woman that had tired feet and all of this.  And when you raise that she was part of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and she actually knew what she was doing.  Somehow people resent that for some reason, I don't understand it, but it seems to me like SNCC knew what it was doing.  I mean it was a strategic plan to get people in and get 'em set up, and it wasn't just some spontaneous people going out for demonstrations.
Speaker 2: The plans started in 1947.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For the sit-ins in the 1960s.
Speaker 1: Explain.
Speaker 2: There was Ella Baker and a white woman named Nan [ph.], not Nan Gordimer [Nadine Gordimer] or--oh she just died--oh what is her name, down here in Kentucky.  Oh Lord, she just died a couple of days ago on March 4, but anyway it was her and Ella Baker.  They was going around the country, this was in the '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s], preparing folks for the day when the sit-ins will happen.  When the Freedom Rides will take place, that, it had been discussed many, many times and put off many, many times.  And what Ella was doing was to go places like Shaw [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina] and Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and preparing young students when the day comes that they will come out of the classroom, they would fill the streets.  But all of that was preplanned.  If you look at the dates on the day that the Freedom Rides started for Washington, D.C., it was on Mother's Day.  How many mothers gonna allow their children to be beat?  So dates are very important, and, but no it was--
Speaker 1: It was a strategic--
Speaker 2: Right, everything.
Speaker 1: Operation.
Speaker 2: I mean, we just didn't go into a room and sit down and say, "We gonna go down the road in the morning, jump on Mr. Charlie."  No, it didn't work that way--you sat down, you discussed, you looked at the negatives and the positives.  And what if, what if was very important.  What if he gives in, then what you do, can you go in the store and buy the stuff that you want?  Do you have the money, I mean well, you know, it's a lot of what ifs?  You see where I'm coming from--I mean it's one thing to integrate a restaurant it's another thing to pay the man for the money for the Coke [Coca-Cola] if you want one, you know, so.
Speaker 1: The way I see it, you know, what you raised here is an important issue I guess for people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right but we--
Speaker 1: For people who don't have a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: If you--say you wanna sit in the lunch counter, suppose the man says, "Yeah, come on."
Speaker 2: You're right.
Speaker 1: Then can you pay for the meal?
Speaker 2: That's right we could, you know, people that was going in those five and ten cent stores using those students, it was their lunch money that they were using, you know.  And that messed up the budget (laughter), you know, I mean.   It--and especially when you get up, you fill it full of salt and leave.  I left many of plates back, you know, they say--I wasn't gonna eat it 'cause I didn't know what they put in it.  You know, my grandparents and parents [Gussie Bussy McCray and Willie C. McCray] were always telling me, "Watch what you put in your mouth, boy, don't eat everywhere you go."  That was the rule, eat before you leave home.  So you can get there, you might have a little snack or a little something, but you didn't go there and act a fool.  You know, get all the chicken, you know, (laughter) you just didn't do it.  I mean, but that's just the way it was but just like I say, everything was set down and, and worked out.  And bail bonds was set, we knew how many peoples we could get out of jail.  If we had fifty on the demonstration, we had money for forty, that's how many we would send.  All of that was preplanned before you left out the office and went down the road.  I mean, we had to know, you know, who was gonna do what, when and where.
Story_ID: 344127
Speaker 1: It was quite a machine, SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] was a quite a machine.  I mean, when you really look at what they had and what they did, it was awesome.  I mean, you know, the last building that they owned in downtown Atlanta [Georgia], 360 Nelson Street, was a three-story building, print shop, photography dark room, five color printing press, elevators, warehouses, mechanic shops.  You name it, we could, we could take a--we could bring a car in from Mississippi with a blown engine and have an engine in there the next day, the next day.  SNCC had stuff right there on Spring Street and I-20 [Interstate 20] in Atlanta right now.  That's where the garage was, and every car came in that didn't have a CB [citizens band] radio we'd slap CBs in 'em because that was the line of communications. That's why we was able to get stuff out as fast as we did, because every car had a CB.  And it's a one-person job to stay in that car and relay to base any activities that was going on.
Speaker 2: Now CBs were they, they weren't that popular then but (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No they wasn't.
Speaker 2: But you all, but you all had em.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah--
Speaker 2: In the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: And that came after the three civil rights workers was killed.  What if they had had CBs?  And that's why, and then Patti LaBelle, [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson--I can't recall whose all was on that ticket that night, but I'm really fast forwarding (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, don't go fast, don't go fast.  Let's see, all right, okay.  All right, okay, let's ease up now.  Let me try to get this in a chronological perspective now.  You said early in the 1960s, Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] was already in McComb [Mississippi] organizing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he was--
Speaker 2: People, people.
Speaker 1: Bob had been there.
Speaker 2: And now I read, and what's Taylor Branch's book, 'Freedom On My Mind' [sic.]?  He was already down there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I think when he first arrived in the SNCC office, it was he and Ella Baker, and that was it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they eventually when they got enough people they sent him down to Mississippi to try to organize people to register to vote.  And was he in McComb, that's where he was?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I believe Bob was in McComb.
Speaker 2: So, and your job in those days was to bail people out of jail, to take them different places, to make sure those cars got fixed to do those (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do the supply runs.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And when I wasn't doing that I was in the print shop and if I wasn't doing that I was putting stamps in the books.  Top Value Stamps that you got at the grocery store, when you went and bought your groceries, they gave you these stamps.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Top Value Stamps, I forgot about that.
Speaker 1: We bought all our furniture in those offices with those stamps.  We put thousands and thousands of books of 'em together.  We even got vans, two white vans, sixteen-passenger vans with those stamps.
Speaker 2: And the stamps came--the people would contribute the stamps?
Speaker 1: We'd go around and pick em up, you know, people set em outside, there'd be sacks of 'em.  And we would sit there in the office and get in a circle and start singing 'We Shall Overcome' and start licking stamps.  And you'd be surprised how many books you can get done in an hour, but we did that, that's how we got furniture and lamps and, and stuff like that for those offices.
Speaker 2: Gee, that's something.
Speaker 1: Because most monies that you was receiving was for special projects.  They would send a check, maybe Antioch [Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio] would send a check, and they would have peoples in Jackson [Mississippi].  Well, they wanted that money to go to that group of students in Jackson.  So that's where it had to go so each, each project pretty much had to have their own thing.  And Atlanta [Georgia] was the base so we (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Top Value Stamps.
Speaker 1: That's right we'd did thousands and thousands of books.  Yep.
Speaker 2: Well, did you use S&H Green Stamps [Sperry & Hutchinson Company] to--they had it--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Whatever worked, we had it.  And just like I say we would get new recruits in--that's the first thing we'd break em in on we'd start (laughter) 'em licking some book--stamps--
Speaker 2: And for those who are listening to this and never heard of this, it used to be when you go to the grocery store they'd give you stamps along with your change.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the stamps could go in a stamp book.  I don't think they even do it anymore that's why I'm doing this.  That the stamps would go in the stamp books and the books can be redeemed for items in a catalog right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's how that worked.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they--I haven't seen that in a long time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But Top Value Stamps, S&H Green Stamps, and even James Brown had Black and Brown Stamps [Black and Brown Trading Stamp Corporation] at one time in the South.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But I don't know that wasn't for very long period of time.
Speaker 1: So yeah but we used a lot of, a lot of stuff, and when you had people that knew how to how to tap that resource, and they put peoples on it, they was very good at what they did.
Story_ID: 344128
Speaker 1: One of your jobs was to drive around the Freedom Singers?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that included [HistoryMaker] Bernice Johnson Reagon and Cornell Reagon, I guess he was in it and (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: And there were others too--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you drove them from place to place, they were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bernice was pregnant, and Cornell would be out with the Freedom Singers on a trip someplace, and she needed to get to the medical doctor or something with the baby.  So, I would take her and made sure that she got there, so it was all good, yeah.
Speaker 1: So they, they would often--from what I understand they would like sing in different churches to raise money for SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: Right, on the--lot of campuses the biggest one that I was involved with was the Freedom Singers and [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory when he did the tour.  And the Freedom Singers would be the opening act for Dick Gregory.  And that was very successful--
Speaker 1: About what year was this?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what, you know, from just from, you know, watching the news and when I was a kid just watching television it seem like most of the attention in the Civil Rights Movement was I mean Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] activities, you know, got most of the national attention.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: National media would be Birmingham [Alabama], you know, in '63 [1963] there's a lot of attention that got a--I don't know if we were even aware that anybody was organizing in Mississippi.  But that started in '60 [1960] and it was just kind of--I mean what--were you--where were you stationed I guess during these--in those days between '60 [1960] and '63 [1963] I guess?
Speaker 2: I was stationed in Atlanta [Georgia].  I was always stationed in Atlanta and just like I say SNCC had many projects in many cities.  And at one time or another I've been to every one of those projects at some capacity either to deliver or to pick up.
Speaker 1: Now were there other guys doing the same thing that you were doing?
Speaker 2: No, maybe one or two others.
Speaker 1: Who were the other guys that you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jesse Harrison, he was a brother that ended up spent a lot of time in Pascagoula, Mississippi, down on the coast.  He was unfortunate enough to have an accident and killed two people, two white people.
Speaker 1: In--oh while he was working for SNCC?
Speaker 2: For SNCC, yeah as a driver.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they threw him in jail, and the brother spent some hard time now, and I was--
Speaker 1: So two--were the two white people volunteers or were they just regular (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were regular Mississippians, yeah.
Speaker 1: Regular--oh okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he ran into 'em with the car?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Accident, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I, you know, I've logged a hundred, two hundred thousand miles and thank God I never had a fender bender or hurt anybody.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I was able to go from point B to point C, and no--everybody got there, which was good (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 344129
Speaker 1: I heard Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] say this, in the '90s [1990s] when he was speaking in Chicago [Illinois].  He said that there was an incident where they were going someplace in the car, and the driver was actually shot in the neck.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you know about who that was?
Speaker 2: Right.  Travis, I think that was his name, I believe that might have been the incident that, where Travis got shot.
Speaker 1: Travis, what was his last name?
Speaker 2: Jimmie Travis.
Speaker 1: Jimmie Travis, okay.
Speaker 2: That's right, I think his first name was Jimmie and if you--it's hard because you're talking about hundreds of shootings, hundreds of shooting and thousands of bombing, you know, within that two-year period.
Speaker 1: Now there's a--in that movie 'Freedom On My Mind' they alluded to the bombings and shootings, and the same kind of numbers you're talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: I don't think most people are aware of that--
Speaker 2: They, they wouldn't have the faintest idea.  I was--we was--we called, you know, went out to get this church for Mrs. Hamer [Fannie Lou Hamer] to speak.  And this was coming up to the Democratic convention [1964 Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey] when it was gonna challenge that.  And we went out and talked to the deacon, and the deacon said, "Oh I don't think it's a good idea, no I can't let y'all have my church."  So we kept messing with the brother, kept messing with him.  Finally, he gave in so then we had the meeting that night, couple hours after the meeting was over the church was torched, they burnt it.  And it was so sad to go back and the brother standing there shaking his head saying, "I told y'all that wasn't a good idea, now look what you did."  We didn't know that was gonna happen, what we would've never did it but, but that was just one of the incidents that happened, and it was happening every other day it looked like.
Speaker 1: So were you ever in any personal danger, I mean did you have a close call, or tell us about a time when--
Speaker 2: Well, I can't really say a close call, the closest thing that happened to me was in Columbus, Mississippi, and it was July 2, the day Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] signed the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964].  And right up the road in the black community was this swimming pool, but we had a bunch of students, white students, you know, Antiochans [from Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio] and the whole bit.  So they come in, and they barricade the area, they put up these barricades, you can't come outside of the barricades and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So who, who the--
Speaker 2: The police--
Speaker 1: The police did, oh okay.
Speaker 2: State police.  And so I guess I decided that I would call 'em on it, so I walked through the barricades about that time I heard the rifle click.  And somebody hollered, "Don't shoot him."  You know, and if I guess I'd have been shot and dead now if--but that was the--
Speaker 1: Now why did they--why did you think they did--
Speaker 2: Because it was the--Fourth of July was gonna be the next couple of days, it was two days before the Fourth, Johnson had signed the civil rights bill to integrate.  And the swimming pools and all of that, and we had a bunch of Antiochans, a lot of summer volunteers down running around in bikinis and stuff, you know (laughter), the man wasn't gonna have that it was no way he was going to have that--
Speaker 1: Oh, so no integrated pool activity?
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't going to have that (laughter), he don't care.
Speaker 1: But why didn't he shoot you?  I mean the guy said, don't shoot you?
Speaker 2: I think it was too many witnesses, too many volunteers was in the area.   It was no way they could've thrown me into the river, and forgotten it.  I mean, you know, it was gone--I think TV cameras might've been there.  I'm just not sure, but it was a lot of stuff happening.  That happened in Columbus, Mississippi, I never will forget it.
Story_ID: 344130
Speaker 1: Now you had to be real cool in the position you were in I suppose because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, because that that was one of my things, "Don't go to jail, McCray [HistoryMaker Willie McCray] (laughter)."
Speaker 1: Okay, so if you if--I mean if they knew that you were the one with the bail money, if they knew that you were the one, you know, driving people [for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So how did you conceal what you're doing, I mean how did you--how were you able to move through so smoothly to get things done?
Speaker 2: Because I moved--most of my deliveries was made between two a.m. and six a.m. in the morning.  When daylight came I was headed back to Atlanta [Georgia].  We would time it to get into Jackson [Mississippi] at three a.m. or four a.m. in the morning.  This dude is supposed to be getting his coffee and his eggs at this point.  We ain't got to worry about him out here on the road.  You know, it's after three a.m., so most of the stuff we did would be did in those hours--predawn hours, you know.  And that seemed to be the safest time to do it, most of the trouble we had would be from midnight to two a.m., it kind of seemed like it quieted down after three a.m.  And we have white females in the car, we would cover 'em up with blankets make him stay on the floorboards with headlights coming, and stuff like that.  And once we go through--say you was living at the third house on this lane, and we'd be driving if we didn't hit the dimmers three or four times to let you know who we was, he'll blow you right off the highway.  These were blacks, you know, didn't know who you were and what you was up to, so you had a signal.  And that's why we was able to survive, I mean, you know.  We, you know, they came up with it this way we gonna do it, and we did it, it worked.
Speaker 1: So, so did you ever get stopped?
Speaker 2: Oh, several times.  I got stopped one time, this wasn't in--it was in West Virginia.  I can't recall now what I went to pick up, I was picking something up.  And the load shifted, and that's one reason I wanted to see how--what you stack in my trunk anymore when I take off, because the weight went.  And the judge asked me, could I share butter beans, I said, "Do you want em for supper?"  (Laughter) And they put them in a bowl, let 'em go, so I thought, hey, I sat there, and I shared butter beans man.
Speaker 1: That's what you had in the truck?
Speaker 2: No, that's what he wanted.  That's what he was doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he wanted to know, did I know how, I said, "Bring me the bowl," shit you ain't got to do nothing.  "I can get 'em in the bowl," shit, I sat there and shared butter beans.  I think I ended up, oh, I don't know, ten or fifteen dollars, it was a lot of money, but then it wasn't a lot of money when you look at it today.  But it, you know, no more than that basically I'm working for somebody else, I don't know what's in there, you know, I'm just a driver.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was your response if somebody asked you who you were and what you doing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.  And plus, I had a Georgia license I didn't have a New York license.  See they thought all the trouble was coming from the northern blacks.  They never gave us any credit at all, we was too dumb and ignorant to know what was going on, or to have any input at all.  But they didn't know that we was right there doing it for 'em.  There was no way none of those groups, Bob [Robert Parris Moses] or any of the rest of them, could've did anything if it hadn't been for the work that we was doing.  Their project would have been through, but nobody talks about it.
Speaker 1: That's right, I mean that's a significant role, I figured it had something to do with it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you all knew you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we had maps on the wall with pins in it, red pins meant safe, you know, white pins meant this, blue pins meant this, you know, you can get gas here.  You can get a--you know, if your car breaks you can go over there and get this--if this happened, you know, and that's the way we moved.  I knew how long it took me to get from Atlanta to Tuskegee [Alabama].  Tuskegee usually would be my first stop going that way, the next stop would be Meridian [Mississippi], the next stop would be Jackson, depends on which way we were going.  If you were going the other way, go Montgomery [Alabama], Birmingham [Alabama], you know.  So, and it was planned, you know, it was prepared before me, and that's the way it really worked.  Just like I say, when you were supposed to be at a place, and you wasn't there, that's what upsetted folks.  They knew it would take me three hours to drive from here to Birmingham.  If I wasn't there within those three hours, they would turn around and send a car back looking for me on the highway.
Story_ID: 344131
Speaker 1: Were you ever stopped in Mississippi or--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was never arrested in Mississippi.  I was arrested in Alabama but, Georgia and Alabama.
Speaker 1: So they actually arrested you in those states?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well now for what--for what in Alabama?
Speaker 2: For I guess just being a stranger in town because we--this was a couple of days after Bloody Sunday.  I think we started arriving and regrouping and bringing more folks into Selma [Alabama] that Monday, and that Monday night I think they swept through the neighborhood.  They picked up everybody, they got Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture], they got Ralph [Ralph Abernathy], they get myself, they got [HistoryMaker] John Lewis, they got every SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] worker--(background noise) she can get it out there.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Every stranger that was in Selma was picked up and thrown in the can.
Speaker 1: This was in 1965 right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the first time I ever went before the judge at night.  They pulled a bus up, and they put us all on this bus, and we didn't know what they was gonna do with that bus.  We thought they was gonna drive it off into the river (laughter).  And, but that was quite a time, but that was the reason for that they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, now what happened, and did they ever catch on that you were with SNCC at all, did they catch on to it?
Speaker 2: No not really, especially the Alabama folks I don't think so because I can't recall now how many days we spent in jail.  I don't think we was in there a day, I don't, I can't--it was the same day the woman bit the, the chief's hand--thumb, he was trying to pull her down through there and--
Speaker 1: Oh what happened?  Tell that story--I'm not even--I don't think I've ever heard that story?
Speaker 2: We was at the Dallas County [Alabama] jail, and trying to get folks registered, and my job was to not let the line form in the alley.  I was--just made sure I stayed there and, you know, be the last man on--and I never moved.  And the guy was getting upset with me because I would never--I was always there.  I'd never moved up any I was--so they came in and rushed me and snatched me off the street in that incident.  And right before that incident, this Jim Clark, who was the chief down there, was tussling with this woman, and she bit his thumb, bit it to the bone.
Speaker 1: A black woman?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they arrested her also, I can't remember, I believe her name was Scott [ph.], I can't remember her name now, but that was the only Alabama arrest.
Story_ID: 344132
Speaker 1: Okay, my Selma [Alabama] thing really was to support [HistoryMaker] John Lewis after he had got beaten that Sunday.  We kind of reorganized, Atlanta [Georgia] moved all of the staff there to Selma.  Also set up an office in Montgomery [Alabama] because there was some key decisions was gonna have to be made in terms of what do we do with three thousand folks that we had in Montgomery.  These are folks that's trying to get to Selma, and they got us locked in the Brown Chapel's Church [Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama], and we gotta deal with it, you know.  So, I guess that Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, late night meeting decision was made that if the court ruled against Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], we would go to Montgomery.  And we would bring the march to Selma, one way or the other, the march was going to start this week, you know, enough is enough.  You know, the anger that had brought it all on had reached a point of, it had to be.  It was wet, it rained every day, and we was cold.  I mean, you know, it's a--they took a rope, a little jump rope, and tied it across the street in front of the church, and we had to stay behind this rope.  And man, for two days and two nights we sat there and looked at that rope, the rope got to go.  Somebody, the rope just got to go, so I cut the rope, you know--if the rope was a Berlin Wall (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, was it on anybody's order or did you just do it?
Speaker 1: No, that was the police department that put this rope up--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but what did, did somebody ask you to do it in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] or did you just do it?
Speaker 1: I just cut the rope, it was just too much of a--every time you saw it, it just scalds you bad.  Now they gonna keep us behind this little rope, you know.  And we was getting in out of the church anyway, we had parked all our cars over in the apartments and was using the apartments like you see on TV where they knock these holes through apartments and go through one building to the other.  We was doing that through doors and through windows.  We was bringing in twenty-five or thirty folks a night through the apartments, and the people was allowing us to do that these are the--
Speaker 2: Adjacent to the church?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The church is surrounded by these government apartments, and they thought, you know, that we were stuck, but no.  I mean, you know, this is why I'm going back to local folks, the role that they played.  A lot of kids don't know that right there in their community that those people allowed us access through their buildings to save our lives.  To make sure that we got soup and water into the church.  And I mean, you know, we had to bring all that stuff in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah now yeah those apartments are still there--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Those--the projects are right there across from Brown Chapel, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah we used them, well they was a good resource, and they was wondering how we was doing X, Y, Z.  We wasn't gonna tell you nothing, you find out, you the man, you know, we ain't gonna tell on the brother (laughter), but that's the way we were doing it.
Speaker 2: Oh that's something.
Story_ID: 344133
Speaker 1: Once again, the peoples there in those buildings should be saluted, and this is what--I just went down to the anniversary here in March and was very unhappy for a lot of reasons (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This the anniversary of the--
Speaker 1: The bridge [Edmund Pettus Bridge, Selma, Alabama] crossing.
Speaker 2: Bloody Sunday?
Speaker 1: Right.  And I know when we was in Brown's Chapel [Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama], and Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was trying to explain his reasoning for what was occurring, and he was strictly going on a court order against him.  The order never said SNCC, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, it said Dr. King and SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] was not allowed to march, but SNCC, you know, wasn't gonna play that kind of game.  That's why I was saying earlier, we had three thousand folks, Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], Alabama State [Alabama State College; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] was closed.  We had all them students ready to come I mean, you know, now we got we got thousands of folks coming down now, pouring into Montgomery [Alabama] with no place to stay, expecting to be on the road walking, you know.  So I mean it would become a logistic nightmare because so much of the highway could not be used for walking.  Only five or ten folks could walk in certain spots because of the ravines and stuff.  You know, just dangerous and unsafe, especially vehicles was coming, so some key decisions had to be made.  Where do we take 'em?  I mean, we got to move 'em to a safe area.  And you get a bunch of folks there, then the logistics of it, bathrooms (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Yeah, that's a--that can be a nightmare.
Speaker 1: I mean just this stuff, and a lot of farmers along that highway, black ones, lost their land because of it, for allowing us to use it.  And nobody today have as far as I know given them credit in the times come.  And I get emotional, you know, it's a lot of pain there.  A lot of events I can't even talk about because I'll lose it.
Speaker 2: Now tell me, now we've talked about a difference between SCLC and SNCC, can you give us what your perception of the difference is between those organizations and maybe why SNCC was founded in the first place?
Speaker 1: The ministers kind of ran the SCLC show, whereas we allowed the neighborhood to have input in SNCC. Everybody's voice, everybody's worry, meant something, might not agree with it, but they listened to it--what you had to say.  And I think that's the difference they gave, the SNCC gave the forum, you know, so you could let it loose.  And just like I say, SNCC was ran by cliques.  And what I mean by that, you had the Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] group, you had the Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] group.  You had the Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] group; you had the Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] group.  You had the Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] group, and whoever had the most at the meeting, at the time the meeting was going, controlled the meeting.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: The majority rules.  Most of the voting went on between two and four a.m. in the morning 'cause the average Joe would be asleep (laughter).  So Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] and the boys, you know, if he could stay up the longest and talk the longest and keep you waiting the longest so when the vote came, he had his people there.  So they just raised their hand, the motion carried it, and I'm chairman (laughter).  People woke up the next morning, the folks go well that's the way it went, but that's basically how it went with John, [HistoryMaker] John Lewis, you know, it was a midnight vote.
Story_ID: 344134
Speaker 1: Now what about Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses], you have any reflections about him?
Speaker 2: Well Bob has pretty much been an independent kind of a guy.  I--he, you know, had his pet projects he was working on, and I think peoples kind of let him did that.  I can't recall any confrontation in terms of anyone taking him on for any reasons, I think he was well-liked.
Speaker 1: Now you were saying earlier, before we started, and before we--as we were talking, that you were at Western University and a--Western College [Western College for Women] here in Oxford [Ohio] right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Close by here, where we are now?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In Yellow Springs [Ohio], in Oxford, Ohio when they were organizing the summer volunteers for 1964's voting registration campaign.  The Freedom Summer campaign, and you said you were there the day that the group found out that Goodman [Andrew Goodman], Schwerner [Michael Schwerner] and Chaney [James Chaney] had been killed in Mississippi, and, or probably were killed, they disappeared at that point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: And you were there when Bob Moses gave his speech to the group, can you describe that for me?
Speaker 2: Well it was so quiet, and all I can really remember, I believe it was Dorothy Cotton started singing a song.  Then Bob came out and gave the group the sad news that the workers had been killed.  And people should really decide now whether or not this is really what you really want to do.  It's a proven point that they will kill you, and the killing had only just begun.  We had had a couple of killings earlier, Tombeau [ph.] and a couple of other ones.  But no one left, and I think it was the way Dorothy started singing that song.
Speaker 1: I think it was 'Freedom is a Constant Struggle.'
Speaker 2: Constant struggle.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that was the juice that ran SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] people, was the music, the freedom songs.  You could go to a mass meeting, and when the meeting was over you could get up and pull your shoes off and walk on a bed of coal.  It wouldn't burn your feet, that's how fired up you would be, you know.  That's why most of the mass meetings occurred before an event because you got all of this energy now.  And you can walk for days 'cause you had such a high because of what just happened.  The worst thing this dude done did he done did it.  He done killed somebody, we ain't gone take this laying down.  That's what Selma [Selma to Montgomery March] was about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Jimmie Lee.
Speaker 2: Jackson [Jimmie Lee Jackson].
Speaker 1: Jackson, right.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: Was killed right?
Speaker 2: And we was sitting around and somebody, come up with the idea, let's take this body and put it on George Wallace's doorstep, and somebody hollered, "God damn let's do it."  And that's what kicked it off, what started it.  My feeling was let 'em go across the bridge [Edmund Pettus Bridge, Selma, Alabama] then come around and come back in the morning (laughter).  You know, but now you done whipped somebody or hurt somebody, now they gonna walk all the way.  And, you know, that was, 'cause that was our attitude, you know, just like I say, John being from Alabama was really behind it, [HistoryMaker] John Lewis.
Story_ID: 344135
Speaker 1: Wasn't it the idea of Hosea Williams, I think his idea to march?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but James Orange was actually the guy from SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] that was working in Selma [Alabama], it was a brother named James Orange.  And James Orange, Willie Ricks [Mukasa Dada], Bob Mants [Robert C. Mants, Jr.] and myself was asked to come up and form a line in front of Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and take him across the bridge [Edmund Pettus Bridge, Selma, Alabama].  It took me a long time, many years later, to realize why I was asked to do that, and that's because basically we didn't know, a lot of us didn't know that Martin had been threatened that Monday at Brown's Chapel [Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama].  I guess we was getting information on a need to know basis.  I don't think very many SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] people know about, probably a lot of folks in SCLC because I remember Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] asking everybody that had on a dark jacket, suit jacket, to come up front.  And this was in order to throw off the shot, if everybody had on a blue suit jacket and Martin had on blue suit jacket it would be hard for him to pick it out, that was his rationale.
Speaker 1: Yeah, from a distance.
Speaker 2: Right, so but then Orange and Ricks and myself was asked to go up in front of those people.  So we would get it first, I guess that's what you call it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Maybe that's why they didn't tell you.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, we probably would have still did it, but, and that was, that was the difference, SNCC ran its meetings more openly.  You knew what was gonna happen from one end to the other, it was a lot less information coming from SCLC.  Maybe Martin knew something, maybe Andy knew something, Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] might've knew something, but it wasn't filtered down.  SNCC would print up a press release and pass 'em out.  They had always had handbills, you know, they're gonna tell you upfront what they're gonna do.  You know, this the way it's gonna be and, you know, and that's the way we operated.  But there was never any real animosity or anything like that going on, it was just a difference in tactics.  We saw it a different way, and a lot of times we told Martin that we think our way is the best, and it caught him off guard a lot of times.  But you know, majority rules (laughter), that's the way we saw it, we had the more peoples, and we can put 'em out.
Speaker 1: Did you remember now, some other people we've interviewed have talked about this march, C.T. Vivian [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. C.T. Vivian], do you remember him?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And James Bevel [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel].
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, C.T. and I was in Selma together, matter of fact I was there at the Dallas County Courthouse [Selma, Alabama] when Jim Clark hit him right in the face that brought the blood, and so.  Bevel goes back to the Nashville [Tennessee] movement.  You know, he's always been around the SNCC office, you know, so Bevel was just like one of them little children.  So, you know, yep.
Speaker 1: What about--was Diane Nash involved in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah well, Diane is the mother, I mean she was the first secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, yep.  Yes, she was--she goes way back.
Speaker 1: Okay, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure do.  [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, as a matter of fact when I went to--in '65 [1965] this is when Ella Baker and I got together, and she encouraged me to go to be tested, you know.  And so part of that was moving to New York [New York], so I moved to New York and took Marion Barry's place at the New York SNCC office.  Marion was to leave the New York SNCC office and go to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] to begin to lay the groundwork to run for city council.  Okay, Julian [HistoryMaker Julian Bond] would run in Georgia, SNCC folks now is beginning to put that whole piece together, this coming after the Democratic convention [1964 Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey] in terms of what really happened, what really, really happened there, we were sold out.
Story_ID: 344136
Speaker 1: Let me go back to that now, we, the last we talked about it 'cause this--like the summer of '64 [1964] I think is really pivotal.  And, you know, a lot of the other things got coverage, but the summer of '64 [1964] was like a pivotal time in black history, that Freedom Summer.  So what are your reflections of Freedom Summer and organizing 'cause and just set the--really just set the stage?  And volunteers, mostly students, were invited from all over the country.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And black and white came down too, by the hundreds if not thousands to work in Mississippi.  And what are your reflections on that?
Speaker 2: I think it went well.  I think the job the students was asked to do was did, and we thought we had a good plan together.
Speaker 1: And what was the plan basically?
Speaker 2: The plan was to challenge the Democratic Party of State of Mississippi; that was their ultimate goal.  They couldn't represent all of the people in the State of Mississippi.  So we was gonna take someone to do that, and that was Fannie Lou Hamer's Freedom Democratic Party [Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party].
Speaker 1: So the Freedom Democratic Party was a group of voters registered by the--by SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That would go down and challenge the credentials of the--
Speaker 2: Democratic Party in Atlantic City [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: The Dixiecrats, the old guard, the all-white Democratic Party?
Speaker 2: And I think all of that went well, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now did you go to--
Speaker 2: Atlantic City [to the 1964 Democratic National Convention].  Oh yeah, we--I went to Atlantic City, spent many hours on the Boardwalk [Atlantic City Boardwalk, Atlantic City, New Jersey].  Just like I say, the work that students had earlier that summer, we dotted all of the Ts and I's, commas, and all that stuff was in the proper place.  And so we take a group of Mississippians up to Atlantic City, and we get there and Democratic Party kicks us out, is basically what happened--
Speaker 1: So they basically had a choice of whether to--the regular delegation was seated and you challenged their credentials?
Speaker 2: Right and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what happened, I mean what was--how was the challenge dealt with?
Speaker 2: Well they only would offer us two seats or one seat, two seats I believe, that's what the last--and we wouldn't accept it.  We didn't spend all that time in the hot summer sun down in Mississippi trying to get these folks registered to a straw convention, and a lot of time and energy, and we get all the way up to Atlantic City, and the same people that was encouraging us to take it on were the ones that turned their backs on us now.
Speaker 1: You talking about like the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The politicians.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Walter Mondale and the rest of that group, and Hubert Humphrey and the whole bit, you know.  We were doing such a good job, but you still--when it's time for you to stand up and be counted they didn't want that.  So they ended up offering Ms. Hamer two seats and she said she didn't come all the way for no two seats.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think she said a crumb.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So we packed up and went back to Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Yeah now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Started leaving that night.
Story_ID: 344137
Speaker 1: Now Ms. Hamer [Fannie Lou Hamer] like appeared on national television [at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey], right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, and to prove who was in charge, as soon as she went on the air and started talking about it, Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] went on the air, Lyndon Johnson, so they bleeped her off.  Cut her off on the convention floor, and put him on over in the Democratic headquarters office.
Speaker 1: I think he called a press conference, right?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah because Ms. Hamer was giving it to 'em, she was hammering on him, but she was talking about the whole bit.  I mean but Johnson didn't want to hear that, he didn't want to hear it, so that was basically what happened.  But we was sold out, it was just no doubt about it.  It just put too much trust in one or two folks.  And that kind of began to set the stage for white organizing, the white community.  And black organizing, the black community, black power was then on the scene, if you notice it come right after that.
Speaker 1: So what we're saying is that an attempt to really integrate the United States by participating in the system the way it was designed--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Didn't--was actually once you did everything you was supposed to do they told you--they still weren't gonna do it.
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: Because the majority of the people in Mississippi was still black right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Even in 1964 they still are in Mississippi (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, but if one fifth of them had been allowed to vote could've carried the state, and everything from dogcatcher to chief judge.  And that's why so many counties like Lowndes County [Mississippi], places like Holly Springs [Mississippi] that's why those communities was picked because of the majority in the black population.  If you can get half, then you can control, get three, you know, so that's why those communities was picked.  And why a lot of times and energy was picked, plus you had the professionals, the professors and other instructors and stuff that was good resource folks to keep--cover your back (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you needed that.  And, you know, people thought, it wasn't a lot of folks, you know, if you look at SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], SNCC staff probably never considered--consisted of more than thirty folks.  It was much more than that who hung around, but if you actually look at the people that was actually involved it was twenty-five or thirty people.
Speaker 1: Is that all?
Speaker 2: That's all brother, that's all so it--numbers mean something but numbers, not everything.  It's just knowing how to cross the I and how to dot that T and you--peoples like Guyot [HistoryMaker Lawrence Guyot], (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Lawrence Guyot?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses], I mean these was smart brothers, I mean, you know they was articulate.  People like Julian [HistoryMaker Julian Bond], the first time I seen a brother type with two fingers.  That's the way Julian types, you know, I never seen nothing like that.  That was exciting to me, you know, I didn't know this brother could type, god damn (laughter) he was whipping them out.
Story_ID: 342127
Speaker 1: In '65 [1965] you said you went to New York [New York], and you said that Ella Baker sent you into New York?
Speaker 2: Yeah pretty much to be tested, it was some of my problems that I was having and at the same time there was a bunch of young people being arrested in Jackson, Mississippi and being held in cattle yards as prisoners.  And being in New York, I--the New York office decided that we would have some type of demonstration of support there in New York to show support to the peoples in Jackson.  So several of us left the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] office and got big chains.  And the idea of the chains, we was gonna chain ourselves to columns of the courthouse in downtown Manhattan [New York], which is a United States courthouse [New York State Supreme Courthouse, New York, New York].  And we did it was--that was real easy, we just come right off the train and right up the steps and pull out the chains and locked 'em.  So that was no problem, so then the problems came when they decided that they'd had enough, and all this garbage had to go.  So they moved in their forces, and to get us off of the property.  And in the meantime, a man, young white fellow wearing a pair of khaki pants and a leather jacket, a brown leather jacket if I'm not mistaken, approached me, and the only thing was free was my feet.  So I folded him, I hit him right in the balls, I kicked him.  You know, I didn't know what he was and what he was trying to do--turned out to be a United States marshal.  Oh yeah, but now the game was turning a different swift, it's all back on me.  So they finally get me in the courthouse, and I ended up being convicted of assaulting a United States marshal and placed on five years' probation.  That incident would be a--would play a strong part in me leaving SNCC a year later.
Speaker 1: Well, why did they tell you to leave, I mean what?
Speaker 2: It was just at this stage in life, it was just tired, it was just, you just burned out.  I mean, you know, it's, you tried everything, you did everything, and a lot of it has not fallen into place like it should.  And a lot of ideas was going on about what Malcolm [Malcolm X] had said, and Malcolm spoke with a strong tongue.  And he said, you know, you have to do things for yourself, you know, by any means necessary.  And the whole bit--so the more and more I heard him talk the more and more I liked him.  And my whole attitude and feelings about the nonviolent philosophy has taken a whole different turn.  The cities, a lot of the cities, Detroit [Michigan], New York, D.C. [Washington, D.C.], all of 'em had already had uprisings, you know.  And to live through a riot and being able to talk about the next day is, is oh wow it was just awesome man.  It's just--I remember being up in Harlem [New York, New York] and jumping from rooftops trying to get back downtown Manhattan.  Hellen [HistoryMaker Hellen O'Neal-McCray] and I lived on 12th Street between A [Avenue A] and B [Avenue B] here I am way up on 125th Street and Lenox Avenue.  I got a long way to go (laughter), and they fixing to cut the trains off and the city's on fire, and, you know.  So it, I guess it had went its circle.  I don't know what else to use, but I knew, I've had enough.
Story_ID: 342128
Speaker 1: And I had met Arthur E. Morgan, who was president of Antioch College [Yellow Springs, Ohio], who also was involved in the Tennessee Valley Authority that builds all of that down in there.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, down in western Kentucky and Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean where did you meet him?
Speaker 1: He is right here in Yellow Springs [Ohio], he lived right up the street.
Speaker 2: Yeah I know, but I mean where did you meet him initially?
Speaker 1: In Yellow Springs.
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: I met him through his son Ernest, Ernest Morgan, who ran Antioch Publishing [Antioch Publishing Company, Yellow Springs, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Okay, well we had you in New York [New York] now so what--I'm just asking like where you met him.
Speaker 1: I came here in '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because of a barbershop incident they had here, Gegner (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lewis Gegner.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Gegner's Barbershop [Yellow Springs, Ohio], yep.
Speaker 1: So I knew some folks here in town.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I met Ernest, and because I was involved in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] printing he offered me a print shop job, you know, working for him.  And so I called him one day to tell him I was on the way, that's how I ended up in Yellow Springs.
Speaker 2: Now you were married by then right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, well tell us how you met your wife [HistoryMaker Hellen O'Neal-McCray]?
Speaker 1: She had left Mississippi and went back to New York.
Speaker 2: She was in SNCC too, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, and this was during my taking over Marion [HistoryMaker Marion Barry], so he could go to D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  She lived also in the same apartment building, and that's how we got together.  Her apartment caught fire, and I was able to put it out and save her some money I guess, so yeah, but that's how basically how we met.  Her apartment caught fire, and I ran over to snatch the curtains or something I can't recall now what was really burning.  I don't think it was a grease fire, but that's how we met.  I didn't know her prior to New York because she was going to the school there in New York, so that's basically, basically it.
Speaker 2: So you moved your family to Yellow Springs, though?
Speaker 1: No, Malcolm [Malcolm McCray] was born--my son, both sons was born here.  Then like I say, when I came here I was on federal parole, and the young kids in town, especially the young black kids, had never seen or ever heard of a black man being on federal probation or parole.  So it was something that I had to learn to live with, so the road got rocky.  And the way got awfully tough because a lot of the older folks saw me as a threat, whether I was or not.  You know, only place I was trying to do is put some sugar and flour on the table at this stage in my life, but for the first ten years, it was pure hell.  I would say ten or fifteen years I lived here as a matter of fact I couldn't even go up here to eat at Young's Dairy [Young's Jersey Dairy, Yellow Springs, Ohio], which is right down the street here and to the left because it's out of the county.  And my kids needed milk I couldn't even go, go up there and get a carton of milk unless I called them first.  So, you know, it was a difficult period.  And I was bitter, and I think a lot of that happened because Ruby died.  Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson, she died some time back there, you know, right during that period and she had so much information.  And so much stuff in her head that she, you know, the loss of her really made it difficult.  You had at this point, had nobody to pick up the phone and call if you had a problem.
Story_ID: 342129
Speaker 1: You know, I did the time, I ended up doing a year in the penitentiary.  And this scar here underneath the eye is the--was did in the penitentiary. And part of that was because of who I was.  The only record, the only arrest that I ever had in my life was civil rights activities, being involved in the movement.  And Ernest [Ernest Morgan], who was Dr. Morgan's [Arthur E. Morgan] son, came to the penitentiary to visit me.  And one of the inmates came up and told me, he said, "We want your boots."  I had on, I had big boots, so they brought me a pair of loafers or something and different shirts.  Oh, you got a different assignment, they assigned me to the print shop.  And a lot of inmates wanted to know, you know, how can I, or who was I, to have an assignment switch in the middle of the stream.  And they don't know nothing about it because inmates run the penitentiary (laughter), you know.  I mean, you know, who are you I mean, who was this guy come in telling the warden to give you a special assignment over here then I'm a spy, at least, that's what they think (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, so that put you kind of in jeopardy in some ways?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  That's why I ended up with my eye knocked out, and that happened right here in Ohio.  It didn't happen in Mississippi, it didn't happen in Alabama, it didn't happen--right here in Ohio where I thought I was safe.
Speaker 2: Where were you here, did they have you in the Ohio penitentiary?
Speaker 1: I went to Mansfield [Ohio State Reformatory, Mansfield, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Mansfield, oh okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did nine months and--
Speaker 2: For kicking the federal marshal in the groin.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's supposed to have been the--see I don't know it's a mystery to me, because just like I say I had no prior records and only record that I had was movement involvement.  And then I come here, just like I say, the young people would go around giving me the black power sign and the parents didn't understand it.  You know, at this stage Rap Brown [H. Rap Brown; Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] was on the loose they didn't know where he was.  And they was so afraid he was gonna come by the house and I was going to give him a glass of water.  So I was being watched, FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] used to sit across the street out there 24/7, you know.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you knew him though from SNCC, yeah (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, oh yeah I've been to his parents' house in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and the whole bit--
Story_ID: 342130
Speaker 1: --We was a band of brothers, you know, that's the way we saw each other, you know.  If I got a dime you got a dime, you know, that's the way it is, you know.  But we had--there was other ways of communicating.  Drive down, he might be in Cincinnati [Ohio] or down in Lexington [Kentucky], you know.  He'd look up there, and I'd be standing up north or out in the audience, but they knew that their backs was covered, you know, 24/7.  I mean, you know, Gerald Truitt [ph.], bunch of folks out of Dayton [Ohio] over there, McIntosh [W.S. McIntosh] and all those folks, I mean there was Charles Tate, Florence Tate.
Speaker 2: So W.S. McIntosh right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so yeah we have seen a lot of change, yep.
Speaker 2: So things finally settled down around here some or what?
Speaker 1: Well I would always be an outsider, I guess my kids [Malcolm McCray and Lawrence McCray] are Yellow Springers or Buckeyes or whatever you want to call them, but you know, I'm a transplant, and I've accepted that.  We're left alone, you know, we're here.  I mean nobody bothers us, you know, I know the neighbors, the neighbors know me, and that's about basically it.  If I'm out cutting the grass or picking up some brushes or something on the holiday, yeah we're pretty much left alone.  Yeah, so I like Yellow Springs [Ohio] for that reason, and the location is nice, you know.  Eight hours to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], eight hours to Atlanta [Georgia], three hours to Chicago [Illinois], twelve to New York [New York].  So I mean that's one of the reasons we picked it, you know, both our parents at that time was living in the South.  And we just didn't, you know, want it to be eight or ten hours away at the most.  So that's why we picked southern Ohio, and it served its purpose, and I guess it's time to move on, and I'll do that in the next twelve months.
Speaker 2: So you gonna move?
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go back south.
Speaker 2: Do you?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--every time I go back I just see more and more of it that I miss, like Muscadines, and scupadines and all that shit grows wild.
Speaker 2: Scuppernongs and stuff, yeah?
Speaker 1: Grows wild, you know, you just reach out on the vine and reach out, oh man, I miss that.  I got fruit trees planted out back but mine ain't nothing like they are down there, man.  So it's all good.
Story_ID: 342131
Speaker 1: --Right now you're a security officer at the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center [Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think I mean did--when you started there did they know your background and did they know that you had been with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] or did they know what that meant even, I mean.
Speaker 2: John Fleming.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who was the director out there, was also a student from North Carolina that was involved in SNCC.  And it just so happened it--I guess the Lord did work in mysterious ways.  But he looked out for me, you know, yeah, but I wasn't--I don't think I would've got the job if it had been somebody else.  I don't--you know, but because it was John and that was--it's all good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause see I'm trained just like the ODOT [Ohio Department of Transportation].  I was trained by the ODOT, firearms, you know, the whole bit certified, you know, the whole bit.  So I mean I can do private security, anything, so took all the classroom work.  And the whole bit so just like any police officer.  I liked the museum because it didn't require me to carry a firearm, which made it great because I am quick-tempered, you know.  If I had it you know (laughter) don't touch the painting man, no, but it's all good, that's.
Story_ID: 342132
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: That we are able to find some type of solution to the madness.  And what I mean by that, the black-on-black crime.  We didn't do all this work to see our grandbabies treated the way they are by the thugs, you know.  And part of that is when you have children having children.  We had a lot more help with our children than the children today is having, you know.  But we, we need to figure out some way to deal with that, and then definitely the educational system is shot, it's gone.  I--and the conversation started off with education, I guess it can end with education.  But there's so many reasons why young peoples are the way they are.  But I think they can be saved, but we just have to find the right program that's gonna excite 'em like it--the Civil Rights Movement excited us.  The willingness to go out and spend that time, and do what is necessary to get it better.  But you cannot have babies raising babies, I mean it's just it's gone crazy, you know, I was twenty-five, twenty-six when my youngest--my oldest son [Malcolm McCray] was born.  You know, so, and then it's ten years difference between my youngest son [Lawrence McCray] and my oldest son.  So we thought we had the right plan, you know, it wouldn't be no more sharecropping (laughter), you know, raising ten or fifteen kids.  And then we have to understand why people did that in those days because it was a matter of survival.  You know, they had to have nine, ten, fifteen kids because they would lose one, you know, for various reasons, sickness or what have you, so--
Speaker 1: They needed the help too--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I'm saying somebody had to work the cotton fields.  And, but we made a promise that we wasn't gonna do that.  So we come up with two kids, and before they are out of high school they got babies, and that's what the problem is, you know.  And then with the court system like it is where you can't discipline.  I think once they took discipline of children out of the home and put it into the court system, that's why we having the problem.  Because my boys ain't gonna come in here and sit at that table and eat my groceries if I can't tell him to go tie his shoes up, you know.  And that's what the problem is, if I hit one of 'em, all he got to do is pick the phone up say, "My dad just hit me," they coming over--throw my ass in jail.  And I live here, I'm paying the taxes, but that's what this system has gone to even your grandbabies can pick the phone up (laughter) call and say, "Grandpa just whipped me, come get him."  Hey, but we didn't have to worry about that when we was coming up, you know, but I think that's what the problem is.  I think they had to find something for these new degrees that the human services and all these new degrees that they're coming up with to, you know.  And basically that's what happened I mean, you know, they created a whole new children's services type of thing, you know, so, to build jobs.
Story_ID: 342133
Speaker 1: Now, are you still involved in organizations that are dealing with social change and all?
Speaker 2: Every once in a while I'll do something, but I've been picking and choosing, just like I say, I worked on the Karina [sic.] event (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Hurricane Katrina.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I will mess it up won't I (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's why I had to say it again I just want to make sure people knew the Hurricane Katrina--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did pretty good here in the village [Yellow Springs, Ohio], we was able to send four or five truckloads of materials and stuff down.  I think we'll try to put together stuff later on in the summer when the need would be greater.  I think another three or four months from now there'll be a lot more peoples needing that type of stuff.  And we'll--we got some free roofers here, organization called free roofers.  And I've been negotiating with them about going down for a week, and see can they do about four or five houses with new roofs.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know, so just like I say, at this stage in my life I have gotten to the point where I pretty much pick, you know, and choose now.
Speaker 1: How do you reflect on your SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] activities?  I mean at the time I know you mentioned that--I heard a lot of people say that in 1964 and '65 [1965] and '66 [1966], it seemed like maybe all the act- activities were just falling to the ground.  And though you've done so much it didn't seem like anything was changing but now can you see where you did something was valuable or--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I think the--from day one up until SNCC days, that ended.  And let's talk a little bit about the reason SNCC folded.  There was some questions raised about where's the money coming from, if you go back and look at some of the old press releases.  During that period, you see Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture], Forman [HistoryMaker James Forman], several other SNCC folks traveling the African continent, going to several countries making connections.  Lot of push for information was trying to be swindled out of folks, beaten out of folks, in terms of what SNCC was really up to, and once again this goes back to what Malcolm X had came to Selma [Alabama] and preached.
Speaker 1: Were you there when he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what, the message to the grassroots I think?
Speaker 2: Right, SNCC folded because the government tax office, and we know who the money was coming from, but we wasn't gonna tell 'em.  We didn't feel it was their business, it was obvious that we thought that there was the job that the federal government should've been doing in the first place.  And if I guess I could talk about it now, peoples like Lucy Montgomery, white woman, she bankrolled a quite a bit.  [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte had a group of folks, so it was a nice group of folks that didn't want their names out there, so we didn't tell it.  And so the only thing they could do was padlock the door, so we let them padlock the door, you know, but that's what caused SNCC to fold, was the government.
Story_ID: 344138
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965] campaign, you know, was kind of the tail end of it, and I would be involved in one more march after that, and that would be the Meredith [Meredith March Against Fear], Memphis [Tennessee] to Jackson [Mississippi] walk by James Meredith (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's when he was shot right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Shot during the march.
Speaker 1: And that would be the--
Speaker 2: Were you there when he was shot, I mean, were you?
Speaker 1: I wasn't there when he was shot, but we got involved in the march.  We--I think he had been on the road though maybe two or three days before we had--SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] office really began to pull peoples in.  I don't think it really happened until after he was shot that a lot of folks decided at that point that they would go on in and support him, you know.  And so we poured all our resources into Mississippi, and started inviting veterans that had went back to their own communities to come back into Mississippi for one more trip.  And on this trip black power would come on the scene.  Several days before--black power would use Willie Ricks [Mukasa Dada], who lived in Chattanooga [Tennessee], took a bus down to Atlanta [Georgia], stopped in the Atlanta office, and asked Forman [HistoryMaker James Forman], we needed something else to give peoples hope.  And Ricks asked Forman whether not he thought using the word black power would be okay, that was a discussion, maybe an hour and forty minutes or maybe less, with the Atlanta staff there was there.  We didn't see anything wrong with it because basically that's what we was doing, trying to empower people, and they was black people, so we didn't see nothing wrong with black power.  We knew that at some point the slogan would be used, but just like I say, time is the key.  And so I would imagine we was ten miles, four miles outside of Jackson.  We was--I remember as the marchers come up the highway the train track kind of went across like this, and the train was coming.  And Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] hollered, "Black power," hollered black power, holler black power, and Ricks hollered black power, and the train stopped.
Speaker 2: Now was this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The train stopped, and 'cause they ain't never heard nothing or seen nothing like that.  He was hollering, "Ungawa, black power, Ungawa, black power."  And all of the other walkers and peoples in the march started hollering, "Ungawa, black power."  And all of the white folks that was coming out on the curve turned around and started going back in the house because they'd never heard nothing like it and they couldn't understand what was going on.  And that was--and the only thing it was supposed to be used to just give some energy to keep the legs going.  And that was basically supposed to be the end of it, but it turned out to be something totally different.
Story_ID: 344139
Speaker 1: All right, black power.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was just like I say it was, it wasn't meant to end up the way it did, Lowndes County, Alabama, where the panther was used as a symbol was only because most of the blacks in Lowndes County could not read or write.  And we used a cat, a rooster and an elephant on the booklet.  So they could identify, they knew what these symbols meant.  So when they went to the ballot box, these same symbols will appear on the ballot, and they would know which ones to punch.
Story_ID: 344140
Speaker 1: So that's the origin of the term black power, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, just like I say, it was supposed to be used, and then folks got a hold to it took, it the wrong direction.  Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] had a field day with it, you know, he went on, tried to explain it.  You know, come up with all the rationales, the reasoning, and which was all good.  But if you look at any of the literature that was printed by SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] in those days and talks about black power, it talks about the good of it.  And it wasn't--just like I say, there was nothing supposed to be negative about it.  Almost like when the Panthers [Black Panther Party] went and stood up out there in Oakland [California] on the courthouse for the right to bear arms.  That was supposed to be a one-day event, and they was supposed to take their guns home and put 'em back in the closet.  And it would be over with, but that one event turned into three or four years of violent confrontations.  Just because somebody took it the wrong way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the term of black militants saying they're trying--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: To tear up America--
Speaker 2: And see black folks were not allowed to have weapons up until that time.  You had 'em I mean, you know, dad had a shotgun sitting up in there, but they went squirrel hunting, rabbit hunting, camping around the farm, you know.  But as far as having a weapon, black folks was not allowed to have weapons before the Panthers made their stand in Oakland.  And that was the right to bear arms, First Amendment [sic.] right to bear arms.  That was the reason behind it, and that's why they did it, but then the press got it and gave 'em a little boost.  And everybody got excited because of the press time and one thing just led to another one.  And I have some bad stuff, I shouldn't say bad, but it was bad to me.  The only organization that supported the Panthers during their struggle was Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, better known as SNCC.  And for them to do Jim Forman [HistoryMaker James Forman] the way they did, they better been glad that a lot of us didn't know about it until months and months after it was over (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, well what happened?
Speaker 2: They put a gun in his mouth.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: And threatened him.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: You know, these, some of the young bucks, now see they don't realize that when they--their old days it was, it was us who kept 'em surviving, you know, that happened.  And a lot of us back in the East found out about it, you know, I couldn't afford to fly to California just to get in a fight (laughter), you know, but we would've, but Forman said leave it alone.  You know, but we--
Speaker 1: What was the argument, I mean why did they do that, was the story behind it?
Speaker 2: Jealousy, you know, Forman was a brilliant man, and he thought before he said anything.  He would sit down, make a little note, then he'll sit there a few more minutes.  And then he'll get up and say, "Doctor, this is, there, this is this," and they couldn't deal with it.  And, you know, they couldn't deal with it--they threatened to kill the brother, and I still believe--
Speaker 1: So is this the Panther leadership that did this to him?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And I still believe that they killed Cornell Reagon, you know, because he was killed by gangbangers, you know, trying to stop the scene on the street.  You know, it's a lot of pain there, and it's a lot of stuff that hadn't been told.  And just like I say, a lot of us had restrictions where we couldn't move, like I was stuck here.  You know, for five years I needed permission to go to the bathroom.
Story_ID: 344141
Speaker 1: Now when you were here--while you were here were you involved in--I know I was asking you when I came in about the campus, the organization of the black organization on campus at Antioch [Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know I saw in 1966, Jet magazine they took over a dorm, called it Umoja--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Hall [Nyambi Umoja], what is, did you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was involved in all that, just like I say, I helped do a lot of the proposals and the curriculum for that ISSP [Institute for the Solution of Social Problems], that new direction program that they brought in.  I did a lot of that.  A lot of it was did right here in this house, a lot of the proposals and stuff, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: So you didn't stop organizing and dealing with these issues just because you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did what I was allowed to get away with doing.   The--just like I say the first fifteen years they was just, they was hot on me.  And Yellow Springs [Ohio] was one of those communities is on the ten most wanted list.  It was one of the most undesirable places in the country to be, Yellow Springs, Ohio, Antioch College.
Speaker 1: Well, because of the antiwar activism?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: The black activism, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, it was a difficult period for a lot of things, and I lost track of a lot of folks and a lot of folks, you know, peoples like Julian [HistoryMaker Julian Bond] and Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture].  And when they had speaking engagements in the area, they knew I was here, and they'll stop by, you know.  So I had a little contact over the years.
Story_ID: 344142
Speaker 1: So, when you look back at everything you've done at this point, is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: No, no, I think you, you play the hand you're dealt.  And I think I'm going to get a good hand before it's all said and done, I haven't got it yet.  I think I'm gonna get it, at least, they're beginning to talk about it.  And that's what's so good about it.  Just to talk about it, 'cause it was a hard road to hoe and it wasn't, it was--had a lot of crooked places.  And it was almost impossible to keep straight and so, we kept our eyes on the prize.  And we always say at the end, we'll never turn back, I got miles to go before I'm home.
Story_ID: 344143
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I saw the wrong and tried to right it.  When it was time to stand up I stood up.  I don't think you can say, or I can say much more than that because it would be nice to have someone else write that for me just to let them know that I think this is, you know.  But I think I wouldn't change a bit, Hellen [HistoryMaker Hellen O'Neal-McCray] has been one of the greatest things for me, she saved my life many times.  And I think if you talk to any of the women that was involved in the struggle, they all was strong.  Yep, she was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There seems to be today, I know that when I was involved in VISTA [Volunteers in Service to America; AmeriCorps VISTA], there was something called friends of VISTA, a lot of them were ex-SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] people.  They were linked to other sites where SNCC people would get together.  You know, on the web there'd be gatherings around the country with people in SNCC who really don't get the kind of attention that war veterans get.  When war veterans go through traumatic situations and they can go to the doctor, not that they are getting everything they ought to get.  But is there any, I mean nobody has really dealt with the veterans in the Civil Rights Movement in terms of what they need and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was an organization formed last Thursday which is the--and it's the Veterans of the Mississippi Movement [Veterans of the Mississippi Civil Rights Movement].  And the idea of it, to try to retrieve some of the documents that was stored at The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] which has been sold to the Park Service [National Park Service].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And when the SNCC office closed, most of the SNCC papers was stored at this King Center, so we had to form a veterans committee so we can get the legal people to deal with it if they have to deal with it through a legal challenge.  I don't see any problem because it was always supposed to be used as storage area.  I don't see them, you know, all I think that should happen is they go over and say, "We want to get the SNCC papers," and they should let them have 'em.  And that's once again Ruby Doris [Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson] and Forman [HistoryMaker James Forman] both are dead now and those, they was the backbone, you know.  The final decision laid with them, and what they was told I don't know, you know.  I wasn't allowed to go down because I was probation for the last closing meeting that they had, but the veterans committee, State of Mississippi has some good things coming up.  They actually believe that they can pull off the first governor of Mississippi this time so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so it's not just a club reflecting about what's happened in the past, they're actually planning?
Speaker 2: They're planning the big picture, and they seem to think that the time is right to do it.
Speaker 1: Well, let's hope so.
Speaker 2: So, I told 'em, you know, just ask us what you want us to do, we know how to play the game.  You know, we've canvassed many neighborhoods, once again this goes back to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] with Marion [HistoryMaker Marion Barry], Buttermilk Bottom [Old Fourth Ward, Atlanta, Georgia] with Julian [HistoryMaker Julian Bond], you know, and the whole bit.  I mean, you know, we could bring in the SNCC folks, people like Ivanhoe [Ivanhoe Donaldson], Charlie Cobb [Charles E. Cobb, Jr.], the list is long.  You know, I mean they would love to go back to Mississippi and elect the first black governor and be a part of that.  You know, if there's areas that they really need the peoples in, we can mobilize that and send them in there.  I mean, we're at a stage in our lives--I'm sixty-five years old, you know, hey, ain't no more you can do to me, you know.  I'll go in the morning, you know, my little social security check'll follow me anywhere I go (laughter).  You know, I guess that's nice about getting old, you know, it's all good.
Story_ID: 344144
Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you that you think you want to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Oh well, no.  I think I'm--what's your last one?
Speaker 1: Oh the last one, it's similar to legacy.  It's--well, I didn't ask you about your family though, I didn't ask you that, you got two children right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, two boys.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Malcolm [Malcolm McCray] and Lawrence [Lawrence McCray], I guess you can understand why named one Malcolm, Malcolm Dubois, and my youngest son is named Lawrence because of my middle name, and O'Neal because it's his mother [HistoryMaker Hellen O'Neal-McCray].
Speaker 1: Oh, it's Lawrence O'Neal McCray.
Speaker 2: I have a granddaughter [Carley McCray], she lives in Florida, and one grandson [Lawrence McCray] lives in Springfield [Ohio].  And we get--she left on Wednesday, and we get him on Friday nights, and we keep him 'til Sunday and take him back and forth.  So we pretty set in our ways so, you--but it's all good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My oldest son lives up in Troy [Ohio].  Yep, yep, so it's all good.
Story_ID: 344145
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I sort of needed to get on board, and some inner strength kept telling me I had to do it.  I realized over the years that everybody can't participate in nonviolent action, other means of protest, but there are some of us that is very good at it.  And I'd like to be remembered as one of the very best that it because just like I say, I think it's a heck of a thing to travel as many miles on many dirt roads as I did and never lost anybody.  I'm talking about it, it wasn't no pavement, you hit that sand and that sand will take you places you don't want to go, you know.  And drive a car on the back roads of the State of Mississippi and south Georgia but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have a favorite car?  I don't know why they came to me, but I wondered.
Speaker 2: I drove a Ford, '56 [1956] Ford, most of my movement years, but I had access to the motor pool.  I had the keys--a line of keys up on the wall, so if I wanted a car I'd just go out and reach up on the wall and get a key.  And I have documents--see the name of the motor pool was the Sojourner Motor Fleet.  Sojourner Truth Motor Fleet, and we leased them.  If you needed a car we would just come in, fill out you a lease, give you the keys to it send you on the way then, we file that lease.  I have some of those leases around here somewhere but, you know, my position in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] put me in some good spots.  I was always near the warehouse, we had a warehouse that contained clothing, food because a lot of folks would get kicked off the farm.  We had to have food for them to eat so we had this big warehouse in Atlanta [Georgia], just stuff from one end of it to the other with nothing but canned goods, you know, and all that stuff.  So I mean, I had the key, it's nice to have the key (laughter), you can get along well with the key.  So, you know, I took care of the business, and they took care of me.
