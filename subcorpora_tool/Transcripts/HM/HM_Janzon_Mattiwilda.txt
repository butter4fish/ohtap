Speaker 1: Let's begin now and talk first, starting talking about your mother [Irene Thompson Dobbs], starting with your mother's name and where your mother grew up as a girl and if she ever talked about her childhood and what life was like for her growing up.
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Columbus, Mississippi, and her father [Kelly Thompson] was a barber, had his own shop.  From what I heard from her, he only had white customers.  It was a holdover from slavery.  She was born just a few years after slavery.  And during slavery, all the barbers had been white, and so the white men went to the black barbers.  And her--she had two sisters and a brother.  She had really three sisters; one died.  And she had piano lessons when she was a young girl and from what I can understand, she had a very good middle class upbringing.  And her--she took a course, a teacher's training course, and she told me that she had wanted to teach school.  And her father wouldn't allow her to do so because at that time in Mississippi, it was very dangerous for attractive young black women who had to have to do with the school board and the white men on the school board and so forth, and so he wouldn't allow her to teach, and probably she would've had to have left Columbus and gone to some small town or something.  Anyway, she wasn't able to do that.  But she had a married sister living in Atlanta [Georgia], and she visited her then; that's where she met my father [John Wesley Dobbs].  But I never knew--well, I can't say I never knew my grandparents, because at least my grandmother [Mattiewilda Sykes Thompson] was still alive when I was about two years old, but I just don't remember it.  I was told that my mother took me to Columbus to visit, and I'm not sure whether not my grandfather was alive or--at that time, but I don't have any recollection of that trip.
Speaker 1: And did your mother ever talk about what life was like for her as a girl growing up in Columbus, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  She--as I said, she had a very comfortable home life, and she had piano lessons, and she was able to study, and she told me one day something that happened when she and some friends had taken the carriage and horses of some visiting guests and taken a ride around the block, and she got very much punished for that, you know.  It was a hard lesson, but that was a reckless thing to do (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did your mother ever talk--were there any stories about slavery that were handed down to the family?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I--you know, I'm sorry that I didn't ask more about it, but I know that the older people weren't--didn't want to talk about it so much.  They were ashamed and especially for those who were offspring of the white-black unions, and there were so many of them during slavery and also just after slavery.  And I--my mother mentioned one time about her aunt or something who had a relationship with a white man then and I know that both of her parents were half-white.  But they were just--they wanted to be respectable; that was the main thing.  So, I didn't hear too much.  I wish I had asked more now (laughter).
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother was very beautiful.  I always thought that she was really very beautiful and very sweet, and I couldn't have asked for a better mother.
Story_ID: 253948
Speaker 1: What was your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Irene [Thompson Dobbs], and that's something I wanted to mention about names.  She named me for her mother whose--and my name is very unusual.  I've never encountered anybody with the name Mattiwilda as one word.  I've heard of people named Wilda, and someone told me that Wilda was a Polish name.  I didn't know that, but how my great-grandparents took the name Wilda for their daughter in Mississippi in those days, I don't know.  They probably heard of someone with that name.  But my maternal grandmother's name was Mattie, M-A-T-T-I-E, and Wilda, W-I-L-D-A [Mattiewilda Sykes Thompson], so my mother wanted it to be one name, and so she took out the E and combined them so that's how I got my name.
Speaker 1: And what was your nickname growing up?
Speaker 2: My little sister [HistoryMaker June Dobbs Butts] had a very hard time calling me by my real name; she was three years younger.  And so she started calling--I remember at first, she first went from Wilda to Weekie [ph.] because I had a cousin who called me that for a while.  And then from Weekie, she came on Geekie [ph.], so then the whole family started calling me that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Except my mother when she was angry, she would call me by my real name.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) As most mother's do.
Speaker 2: And then I knew I was in trouble (laughter).
Story_ID: 253949
Speaker 1: Let's talk now about your father starting with your father's name and the same thing, your father's background, where he grew up and that kind of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father grew up on a farm in north Georgia, Kennesaw [Georgia], Cobb County, and that's now a very affluent suburb of Atlanta [Georgia].  But his father [Will Dobbs] had been a slave, and his grandparents had been slaves, and his mother [Minnie Hendricks Dobbs Banks] and father were married when his mother was young, very much younger than the father, and they separated shortly afterwards.  And my father's mother wasn't suited to farm life.  She hated living on the farm, so (laughter) in those days, grandparents would gladly take care of children, so she left her son and daughter in the care of her--of their grandparents who were the main ones on this farm.  And my great-grandmother had thirteen children.  She was around fifty, but that didn't stop her from taking these two children.  So my grandmother left my father and his sister with the grandparents in Cobb County, and she went to Savannah [Georgia] to work, and she was a seamstress and worked for white people there.  And I've often wondered how she came to go from north Georgia down to Savannah, how she was able to do that on her own, you know, a single woman.  But a cousin told me that she had heard from her father that my grandmother probably had met someone, a man, who was a servant of some very wealthy white people who used to come to Marietta, Georgia, for the summer, because Savannah was a hot place.  And it sounds strange that people would come to north Georgia to be cool, but it was cooler there than in Savannah.  So these white families would come to Marietta and bring their servants with them, and Marietta was very near this farm, so I'm sure that my grandmother, a young, beautiful, vivacious, young woman made a lot of friends among those people, you know, from the city, and they helped her to get a job.  And so she went to Savannah, but she came back and got my father, and his sister.  And my father was about nine years old when she came back, and he said he had great faith that she would come back and get them.  Then they moved to Atlanta after that.
Speaker 1: Oh, so they moved--
Speaker 2: Some years later.
Speaker 1: And, I'm sorry, what was your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's name was John Wesley Dobbs.  He was named for the great Methodist minister, John Wesley.  A lot--a lot of people that I knew were named John Wesley (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And did your father ever share any stories that were passed down through the family about slavery?  Did he remember any?
Speaker 2: Well, my father didn't know anything about slavery.  He was born just after.
Speaker 1: Right, but did his parents and did his grandparents ever share any stories with him?
Speaker 2: I suppose they did, but I never heard him say anything more than he was happy that he missed slavery by just twenty some odd years, because his mother had been born a slave.  And so the--I did actually have a step-grandfather who had been a slave.  My--this same grandmother, my father's mother, later on married a man and lived in Atlanta, so she was alive until I was twelve years old, and she was the only grandparent I knew.  And this man was much older than she was, and he had actually been a slave as a child.  And my sister and I would very often ask him to talk about slavery days.  We thought that was like fairy tales, you know (laughter)?  And it was terrible.  He--I remember he said that he would be locked into chicken coops while his mother went out to work, and he was slightly deaf, because he'd been boxed on his ears so much.  This has nothing to do with slavery, but it is something that is very interesting that I actually experienced.  I saw a confederate soldier dressed up in his gray uniform.  He was an old man, and he sold newspapers downtown in Atlanta where I grew up.  And he was there dressed.  He had a beard, and he was dressed in his gray uniform and everything, and I figured later on that he must--I was very young, and I was born in 1925, and the [Civil] War ended in 1865, so he probably had been very young when he went, just before the end of the war, and lived to be very old.  So, that was a very unusual thing.  I actually saw one (laughter).
Story_ID: 253950
Speaker 1: What kind of work did your father [John Wesley Dobbs] do when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: My father at first was a Railway Mail [Service] clerk, and he was able to be promoted to clerk in charge, which was the highest that he could go.  You know, this was during the time when they sent the mail on trains, and they were portable post offices.  And I remember that he retired--he started when he was a young man, about twenty-one, and he retired.  It was a government job, federal government, so he was able to retire with a pension after thirty years.  And I was a little girl when he was still working as a railway mail clerk, and he would take me and my sister down to look at the car, and I thought--always thought that was fascinating to see that post office on the train and--
Speaker 1: What did it look like?  Can you describe it?
Speaker 2: Well, it was--you know, we had the same thing at home, because he had to have a copy of the sorting box at home, and he had to practice, because what they had to do was to sort the mail very quickly.  It was a night run.  He ran from Atlanta [Georgia] to Nashville [Tennessee], and they did all their work at night, and then the mail evidently arrived in Nashville and on the way the next morning.  And so, there was--there were these little compartments where the mail was sorted, you know, I guess according to where it was going.  There were no zip codes or anything like that, but they had to know very quickly in which slot they put that letter.  And so, in order to keep his job and also to go further in his position with the government, he had to practice.  So he had this copy set up at home and I would--I'd see him very often copying, sorting the mail there.  Then he got to be clerk in charge, which was like a postmaster, and it was very high position.  It was as high as he could go as a black man.  They weren't going to let him be anything in the post office or anything or go any higher than that.  But that was unusual, because I don't know if there was anybody else.  I just never heard of any other clerk in charge.  He was given a gun, because, you know, this was not too long after the robberies on trains, Jesse James and the bandits who would rob trains, so the government gave him a gun as clerk in charge, in case there were any robbers.  And here he was, a black man, over all these very hostile white people.  They hated him.  They wouldn't eat with him.  He had to take his lunch and eat on the train, and they wouldn't eat with him.  They--well, they really didn't have much in common, but they treated him very bad.  And I remember his cleaning that gun; he had to clean it, and he kept it at home when he was at home, and he frightened me and my sisters very much.  He was afraid we might accidentally get a hold of the gun and shoot it.  And so I don't think I could touch a gun today; I'm so frightened of them (laughter).
Story_ID: 253951
Speaker 1: --I don't know if you're interested, but when he [Janzon's father, John Wesley Dobbs] was getting ready to be retired, he had already started his other job, which was working with the black Masons of Georgia, and he was not head of them then, he was secretary or something, but they had a lot of businesses.  They had property; they had an orphan home [Masonic Orphans Home, Americus, Georgia]; they had buildings, and it was a big organization.  He already had started working with them, and so when he applied for his pension, the local people in the post office tried to stop it by saying that he had this other job, and they tried to say that he hadn't had his full number of years and all that.  And I remember he was very upset because they were trying to keep him from retiring at that age, after thirty years.  And he and my mother [Irene Thompson Dobbs] were friends with the McDuffies who Mr. [Irvin] McDuffie was a personal valet of President [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt, even from the time that Roosevelt was governor of New York.  And President Roosevelt was an invalid, you know, with--he'd had polio, and so this valet was very close to him.  He was the one who put him in bed at night, and was--he had been with him many years.  So, my father told him about his troubles.  He said, "I'll speak to President Roosevelt."  This was when Roosevelt was now president, and he did.  And so President Roosevelt said my father could come to Washington [D.C.] and talk to him.  And he--oh, by the way, Mrs. [Elizabeth] McDuffie was a maid there, but they were from Atlanta [Georgia] and they kept a house in Atlanta.  They would come back down vacations; I got to know them.  So my father went there and spoke to the president, and he saw that his claim was legitimate, and it was just prejudice and discrimination, people who hated him trying to keep him from getting his pension, so he said, "I'll arrange for you to meet with the postmaster general," who was Farley, James Farley, then.  And he went and spoke to him, and he did--he got his pension for him.
Speaker 2: Wow.  Wow.
Speaker 1: So that's, that's an unusual story I think.
Story_ID: 253952
Speaker 1: What else can you tell us about your father's [John Wesley Dobbs] involvement with the Masons?
Speaker 2: Yeah, then he became head of the Masons with--grandmaster, as they called it.  And as I explained before, they had this orphan home [Masonic Orphans Home], and they took in children whose fathers or uncles had been Masons.  They had a school there, a farm; it was in Americus, Georgia.  And we'd go there once a year because they would have their annual meeting.  And it was very interesting.  They did a great job, and they would educate the ones who, you know--past high school.  They had their own school there, and they worked on the farm.  And those who were able--were capable of going to college, they would send them to college.  But it got to be too expensive, and then they couldn't keep on with that.  In fact, the whole organization suffered very much in the [Great] Depression and that was when my father took over, just when they were having all of this financial trouble, and I remember he was very worried.  They were--they had started building a building in Atlanta [Georgia] and they had to stop.  They couldn't complete the building until many years afterwards.  And they lost a lot of their property and everything, but he was instrumental in keeping them afloat; I know that.  And for that, they were very grateful to him, and he remained in that position until he died at the age of seventy-nine.
Speaker 1: And can you just tell us, what are the Masons?  What kind of organization is it?
Speaker 2: Oh, now this might be something of interest as black history.  This group of Masons, which my father said were the only legitimate black Masons in the United States.  There are some that he called bogus, but his group was called the Prince Hall Free and Accepted Masons.  And Prince Hall was a black freed slave, I think from Barbados, who went to Boston [Massachusetts] and was inducted into the English Masons when America was a colony.  And so from him, he started this black--this group of black Masons.  And their charter came from England, so that couldn't--you know, whereas if they had waited on the white Masons to take them in, they never would have been taken in.  But the Prince Hall Masons come from this--these colonial--this charter in colonial times, and they are the legitimate ones.
Speaker 1: And what kind of organization is it?
Speaker 2: Masonry is a very old organization that--well, I--the composer [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart was a Mason, and I know it's been around a long time.  It's a secret society of men, and, being secret, of course, I don't know much about it (laughter), but it's based on certain principles that came out of Egypt, you know.  That's why they're called Masons, you know, certain building, things that have to do with character.  And I--it's a worldwide organization (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 253953
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your father [John Wesley Dobbs]?
Speaker 2: My father was a very charismatic, outgoing person and very devoted to being a father.  He was disappointed that he didn't have a son; he had six girls.  And up until the last, he was still hoping for a boy.  But he reared us--I say he did, my mother [Irene Thompson Dobbs] did also, but my father was the absolute authority in our house.  And my mother followed him, and she didn't have a career of her own; she was a homemaker.  And what he said was the last word.  But he, he--oh, I forgot what I was gonna say now.
Speaker 1: You were just actually describing him, and you were saying--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --he was a very devoted father.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, he was--he educated us as if we were boys, and he was very keen on our having good grades and having education that we could--and being able to support ourselves.  So I remember one--sometimes one sister would say, "Well, we just gonna get married anyway.  Why do we have to do all that studying?"  And he would say, "Well, you could get married and your husband could leave you, or you could--he could die, so you've got to be prepared, yourself."  And also he and my mother were very keen on our taking music lessons, piano lessons.  They bought a piano, which is one of the first things they did when they were married.  My mother had had piano lessons.  My father played by ear.  He had quite a good ear.  And so, so we all, six girls, all had to take piano lessons.
Speaker 1: And did your mother play the piano a lot?
Speaker 2: She--no, she didn't play a lot.  No, I guess she didn't have time.  My father didn't play much at--when I was a child.  He said he had had played a lot before, and I remember his saying, "I realized that I was going to have a family to support, and I couldn't waste my time, so I gave up piano playing and card playing," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, you said your father raised you all as boys.  What did you mean by that?
Speaker 2: In--I mean, as far as education is concerned.  No, it didn't go any further than that.  But he was a very, very good father.  He took us on trips.  He always would take us to cities in the North where we could see that--see, I grew up in segregation, and he wanted us to see that there was a place where there was no segregation, and so we would take car trips to New York [New York], Chicago [Illinois], and different places.  And he would take us to museums, and he didn't allow us to go to segregated movies.  Fortunately, we had our own black movies, but there were white movies in town with black balconies, and we weren't allowed to go there.  But he made an exception on segregation when there were concerts.  He--and--because he said you have to go to them, so we were allowed to sit in segregated balconies for the concerts, but we couldn't do it for movies or anything.
Story_ID: 253954
Speaker 1: We talked a little bit about your grandparents, but I think your paternal grandmother was the only grandmother that you really knew?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was--well, you know, we used to laugh because she had so many, many names.  Her name was Minnie Millie Minerva [Hendricks Dobbs Banks].
Speaker 1: Minnie Millie Minverva.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And Hendricks was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: And what can you tell us about her?
Speaker 2: She was--I see how my father [John Wesley Dobbs] got his personality, because it's just like her.  She was very extroverted, very outgoing, and a flamboyant character (laughter), and she was very generous, and she loved us very much.  But she had a temperament; she could get angry (laughter), and but it would soon go over.  But she was a wonderful person.  She had been the child of her white owner.  You see, she was born in slavery, and she was about twelve years--no, she was I think just--oh, she was twelve years old when slavery ended, something like that.  So, her mother was a slave of this man and through some research that was done by someone who did a book on my family, we found out that her father was a doctor in this small north Georgia town.  We weren't quite sure who he was, but we just knew that he was white.  But anyway, I knew that my grandmother told me that she lived in the home of this doctor and his white wife, she and her mother, who was a cook or maid, and the wife knew that that was his child and everything.  And they didn't have children of their own, and she told me that they took her to Boston [Massachusetts] one time.  She was very light-skinned, so she could've passed for their child, and she said they actually took her to Boston.  But then when her mother found a man to marry, she left.  You know, I think about it very often, when--it's easy to condemn people who stayed on in slavery, but when you think about it, where were they going?  Where was a woman with a child like that going?  How was she gonna get food or make a living or anything?  Unless she found someone to marry, which she did eventually, you know.  She had other children by him.  But, the men, how were they going to go out and make a life for themselves?  It must've been very hard, because nothing was done to help them.
Story_ID: 253955
Speaker 1: Did your [paternal] grandmother [Minnie Hendricks Dobbs Banks] tell you any other stories about slavery that you can remember?
Speaker 2: That's about all I remember except that she did say that when her mother married and had these other children, her mother, I think, wanted to marry her off, and she knew this family on a farm, and she arranged the marriage between my grandmother and the man that she married, my grandfather [Will Dobbs].  He was about twenty-something, and she was only fourteen.  And so they were engaged for about two years and then she married, I think when she was about sixteen, and that marriage didn't last.  That was why they separated.  But, I can see that maybe it was uncomfortable for her mother after she married and had these other children to have this child by the slave master, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell us the story about--you said your older sisters had shared a story with you.
Speaker 2: Yes, they knew my great-grandmother.  That's my--on my father's [John Wesley Dobbs] side.  I didn't know her, but they knew her, and they said that she had told them that her father was the white owner, and she looked like she was shite.  She was very, very white.  And she was assigned, as a slave, she was assigned the duty of taking care of the invalid wife of the owner.  She was in a wheelchair.  And this poor wife knew that that was her husband's child that was taking care of her all the time, and she hated her, and she would pull her hair and hit her, so that was one of the horrible stories I heard (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Tell us about when your father brought Duke Ellington home?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that, that was really something.  Well, in order to give you some idea of the way life was, this was in the days of segregation.  We had a city within a city, and it was apartheid, you can call it there.  We had everything, but in a good, very high level, very good way.  We had universities, we had everything we needed.  We--banks, people in all the professions.  Atlanta [Georgia] had a lot of professional people.  I think Atlanta had always been based on, from the beginning, on a lot of house servants rather than people from the field.  People did come in, of course, like my father's family and so forth, but there were a lot of slaves already there who had had some training.  So at anyway, Atlanta was--that was all I knew.  It was segregated, and you hated when you had to submit yourself to segregation on public transport and places like that, but that really was the only time that I came in contact with that outer world.  We had everything we needed.  And there, there was this main street, Auburn Avenue, that my father named Sweet Auburn, and now it's named for him, because my nephew, Maynard Jackson, was mayor and while he was mayor, he had the street--no, I'm sorry, I'm wrong.  Not Auburn Avenue--our--the street we lived on, Houston Street, was named for my father.  But my father gave the name to the main business street in the black area called Auburn Avenue; he called it Sweet Auburn, and everybody calls it that now.  And I think he got it from the Robert Burns poem ['Sweet Afton'].  Robert Burns was referring to a river, "Flow on Sweet Auburn [sic.]."  But anyway, in those days, all of the visiting celebrities who came to Atlanta to perform stayed in the black neighborhood in this hotel that was there, and they ate in the only restaurant that was there, Ma Sutton's.  And my father knew when people were in town, 'cause everybody knew everybody; it was very small.  So he went by Ma Sutton's that day and saw Duke Ellington.  So he asked Duke Ellington if he would come home and play for his daughters, and he did.  And so what happened was that my father wanted to surprise us, so he told Duke not to say anything.  They just came in the door and he, he sat Duke Ellington down at the piano and he started playing.  And we were in the other part of the house, and my older sister said, "Oh, that's Duke on the radio, let's go turn it up."  The radio was in the living room where the piano was.  And we all ran in to turn up the radio and there he sat (laughter).  That was a thrill.  And he was so nice.  You know, I think about, something like that would never happen today.  I remember Fats Waller coming to my high school [Atlanta University Laboratory High School, Atlanta, Georgia] and playing for us, and we got visits from the black celebrities.

Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?  What's your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: You know, I would like to say that it was when my sister [HistoryMaker June Dobbs Butts] was born; I was three, but I don't remember that.  I--you know, I never really thought about that.
Speaker 1: Does it--does anything come to mind now?  The earliest thing you remember.
Speaker 2: No, I just always remember I had older sisters and my parents [Irene Thompson Dobbs and John Wesley Dobbs], and my [paternal] grandmother [Minnie Hendricks Dobbs Banks] who came over.  I don't have any one thing that I could point out that's early memory.
Story_ID: 253957
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about what family life was like for you growing up as a girl.
Speaker 2: Well, I was number five of the six daughters, and my younger sister [HistoryMaker June Dobbs Butts] was three years younger, but the others were older.  We were spread out very much, so there were twenty years difference between the first one [Irene Dobbs Jackson] and the last one, and I was seventeen years younger than my older sister, and the sister [Josephine Dobbs Clement] next to me was seven years older.  So, so the fact that we were spread out meant that we didn't really all live there together.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My older sisters were away in school or had gone and were working, teaching somewhere, or married.  And I can't ever remember their living at home.  But what I remember was just my younger sister and me living at home.
Speaker 1: And what were holidays like in your house growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, holidays were, were wonderful.  Christmas was always a great time.  I can remember an older sister telling us--I guess she was still living there, reading the '[A] Christmas Carol' [Charles Dickens] to us and, then could hardly wait the next morning to go and look in the room and see what we had, you know, where the parents [Irene Thompson Dobbs and John Wesley Dobbs] had made the Christmas tree.  But I remember waking up to the sound of children roller skating, because a lot of children got roller skates for presents, and they would be out early in the morning (laughter).  And I associate that with Christmas, hearing roller skates out in the street, early in the morning.  But, you know, when--even when my sisters were away, they would--if they didn't have their own families, they would always come home for Christmas.
Speaker 1: What about birthdays?  Were they big celebrations in your house growing up?
Speaker 2: I only remember one birthday and that was a very delightful birthday.  It was sort of surprise.  My birthday is in July, and there never was very much going on.  You know, we were out of school, and we didn't live in a neighborhood where most of my friends lived, because my parents were older and they remained in the older part of town, and my friends' parents were younger, so they all had moved to the other side of town (laughter) where--we got together, but it just wasn't that easy.  So, but somehow in the summer for my birthday, there wasn't much going on.  There was always a lot going on for my sister's birthday.  She was born in June, and that was during the time of the annual meeting of the Grand Lodge of the Masons at this orphan home [Masonic Orphans Home, Americus, Georgia], and we would be there, and we would always have a big party with all the orphan children.  And--but on my birthday, one year, I do remember something my father did and that was, my mother was away, probably one of my sisters was having a baby or--that was the only time she ever went by herself, and so my sister and I were spending a few days in the country.  We had some cousins who lived in Norcross, Georgia, which is in Gwinnett County [Georgia], which is now a very affluent area, and they still live there.  But the--at this time, they had a big working farm, and the old man who was my [paternal] grandmother's [Minnie Hendricks Dobbs Banks] cousin was still alive, and that farm was very interesting.  You could see everything going on there, you know, all the animals and a well outside and privy, and also a little private family graveyard.  It was huge.  They owned a lot of land.  So I would always get frightened at night; I didn't like staying there at night, but in the day it was fun.  So anyway, we were staying there while my mother was away and my birthday came.  So what my father did was he picked up several friends and brought food and brought them all up there for my birthday, and they enjoyed being on the farm, too, and we had a--that was a great birthday.

Speaker 1: Could you please give us your siblings' names and their birth order including yourself?
Speaker 2: All right.  My older sister was Irene Dobbs Jackson, and the second one who is still alive, Willie Dobbs Blackburn, and she's ninety-five years old now.  And then the third oldest one is deceased, Millicent Dobbs Jordan.  And the next one is deceased, Josephine Dobbs Clement, C-L-E-M-E-N-T.  And then I came after her, and then I have a younger sister who's still alive, so there are just three of us alive now.  And my younger sister, [HistoryMaker] June Dobbs Butts, lives in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And also the older one lives in Atlanta (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 253959
Speaker 1: And do you remember the name of the street [in Atlanta, Georgia] that you grew up on, that you lived on?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  That was Houston Street and it's now named for my father.  It's now John Wesley Dobbs [Avenue].  My nephew, Maynard Jackson, had it changed when, when he was mayor, and that was a great thing for us.  In fact, there's a sign on the freeway.  Every time you pass by it on the freeway, there's John Wesley Dobbs there, and we are very proud of that.
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe Houston Street for us?
Speaker 2: I had--there was--it was a nice street with very nice houses.  It was very middle class in those days.  It went down over the years.  There was a school across the street, a public school that was elementary and junior high.  I went there the first four years, but then my sister--my sister [HistoryMaker June Dobbs Butts] and I went to the private school [Oglethorpe Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], which was across the street--I mean, across town.  But the--it was a very nice neighborhood.  I remember my parents saying that they had bought the house--they were married in 1906, and they bought that house about two or three years after that.  And it was an all-white neighborhood that was set--you know, going over to blacks as always has traditionally happened in this country, and they bought it from a German.  In fact, I remember their mentioning his name.  His name was Steineken [ph.].  The reason in know that is that (laughter) my older sister is supposed to have imitated them, setting aside money every month that, "This is for this, this is--and this is for Mr. Steineken," (laughter).  But he was a--this German man was a plasterer.  I don't know if that's what you call it, but the decorative European plasterwork, and our house had lots of that.  All the ceilings had decorations and moldings, and we had two rooms with beautiful mantle pieces with figures on them, and he really had lavished a lot of his work on that house.  But anyway, my parents bought it from him, and the neighborhood became all-black.  But just about one block from there was a white neighborhood.

Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up and remind you of your childhood [in Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Well, sounds--well, there was a lot of music in my family all the time.  All--somebody was always playing the piano or singing.  My sisters liked to sing, and I had that from the time I was born.  So, that really helped me since I became a professional musician myself.  And music was always in the house, you know, somebody singing or playing or either had the radio on.
Speaker 1: And what smells and sounds remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Well, smells, I don't know.  My mother [Irene Thompson Dobbs] was an excellent cook and she made a lot of good dishes.  She never taught any of us how to cook, because I think the reason was that my father [John Wesley Dobbs] would--didn't--wouldn't have eaten our cooking, and so she never took any chances.  So we all had to learn how to cook when we got married (laughter).  But I try sometimes to remember some of her dishes.  Oh, one, one thing that we had, like all southerners did every day, was cornbread, and she baked this cornbread every day, so that would be a smell that I remember.  It was always in the oven every afternoon when you came home from school.
Speaker 1: And what sounds?
Speaker 2: Sometimes gingerbread.  Excuse me.
Speaker 1: That's okay, that's--
Speaker 2: Well, the sound, that would be--oh, I do remember on the streets in those years when I was a child, you had itinerant salesmen of vegetables, and they would come down the street calling.  That's an old southern, mainly black, custom, too; "Here are your watermelons," and they'd have little tunes and things, you know, and I do remember that.
Story_ID: 253961
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school you attended that was part of Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, the elementary school was Oglethorpe [Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia].  Oglethorpe was named for--there was a General [James] Oglethorpe in the Revolutionary War, and that's an area [Oglethorpe Park] also in Atlanta [Georgia].  And, and then I went to high school.  It was called Lab--Atlanta University Laboratory High School [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: But let's go back to elementary.  So Oglethorpe Elementary was part of Atlanta University?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They even had a nursery school that--but I didn't go to that nursery.  I went to a kindergarten that was at Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia], which at that time was across the street from my house.  They moved later on.  But, then this Lab--Atlanta University Laboratory High School, it was just what it says, a laboratory high school.  They, the college students, could practice teach there.
Speaker 1: Now at Oglethorpe, do you remember some of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: Yes, one thing I would like to say is that in this private school system, we had mixed faculty.  We had mainly black, but we had some white teachers also.  And that was a very good thing for us living in a segregated society, you know, to be in an integrated school system, at least as far as the faculty was concerned, and also in Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], we had white teachers mixed with the black teachers.
Speaker 1: And during the elementary school years, what--did you have any favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: I liked languages.  I liked French, and my first language was Latin, and I wasn't so fond of Latin.  But when I studied French in high school, I did like that, and in college I continued with as a minor subject, the languages.
Story_ID: 253962
Speaker 1: And when did you start begin singing or, you know, really learned that you had a talent for singing?
Speaker 2: I always liked to sing, and, as a child, you know, you have a child's voice, and nobody knows if you're going to have a real voice until you go through puberty.  But I do remember that when I was six years old, my parents [Irene Thompson Dobbs and John Wesley Dobbs] had a twenty-fifth wedding anniversary party at home, and they invited a lot of people, and in those days, they asked the children to perform, you know.  So we all did different things.  My older sister who was a very good pianist played the piano, and another sister recited some poems, and they did different things.  And then my younger sister [HistoryMaker June Dobbs Butts] and I were supposed to sing this duet, 'When Your Hair Has Turned To Silver, I Will Love You Just The Same.'  And we'd practice it and my older sister was playing for us.  And so when time came for--she was three, my little sister, and I was six, and when time came for us to perform, she--we couldn't find her anywhere.  And we found her, and she was sick.  She had eaten too much ice cream and cake and (laughter) and was very sick so had to be put to bed, so I had to sing by myself, and that was my first performance.
Speaker 1: And how was it for you?  Did you enjoy having an audience or was it a little--
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) frightening?
Speaker 2: Yes, I suppose so.  Yeah, I liked it.  But I just knew I had to do it.  I didn't have time to get nervous.  Later on, when I started being asked to sing, I was very nervous.  But I remember that I always loved playing the piano and singing, and we had books of songs at home, folk songs, spirituals, Irish and Scottish folk songs, all kinds of songs, you know.  So, I would go through that song book playing and singing.  And my mother would have to come into the room and say, "Stop that singing and practice your piano," (laughter) 'cause I really always loved singing and, and, and accompanying myself.  But I didn't have any voice until I was about fourteen or fifteen, and then I--somehow I didn't want my school friends to know that I could sing.  I was in the chorus at school, and I never did say I could sing solos and they--and, you know, they didn't notice that I had any special voice.  But I was afraid.  I didn't want to do a solo.  So it wasn't until I got to college that I started really taking--I took voice lessons and started seriously with singing.  But I remember when I was about fifteen, my mother realized that I had the voice and could sing, and she asked me to sing for a ladies club that she was having, and I cried all day because I didn't want to do it (laughter).  And, I think I finally had to do it.  And then when I got to college, I started taking voice lessons, but I was not majoring in music; I was majoring in home economics, 'cause at that time, I thought I could be a fashion designer.  That's what I was interested in.  And it was only when the music people heard me sing, and they came to me, and said, "You've got to change over to music," then I changed the next year and started majoring in music.  But I took from this teacher [Naomi Maise] at Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], my freshman year--and those were my first voice lessons, she was a very good teacher--and I remember that we had a little recital, which I was to sing.  And I was so nervous that I was standing there shaking, and she got up from the piano and came over to speak to me and tell me to not be afraid, you know, and that embarrassed me so.  So I told 'em, I said, "This can never happen again."  So it really sort of cured me of stage fright, because I was not going to be that embarrassed again (laughter).
Story_ID: 253963
Speaker 1: During elementary school [Oglethorpe Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], what kinds of dreams and aspirations did you have?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think I had any at that time, you know, not--certainly not in elementary school.  Just to be happy, you know--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --and be with friends and family.
Speaker 1: And what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: We all had to manage to have good grades, because our father [John Wesley Dobbs] really was very strict on that, and we were afraid to bring home bad grades (laughter).  And my older sister was very smart, and she had always been very, very good in school, and he would bring her up to us, you know.  "You got to be like Irene [Dobbs Jackson], because she never stood second in any class she was in."  So we always had to keep up with her.  But I did graduate first in my class from Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: How excellent, excellent.  So, now where did you attend junior high school?
Speaker 2: That was at this [Atlanta University] Laboratory [High School, Atlanta, Georgia].  It was junior and senior high.
Speaker 1: Okay, the Atlanta University--
Speaker 2: Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: --School?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And it closed the year that I graduated--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and all of the students who were there had to go to the big public high school, and they didn't have a good--a very good time being received there.  My sister [HistoryMaker June Dobbs Butts] was one who went (laughter).
Story_ID: 253964
Speaker 1: So, during the junior high school years [at Atlanta University Laboratory High School, Atlanta, Georgia], like the early teen years, what were some of the things that you enjoyed doing in your spare time?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.  I never--well, we--I didn't learn to swim, because we were inland, you know, and also there was only one park for black people at that time, and that was not very good place--a lot of rowdy people were there--and far away from home.  So we never did get a chance to swim.  I did go to camp one time and tennis, I had wanted to play, but I couldn't get up early in the morning.  In the South, when it's so hot, you have to get up very early.  I--oh, bicycles.  I loved bicycles, and one birthday I got a bicycle; that was a big birthday.  I think I was fifteen that year.  My father [John Wesley Dobbs] took me to the Sears Roebuck, and we bought this bicycle.  And I taught all the neighborhood children to ride on that bicycle (laughter) after I learned myself.
Story_ID: 253965
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about some of your experiences in high school [Atlanta University Laboratory High School, Atlanta, Georgia].  Did you--were there any particular teachers in high school who had a influence on you?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had a music teacher who was a very fine music teacher.  She had us in a chorus, and she also taught us some music appreciation.  I remember that they had a way of playing a classical music recording every morning, and if that music had stopped, you were late, and we had to learn, you know, what the music was and all that.  I remember that very much.  And--oh, at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], when I was in college there, they were very strict about your being on time and especially to the chapel.  Everybody had to go to chapel in the morning at 8:30, and I lived far away from that part of town, had to take two street cars and get there.  But it was hard, and if they closed the door on you, you couldn't get in.  And then if you were absent, they would take--too many times, they would take away your quality points.  Now, in order to graduate, you had to have so many credits, but also some quality points.  And, if you didn't have the same number of quality points as credits, you couldn't graduate.  So that, if you didn't go to that, you could--you would not graduate if you lost too many of those points, and if you were late too often.  That was one way of teaching you how to be on time, and I'm grateful for that.
Speaker 1: What were some of the activities you were involved in in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in this chorus, but we didn't have too many extracurricular activities that I remember beside the choir; that's all I remember.
Speaker 1: When did you start becoming interested in classical music, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, already from the beginning, because my older sisters and my parents [Irene Thompson Dobbs and John Wesley Dobbs] liked classical music, and so I was brought up around that.
Speaker 1: And was that the only type of music that you liked?  Did you like other kinds of music?
Speaker 2: I did, to dance with--you know, I liked Glenn Miller, I remember, and, and Nat King Cole, and I was fond of the certain popular musicians then.
Speaker 1: But was class--
Speaker 2: Duke Ellington, of course.
Speaker 1: Was classical your favorite?
Speaker 2: That was always my favorite, and that is--I started collecting records in high school.  My sister [HistoryMaker June Dobbs Butts] and I collected a lot of recordings of classical music.
Speaker 1: And I know that your older sisters had gone to Spelman, so was there any doubt that you, too, would follow in their footsteps?
Speaker 2: I tried to get out of it, because I wanted to go away, but my father wouldn't allow me to go away, so--in those days, you went where your parents said you should go, so I went to Spelman.  But I was very happy there.  I liked it.  But I--Spelman had a rule that required all the city students to live on the campus the last year, but I wanted to have more of an experience of dormitory life, so I lived there junior year as well, so I was on campus two years.  And I also had a lot of activities in music, you know, with the choir and so forth, and I lived far away, so that was good to have.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school in '42 [1942].
Story_ID: 253966
Speaker 1: When you went to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], you decided to--I'm--what was your major again?
Speaker 2: The first year, I was majoring in home economics, but then I changed to music.
Speaker 1: Why were you majoring in home economics?
Speaker 2: I had thought that I wanted to try and be a fashion designer.  I had no idea how to go about it or what the chances were or anything, but I liked to draw and draw fashions.
Speaker 1: Did you sew at that time?  Did you like to sew?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I did.  I sewed.  My mother [Irene Thompson Dobbs] taught me how to sew, and I used to make most of my dresses and also for my sister [HistoryMaker June Dobbs Butts].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: In fact, I made some of my first concert dresses.
Story_ID: 253967
Speaker 1: When you went to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], that's when you really started to develop your voice and that kind of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I started studying voice--started studying voice for the first time.
Speaker 1: And can you just tell us a little bit about what that was like?  Did you--did you know at that point that you were, you know, just this wonderfully gifted singer?  Did you know it at the time?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew that I had a good voice and could sing better than other people, but I really was not thinking so much in terms of a career in music, at first.  And I had heard great black singers, you know, so I had role models like Marian Anderson, Dorothy Maynor, had heard Paul Robeson, and I knew that was something that I could perhaps aspire to, but at first, I didn't think I could do anything like that.  But then, as I gained more confidence during my four years in college, and saw that I sang more and had a senior recital when I graduated.  And even then, I was a little afraid of trying for a career, afraid of not succeeding.  And my father [John Wesley Dobbs], though, really wanted me to try for a career.  And I was also encouraged by my voice teacher.  I had another voice teacher by that time, a man by the name of Willis [Laurence] James, and he encouraged me a lot.  Also, the president of the college, Ms. Florence Read, wanted me to try for a career.  So with all of that encouragement, then I decided that I would try.  By the time I graduated, I got more confidence.
Speaker 1: And while you were at Spelman, you sang with the combined choir?  It was Spelman-Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: We had several groups.  We--Spelman had a glee club that was all girls, and Morehouse had its own.  And then we had Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] chorus, and I sang in that as well.  That was coed.
Speaker 1: Now, there would be like national broadcasts that the choir would perform in, correct?
Speaker 2: Not national, but we did make a recording--in fact, that's the first recording I ever made.  We went down to a local radio station and did a broadcast, singing some Christmas spirituals.  This was the combined chorus, boys and girls, and they made a recording of that for us that I still have.
Speaker 1: And what was that like for you to have your voice, you know, on this recording?  What was it like for you personally?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was wonderful.  It was very special.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from Spelman?
Speaker 2: Forty-six [1946].
Speaker 1: And you received a B.A. in music?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, we didn't have bachelor of music.  We just had a bachelor of arts with a major in music.  But I had a very well-rounded education.  I'm glad of that, because when I started teaching in schools where they had bachelor of music degrees, I saw that they really didn't get as well rounded an education as I got.  I had lots of music, but I also had many liberal arts subjects.
Speaker 1: And you minored in Spanish or did you major in Spanish as well?
Speaker 2: I minored in Spanish.
Speaker 1: And you graduated first in your class?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I also studied French and German in college.
Story_ID: 253968
Speaker 1: So, once you graduated from Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], were you confident that you were going to pursue a music career?
Speaker 2: I wanted to, but then on the other hand, I was afraid.  But--and then the main difficulty was to know with whom I should study, and I knew that New York [New York] would be the place to go to get good vocal training.  And the president of my college [Florence Read] and my teacher, Mr. [Willis Laurence] James, thought that I should go to a conservatory, and the president knew the president of Curtis music school [Curtis Institute of Music] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and so she was on the side of my going to a conservatory, and she could arrange for me to go and sing for them.  And then on the other hand, I didn't want to go to a conservatory, because I had had a lot of music theory, and I knew how to play the piano from childhood, and I had had all of those general music courses in college that I thought I needed as a singer.  And what I wanted to do was to concentrate just on the voice and study with a private teacher.  And in the meantime, I happened to sing at the church of my brother-in-law [Maynard Jackson, Sr.], Maynard Jackson [Jr.]'s father; my sister, Irene [Dobbs Jackson], was married to this minister.  And he had a political meeting, I think it was, in church, Friendship Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia], one Sunday evening and asked me to sing there, and my sister played for me.  And on the program was a white lady who was a singer.  She was a soloist in one of the big churches in Atlanta [Georgia].  And she came up and praised my voice, and she said, "I know just the teacher you should have."  So she says that I know some people here who are friendly with this wonderful German teacher who now lives in New York.  So she introduced me to this other couple, this white couple, and they put me in touch with the person who became my teacher in New York.  So it was just through sheer luck that I found the person with whom I studied.
Speaker 1: And is that Lotte Leonard?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But in the meantime, my people from Spelman, the people from Spelman wanted me to go to Curtis, so my mother [Irene Thompson Dobbs] and father [John Wesley Dobbs] drove me to Philadelphia, and I sang for the head of Curtis, and I could've gotten in there.  And I think that only has scholarship if they take you in.  It would've been very, very good for my parents, you know, if I had gone there.  But then at the same time--and I always have been very grateful to them for this--the same time they took me to New York and made contact with this German teacher, Lotte Leonard, she was a singer in Germany.  She was Jewish and had to leave under [Adolf] Hitler.  We had a lot of great musicians in New York from Austria and Germany who had had to leave their countries.  Anyway, I liked her very much, and I wanted to study with her.  And then I wanted to be in New York, because my opinion was that you could learn so much by actually hearing concerts and opera, and there was plenty of that in New York, and symphony concerts and, and all kinds of music.  And so I wanted to be there to take advantage of that.  So my parents allowed me to go to New York and study with this teacher, and I remember the people at Spelman said, "Oh, you've made a big mistake.  You should've sent her to Curtis," but (laughter), but I was always very glad they let me decide.  And they were very impressed with this teacher, too.
Story_ID: 253969
Speaker 1: And so when you studied in New York [New York], did you work as well as study there or did you--
Speaker 2: No.  No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) just study full-time?
Speaker 2: My father [John Wesley Dobbs] supported me, and I've always been grateful for that, because I knew many people who had to work also, and they had a hard time taking all the lessons and working at the same time, too.  But I was fortunate in that I could take these voice lessons; I went twice a week to her, and then gradually, I worked--I got a scholarship to go to a music school, the Mannes music school [Mannes School of Music, The New School, New York, New York], to study opera.
Speaker 1: And where was the Mannes--
Speaker 2: It was in New York, and I was in that course there for a while.  And I also went to--I got a scholarship to study opera at Tanglewood [Music Center], which is the Boston Symphony [Orchestra]'s summer home; Tanglewood [sic. Lenox], Massachusetts.  So I still was very doubtful about whether or not I could have a career; I knew how hard it was.  And at the same time, I didn't want to lose time by not preparing for something else.  So as an--as a second choice, I thought that I would go to Columbia University [New York, New York] and take some courses in Spanish, which was my next interest.  I had a lot of free time the first two years, so I went part-time and started studying for a master's degree there.  And after two years, I was able to get the degree, and I always felt good having that, because at least I could go and teach, and I didn't want to get it in music; I wanted to do it in--
Speaker 1: So that was in 1948, you got your--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --master's degree?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  But that was all during the time that I was there to study voice; I was just able to do it because I had the time--
Story_ID: 253970
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about how the opportunity to go to Europe came about.
Speaker 2: One time when I was back in Atlanta [Georgia] on vacation, I was reading in--we had a paper called Atlanta Daily World.  I think it's still there.  It used to be daily; it's no longer daily (laughter), but it still exists.  And I was reading there about--I found out about a fellowship given by John Hay Whitney, who was a millionaire and also I think he'd been ambassador somewhere.  And this fellowship was called the Opportunity Fellowship, and it was for people, black people, Indians--Native Americans as we say now--and people who were Americans from Samoa or some place, people who thought that they, because of geography or race, had not been allowed to progress in their career, educationally, and so I qualified under the race.  And I had to do an audition, because--for the first, you had to write a proposal of what you were going to do, and then, as a singer, I had to go and sing for them.  This all happened in New York [New York] and I applied and I wrote my proposal, and my proposal was to go to Paris [France] and study French recital literature.  Because at that time, I didn't have great hopes of being an opera singer, even though I had studied opera.  I was studying opera in New York, but we didn't have--there were two black singers, however, at the New York City Opera, Camilla Williams and Lawrence Winters.  I heard them very often.  But there were no black singers at the Metropolitan [Opera].  And, my teacher [Lotte Leonard] had been a concert singer, and I was--thought that that would be what I would be; my best chances would be that.  Fortunately, I was able to do the opera, because now you can't make a career as a concert singer; that has all--you know, you have to sing opera if you're gonna make it, nowadays, but in those years, you could still be a concert singer.  But so, I was--my teacher had given me training in German songs, and I wanted to go to France to study the French song literature, and so that was what I proposed.  And I sang for them, so they gave me this scholarship, which was a very generous scholarship.  And so, I think one reason I wanted to go to France, I was interested in French music, but also my oldest sister, Irene [Dobbs Jackson], had studied in France; she was a French professor.  And she had been studying in France when I was a little girl.  Now that is one of my earliest memories.  I remember letters from her, writing back telling about her experiences in--she lived in--she went to the University of Toulouse [Toulouse, France], and she lived with a family.  She would write these letters and tell us about--and I was so impressed about France, you know, just seemed like such an interesting place, and--especially since I had studied the language, and so I always wanted to go to Paris.  So that was how I used my scholarship.  I went there, and it was a good move, I think.  I found an excellent teacher.  I didn't know with whom I was going to study when I went there, but I had a friend who was a black American who was studying with this outstanding teacher and, and found him that way, through this friend that I met.
Story_ID: 253971
Speaker 1: And how did your career kind of get its start when you were in Europe during that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  When I was in New York [New York], my teacher [Lotte Leonard] had introduced me to a manager there who really never did anything for me before I left.  But the only thing he did for me that helped me was he put me in touch with a manager in Paris [France].  And when I went to see this manager in Paris, he couldn't do anything for me because I hadn't done anything, you know.  But then I heard about a very famous competition [Geneva International Music Competition] in Switzerland, in Geneva [Switzerland] that was sponsored by the Geneva Conservatory of Music [Geneva, Switzerland], and it was an international competition.  And I found out, because my singing teacher went to Switzerland every summer, and I went there to visit her, and these Swiss friends told me about it.  So the next year I applied for this competition, and I won first prize, and that was a very prestigious prize.  And so, when I had that, this agent in Paris was able to start doing something.  And then that really started my career, because out of that, I got a chance to go and sing for the people at [Teatro] alla Scala in Milano [Milan, Italy], and they engaged me to sing there, and then I started getting a chance to sing in opera companies, and my whole career started then.
Speaker 1: And some have said that during that timeframe, you know, being an operatic singer was difficult anyway, but for many African Americans or--and Americans in general, to really get that success in Europe was a big boost to the career.  Would you agree with that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's true.  That's true.  And during that time, Rudolf Bing, who was an Austrian who had become English was head of the Metropolitan [Opera], and he didn't like to engage Americans unless they had experience.  There were some who made their careers straight from America without going abroad, but the general rule was that he had scouts in Europe who would recommend people that they heard to him.  And most of the people he took were either Europeans who had had a lot of experience in the European opera houses or Americans who had sung abroad.  It was easier, I think, to get there that way.
Story_ID: 253972
Speaker 1: Can you tell us the difference between a lieder singer, a concert singer, and an operatic singer?
Speaker 2: Well, lieder and concert--well, concerts would be say with orchestra, but they--some people call the lieder recitals concerts also, but it's a recital when you're just with the piano, and you sing songs, and the main bulk of those songs were written in Germany, that's why they're called lieder, [Franz] Schubert, [Johannes] Brahms, [Robert] Schumann, and so for forth.  And then of course France has a great number of song composers.  And there are other countries; America has songs and everything.  So, you could say a recital consists of songs being sung with piano accompaniment.  A concert is usually with an orchestra, maybe.  And then opera, you're on the stage with full costume and doing these--this, like, theater, musical theater.
Story_ID: 253973
Speaker 1: Was your success in Europe, was the news of that reaching back home here--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: --in the [United] States?
Speaker 2: It was.  And then, also, something else that happened was that this manager in Paris [France] had me sing for Sol Hurok who was a great manager in New York [New York]. He was from Russia originally, but he'd come to America very young.  And he had--he was the manager of Marian Anderson and a lot of big stars.
Speaker 1: Was she a role model for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was.  And, and I was told that he wanted to hear me sing in Paris, and also, this same manager had been the manager of Marian Anderson, and, and Marian Anderson had sung for Sol Hurok in this same hall in Paris where I later sang for him.  I was very impressed by that.  Anyway, he, he made a contract with, with me to go--I had already done quite a bit of singing in Europe.  I was at Covent Garden [Royal Opera House, London, England] a lot.  I was at Glyndebourne [Lewes, England], which is an opera in England in [East] Sussex, summer opera.  And I was at [Teatro] alla Scala [Milan, Italy], and Holland [the Netherlands] and Belgium, and so I'd done a lot of work.  And, so anyway, he brought me back for my first American tours.  And he presented me in New York in a debut recital.  That was with an orchestra.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was--you know, I think that was '53 [1953].  I have to check on that, because that's an important date.  But it was a concert performance of an opera that I had sung at Glyndebourne, Richard Strauss, 'Ariadne [auf Naxos].'  I sang the role of Zerbinetta, which is a very, very difficult coloratura role.  I was a coloratura soprano, which means high, high soprano.  And so I was--I made my debut in New York in this concert sponsored--he got me the engagement, and I also had some other recitals on tour and performed on 'The Ed Sullivan Show.'  And, so I was with him for many years then, but I was going back and forth.  In the meantime--
Speaker 1: Back and forth between New York and Europe (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Europe and America, um-hm.
Story_ID: 253974
Speaker 1: What were some of your impressions of Europe when you first arrived there in the early '50s [1950s]?  Were you accepted as an African American operatic singer?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yeah, I didn't feel any prejudice at all.  It probably existed, but I just didn't feel it.  And it was a very--it was a good time to be in Paris [France].  I went there in 1950, and I lived at the Cite [Internationale] Universitaire [de Paris, Paris, France], which was a place where they had students from all over the world.  Different nations would have their own houses for their students, and it was a very interesting place to be, and I lived there for two or three years.  And, it was just a fun time to be in Paris.  I loved being there.
Speaker 1: And you, you met your first husband [Luis Rodriguez] in Europe.
Speaker 2: I did, yes.
Speaker 1: And you were married in 1953?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He unfortunately was ill and died after a year.  He was a Spanish person who was studying in Paris, and we went to--well, my career started just about the time he was getting ill, and so we moved to Madrid [Spain] from Paris, because when I was away, his mother could take care of him.  But unfortunately, he died after one year.
Story_ID: 253975
Speaker 1: And let's talk about your debut at the Metropolitan Opera and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that was a very thrilling thing for me, because I had sat there as a student--
Speaker 1: And what year was it?
Speaker 2: This was 1956.  In 1955, Marian Anderson had made her debut there [Metropolitan Opera House, New York, New York], and I had been present, and--
Speaker 1: And did you ever think that you'd be on that stage one day?
Speaker 2: When I was studying?  No.  No, because they didn't have any black singers at the Metropolitan then.  And so, I really didn't have much hope.  Also, you know, it was just such a big famous place, and so, it was thrilling for me to be able to sing there just in that place where I had been as a student.  And my parents [Irene Thompson Dobbs and John Wesley Dobbs] were there, and most of family were there.  So it was a very thrilling night.  And although Marian Anderson had sung there the previous year, and just after her, Robert McFerrin, Bobby McFerrin's father, sang there for one year.  He sang leading roles.  And then I came, so I was the second black woman to sing there, and really the first one to do leading roles, because Marian Anderson had a--not minor, but it was not the leading role.
Speaker 1: And what did that do for your career?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was very good for my career.  Also having sung at [Teatro] alla Scala [Milan, Italy] was good for my career; I had done that before.  And so it--I was doing a lot.  I was singing very much in Europe; I went to Australia several times, and I was singing in the United States also.  And--but then after my first husband [Luis Rodriguez] died-well, I must back up, because this manager in Paris [France] asked me to sing one time for a meeting of all the European managers that was taking place in Paris in order to get me some work in some of the countries.  And this was rather early in my career, so I sang for them and there was a very famous manager [Helmer Enwall] from Sweden, who had been Marian Anderson's manager.  She did a lot of her early work in Scandinavia, by the way.  And so he asked me to come there and sing, so I went very often to the Scandinavian countries and sang there.  So on one of those trips, I met my husband [Bengt Janzon], my second husband, who was my husband for around thirty-nine years.  He's been dead eight years now.  And he was at the opera.  He was their press man at the opera, so that's how I met him.  And I was invited to sing at the opera there the year after I had been at the Met.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So then I married and moved there.
Speaker 1: And were you as well received by American audiences as you were by European audiences?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so, yes.  Although on the whole, I must say that at that time, the--I thought that the European audiences, especially for recitals, were more appreciative.  They just seemed to be more knowledgeable.
Speaker 1: And do you think that's what it was, that they were just more appreciative of the music and the craft and that kind of (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 253976
Speaker 1: So you then begin performing in Sweden.
Speaker 2: Yes, but not entirely, because I was traveling very much, and so, I was singing really all over the world, and I had a lot of contracts for traveling.  So my husband [Bengt Janzon] took a leave from his work, and he was able to travel with me for the first few years.  And, we went to Australia, New Zealand, we went Canada, United States, and I was still at the Met [Metropolitan Opera], and then I would sing in Sweden, so we were just going the whole time then.  But then, after a few years, he went back to his work and he went into--he became a public relations director for the depart--Swedish department of health and welfare [Ministry of Health and Welfare; Ministry of Health and Social Affairs] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 253977
Speaker 1: Let's talk about, in 1962, when you desegregated the theater in Atlanta [Georgia], what was the name of the theater?
Speaker 2: It was the city auditorium, [Atlanta] Municipal Auditorium [Atlanta, Georgia], where I had had sat--the only time I sat in segregated places was when I heard concerts (laughter) and--I had learned during those years that Paul Robeson never sang in those segregated places.  He refused to sing for segregated audiences.  He was the only black artist that I knew of who would not sing for segregated audiences.  When I heard everybody else, we had to sit in special sections.  Now, when Marian Anderson sang in Atlanta at this same municipal auditorium, they had so many black people who would come so they would divide the downstairs, the orchestra section, half white, half black, because they could fill up more than a balcony, but most of the time, you sat in the balcony.  But they all sang for segregated audiences except Paul Robeson.  And when he came, he sang at a church, and I remember hearing him.  And I was very impressed by the fact that he didn't sing for segregated audiences, so when I signed my contract with Sol Hurok for work in the United States, I had it put in the contract that I wouldn't sing for segregated audiences, 'cause having sat there myself, you know, I just didn't see how I could do it.  And fortunately after a few years, all that was away, so that's why I was so happy to be the first one to sing in my hometown.  And I also was the first one to sing in one or two other places--Birmingham [Alabama], I think--after the desegregation happened.
Story_ID: 253978
Speaker 1: After your performance in Atlanta [Georgia] in 1962, can you talk a little bit about, you know, the country was really changing--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at that particular time.  What impact was that having on your career and on your--on you professionally, or was it?
Speaker 2: Yes, because, see, I was living in Europe, and I would just come back to the United States to sing, and I was able to have some things in the South and also stay in some hotels in some places where I couldn't have stayed before.  I remember one place, they had just recently desegregated, I think it was Phoenix [Arizona], and I was so afraid.  I was really expecting something to happen.  I was very nervous (laughter) the whole time I was there.  But then also, when I was--when I got married in 1957, my husband [Bengt Janzon] and I--this is my Swedish husband, the second husband--we got married in New York [New York].  I was singing at the Metropolitan [Opera] at the time, and we couldn't get married in my hometown, because it was against the law in 1957.  So my family came to New York, and we were married there.  And, he didn't go with me to Atlanta until after the laws changed.  And then I was invited to sing at an opera company in Atlanta.  And I guess this was around '67 [1967], and that was the first time he and I had been there together.  So I saw a lot--a lot of changes.
Speaker 1: And so, did you continue to split your time between Europe and the U.S. in terms of your performances, like in the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  But by that time, toward the end of the '60s [1960s], I was doing more singing closer to home, because my husband had gone back to his work, and I didn't want to be away too long, so, I would--I did a lot of singing in Scandinavia during those years.
Story_ID: 253979
Speaker 1: And can you kind of walk us through the process of how you prepare for a performance and all the things that--the steps that you take that lead up to that performance?  Do you have like a ritual that you do?
Speaker 2: Well, do you mean opera?
Speaker 1: Or--yes.
Speaker 2: All right.  Let's--because it's different.
Speaker 1: Sure, well, can you explain opera and then--so, opera, and then concert, what you did for--
Speaker 2: Well, for both of them, you got to rehearse.  First, you got to learn the music and for--you, you know, it's usually something that you've done before, but it could be something new, and then in that case, you might get more rehearsals.  But, say if it's opera, you go and rehearse the stage business with the other singers, and then you have rehearsal with the conductor.  But if it's a first performance of that opera, you will get more rehearsals, but if you just come in later on during the season, you won't get an orchestra rehearsal, or a stage rehearsal; everything is done off stage.  And then you have to arrive at the theater in plenty of time to do your makeup and put on a wig and everything, and usually somebody will come and get you for your entrances, and they have a loud speaker system and tell you now it's time to go out, and so forth.  And you know when it's supposed to be, and there's someone there to help you dress and everything.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have to have--like suck on a lemon or drink tea or something like that before performances or?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to drink tea with lemon.  My singing teacher told me that milk was not good for the voice.  So, I always drank tea with--now, sometimes I would carry a thermos.  And, in my solo recitals, see, there, you sing by yourself; you're not with colleagues, and you're with a pianist, and you-- sometimes I had my--well, usually I would have my own pianist that I traveled with and would've rehearsed already, but you still have to go to the hall and do a little rehearsing there.  And there's a lot of preparation, rehearsals, for all kinds of singing (laughter).
Story_ID: 253980
Speaker 1: Did you perform with your sister?  Did your sister play for you sometimes?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  When I came back--
Speaker 1: And what sister?
Speaker 2: This was my sister, Irene [Dobbs Jackson], my oldest sister.  When I came back from having studied in Paris [France] two years, I did a little work in--back home my father [John Wesley Dobbs] raised some concerts in Atlanta [Georgia] and near Atlanta, and one of them was this concert in Atlanta.  My sister played for me on those concerts.
Speaker 1: What was that like for you, for the two of you to perform together?
Speaker 2: It was wonderful.  Something I forgot to tell you was that when I was just beginning to get my mature voice and realize that I had a voice, I had gone with my younger sister [HistoryMaker June Dobbs Butts] to Dallas, Texas, to visit her and her husband and children, and this is Maynard Jackson [Jr.]'s mother [sic. aunt]; he was just a little boy then.  And we--my sister and I took the train and went there, and so my sister, Irene, heard me singing and discovered that I had a voice.  And they had me sing at her husband's [Maynard Jackson, Sr.] church [Friendship Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] there, so that was one of my first concerts.  And she's the one who really sort of discovered that I had a singing voice.
Speaker 1: And we made reference to Maynard Jackson [Jr.] several times throughout the interview.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about the young Maynard Jackson.  What do you remember about him, you know, as a boy and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, I suppose I was living abroad most of the time when he was growing up, but I do remember when he was born in Texas, in Dallas, and I do remember going there and visiting them when he was a young child.  And then, I was, of course, kept contact with my family, but when I was living abroad, you know, when they moved to Atlanta, and he was going to high school and college, I didn't see so much of him, 'cause I was living abroad.
Speaker 1: And what was it like for the family when he became mayor of Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was wonderful.  I--he asked me to sing, and I sang with the Atlanta Symphony [Orchestra], and the whole family was there, and we were extremely proud of him.
Story_ID: 253981
Speaker 1: During the early '70s [1970s], you began your teaching career--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at the University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas]?
Speaker 2: I did, yes.
Speaker 1: Why did you decide to go into teaching?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to prepare for the time that I wouldn't be singing anymore.  I was still singing, though, but I was offered this job, and I thought, well, maybe it's a good time to do it, and also at that time, I was thinking of moving back to the [United] States, and my husband [Bengt Janzon] was going to retire in a few years, and I thought, well, I'll--if I get a job there, then we can live there, and I can still be working when my singing career stops.  So I accepted it, and I was still singing.  They- -most universities had begun inviting professional singers to be on their faculties.  Before, that didn't happen.  You had to--had to be there just as a teacher, but now when I was offered this job, they wanted people who were singing.  You were allowed to go away and do your engagements and then come back and teach, and so, it was sort of like you're artist in residence, but you were a real teacher, a real professors.  But that was a good way to begin.  And so I did that for--the first say four, five or six years, I was still singing and teaching.
Speaker 1: And was teaching gratifying for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.  It was something new to learn.  I had to learn how to teach boys, for instance, you know, and I found that I learned very much myself by teaching, 'cause you thought about what you were doing.  But, I just wasn't very happy living in Austin [Texas].  I don't know why, it seemed so strange to me, and so, I didn't stay there but one year.  I moved around a lot the first four years.
Speaker 1: And the bulk of your teaching career was at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yes, but before that, I had been--I was at--I went to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] as artist-in-residence one year, and then I was at the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign] in Champaign-Urbana [Illinois] one year, and then one year, I was at University of Georgia, which is in Athens, Georgia.  And then I was trying to commute from Atlanta [Georgia], but it was too long a commute, and I was offered a job at Howard, and I was very happy to come to Washington [D.C.] to live, so I accepted that job.
Story_ID: 253982
Speaker 1: You were at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] from 1977 to 1991.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you just tell us a little bit about some of the changes that you saw in students during that time?  Were you finding that there were students who were becoming less interested in operatic singing, or what were--how did--
Speaker 2: Yes, well from what I had heard about Howard, they had had almost a conservatory-like music school there before, some years before, and there was a lot of interest and good students.  And in those years, black students couldn't go to white schools, and they certainly didn't get scholarships, so they to all-black colleges, and Howard University attracted all the talented black singers, the main ones, you know, 'cause they were the best, but now when I came there, we had--the schools--the white schools had opened up and not only that, but they were actively courting the talented black students and giving them scholarships to go.  And so, that hurt the music department very much.  We just--and they didn't have much money to give scholarships either.  And there's a school here in Washington [D.C.] that's a performing arts high school called the Duke Ellington high school [Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Washington, D.C.], and there are several students from there--like [HistoryMaker] Denyce Graves is one, for instance--who received scholarships to go to Oberlin [Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio] and [The] Juilliard [School, New York, New York] and various places, and I know at least five or six professional black singers who came from the Washington [D.C.] area, and not one of them went to Howard.  So, Jessye Norman went to Howard, though she was there before I came.  And she was one of the last--well, one of the--well, the only one who made such a fantastic career, but she was one of the last students from that golden period.  But that--we had students, but there weren't that many interested.
Speaker 1: And were you finding that the interests in the type of music was changing?
Speaker 2: Yes, Howard has a very fine jazz department, and they had a lot of good students there, and a lot of the students in classical music maybe wanted to go over to jazz (laughter).  So, I find that it had changed.
Speaker 1: And what was it like in the '90s [1990s] right before you retired?  What were the--was there starting to become an interest in--was the interest in operatic music starting to increase or was it staying about the same?
Speaker 2: I think it was about the same during my fourteen years there.
Speaker 1: Was it disappointing for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, because--I had some good students.  I'm not saying I didn't have any good students, but I didn't have as many as I would have liked.  And then, another reason why I didn't think the work was as satisfying was that we didn't have hardly any--there were no graduate students.  Maybe the whole time I was there, only one graduate student or something, but whereas in these other large universities like [University of] Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas] and [University of] Illinois [Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], there were--you know, most talented students were on the graduate level.
Story_ID: 253983
Speaker 1: What advice do you have for someone who's--particularly an African American--who's interested in an operatic singing career?
Speaker 2: I would say try and listen to as much opera, and not only opera but symphonic music, recitals, voice, piano, violin, all kinds of classical music.  Try and listen to it as much as possible, and if you think that you have talent as a singer, try to get the opinion of someone who knows whether or not you have a chance, because to spend a lot of time, money, and energy trying and not have the talent is not good, so you really would need to find somebody who could give you a good assessment of your chances.  And then, get a good teacher (laughter).
Story_ID: 253984
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite performances that you did?  Or most memorable performances (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there was a--my debut at [Teatro] alla Scala [Milan, Italy] and also my debut at the Metropolitan [Opera House, New York, New York], and I loved doing recitals.  I did recitals in New York [New York], very much, and also one I particularly liked doing was in Vienna [Austria] and Paris [France], and, well, I don't know.  I did a lot of interesting things, like my tours of Australia and New Zealand.  When I went there, I was brought out by the broadcasting corporation, because they were the ones who brought the artists.  They didn't have private managers who brought artists in those years, 'cause it was such a big deal to pay somebody to come that far and also the radio, the broadcasting company, took tapes of all the performances, and they played them on the radio even after you had gone.  And so you had--I had to stay three months each time and tour the whole country.  Now, I did that three times.  Then, I went to Russia [Soviet Union].  I was one of the first Americans to sing in Russia during the Cold War period; this was 1959.  My manager, Sol Hurok, was born in Russia but had become an American, and he had a big--he started the first exchanges between Russians and--artists and Americans.  He would bring Russians here and he--and then he sent some Americans to Russia, and so he sent me there in 1959.  I did a six-week tour.  I sang at the Bolshoi [Theatre, Moscow, Russia] and then I also did concerts.  That was very interesting.  Then I sang in Israel with the Israel Philharmonic [Orchestra]; I was there twice.  And I was in the Far East; I was in India, Thailand, and Singapore.  But unfortunately, I never sang in China or Japan, nor South America, but I was in Central America, Cuba--I was in Cuba before [Fidel] Castro (laughter).
Speaker 1: And was it difficult overcoming the language barrier?  Because I'm sure there were other performers from other countries.  How did you all communicate with one another?
Speaker 2: In Europe where, you know, they used to--I don't know if they still do it, but they used to perform opera in their own languages; each country performed in its own country--own language, whereas here, we always performed in the original language.  But--so, many times in Scandinavia and Russia, I would sing, for instance, say in 'Rigoletto' by [Giuseppe] Verdi, I would sing in Italian, and they would be singing in Norwegian or Swedish or in Russian (laughter).  And when I was in Russia and sang at the Bolshoi, I did two Italian operas, 'The Barber of Seville' of [Gioachino] Rossini and 'Rigoletto' Verdi, and they all sang in Russian, and I sang in Italian.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: They sang in Russian and I sang in Italian, and in 'The Barber of Seville,' there is a scene that portrays a young girl taking a singing lesson.  And traditionally, singers would use that scene to interpolate different songs.  They could sing anything they wanted to.  That was the old tradition; I don't think they do it now.  But you could sing some--a very short piece that would show off your voice, and so I chose--I decided I was gonna sing a Russian folk song.  And I had been in Israel just before going to Russia, and I had stayed at a place where the housekeeper knew Russian, and she had taught me the Russian for this folk song.  So, I sang that folk song, and the audience was so amazed when I sang in Russian in the middle of this opera where I had sung Italian.  I had another experience with languages in Israel.  I don't think they even now perform anything in German.  They had a ban on any German.  And as you know, a big portion of the recital repertoire is German.  So, I didn't program any German songs by German composers, but I did program some songs in German by a Jewish composer, [Felix] Mendelssohn.  And I thought, well, they'll accept this, because it's Mendelssohn.  And when I first started sing the German, I almost had to stop.  There was such a whispering going on in the audience, you know, they were so shocked (laughter) to hear German.  And then they, they quieted down, and I was able to continue (laughter).

Speaker 1: What's your opinion of popular music today, like black popular music today?
Speaker 2: I'm not very fond of it.
Speaker 1: Why not (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't like rap.  I don't think rap is music.  I think it's more talking.  And I liked the music before, so really in my opinion, I just don't--I don't care for it, so I am very, very prejudiced against it, because I don't like it.  But I think that musically speaking, black music was better before.  It was more--it was better music, in my opinion.

Speaker 1: One of the things I didn't ask you about that I'd like to is church.  Did you sing in church?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I sang in the choir of the First Congregational Church in Atlanta [Georgia].  And also when I went to New York [New York], I sang in the choir, Grace Congregational Church [of Harlem] in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like in church growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to Sunday school, and then went to church and joined when I was twelve years old.  And my father [John Wesley Dobbs] was a trustee and my mother [Irene Thompson Dobbs] was a deaconess, and my whole family had gone to that church for years.
Speaker 1: And did they perform like in the traditional way of the black church?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: How was it different?
Speaker 2: Our church performed European-type music.  And this was before--well, there were some churches that had gospel even then, but I--my church had strictly classical music.
Story_ID: 253987
Speaker 1: And when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: Well, the fact that I had such a good family life, wonderful parents [Irene Thompson Dobbs and John Wesley Dobbs] and sisters, and I never had children of my own, so it was always a pleasure for me to have such a large family, my sisters and their children, and now their children.  And so, that's what stands out very much.  And also, my marriage to my husband [Bengt Janzon], and my years in Europe.  I still spend a lot of time in Sweden.  I have many friends there, and I love having both countries.  As long as I can get on a plane, I'm gonna do that (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And do you ever regret not pursuing that career in fashion?
Speaker 2: No.  When I think about it, I don't think it even would've worked, not at that time (laughter).
Speaker 1: And so what haven't you done yet that you'd still like to do?
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything, because I have been fortunate, been able to do most everything that I wanted to do.  I learned how to swim late as an adult, because I hadn't done that as a child, and I also learned how to drive a car late, 'cause I was living in Europe where I didn't need one.  But now at this stage of my life, I don't know if there's anything particularly that I want to do.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Different.  Well, maybe learn a computer.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That, I might do.
Speaker 1: And is there anything that you've already done that you wish you would've done a little differently?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't like to think in the past like that, you know, and say I shouldn't have done that.  I think that the past is past.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Can't do anything about it anyway (laughter).
Story_ID: 253988
Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: Because--who was that who said that--who--let's see, what is that quotation?  You--if you don't know anything about history, you are doomed to make the same mistake, something like that, somebody said that.  My father [John Wesley Dobbs] used to say that.  So, you have to know about history so you can learn and avoid the mistakes of the past and try to improve, and also realize what made you as a person also, because all those historical things are very important.  My father was very interested in history.  He read books on history and was very, very much interested in that, so I grew up hearing about history (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 253989
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: What I think is a sad thing now is that we have--we're getting these class--big class distinctions.  It's part of the whole--part of the American life that's now so dependent on money, where you are--with money, you can only live in a certain neighborhood, you can only go to a certain school, and it--and it's getting worse and worse.  We're getting a big divide between people who have money and people who don't have money, and without the money or chance for education--an education is very important, and that takes money.  When I grew up in Atlanta [Georgia], we had segregated community, but we all lived more or less in the same neighborhood when I was a child, and we had people who were less fortunate, people who were more fortunate, but we were together.  And they saw what they could become and had role models.  But now, you have the upper income group all by themselves and the lower income group by themselves.  They don't--they're like two different races, really.  They don't have much to do with each other, and I think that's a pity.
Story_ID: 253990
Speaker 1: Do you think that you led a life of privilege growing up in Atlanta [Georgia]? Would you consider it that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did.  I did, especially when I think about it being in the days of segregation.  If your father or mother didn't have to work for white people, you could live an independent life.  But if they had to work for white people, as maids or in menial jobs, your whole life was different.  So that was a big difference.  But I think also that when I grew up in Atlanta, there weren't--there were--we had poor people, but nowhere near like you have in the cities now.  We--the great majority of black people were still in rural areas on farms.  They hadn't yet come into the cities.  I'm talking about before the, the Second World War [World War II, WWII].  And more and more came into the cities and got stranded without education, without chance to achieve.
Speaker 1: And did your parents both--were they both educated?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother [Irene Thompson Dobbs] took this teachers--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --certificate.  My father [John Wesley Dobbs] went to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], but he didn't graduate, 'cause he left to join the Railway Mail Service, and he was supporting his mother [Minnie Hendricks Dobbs Banks], and then he got married, but he was there for about three years at Morehouse College.
Story_ID: 253991
Speaker 1: As we're talking about education, you know, we--what are some of your thoughts as someone who grew up in Atlanta [Georgia]?  You grew up around Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] and to see what's happening or what has happened to Morris Brown College today?  What were some of your thoughts about that?  The school just not being able to stay open--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) due to financial reasons.
Speaker 2: I think it's a pity.  I had a niece who was on the faculty there--I have a niece who was on the faculty there, and I heard from her already before this happened that they were in trouble.  They actually moved.  They used to be across the street from where I grew up, but they moved over to the other side of town where the other universities were, and they took over the old buildings that had belonged to Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] when it was an undergraduate school.  So, I don't--I really don't know what's going to happen to them.  I think it's a pity.  But it's a church sponsored school, and they probably just don't have the money.
Speaker 1: And do you think that we're gonna begin to see this happen to more and more historically black colleges [HBCUs]?
Speaker 2: Well, maybe some of them that don't have adequate financing.  Now, some do very well, like my alma mater, Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  They were always supported very much by the Rockefeller family, because they were founded by two white teachers [Harriet E. Giles and Sophia B. Packard] who came from New England just after slavery to teach the freed slaves how to read and write.  And the Rockefeller family, they contact--they knew somebody there, and they were always interested in funding Spelman.  In fact, Spelman is named for John D. Rockefeller's mother; her name was Laura Spelman [Rockefeller].  And so, there's always been a member of the Rockefeller family on the board, and I don't know today, but I think that they still support it very much.  But they have other people who support it, too.  But, Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] is well-endowed.  Some--Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], of course, has government support plus private.  And Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] I think is--has good support.  But, there are a lot of them that are struggling.
Story_ID: 253992
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a pioneer in the operatic field as a black person.
Speaker 1: And would you like to see more African Americans becoming interested in operatic music (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes I would.  Yes, I would.  I don't think we have as many now as we once had.
Speaker 1: Why do you think that is?
Speaker 2: I think just simply there are not as many actually studying opera and going into it--going to do all that necessary to try for a career.
Story_ID: 253993
Speaker 1: And what do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: My legacy?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, if I could maybe inspire someone to try and have a similar career, like I was inspired by Marian Anderson's career.
Story_ID: 253994
Speaker 1: This is with Louis Armstrong and his wife.
Speaker 2: Do you remember her name?
Speaker 1: Let's see, what was--wait, now what was her name?  Lucille.
Speaker 2: Lucille Armstrong, okay.
Speaker 1: And this was at the Copacabana nightclub [New York, New York] shortly after my marriage.  That's my husband, Bengt [Janzon]--we pronounce it Yonson [ph.] in Sweden, but I just say Janzon.
Speaker 2: Okay, and his first name again, I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Bengt.
Speaker 2: Okay, and about what year was that one?
Speaker 1: This was 1957.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Spell, spell his name, too, for, for our caption editors.
Speaker 2: B-E-N-G-T.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: And J-A-N-Z-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: And he--my husband knew Louis Armstrong from the days that he was a public relations person for Paramount Pictures.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he had had met Louis Armstrong there and they'd become very good friends.  Louis Armstrong called him, my boy (laughter).  Anyway, so we went there to his performance that night, and somebody took that picture.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And if the pictures are upside-down, we flip them in our postproduction, so don't worry if they're upside-down.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  We'll fix 'em.
Speaker 1: This is my mother.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Or sideways.
Speaker 1: Yeah, or sideways.  Her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Irene Thompson Dobbs.
Speaker 1: And about what year was that one taken?
Speaker 2: You know, I really don't know.  I would say this must've been in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is my father, John Wesley Dobbs, and I don't remember when this was made either, but he looks like he might've been say about fifty or so or something.
Speaker 1: So about what year do you think?  When was he born?
Speaker 2: Well, this might be from the late '40s [1940s], maybe?
Speaker 1: Late '40s [1940s], okay.
Speaker 2: This is my--the picture at my wedding in New York City [New York, New York] at Grace Congregational Church [of Harlem, New York, New York].  That's my mother on the left and my husband next to her and my father on the right.
Speaker 1: About what year--what year did you get married?
Speaker 2: This is 1957, December 1957.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They came to New York.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Great.  Next.
Speaker 2: This is a--
Speaker 1: Oops, I'm sorry, Ms. [HistoryMaker Mattiwilda] Dobbs [Janzon].  Hang on.
Speaker 2: That's one of my--
Speaker 1: Sorry.
Speaker 2: --professional pictures that I had made when I was living in Spain, I had made for my publicity material.
Speaker 1: About what year was that one taken?
Speaker 2: This would be about 1954, say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is when I sang Gilda in 'Rigoletto' by [Giuseppe] Verdi at the Metropolitan [Opera House, New York, New York].  I made my debut in this role in December 1956, and this picture was probably shortly after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is from the Glyndebourne [Lewes, England] opera in [East] Sussex, England, where I sang the role of Konstanze, K-O-N-S-T-A-N-Z-E, from the opera, 'The Abduction from the Seraglio,' S-E-R-A-G-L-I-O, by [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart, and this was 1956.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Next.
Speaker 1: This was when I sang at the White House [Washington, D.C.] on the occasion of Marian Anderson's receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor from President [James Earl "Jimmy"] Carter [Jr.], and this was 1977.
Speaker 2: A family reunion held in Durham, North Carolina.  You want to know who everybody is?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am, please.
Speaker 2: Okay, starting at the back to the left is my sister, Willie [Dobbs] Blackburn, in the middle is my sister, [HistoryMaker] June [Dobbs] Butts, I'm to the right.  Then coming down to the next row, on the left is my sister, Irene [Dobbs] Jackson, next to her is my sister, Millicent [Dobbs] Jordan, next to her is my sister, Josephine [Dobbs] Clement in whose home we were, and next to her is her husband, William Clement [Sr.].  And the two on the floor to the left is Carol Ann Miller, my niece, the daughter of Irene, and [HistoryMaker] Juliet [Dobbs] Blackburn[-Beamon], the daughter of my sister, Willie Blackburn.
Speaker 1: And about what year was that one taken?
Speaker 2: I tell ya, this was in the '80s [1980s] I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Early '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oops, sorry.
Speaker 2: This was from one of my early recitals when I came--first came back on a brief visit from Europe, and this was at a black church in Atlanta [Georgia], Bethel Baptist Church [ph.], and it was a recital.  My sister, Irene Jackson accompanied me, and she's to the left, I'm to the right.
Speaker 1: And what year?
Speaker 2: This would be 1952.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Hold just one second.
Speaker 1: Oh, sorry.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: I made that dress, by the way.
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.
Speaker 1: Carol Ann got that--gave me that picture.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That's a photograph I had made when I was in college.
Speaker 2: About what year?
Speaker 1: I would guess about '44 [1944].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is, let's see, 1948 when my sister, June, who is sitting in a cap and gown graduated from Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] where we all went.  All six sisters went to Spelman College and graduated from there.  And at the--at this time when the youngest one was graduated, the president [Florence Read] of the college asked us to come, and she inaugurated what she called the order of the sixes, because we were so unusual in being six girls who had gone to Spelman.  I don't think that record has been broken.  And--
Speaker 2: Can you name everybody, Ms. Dobbs?
Speaker 1: The man sitting on the left is my father.  Wait a minute, I really can't see this very well.  Wait a minute.
Speaker 2: Can you help a little bit, Beth [Jackson-Hodges]?
Speaker 1: Could I just--oh, there it is.  Oh, yeah, I look there (laughter).

Story_ID: 253995
Speaker 1: This picture was taken at the opera house [Kungliga Operan] in Stockholm, Sweden.  I can't remember the year.  It was some time in the '60s [1960s], maybe about--when was [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] assassinated?
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 1: This might've been say '65 [1965] or '66 [1966], and as you see, he's standing next to me, my husband is on the left, Bengt Janzon, and then Martin Luther King, who was a childhood friend of mine, is next to me, and I'm standing there.  And then on the other end is Gunnar Myrdal, a Swedish sociologist and writer who wrote the famous book called the '[An] American Dilemma' which was one of the best and first books to come out about the--about race relations in the United States.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: Is that one--
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Yeah, it's got the same disease as the other one.  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is me and Danny Kaye.  I'm not really playing ping-pong, just posing.  This was in Sydney, Australia.  It was done for a newspaper.  I was performing there, and he was also, and we stayed in the same hotel, so they took our picture.
Speaker 2: About what year was that one taken?
Speaker 1: This was 1959.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: Did I fix it?
Speaker 1: This is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: This must be about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry, [HistoryMaker] Ms. [Mattiwilda] Dobbs [Janzon].  I'm sorry.  There.
Speaker 1: I think this is around 1957.  I think it was an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] gala where my husband and I were talking with Congressman Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.].
Speaker 2: And did you say the year?
Speaker 1: Around '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: Now, on the back of this one, it says 1956.
Speaker 1: It's '56 [1956], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is nineteen--December 1956 on the occasion of my debut at the Metropolitan [Opera House, New York, New York].  I'm being congratulated by the director of the Metropolitan, Rudolf Bing, and the opera in which I sang was 'Rigoletto.'  I sang the part of Gilda, G-I-L-D-A.  It's by [Giuseppe] Verdi.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  This is 1949.
Speaker 2: This is--you said 1949?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, one of the early times I sang was in St. Louis [Missouri].  I think it was at a teachers college, Stowe Teachers College [Harris-Stowe State University, St. Louis, Missouri], one of my early concerts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: This was one of my first recitals when I had come back from Europe.  I was presented at my alma mater, Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], and I'm seated in the center.  To the left is my sister, [HistoryMaker] June [Dobbs] Butts, my mother [Irene Thompson Dobbs], my father [John Wesley Dobbs], my sister, Irene [Dobbs] Jackson, and my sister, Josephine [Dobbs] Clement.  That's in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: Did I say the year for that one before?  Did I say what year that was?
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  I'm not sure.  She did?  Okay, thank you, Beth [Jackson-Hodges].
Speaker 2: This is 1959.  My husband and I are in Australia somewhere.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Next.
Speaker 1: This says 1987.
Speaker 2: Does it say '87 [1987]?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I'm glad I wrote it.  This is a time I was staying in a house in southern France near James Baldwin whom I had met in Atlanta.  And that's James Baldwin to my right who came and had lunch with me and his friend, Bernot Hassid [ph.] seated to my left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: This is a picture that my mother had.  It was her grandmother, my great-grandmother who was an Irish person who had come to the United States.  I don't know, probably she was an indentured servant.  But anyway, she met this black man and they married and had children, one of whom was my mother's father.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  What was her name?
Speaker 1: Her name was Lenore [Thompson].  I never knew her, of course, but my mother had this picture of her.
Speaker 2: And her last name?
Speaker 1: I--she was married, Thompson.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do you know about year it was taken?
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know.  That--my mother was born in 18--let's see, what, what date did I--1863, I think, and so this was her grandmother, so this was two generations before.
Speaker 2: So maybe 1800s maybe?
Speaker 1: It was before the Civil War, I guess it was.  So he must've been a free man.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: And this is her son, my grandfather.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  His name?
Speaker 2: His name was Kelly, Kelly Thompson.  She gave him an Irish name.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  And about what year do you think that one was taken?
Speaker 2: See, my mother was forty when I was born, and say her father was about twenty-five when she was born, so this would be sixty-five years before 1925?  What's that?
Speaker 1: So, nineteen--
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  They can do the math.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's my grandmother, his wife.  Her--I was named for her.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  What's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Mattiewilda [Sykes Thompson], two separate names, M-A-T-T-I-E, and capital W-I-L-D-A.  And her maiden name was Sykes, and she married Kelly Thompson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  About what year?
Speaker 2: My grandfather.  There again, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: But as I said my--so you're talking about, about sixty some odd years before 1925.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my mother when she was a child with her sister to the left and her brother to the right.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Their names?
Speaker 2: Her sister's name was Caroline Thompson, my mother's name was Irene Thompson, and her brother's name was Kelly Thompson [Jr.].
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Do you know about year that one was taken?  Your mother looks like she was maybe about ten, maybe?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  So, 18--
Speaker 2: Let's see, well, she was born in--when did I say?
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Eighteen sixty-three [1863], I think you said?
Speaker 2: I can't remember now all of the sudden.  My father was born in--
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is my great-grandmother on my father's side.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Judy or Judith, I don't know which, but she was married Dobbs.  She was a slave, and she died before I was--I think she died in 1925, the year I was born, so I didn't know her.  She's the one I told you about who, who had to take care of the master's wife and was his daughter.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Do you have an idea about when this photograph was taken?
Speaker 2: Let's see, if she died in 1925--we went to her grave, so I think that's when she died, and she was--I don't know how old she was, but she was pretty old.  I think she was--say, say she was eighty?  What would that be?
Speaker 1: They can figure out the math.  We'll let them figure it out.  Okay.
Speaker 2: See, I just don't know these dates.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, that's fine.  That's fine.
Speaker 2: This is my, my father's mother, my grandmother whom we call Nanny and her name was Minnie Millicent Minerva Hendricks Dobbs [Banks].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: What year do you think?  Your best guess.
Speaker 2: If my father was born in eighteen--twenty years younger?
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  So 1862?
Speaker 2: Maybe a little before that, because she was born in slavery.  She said she was ten years old, so she must've been born 1855, say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: And so, so she--I don't know how old she was on that picture.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's fine.
Speaker 1: That's her children, my father and his sister.  His sister's name was, was Willie Eves [Dobbs].
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  About what year?
Speaker 1: And this must've been taken in Savannah [Georgia] when they lived there because he was very young.  So, I don't know when that was, 'cause he was born in 1882.  What--how old does he look there?
Speaker 2: He looks like he's about five, so--
Speaker 1: He looks a little older than that.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  He looks a little older than five?  Okay, what do you guys think?
Speaker 1: Eight or ten?
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Like ten, eleven?
Speaker 1: Ten?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So 1892?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, this one says 1963.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that--this is with Roland Hayes, the great tenor and this is when I sang with the Boston Opera Company [Opera Company of Boston], and he lived in Boston [Massachusetts].  He came back stage.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And did you say the year?
Speaker 1: It--what--it's on the back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1963, okay.
Speaker 1: This is my wedding to my first husband, Luis Rodriguez.  It took place in Genoa, Italy, and the person to the left is an Italian friend who was the matron of honor.
Speaker 2: About what year?  What year did you get married?
Speaker 1: This was 1953.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Hang on, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: This was taken here in Arlington [Virginia] after I had started teaching at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  It was done for a Swedish magazine, and this was in the '80s [1980s] sometime.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Hold on, please.  Okay.
Speaker 2: This one says 1985.
Speaker 1: Oh, does that say '85 [1985]?
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  That was--I don't know where that was.
Speaker 2: Let me see.  It might be on the back.  Trinidad?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, yes.  That's--I had a recital in Trinidad.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's a friend of mine who, who accompanied me sometimes.  She teaches piano at Spelman, Joyce Johnson.
Speaker 2: And what year did--1985.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This one says 1937.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That, that was my sister, June, June Dobbs Butts with me.  We went to a studio and had this made.
Speaker 2: In 1937?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I was twelve.
Speaker 2: This is in 1950 when I was--I guess I was on board the ship because that's the French flag there.  And, I traveled to Paris [France] on the French liner, and my parents would see me off.  Somebody took this picture as I was getting ready to depart for Europe in 1950.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: And this is a picture I had made say about three years ago, 2002 perhaps, I think.
