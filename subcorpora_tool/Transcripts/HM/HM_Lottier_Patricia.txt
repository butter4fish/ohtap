Speaker 2: I have to say South Africa; we just went last year, and I went back.  I really enjoyed South Africa.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I--not really, but I, I--sometimes when things are a bit unusual or rough, I sort of say, "Good comes back to those who're doin' good"--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I think that's it.
Speaker 1: All right, great.
Story_ID: 98684
Speaker 1: All right, we're gonna begin by talking about your, your family--
Speaker 2: Emm.
Speaker 1: --and we'll start on your mother [Ruth Jennings Franklin]'s side.  Do you know your grandparents, or did you know your grandparents on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well, not really 'cause my mother was one of thirteen, and she was the youngest.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: We were talking about your mother's parents.
Speaker 1: Right, she was the youngest of thirteen, so her mother--when my mother was a young girl, actually, her older sister took care of her because of, you know, the age difference.  And I do remember my grandmother, but she was very elderly and she was ill, the few times I saw her, 'cause we were living in Kentucky and they were in Augusta, Georgia.  Did not know my grandfather on my father's side, did not know those grandparents at all; they both had died before I was born.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Your mother's mother, what was her name?
Speaker 1: Oh, wow; why am I not remembering?
Speaker 2: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jennings was their maiden name, and my grandfather, who I didn't know, was Robert Jennings.  I'll have to--maybe it'll come back to me 'cause I can't think of it now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I remember seeing her one time, and she was in, in my aunt's house in a makeshift hospital bed, and my aunt was being the nurse; had on white, everything, to take care of her.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And I was probably no more than four or five 'cause my sister was in school, so they couldn't--she didn't take her out of school, but since I was not in school--they didn't have kindergarten or Head Start back then, I had to travel with them when they went to take care of her.
Story_ID: 98685
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  All right, well, tell me your mother's name.
Speaker 2: Ruth.  Jennings maiden, name, and then Franklin when she married my father [Melvin Franklin].
Speaker 1: Did your mother share any stories about her growing up--with you?
Speaker 2: Maybe fun kind of stories--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --but none of the hard core, you know, how was it like in the segregated area, 'cause they really didn't think of segregation back then; it was just accepted that there was a white, you know, water fountain, and there was a colored water fountain; it was just--it was accepted.  They didn't see that it was wrong; they didn't see that things could be different, so their kinda stories were basic stories--doing picnics, going to parks, playin' baseball.  Again, she was one of thirteen--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --and she really, really, I don't think, knew her mother that well because the older two--the older three sisters, really, took care of my mother 'cause they were up and married when my mother was a little baby.  That's how they did it back then; they didn't have birth control I don't think.  They didn't think of family planning.
Speaker 1: Did she talk about her education at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was really kind of--very proud of it because she was a very smart lady, went to high school, and actually went to two years of college in Augusta, Georgia, which wasn't really what folks did back then, but she had to wait tables in different restaurants to pay for her education, but she enjoyed learning.  But she also, at the same time, met my father [Melvin Franklin], who was stationed at Fort Gordon in Augusta, Georgia.  And when, I guess, the army sort of said, "You're gonna go to Kentucky, you're discharged"--whatever, she decided, "Well, let me pack up and go, too."  So they got married in Augusta and moved to Ashland, Kentucky--that's where he was from.
Speaker 1: When, when she was growin' up, did they live on a farm or in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--They lived in what they called the City of Augusta, but still it was rural.  I know she talked about walking all the time, she talked about they did pick cotton; that was how they made extra money, and then in their backyard, they had all their own vegetables and had chickens.  I remember her talking about how they cut the heads off the chickens and the chickens would run around, no heads, bloody; I didn't believe it, but that's what she said that would happen.
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: They actually--everything they ate, they almost grew--the chickens, the eggs, all the vegetables.  We probably only went to the little corner store to buy whatever they couldn't grow in the backyard.
Speaker 1: So tell me, what type of mother was she to you?
Speaker 2: She sort of let me and my sister, my older sister who's about two and a half years older, she let us be independent; she always said, "Go to church, do the right thing, but remember whatever happens, you got to face the piper on it."  We always had to do our chores, we always had to make our beds, we always had to switch and--"Okay, this is your day to--your week to wash dishes;" I think we did it by the week, which I was always mad.  On my week, I always said, "You're doin' too much cooking; I got too many pots and pans to wash."  And then on my sister's week, that's when I think, "Ahh, you know, y'all are eatin' light; what's goin' on here?  You like her better than me."  But, you know, as a child, that's how you think.  So, we always had to go to Sunday school, we always had to go to Wednesday church, Sunday day service, and then if the pastor had somethin' in the evening, we had to go back for that.  Then, of course, we always had to go to school; she put that into us and "You do your homework and, you know, this little town you live in you, you know, you want to get an education 'cause you really don't want to stay here; there's nothing much for colored people;" that's what she called--we were called back then--colored people back in Ashland, "so you're gonna get an education, go to college, and become a teacher or a nurse; those are good options."
Speaker 1: Did your mother work outside the home?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, she always did; she did what they called day labor; she went--had two years of college, but there was nothing that she could use that kinda education for in Ashland, so she didn't have a college degree; you had to have a degree to be a teacher, or you had to go through nursing school, and she did not have time nor money to do that, so she worked for a man called Mr. Holly for probably twenty years, cooking, cleaning, taking care of them, which was a good thing for us because she cooked good food and she was able to bring it home for us, so we ate well.  When Mr. Holly wanted strawberries, we got strawberries, they wanted steak, we had steak.  And I also even got to go and watch her sometimes in the big fancy kitchen; I just thought that was the biggest thing since sliced bread--good kitchen.  Now, of course, when we ate at Mr. Holly's, we couldn't eat in the dining room; we ate in the kitchen, but we ate good and we didn't know the difference; we just thought we were livin' the good life there.
Speaker 1: Do you know your mother's date of birth?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, September the 30th, 1934, or 1933.
Story_ID: 98686
Speaker 1: All right.  And what about your father?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Melvin Franklin, and he was about four years older than my mother [Ruth Jennings Frankling].  He died when I was--I was in--I think I was in third grade; didn't know him that much.
Speaker 1: Do you know when he was born?
Speaker 2: He was four years older, so whatever that makes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Oh, I'm sorry.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--but the month, don't even remember that anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'd have to in one of my bibles where I wrote all that down.
Speaker 1: Did your father or mother ever talk about their ancestors--anybody ever in slavery or any stories like that?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, they never, never did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother said that her mother was Indian, and when I would see pictures, I would say, "Well, are you really, really sure?  She got this long, long hair but it's thick hair, it's not straight hair."  And we (ph.) said, "Well, maybe she was half-Indian."  And then they would sorta name some tribe in the Carolinas, but I think they felt very sensitive about talking about slave issues.  And then, just maybe four or five years ago, I found out that my grandfather, who I never knew, had been married before, left my grandmother, then came back, and I think that's why they had such a span of children, you know, some being old, some being very young.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: They were very embarrassed by some of that.  Then, on my father's side, my aunt, who is still living, who is about ninety-seven, she won't tell anybody her real age, but she won't talk about it.  And I did find out, I guess I'd say about five years ago, that my grandfather had been a slave as a young boy, and a white family in Kentucky saw him being mistreated or something like that, and actually took him away from the slave-owner, gave him the name of Franklin.  There was a, a young lady in our--well, an older lady in our town that somehow found the material, wrote about it, gave the book to my aunt, and my aunt kinda hid it 'til somebody told me about the book.  So I asked for the book and, of course, I read it; Gordon Franklin, who was supposed to be my grandfather, and about how he had been mistreated as a child of seven, and made to work ungodly hours, and a white family decided they would rescue this little colored boy, and then gave him the name.
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: But my aunt never, never really wanted to ask any more questions about him; I think it was either painful--she was also a very religious person, so maybe she just felt this was not something God wanted anybody to know.  I never understood that; I still don't.  They have no desire to do like Alex Haley and look for their roots; they don't want to know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said you have just one sister?
Speaker 2: I have one sister, Martina (ph.), and she's two and a half years older than I am and she lives in Atlanta, Georgia, also.
Story_ID: 98687
Speaker 1: All right.  So, as we're talking, we're gonna talk about you and your early childhood.  What is your earliest memory as a child?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, you know, going to Augusta, Georgia, watching my grandmother, who was sick in a bed, being taken care of, I think.  I think I also remember staying with one of my aunts while my mother worked.  I remember, you know, just riding in the car sometimes, and they would always love to go shopping, my two little aunts.  They called themselves the jet-setters; they would get all dressed up with gloves, hats, nice pocketbook, shoes, 'cause that one aunt was kind of, sort of well-off; didn't really need the work; they enjoyed going out to another town to shop.  I don't know if they just window-shopped, or if they bought; I don't remember much of that, but they would put me in the back seat, put a little blanket over my lap.  I remember riding up to a little town called Huntington, and we'd shop.  They never bought me anything; I remember eating pretty good; I had some candy, I think.  But that's what I would do, and I--and when I think back, I just wonder why I wasn't in school, so I guess we didn't have kindergarten back then.  I guess you only went to school when you were in the first grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, everybody else was gone, but I was always with this little aunt when they went shopping.
Story_ID: 98688
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let me ask you.  You said your mother [Ruth Jennings Franklin] and father [Melvin Franklin] got married in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--In Augusta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: They got married in Augusta (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--In Augusta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: And then they moved to Ashland, Kentucky (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Ashland, Kentucky 'cause that's where he's from; he was from Ashland, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His father at that time, even though I didn't know him, somehow had a little bit of money 'cause they owned about eight houses.  So when my father got out of the service, he inherited two of those little houses; now, they were little shotgun houses, you know, the living room go all the way through.  You've heard of shot gun?
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And I don't remember the outdoor plumbing, but they had a little outhouse, but they owned the house, so in Ashland, Kentucky, those people had some money.  So grandfather had 'bout eight of 'em, my father got two, my aunt got what they called the big house, where everybody congregated, and she got two other pieces of property.  Then there were four other brother--two brothers, two aunties.  Two decided to go off to New York to find their fame and fortune, so they sold the two houses back to my auntie.  Another brother decided to stay in Ashland and he kept his two houses, and my dad kept his two; we lived in one and we rented the other, so we had a little bit of money--back then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you said Ironton [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Ironton.  Oh, well, our town Ashland did not have any black doctors, and the white doctors, of course, would not see any colored people, so you went across the river, which is no more than fifteen minutes away, to the only black doctor in that area in Ironton, for any--whatever you needed, you went over there.  He delivered the babies, he took care of high blood pressure, took care of diabetes, and whatever; he was an all-purpose colored doctor.  So, when I was ready to be born, we had to go across the river, so my birth certificate has Ironton, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, my sister was born in Augusta, Georgia when my father was still in service at Fort Gordon.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I just wanted to clear that up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I forget about that, too, sometimes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 98689
Speaker 1: All right, so when you do start school, what elementary school do you go to?
Speaker 2: Booker T. Washington; everyone went to a Booker T. Washington High School, and in our little town [Ashland, Kentucky], it was first grade all the way through twelve.  We had a marching band, we had a home ec [home economics] sewing class, we had a little library; everybody in that little town went to one school, you had no other choice.  Then, when Brown versus Brown [sic, Brown v. Board of Education] happened, we had a principal who was probably ninety-nine, we thought--little ol' man with a cane, and if you acted up, he put the cane to your behind.  But when they decided that they were gonna, you know, integrate schools--desegregation, whatever you wanna call it, well, he wasn't ready to retire, and we found out later that Professor [Charles B.] Nuckolls did not even have a college degree, but he was principal of Booker T. Washington High School, and he was well-respected in the town.  Therefore, since he had no degree, he couldn't go into the white schools could he?  So they had to keep the school open until he retired, which was five more years.  I was caught in that little trap, I call it; I had to spend all--I spent from the first grade all the way to the seventh grade Booker T. Washington High School; I was the last class.  Nobody could come in after us 'cause we all had to finally wait 'til Professor Nuckolls, who was not a real professor, to retire.
Speaker 1: And Nuckolls, how, how do you spell Nuckolls?
Speaker 2: Nuckolls?  N-U-C-K-O-L-L-S.  Well-known in the city of Atlanta--of, of Ashland, Kentucky; very well-known, but did not have a degree.  So, anyway, when they finally got rid of the school and then we just kind of--some of the teachers went into the white system and some went into working in department stores.  I went to a high--a junior high school, and it's the first time I realized that people really wanted to see A's and B's on your report card.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, in the elementary schools, the teachers--your--all your teachers were black, of--
Speaker 2: I only had two teachers.
Speaker 1: Two teachers; there was only (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--from grade one through seven (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--One through seven?
Speaker 2: --because one teacher, Miss Asher (ph.), Tacora (ph.); we call her Asher but it was Tacora Williams, she taught everything--math, English, social studies, English, whatever it was, she taught it.  We were in one room, and you had two grades.  Does that make sense?
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: One room, two grades.  And you--she'd throw a book at you and say, "Well, open it."  Well, by the way, the books came from the white schools; we got their second-hand books.  They would mark through, and then you'd put your name on 'em.
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And they were outdated, and some were really worn; some of the pages were missin', but that's what the city did right then; they didn't understand that colored kids should have the best, and Mr.--Professor Nuckolls wasn't gonna say much 'cause he was ready to retire.  But our band was great; we won all kind of awards.  Basketball team was good.
Speaker 1: So, you entered first grade (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Of the white school system.
Speaker 1: Well, was, was still an elementary school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Booker T. Washington--okay, Booker T. Washington, yes, I entered.
Speaker 1: (Laughter). And I'm trying to get the time line, the year you would have been six, so that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I was six and a half 'cause see, my birthday is February, and they had a ruling that you, you had to be what--six by the end of December, so I missed it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so, I was a little older than some of the other students.  And I was also a tall child, always tall.
Speaker 1: So, you had alluded to the fact that you didn't know that you should get A's or B, but what kinda student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I thought I was good; I enjoyed reading.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--What did you like to read?
Speaker 2: We all--we had Dick and Jane, of course, the white books--Dick and Jane and Spot--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --went up the hill and I don't remember anything about Black History; I don't think we taught--I, I'm pretty sure we didn't 'cause, see, we had the white books--no.  But the teachers were great friends with my mother [Ruth Jennings Franklin], so if I was not gonna do my homework, or if I had some issues, soon as I got home, my mother would say, "Hey, you're in trouble."  I just--and they didn't have cell phones back then, but they sure found a way to get the communication back to your parents that you, you didn't do your homework, or you acted up, or you talked too much in class, or you giggled too much, or you were messing with somebody.  So, the principal--'member I told you about Professor Nuckolls?  He had a little cane, he'd come right down, and in front of everybody, he'd whip your little legs.  You know, you could touch--you could almost kill children back in our grade (laughter); it was no issues at all.  You had--they expected it; parents expected the teachers and the principal to discipline their children, they--it was expected.
Story_ID: 98690
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of community did you come from?
Speaker 2: Ashland, Kentucky's small. People either worked in the iron mill.  Armco Steel was really popular back then; some kind of left and worked in the coal mines, most of my friends, they're, they're family people.  They had what they call hourly jobs--they cleaned kitchens, they were cooks, they even did the railroad because actually, I lived on Railroad Street, and the train went right by our house four times a day; we could always tell what time it was 'cause the train would go through.  Some of the conductors; they were, they were our people that we knew.  One was a pretty good friend, and typically as a train came through, if we knew, we'd stand out there; he'd throw a ham or turkey and, you know, and we knew where that meat came from, but back then, we just thought that was part of the, the, the goodness of everything.  They would--they were the Pullman fellows, and they were all from Ashland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's our community.
Story_ID: 98691
Speaker 1: Did you participate in any extra-curricular activities?
Speaker 2: I did only the things that the girls were supposed to do, see; I'm back in--back in that day where the girls did home ec [home economics], and the fellows went to shop, or whatever--there was another name for shop, but they could work with hammers and nails.  The girls had to do home ec; you had to make a skirt, you had to make a blouse, you had to learn to make bread, make biscuits--had the little kitchen, and of course, we had a young lady who taught home ec, and we had the old-fashion sewing machines that you, you know, pushed with your feet.  The guys, they did their thing in shop; they made whatever.  We weren't even allowed to go in there.  The guys could take chemistry; girls don't take chemistry.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: We did sorta have a kind of an innovative teacher who actually was in music and had studied at [The] Juilliard [School, New York City, New York]--a beautiful lady.  She would teach music to any of us who wanted to sing, and if we wanted to stay after, she was right there with us; that was Miss Johnson.  She was also a good friend of my great-aunt, and she was also the person that would love to shop with my aunt.  'Member, I said I was in the back seat?
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: She never married, beautiful--I mean probably to this day, and I think she's about 101--still plays the piano, and is still considered one of the best piano players in the whole Southeast.  She actually taught a young lady from Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia]--Miss Johnson, who's now over at Spellan, she was one of her teachers; she came into Kentucky to learn from her.  So, I mean--I, I think sometimes my education was certainly slighted, but other times, we had some great, great teachers that, again, if we weren't doin' right, our parents knew about it real quick, so you gon' straighten up.  And even though we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So, did you take music?  Do you take music?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I tried but I can't sing a lick, had no ear, but my sister did, and my sister plays very well, and also can carry a tune; I can't do either one-a those, but I tried; I just didn't have it in me.  Now, I excelled in the home ec part where (unclear) had to make the skirt, the blouse (unclear).  I've made suits, I was really very good, and thought one day that I would be somethin' in fashion design.  But that's another story 'cause I had a, a white teacher later who kinda looked at me and said, "That won't be work for you."
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Now I know what she meant.  Back then, it, it, it didn't hit me.
Story_ID: 98692
Speaker 1: So you only had two teachers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Two teachers in the colored school, Booker T. Washington [High School, Ashland, Kentucky], until I went to the white junior high school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --then, education was the way it should be, where you had a homeroom teacher, then you had a separate teacher for math and you had a teacher for this and that.  So then, I start to realize people are putting your name on a board and they're putting your grade up there, and I said, "I don't want to see."  And I kept saying, "Well, how do you get an A?"  And something in me just said, "I want all A's," so I just started to study, and the more I studied, the teacher said, "Emm, this is a interesting little colored girl; we can give her a little bit more work."  So, back then they had what they call classes, you know, grade 1, 2, 3; you're, you're good, you're fair, or you're poor.  I got put into the good very quickly, and actually, when I graduated from high school, I was number 13 outta 600-and-somethin' students, which was quite unheard of back then because they expected most little colored folks just to slide through.  But I enjoyed school back then.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 2: Paul G. Blazer High School, one of the wealthiest people in the city of Ashland.
Speaker 1: Paul G.--
Speaker 2: Blazer, B-L-A-Z-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he was one of the wealthiest people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--the wealthiest of white people in the city and, I guess, donated money or land, so they named the school after him.
Speaker 1: Hmm, interesting.  So, tell me about your teachers.
Speaker 2: They were all white, and I went into the white schools.
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Many of them were pretty distant, many of them did not think they should put out too much because, again, a small town--they knew everybody; they didn't know my parents, so they didn't feel any kinship to make sure I did anything.  But I just kind of felt it on my own, and started to ask for more work, ask to take some of the algebra classes and try to advance, and a few kind of said, "Okay, we'll let her in and see if she makes it."  And when I made it, they had to accept me, or my name got on the board that I was getting A's; they had to accept that, so--and if you want to know any of those teachers, I don't think I can remember any of their names--
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--Okay.
Speaker 2: --I really don't think so.
Speaker 1: Was there--well, even if you don't remember their names, was there one that might have even encouraged you in any way?
Speaker 2: Very good question.  Maybe the school counselor; I would say she probably did--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --'cause I know at one time I, I told one of the--I must have told her that I was interested in medicine.  I had seen on TV a piece about Johns Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland], and where was it, and I went to the library and, you know, did some research and "Oooh, wow, they're doing a lotta things with, you know, innovative stuff; I, I wonder how I can get there."  And I remember telling her that, and then one day there was a recruiter from Johns Hopkins Nursing School, called and said, "Our school needs a very bright colored child; do you have anybody?"  She called me.
Story_ID: 98693
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the counselor--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes. Who--
Speaker 1: In the Johns Hopkins [School of Nursing, Baltimore, Maryland] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Hopkins--
Speaker 1: Hopkins, I'm sorry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--in Baltimore, yeah.  So she [Lottier's high school counselor] remembered our conversation; she remembered that I was interested in nursing, so we clicked, so--and I wasn't--I usually--I rarely miss school, but that day I was home sick; she calls me at home and says, "I know you're not feelin' well, Pat, but can I have this lady from Johns Hopkins talk to you right now on the phone?"  So, I, I said, "Hello," and, you know, had a fever, I don't know what--sore throat.  The lady said, "We need a nice young lady like you."  I remember she didn't say colored, she said, "Nice young, smart lady, and don't you want to go into nursing?"  And I said, "Yes, but Johns Hopkins; I don't have any money."  She said, "Don't worry about it, don't worry about it."  She said, "I'm gonna leave my name and I'm gonna leave everything with your counselor, and in two weeks you need to come and visit us."  Never been on a plane; they bought the plane ticket, sent me up, met me at the airport, took me for dinner, showed me the school, and I didn't see anybody else black there, but the students were very friendly.  And she said, "If you want to come to this school and your grades stay as good as they are now, you'll get a full scholarship, you'll get everything; you won't have to pay for anything."  "Boy," I said, "that sounds like a good thing."  And of course my mother [Ruth Jennings Franklin] said, "Hey, yeah, yeah, let's make this happen."  So that's where I went to nursing school--full scholarship; they even paid for me to go home, I think, two or three times a year.
Speaker 1: But this was in--was this in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a senior, so right after high school I went into nursing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay.  So what high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Paul Blazer [Paul G. Blazer High School, Ashland, Kentucky].
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought that was a junior high school so actually, you went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, the junior was called Coles, I think--
Speaker 1: Coles?
Speaker 2: --Coles Junior High School, and it was only a year and a half there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 98694
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, junior high school--since we missed that, was there anything significant that happened while you were in junior high school [Coles Junior High School, Ashland, Kentucky]?
Speaker 2: Well, junior high school is where I realized that if you got A's, your name went on the board, and I wanted my name on the board; that was junior high school, my first--my first taste of actually being in school with white--
Speaker 1: Students.
Speaker 2: --students.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was at Coles (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That was at Coles Junior High (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--and then you went to Blazer [Paul G. Blazer High School, Ashland, Kentucky] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--then I went to Blazer--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and there were a few more of us there, since it was a bigger school.  In our town, we had maybe four or five junior high schools, depending on where you lived, but there was only one high school so, of course, it was bigger.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: I finished in 1966.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 98695
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about the economy of the country with civil rights was in full swing.  Do you remember when [President John F.] Kennedy was killed?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I remember I was in my Spanish class--
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about it.
Speaker 2: --and it was advanced class, and I was probably a sophomore, I think, but it was an advanced class and there were a lot of seniors, and then they also had a group of football players, and when someone knocked on the door and said, you know, "Kennedy has been assassinated," the football players said, "Oh, boy, we can't play our game," you know; they just took it the wrong way, and some of us girls we started to cry, and we really said, "Wow," you know, "how can somebody do that?"
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: I was in Spanish class when that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were your parents political in any way?
Speaker 2: No.  In fact, my mother [Ruth Jennings Franklin] did not want anybody from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] to start any trouble; 'cause remember I told you that when desegregation happened, the little town didn't want any issues, so they said, "How do we do this quietly so the colored people don't act up like the folks are doin' in--down the South?"  'Cause they thought the people in the South were acting up; they didn't see that the white people were causing the issues (laughter); they said the colored people were trying to go places they shouldn't be--they should be happy (laughter).  And I never--I guess I laughed at it back then--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --but that's how they felt in Ashland, Kentucky, that the colored people should be delighted that they had a job, that they could work in the white person's kitchen.  Why were they trying to, to sit in a restaurant--go into Woolworth's and sit down with everybody?  That made no sense to them.
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: So, no, they were not political; they were not.  And I don't even think the ministers of the churches there were supportive of the Civil Rights Movement because everybody felt 'things are fine here in Ashland.
Speaker 1: Did your parents vote?
Speaker 2: Well, sure they voted because they got $2.00 every time they voted.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: We were back in the system where some white person would hand a stack of bills to a trusted black person and say, "Get the people to vote Democratic, and if they do, here's $2.00."  That was the whole thing; when you became--I guess it was eighteen, or was it twenty-one back there for voting--that you got your $2.00 from Mr. Rush Barrow (ph.); he was the man that had the money, and we all took the $2.00.  I remember taking the $2.00, I remember my sister took the $2.00, and I remember--of course my mother said, "Has Mr. Rush been around?"--to give us our $2.00; that was buying our vote, and we thought that was fine.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the very first time you voted?
Speaker 2: I think, but I couldn't tell you who I voted for, but I remember I got $2.00.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter), all right.
Speaker 2: And I do believe a few people got $2.00 and never voted--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --because they didn't come by to pick you up to take you to a voting place, all right?
Speaker 1: Well, how did they know?  They didn't know whether you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--They didn't know, and I don't think they cared.  Mr. Rush--I do--one of--his daughter was one of my--still is my best friend.  I don't think he kept all the money; it was just--this is what is done.  Same thing with the man who had the numbers; he'd come around, and--"What number you playing today?"  And the people would give a dollar, give $2.00; I don't think he had a computer or any kinda ledger, and when the number hit, they expected him to pay and, and he did pay; there was never any crime in our little town over issues.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 98696
Speaker 1: So, after [President John F.] Kennedy and, and [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Now, when King was assassinated, I was in nursing school in Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is--you had--you left to go to, to nursing school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Nursing school, Baltimore, Maryland, Johns Hopkins Nursing School in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Right, and so this was in--okay, in '65 [1965], all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause when King was assassinated, we were in our nursing school dorm, and once the assassination happened, and the streets of Baltimore and some other, you know, cities--northern cities and southern cities went crazy, we were well-protected because we had guards; we had white security guards because, again, this was a all-white school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you stayed at the school from '66 [1966] to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Three years.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Oh, to '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were--okay, in '68 [1968] when King was killed.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: We did not have to go out in the streets because the hospital had a tunnel that actually connected our dorm to the hospital, so we never went out.
Story_ID: 98697
Speaker 1: Well-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Once that happened.
Speaker 1: --tell me about the experience there [Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, Baltimore, Maryland]; was it--in was all-white school.
Speaker 2: Quite interesting; there was one other black student that came with me, she was from Virginia; everybody else was white.  Some of the students were from all over 'cause Hopkins thought that to be the very best, they needed students from all states.  It was sort of a cultural shock because again, I'm thrown back into a really white environment--all white teachers.  I think I sort of understood segregation a little bit more there because Hopkins being a city hospital, a well-known hospital, had two sides; they had what they call the white side, and they had the black side, and they had all the clinics where all the colored people would come and sit for hours and hours and hours and hours, and maybe still not get to see a doctor; or, if their illness appeared to be something very different where they could write 'em up in their medical book, they kind of got the front of the line or whatever.  Then they had the more sophisticated private side of the hospital where the wealthy, the people who came with their own private nurses, and they had carpet on the floors and just seemed--it was called Marburg [Hospital]; it was the elite of the elitist, and Hopkins back then was doing some of the first transsexual operations, and so they had people who supposedly were wealthy movie stars, or whatever, from foreign countries, and they had their security guards and they had police.  They got the very best.  And as students, we had to do it all; we did the clinics with all the colored people waiting to be seen with all the little babies, we did the maternity areas where there was one long hall and you had twenty beds with only a curtain separating you from the next, or you went to the private side of the hospital where it was almost like being in a hotel.
Speaker 1: So you got to work on both sides?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah; as students, we had to do it all--every bit of it.  'Cause as a student, way back then, you actually worked seven days a week, and sometimes twelve hours a day 'cause they wanted you to get the experience.
Speaker 1: Did the nurses who were working there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--They were all white nurses (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--they were all white then.
Speaker 2: The black people in the hospital were nurses aids or orderlies.  So, some of us looked at myself and my friend as, "You think you're little uppity because you got a nursing uniform on and you're getting an education."  We tried to just laugh that off, and every now and then, a few of them would say, "I'm glad you're here; we need you here."
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: So, it was fun.  And she's still my best friend today.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  Okay.  Well--so, the teachers treated you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--All white teachers.
Speaker 1: Did they treat you fairly?  Do you think you should not--some students got better grades, or did you--
Speaker 2: Well, actually, in nursing school you had to know what you were doing or it was--you just didn't make it, so I think the teacher element was out of the picture.  If they presented material to you and you learned it then you did it, it's okay; it was nobody could really push you through because in nursing school, you have to take national exams quarterly, and then at the end--I mean nobody could sit there and give you the answers.
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: So I think the teachers were fine; they probably--some of them from New York, so maybe they had been with colored people before.  I don't really remember any issues with them, I just remember--'cause also--I forgot to tell you this--I had gotten married to my husband [George Lottier], so I sorta had different perspective; my second year there I got married, so I wanted to do my work well, pass all the grades 'cause in nursing school, you had to have a C-plus or you didn't move ahead and we, unfortunately, did lose, I don't know, ten percent.  And so I got married, and my husband's family was there in Baltimore [Maryland], so the weekends I had something exciting to do--to see him, and to go over to, you know, my mother-in-law's house to get away from the dorm, and they had a huge family; there were six of them and they had aunts and uncles and all kinds of people, and they were involved in the Baltimore Afros, so it was always exciting things going on at their place.
Speaker 1: The Baltimore what?
Speaker 2: Afro-American Newspapers.
Speaker 1: Oh, newspaper (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--that's my husband's side of the family.
Speaker 1: What--what is your husband's name?
Speaker 2: George Lottier--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --and his grand--his grandfather was one of the Murphy Brothers that started the Baltimore Afro-American Newspapers.  So I just had a different perspective, you know, I was a happy camper; there were, there were really no major issues, even when I got sick and had to have an appendectomy back then.  It was like I got sick one day, didn't feel good, went to the emergency room, and since I was a Hopkins student, they took care of me right away and I was in surgery, and the surgeon says, "Okay, Pat, you'll be fine and in three days, you go back to work."  And I went back to work--three days.  So there was just no issues back then; life was good--life was wonderful.
Story_ID: 98698
Speaker 1: So, tell me what happens after--after nursing school.
Speaker 2: Since I was married, my husband [George Lottier]'s job took us to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and I had a job--'cause I was a Hopkins nurse; Hopkins nurses supposed to be great nurses so all of a sudden I went to this hospital, they threw me in charge of a 3 to 11 shift; I didn't know what I was doing but I was a [Johns] Hopkins [School of Nursing] graduate so I should--so I had one book in one hand and tried to ask the other nurses, "What do I do?  What do I do?"  It kind of worked out, you know.  You, you--when you're in charge of somebody's IV, their medication and you need to kind of know what's going on, I guess you get a inner-spirit that kind of puts you up there and says, "You're in charge, you better do it right" 'cause these--you know, the lives of these people are in your hands, and doctors come running in and--"Why wasn't this done?"  "You gotta," you know, fill--"Oh, yeah, we're gettin' it done now," even though you know the lab didn't come through, or there's a reason; you don't wanna tell the doctor it wasn't done.  Something--we were there for about a year, year and a-half, and then his company moved us to Massachusetts; first time being in the North--way up north--cold.  And I lucked out again; someone told me of a job in the city of Boston [Massachusetts] that I could be in charge of an elderly care program that was a--had a federal grant and, you know, I was gonna be the nurse, I was gonna be the manager, I was gonna do all these great things, and it was headed--it was affiliated with Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Again, I didn't know what I was doin', but I pulled the booklets aside and would read at night and say, "Okay, here I am."  And I did that for maybe two years, and then his job moved us to Pennsylvania--Lancaster, and that's where I had both of our children; I have two sons, Christopher and Shawn; they were both born in Lancaster, in '71 [1971] and '72 [1972], and that was an interesting little town--a lot of Amish people.  Again, we were in a, a neighborhood, almost like this one, where it was 90 percent white, and we did find a lot of friends, even though they were white people around us, 'cause we had small children and somebody has children you sort of have that common bond when children play--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --with children, and they realize everything is fine; you're just like them, you know, you get up in the morning, you cook, you clean your house.  So it was a good neighborhood.
Story_ID: 98699
Speaker 1: Did you work then, after you had your children, or did you stay home?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I would work sort of private duty; I really was a stay-at-home mom 'cause my husband [George Lottier] had--he was in sales and he traveled a lot, so--but they didn't have--day care wasn't really big back then, so I remember doing a little bit of private duty nursing, but I basically was a stay-home mom with them for those years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, staying at home with your kids--tell me some of the things that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That we would do?  Oh, what did we do?  We did shopping--no, we got the sewing machine out; we thought we would make drapes--we did all of the little homemaker things.  We had a little co-op where we would share baby-sitting services; instead of money, you know, you take my child for two hours and I owe you two hours of baby-sitting co-op time.  I cooked all the time, you know--biscuits from scratch, pastry from scratch--enjoyed all of that.
Speaker 1: The Amish people--what was, what was that like?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sort of inter-acted with the Amish people if you went into their markets; I didn't get to know them on a personal basis--only if you went into their markets of if you went shopping; people in my little neighborhood were folks that had small children like we had, and typically they were also maybe re-located from the university or one of the hospitals, so it was more of a career family scenario.
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: We had no issues about being black in the neighborhood.  The town of Lancaster, Pennsylvania--don't think it had any issues; if it did, everybody kept to themselves, nobody said anything.  We were only there about two or three years.
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Being very close to Baltimore [Maryland], we spent a lot of our time with my husband's family in Baltimore, so we sort of had two homes, Lancaster, and then on the weekends, we'd drive up to Baltimore so his parents could spoil our two kids, and we could have fun there 'cause we still had a lot of friends in Baltimore.
Story_ID: 98700
Speaker 1: So, after--you were there two years and then you left and went where?
Speaker 2: We went back to Boston [Massachusetts], and at this time, we moved into a bigger house, so we felt like we were making a little bit more money, you know?  A bigger house, longer drapes, more drapes (laughter), another baby-sitting co-op, a little neighborhood; had a cul-de-sac, the kids could safely ride up and down the little area in their little big wheel bikes and they all played with the little white kids; they had little swimming pools in the backyard, the above-ground kind.  Everybody was fine; we played cards with the neighbors, my husband [George Lottier] took up golf and they would play.  It was a nice little family; no issues in the little town called Marlborough, Massachusetts--no issues whatsoever.  We may have--I think we stayed there maybe four years, and moved over and bought a little bigger house because we thought we had a little bit more money and wanted a little bit more space.
Speaker 1: You said your husband was a salesman?
Speaker 2: Yeah, with Dixie Cup--the Dixie Cup people--Dixie Marathon--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so he traveled a lot, so the neighborhood was really important, especially the baby-sitting co-op and knowing some of the other ladies.  You go bowling together, you go to the movies.  I also went back to school; that's right, I went back to get a master's--no, my bachelor's degree up there.  So I had a few friends--so I did that part-time, you know; took some more courses, sort of made a plan to say, "Okay, when the kids really are independent, then if I've got a master's in something, I don't have to go back to the hospital and deal with those doctors who thought they were sent from God.
Speaker 1: So, you got your bachelor's degree at what school?
Speaker 2: In Connecticut.
Speaker 1: In Connecticut?
Speaker 2: Yes, Western (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--What school?
Speaker 2: Western Connecticut State University [Danbury, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: And what year was this?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow; I'd have to go and look.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Can't remember.  We were in Connecticut then, and I--it might of been 1980 'cause we--I believe we moved to Atlanta [Georgia] in 1983 or '82 [1982]; we moved here in '82 [1982], so I guess I got my degree in 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were in da--were you in--you went to school in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I was in--Danbury.
Speaker 1: Danbury, Connecticut.
Speaker 2: Somewhere--you see, from Massachusetts, we moved to Connecticut.  We were in Massachusetts twice, really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Went Lancaster, Massachusetts, Connecticut; New Jersey for maybe three months.  In those days, if you were in sales and you were doing well, they give you bigger territory and you could move, and it was great to move because when you moved, there was a company that would come in that would pack everything for you, and you could stay in a hotel for a couple of weeks, and the kids loved it 'cause they could swim and, you know, call for room service, and all that was paid for.  They just thought they were big-time rich kids; it was fun back then.
Speaker 1: So, you get your bachelor's--
Speaker 2: In Connecticut.
Speaker 1: --in Connecticut, and then you move again.
Speaker 2: From Connecticut, we moved--this is our last--yeah, to Atlanta, Georgia, and I think it was 1981 or '82 [1982] we moved to Atlanta.  George was now Product Manager for Dixie Cup for the Southeast, so we came.
Story_ID: 98701
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you go back to school again?
Speaker 2: I go back; I, I don't know how I found it but it--said, "Okay, every university is here, huh, maybe they'll take some of my other credits" 'cause after I got my BS, I was still taking other courses.  Went to Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia]--big campus, big campus, and out of the blue--I think sometimes luck is on my side--I go up to a table and there was a very distinguished black person, and he said, "What do you need?"  And I kind of smiled.  He said, "Come here and sit down, let's see what you're trying to do."  I said, "Well, I think I want a master's, and I think I might want public health, and I'm looking at the cost and I don't think I can afford all of this kind of money."  This is a--Emory had their Masters of Public Health Program there; it was the second year of the program, and I said, "If I had that, with my nursing degree," and he said, "Don't say anymore."  He went someplace, he came back, he said, "I'm gonna give you a scholarship, young lady."  And I did just what you're doin', I'm thinking, 'huh?'  He said, "If you have a degree from Johns Hopkins [University School of Nursing, Baltimore, Massachusetts] and you want this," and I know he didn't say it--because a long story short, I went back to Emory for two years and got my master's in public health.  Later--four years later, I meet this same man, and his whole issue, just like it was with Hopkins, they needed some people of color in the program, and I happened to walk in at the right time.  Dr. Herman Reese was his name; he's still in Atlanta, and each time I see him, I say, "You helped me get through a time where I didn't have enough money to pay."  And he laughs and he says, "That's why I was there."  He has since retired.
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: So I did that, and after I finished, I wrote a thesis about health care for low-income blacks in the state of Georgia; that didn't go too well.  The professor who read it said, "Oh, you've got some wild ideas; this'll never happen," so he just kind of looked at it and gave me a C.
Story_ID: 98702
Speaker 1: But I, I finished, and I think--I guess I looked in the newspaper; I don't know how I found this job, but DeKalb County [Georgia] needed a director for the sickle cell education program.  I said, "I can do that; I know about sickle cell, and if I don't, I can read about it real quick, and I'm black."  I did that for the health department for about a year, but wasn't very happy 'cause it was, it was too much of the white people trying to tell black people what to do; it was just kind of frustrating over there--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and I kept sayin' "If I could spend time educating the parents about their rights, what they can do, I could make a difference.  It was so much paperwork, and you just had to see people and say, "Get 'em out."  It was frustrating, so I started to look for other things and ended up leaving DeKalb County, even though I really wanted to stay to make a difference, but they weren't ready for me, or I wasn't ready for their way of doing health care, and actually went to a company called Baxter International; they had a position for someone to, to run actually, the operation center for--Baxter does IV therapy drugs; they do--if you're in a hospital today, they're still in that same business.  Anything that comes through in the IV, that's probably manufactured by Baxter out of Illinois, but they--they needed someone with a nursing background and a management background, and I kind of had both, to be their operations manager, and I did that for four years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Good money, beautiful stock options.  Didn't necessarily, after a while, care for it, because AIDS was really becoming a major public health issue, and I started to see how those who had good insurance, who had the money, were getting service.  Those, and they were our people, who just didn't know how to work the system, were staying in the hospital and weren't getting any of the medication they should have because Bax--all those kinda companies--if the insurance company is gonna pay, you're gonna get the best; if the insurance company doesn't pay, you'll go to (unclear), and you'll wait, and maybe you won't get the medication in time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You got your bachelor's degree in--
Speaker 1: Connecticut.
Speaker 2: No.  What type of degree?
Speaker 1: In nursing.
Speaker 2: Nursing?
Speaker 1: Bachelor of Science in Nursing.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And your masters was in public (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Public health.
Speaker 2: Okay, great.  So, what happens after Baxter?
Speaker 1: Oh, Baxter bought a few companies, they did a couple mergers, and all of a sudden I had an older, white gentleman who looked at me and said, "You're nothing but a nurse; I don't know how you got this job."  Yeah.  I mean he was--he--his name was Bruce; Bruce would say what he felt at any time.  I remember when Bruce first took over as the regional manager for the company; we had a Christmas party at his house.  He had all kinds of sex toys there that he was giving away as little gifts.  None of us knew it was wrong, we--it was odd that nobody said anything 'cause, again, this was the time where salespeople were very important to hospitals and doctors, and extremely important; the amount of money that went back and forth over some of those deals was amazing; the perks that certain doctors would get if they would prescribe certain drugs from a certain drug dealer or drug company, the vacations those doctors could take; a lot of issues back then--probably still going on somewhat, but the sexism part and the interesting way that Bruce wanted to treat nurses versus--and the salespeople were men, of course.  And I just didn't--it just, it just got against me, and I couldn't talk to him, so I called someone at corporate in, in, in Deerfield [Illinois] and said, "You got two choices; you give me a great severance package or I'll find a lawyer that'll talk to me."  And the HR person said, "Don't worry, don't say another word."  And within, I guess--I don't know, three or four days, I got a really nice severance package, got some stock out of it and I think I got six months-worth of--and to me, that was a lot back then--six months of full benefits, salary and some stock, to say, "bye, we enjoyed you; you can go on."  And at that time, I said, "What do I do with my life?"  That was forty, I believe.
Story_ID: 96996
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now in 1980--what is it--six [1986], '87 [1987] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Eighty-Seven [1987]; well, '86 [1986], yeah; I bought the Atlanta Tribune from another person, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay, tell me, tell me about that story.
Speaker 2: Okay, 1986 was the first issue of the Atlanta Tribune; a young man by the name of Kermit Thomas--and I believe Kermit came from St. Louis and decided that he had an idea of making a magazine all about black people, and have it more on the positive side versus, you know, the negative of, of murders and uninteresting what he called details.  So, in '86 [1986], he started the Tribune--had the idea; went to a few advertisers, ran into my husband George [Lottier] at, I call it a bar, someplace; and again, see, George's background with his family being one of the Murphy's that started the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper chain [The Afro-American Newspapers] that was like in Baltimore [Maryland], Washington [D.C.], Richmond [Virginia], Birmingham [Alabama], someone said, "You should meet George if you're interested in knowing more about newspapers 'cause his family is the Murphys."
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: They talked; now, George didn't really know much about it 'cause again, George was always in sales, and when he lived in Baltimore, I think he--well, I know he delivered the paper, he would go into the office 'cause his mother and father were very much involved with the Baltimore Afro, but as far as knowing what to do from A to Z, that wasn't necessarily what he was all about, but he was a business person so he listened to Kermit and Kermit said, "Well, I can do this, I can do that, I just need some extra money; I just need some investment, I need to be able to pay writers," so George lent him some money.  And to this day, you know, I don't even know how much money that was, but within--so, okay, he lent him the money and then Kermit said, "I want somebody that Atlanta [Georgia] does not know to be on the first cover of the Atlanta Tribune; George, you're that person," 'cause we'd only lived here about two years.  So, the typical Atlantan person that somebody might put on a first cover is (unclear) old time I've always been in Atlanta, I know everybody and everybody loves me.  He said, "I don't want that, I want a brand new fresh face since this magazine is gonna be a fresh magazine."  George said, "Fine."  So he was on the cover of the first copy of the Atlanta Tribune, and within three months, I think, or three issues, Kermit could not pay George any of the money back that he had borrowed or invested, couldn't even produce a copy of the third issue, you know; he was--couldn't pay writers, couldn't pay rent, and admitted that.  George said, "Hmm, what are we gonna do?"  Kermit said, "It's yours."  So George comes in and said, "We now have a newspaper, Pat," and I'd left Baxter [International].  I said, "Well, what do you know about running a newspaper, George?"  "Well, let's call my uncle Johnny," or "my uncle whatever in Baltimore; maybe they'll give us some advice."  I said, "Okay, you got a printing press?"  He said, "No."  "Do you have some writers?"  "Well, I have the few that Kermit used but he owes 'em money, they're not gonna work."  I said, "Okay, let's just have a little meeting (unclear) these few people"--there might been five or six, and they all agreed to stay on if George paid them what Kermit owed them, so we did.  The editor stayed--both editors stayed. Senior editor and executive editor and one or two writers, and another young lady stayed, and George went off to work.  I said, "What in the world am I gonna do?"  So, again, I said, "Hey, work hard, figure it out; somethin's gonna happen, right?"  So I told the folks, "I don't know anything about running a newspaper; I don't know anything about writing--I got a degree in nursing, and I can take your temperature and I can tell you about your medications," and they kind of said, "Okay, we can make this happen," and it was a good team, and it worked.

Speaker 1: And within, I don't know, two, three years--even Atlanta Journal Constitution came out to my little office, which is here in Roswell, and had interviews there.  How can this person who knew nothing about newspapers, came from the North--'cause I'm not an Atlantan person--cover black people in Atlanta [Georgia]?  It, it worked, you know.  I had an editor who made sure nothing was misspelled, we made sure the pictures were clean and clear and pretty, and that the magazine was in places where people could see it.  I can remember, back then, going non-stop, morning breakfast at Paschal's to meet people and give 'em copies of the Tribune, going to a lunch at the Hyatt giving out copies of the Atlanta Tribune, then that evening going to an Atlanta business meeting giving out copies of the magazine.  And people said, "This is great; nobody else is doing this."  The Atlanta Journal Constitution and the Atlanta--what was the evening paper; well, they were--one was Constitution, one was the Journal.  They rarely put information in the newspapers about positive things that black businesspeople were doing; they had stuff, of course--you know, Maynard Jackson was the mayor, so they would put his stuff in every now and then, but the other businesspeople who were making a difference, they didn't cover it.  TV stations only wanted to cover if someone were shooting somebody else; the positive things or the positive stories that black Atlantans were doing, nobody was thinking about putting it in print. We did; we became--and then there were--now, I must say, there were other newspapers in Atlanta at the same time; the Atlanta Daily World, I think it's almost what seventy-six, seventy-eight years old; it's always been around.  They had--their, their--Alexis' [Alexis Scott, HM] father [W.A. Scott III] was very much into, let me do it my way, and it was a new day.  People didn't understand about typesetting; I mean it was okay if lines went crooked or pictures were too dark, they accepted it; we didn't.  We had some of the newest typesetting equipment, and it was really just on a computer at that time, to make sure lines were straight, photos were clear.  I can remember calling the printer when I thought he made some of the pictures a little too dark.  And he said to me, "Well, girlie, it's black people and their skin tones are different."  I said, "If you want to keep our business, you will look at every page to make sure the picture we give you stays that color," and they did after I fussed and would scream over the phone--they did.  So, we had good staff; we still have a good staff.  So, that's what happened; that's how I inherited, quote, the Atlanta Tribune fell in my lap because Kermit Thomas said, "Huh, I give up; I'm going off to something else, another venture."
Story_ID: 96998
Speaker 1: Okay, and working with your staff, that's how you learned how to run the business.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you the one who ran the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I was--right, I was the PR person, I was the, the money person to say, "If you have this amount to pay writers, and you have this amount to pay a printing bill, and you're getting this amount from advertising, the numbers have to match."  You can't, you cannot be negative, you cannot have money to pay--and not have money to pay a photographer 'cause they're not gonna come back the next month if you still owe them money, so you have to balance it out.  I think, for the first three years, I never took a salary 'cause I was lucky; George--his business was doing fine so he was able, you know, he paid for all of our benefits and I didn't have to worry about quote lots of money for me, so I didn't take a salary.  And actually, I rented part of his office, so I wasn't paying overhead for lights and utility and a mortgage at that point.
Speaker 1: So your whole staff worked in that office?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh, but we had some freelance writers, so they would work at home.  But we had about three--we had three people that was there.  In fact, George's secretary I shared with him, so she did some of our work and I didn't have to pay her.  So, creatively, I was able to make the business work until advertising started to, to bring in the money, and as it came in, we added more staff and we would do more things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Even today, you use freelance writers, is that right?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Most magazines will use some freelance writers because a, a freelancer may have a special skill; we use Hal Lamar a lot 'cause he knows a lot about Black Atlanta, and then he's got that history; he doesn't have to always go the book and try to look up, 'okay, what did Jesse Hill [Jr.] do?'  You know, he's got the history, he's been here forever and ever, so we still use some freelancers.  We have a staff of eight, full-time, and then my editor may have three to four solid freelancers that she knows when she needs them and she can call them and assign 'em their work.
Speaker 1: I noticed that some magazines allow people to write articles, and I, I went online and I, I saw that someone could submit an article and the criteria is very stringent; I mean you really expect a good article, and you do that so that--for--I mean why do you do that?
Speaker 2: Well, my editors--all my editors--I've had--and, in fact, this year, we're celebrating twenty years of publishing; I think I've had six editors during that time, and each one of them has their own way of running an editorial staff, and they all want to produce a quality product, so in order to produce a quality product, you have to have some high standards.
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: You have to put on paper what you expect of people so they know what they need to give you, and then if you decide, "I'm not gonna use you anymore," you can actually point, "Well, hey, here's second paragraph of our guidelines; you're not meeting those guidelines, you know; you're, you're not submitting the stuff the way we want it, so, you know, we're not here to just help you get a job.  We've got to deal with our readers who expect a high-quality product."
Speaker 1: And they do and, and they get it every, every month.  It is a monthly magazine.
Speaker 2: It's monthly, yeah; we've always been monthly.  At one time, we were what we call a news magazine--tabloid size, printed on news print.  Then, as being sorta--well, actually, the year 2000, when everybody said, "In the new millennium what are you gonna do differently?"  We sort of sat, talked, and what we thought we would do differently is be what we really are, a magazine--magazine-size, magazine paper; because way back, people thought, 'Okay, you're a newspaper, I've gotten--my daughter is getting married next week, will you put her picture in your newspaper?'  We're not that; we're more of talking about the business maybe that your daughter owns; it's a little different for a black female, or it's a successful business, or it's a family-run business that's doing great things.  So we had to--when we changed ourselves in 2000 to look like a magazine--and we actually say, Atlanta Tribune: The Magazine to help the public understand we're a magazine.  If you need newspaper services, there are other people in town that do a good job that can help you, but we're a magazine more like a mini Black Enterprise.
Story_ID: 96999
Speaker 1: The look of the magazine [Atlanta Tribune: The Magazine] is--it's, it's a gloss finish, not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It's a gloss finish, yeah--magazine stock, they call it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--finish style, yeah.  And has it always been that way?
Speaker 2: It really has; I think that was one thing when I bought the maga--the newspaper, that I realized, okay, desktop publishing, what they used to call it back then, anybody can do it.  But I said, "No, you gotta have a graphic look, so you need to have somebody that's trained in graphics."  So we were probably one of the very, very first black publications that hired somebody who had a degree in graphic design.  And I remember they were freelancers, they were part-time--they weren't full-time, but they're the ones that always set the stage to say, "You know, here's a design; I learned this in school, this is how you relate it to a magazine."  They were always the ones that kind of dealt with photographers, even; a photographer takes a great picture, but sometimes photographers don't understand how the background needs to be because it's gonna be laid out in such-and-such fashion.  So I know we were really the very first black publication that used people for their title.  I don't take photos--I'm not trained in photography, I don't write stories, I'm not an English major.  I don't design the magazine because I don't have a graphic design degree; I didn't study it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you do what you do best.
Speaker 2: I--That's what--we all hope that I'm more of the community relations person, I'm the business manager, I'm the one that looks for new business development.  Like when the Internet became popular, we were really one of the first newspapers in this area to really have a website to say--not everybody's gonna pick up a magazine; why not have a way for them to go online?  Why not have content there?  Make it interactive.  We were one of the very first to do, you know, paid subscription drives where if you do this, you get a premium, you might win a trip to Florida; we--that's part of what I do, look for different things to excite our readers, to keep them entertained, keep 'em interested.
Speaker 1: So how do you go about looking for the businesses and the people that you highlight in your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--They, they really, really come to us; there are a condrey (ph.) of public relations agencies that just search the web all the time looking for publications; they have a client, they want this client profiled, they come to us, you know, they constantly keep knocking on the door.  "Well, my client just did this, my client got this award.  Come and visit my client; my client is doing this, my client gave to the Boys and Girls Club; my client, my client."  Typically, after a while, an editor is gonna say, "Okay, let me see something about your client."  And when you look into that client, sometimes you do see, yes, they've made a major difference.  They're in Gwinnett [County, Georgia], which typically, black people don't have large businesses in Gwinnett, but here's a black-owned business in Gwinnett makin' a difference.  And yeah, we will profile 'em then.  So, they typically come to us.  I may find somebody if I'm out and about and like, when I have a business card--my business card does not even have my title on it, so if I'm meeting you for the first time and you ask for a business card, it's gonna say, "Pat Lottier, Atlanta Tribune" and, hopefully, if you've heard of the Atlanta Tribune, say, "Oh, sure, yes, yes, I think I've seen it, I've read it once or twice."  But you don't necessarily come to me and say, "Well, you put my business on the cover of your magazine because we make"--which that conversation doesn't start because they don't really know what I do if they don't know me, so I have an opportunity to talk to them and figure out, hmm, business in Gwinnett; possible story.  So then I may say who I am or, on the other side, 'cause I'm also the money person, if it's an advertising opportunity and I'm talking to you, I'll put my sales hat on and say, "Well, my sales manager really needs to talk to you; you're building a subdivision three blocks from such-and-such area and I know you need to advertise in a magazine to get your customers."  And they'll shake their head like you're doing, and they'll await a call, and I'll have my sales manager or one of the salespeople actually make a call, and sometimes they do sell, which is a good thing, and they become one of our clients.  That's why I don't put my title on my business card.
Story_ID: 97000
Speaker 1: I know that you also are very involved in many organizations in Atlanta [Georgia].  What are some of the organizations?
Speaker 2: I am.  I think when I--again, I moved to Atlanta, didn't really know the lay of the land, my sister's in College Park but she's in education; she's always taught second grade for what--twenty-six years?  But people said if you really want to know what happens, you need to get involved with some groups, so I--let's see, I'm a member of the [National Coalition of] 100 Black Women, I was a member of the Links for a short time; some of their--their issues are fine, I enjoy what they do, but their meetings were very demanding; I don't really need somebody to tell me on Saturday at 2:00 I need to show up for a brunch--or 12; I'm just not that kind of person.  I want to make my time, I don't want you always make it for me.  But I did make great contacts at the Link.  I also was in Leadership Atlanta, early on in my career, which would have been '91 [1991], and met a lot of people, learned about the city--great friends, great relationships, understood--I started to understand how the city and the politics and the business worked within the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Who were some of the people that was in the Leadership Atlanta (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Leader--my Leadership Atlanta class?  Mark O'Connell, who is now President of the United Way; actually, he has now moved out here, to Roswell [Georgia]; I met Mark there.  I met Sarah Gonzalez with the [Georgia] Hispanic Chamber--she's now president.  Oh, I met people from Georgia Pacific, I met the CEO of Grady Hospital--the old CEO; he's no longer there.  Leadership Atlanta allowed me to understand how the city work, and when I--what was fascinating, one of our projects--you had a couple you could choose from, but my project was to ride in a police car for a entire shift, so I picked the 3 to 11 shift, and I rode the side--here's the policeman on this side, I'm on the other, and I'm listening to all the calls; they were going on calls and just to be with him and to get his perspective of what it means to be a policeman in the city of Atlanta; just those things behind the scenes, and of course, we toured the Water Treatment Plant, we toured the General Motors facility where they used to make--I guess they still make the Chevy for a short time, before they close it down.  But just to understand what else happens.  The president of Boys and Girls Club was in my Leadership Atlanta class; it was a good opportunity, and it helped me understand that there was so much I did not know about the city, and that it was a fun city to live in and the city that I really wanted to stay.  I told my husband [George Lottier] if he ever left, he'd had to just kinda commute back and forth 'cause I was not gonna leave Atlanta.
Story_ID: 97001
Speaker 1: He [George Lottier] started his own business, you said.
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: What kind of business was it?
Speaker 2: Plastic cups.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a sales--he was in sales and marketing for Dixie Cup, you know, they make the small plastic cup, all sizes, so he had an opportunity.  Another person said, "Well, let's go in a joint venture, own our own plant, and actually make the cups, and we sell 'em direct."  And he had learned a lot from Dixie, and left with them saying, "Hey, that sounds like a good idea; in fact, we may give you a contract."  And they did; he had a contract with Hardee's, and did their stadium cups, you know, the kind that people would--way back when people would really get excited and save stadium cups?  I think we throw 'em away now.  So he did that for probably four to five years, and then he said, "Okay, I've done that, been there."  The magazine [Atlanta Tribune: The Magazine] was doing well, so he said, "Hmm, what else will I do?"  I was very much active with a group called Georgia Minorities Survivor Development Council [GMSDC]; it's a group that sort of found solid black businesses and certified to make sure that they were what they said.  You know, any of us can hang up a shingle and say, "I make widgets" (ph.), but maybe I'm not making the widgets; there's somebody else behind the scenes, who's white, that's making the widgets and I'm the front person, but GMSDC certifies to make sure they are what they say they are, they understand good business practices, and they have education, so--because it moves the business to another level, too, you know.  I may start making only a hundred widgets, but the economies of scale say that if I make a million widgets, I'm making more money, I'm employing more people, and I'm an asset to the community.  So they have educational programs to, to help businesses develop.  So I was a member, and I would talk about, "Well, you know, we can't seem to get people from Coca-Cola or Georgia Pacific, or Georgia Power, some of these other companies, totally committed to the program," and one day he said, "Oh, you need to stop fussing about it; let me go to a meeting."  And since he came from the business background, he said, "Well, you need to look at it two ways; Georgia Power has their needs, and the black businessperson has their needs; they're not the same.  However, there's a way to make everybody kind of be happy and come to the table, and you can have some positive relationships."  Their executive director just wasn't working well with the board, and actually, I was on the committee to search for a new executive director.  We searched, we interviewed, and there was either people who would say, "Okay, you're not paying enough money, I don't want the job," or "I'll take the job for a while, but I'm really gonna do somethin' else."  So we had all kinds of issues with everybody we interviewed, and I was probably at home, you know, telling George this, and he said, "I'll volunteer for a while 'til you find somebody."  And he actually volunteered for close to three to six months before even bein' paid.  He had such a pleasant personality, and he was--and, and the old executive director had really done some sour things, so you've got corporate members on one hand saying, "I don't know if I'm gonna renew my membership," then minority businesses on the other hand sayin', "I don't see what it's--what your group is doing for me; I don't know if I'm coming back."  And they were housed at the Atlanta Chamber sharing space.  So when George was there, he kind of looked at all the little facets, you know, the Chamber saying, "Stay here under us, we'll take care of you--black people still not knowing what you need to do; you know, we'll handle it, and it looks good that we've got you right here."  But--so, a few of the corporate people and George said, "No, we need to be independent."  And so he helped them find a location, he kind of helped work through the politics of the Chamber all of a sudden losing one of their children, and it's been six years, and I think after maybe six months, they offered him a job full-time and he thought about and said, "Why not?  I can do it."  He's been there for six years making a difference.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--And tell me the name of the organization again.
Speaker 2: Georgia Minority Supplier Development Council; it's part of a national group called the National Minority Supplier Development Council--out of New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--And I'm still a member, but I'm not on the board.  Bein' on the board would be too close to him right now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 97002
Speaker 1: So, what other organizations?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see, DeCab Chamber--DeKalb Chamber, the Atlanta Chamber; don't do as much with them, but we do help support what they do, Sickle Cell Foundation; did go back to Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And I'm on--called Emory's advisory board, which means sort of being an advocate to if you find a talented black student, make sure the black student knows about Emory, and if they want to ask about your experience--'cause I did spend two and a-half years there.  What other groups am I involved in?  The Herndon Foundation, Herman Russell [HM].  I guess he and Dr. [Edward] Irons [HM] one day, I don't know, 'cause we've had 'em all in our magazine from time-to-time, and I do know them and respect him and have asked his advice on several things.  He called me one day and said, "I know you don't know that much about the Herndon Foundation, but would you like to join our board because we need some new blood."  You're familiar with the Herndon Home?
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, I've been on their board for probably three years, trying to make a difference, trying to figure out a way on the marketing side to get the home--people know about the home, but people don't necessarily donate nor visit the home, so trying to drum up creative ways to get the Atlanta community and really the new people who come into Atlanta, 'cause if you've been here all your life, you understand about Alonzo Herndon and his, his claim to fame and the fact he built a home way back when, when black people weren't building such grand homes, and it's still in--it, it, it's, it's in decent shape, but it does need some restoration, and restoration means money.  And the home, it has never had a marketing plan, it's never done any outreach to say, "Make a donation," sort of been status quo; it's there, it'll be there, but old homes need actually more care than new homes, so I'm, I'm one-of their trustees, and I think that's it.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Did you (unclear) the Jack and Jill Foundation?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, we did Jack and Jill.  When we first moved to Atlanta, in order to, to help our boys sort of assimilate and meet other people, we joined Jack and Jill.  There's a Jack and Jill up north, Suburban of Atlanta.  There's--I--and it's four chapters now, so we joined.  My oldest son Chris enjoyed the program, enjoyed the relationships, all the activities; my younger son said, "I can't stand it, I am not going to a Saturday meeting with these kids; they don't--we don't talk the same talk, I don't like it."  So I, you know, I said, "That's fine, Shawn, you don't have to."  So, he went off and was smiling and went to play soccer and was just as tickled, so I dropped out of the group (laughter) when my older son graduated.
Story_ID: 97003
Speaker 1: What are your, your plans for the future, you know, issues of the newspaper?
Speaker 2: The magazine (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--The magazine, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: It's a very good question, and I think it's all evolving, we're all thinking, it's twenty years old this, this April, and I think at different milestones there's always something that you need to do.  If you keep doing what you have done, I don't think you keep your readers interested--you're stagnant; so every five years, we always have a celebration; we did one at age five, when we were five years old.  William Tolliver did a wonderful commemorative painting for us at five, and we had a beautiful event at Atlanta Medical Center, in fact, and that's when I really first met Maynard Jackson.  He came to the reception after everything was over with; he went straight to the buffet table.  I have a picture of him doing that, and I remember walking up saying, "Mr. Jackson, thank you so much for stopping by, I know you're so busy."  He said, "You got the best food that I've had all day; who was the caterer?"  And we started--Nate Goldston [Nathaniel R. Goldston, III, HM] was the caterer.  He started talking 'bout how Nate--remember when Nate used to carry the pans from his own kitchen to his--.  He said, "Hey, you're doin' a good job; yeah, yeah, I've seen your newspaper--very good job.  I'm glad you invited me.  Anytime you got good food, make sure I know about it."
Story_ID: 97004
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talkin' about the celebration and about (unclear)--talking about the good food that you have at your celebration, so--
Speaker 2: He [Mayor Maynard Jackson] also said, you know, "You're doing a good job."  He said, "I know it's difficult; advertisers don't necessarily believe that you're reaching the audience they need, but you are, and if I can help in any way, just call on me."  So--and we did; at our 10th anniversary, we had a few of our supporters do a short vignette, nothin' long like this, and Maynard was the first one to say, "Come on down, 'cause I love what Pat Lottier and her staff is doing with that magazine."  So he gave a beautiful, beautiful--I still have his piece today, where he talked about the difference that we were making in Atlanta [Georgia]--the fact that we weren't from Atlanta--he put that very clear on the tape and said, "But she has found a way to make a difference, and she's an accepted person now in my city."  So that was good; we have that for our 10th.  Our 15th anniversary, Bill Campbell, I think, was involved with that one.  Now, our 20th anniversary, we have a few people that we hope will be involved, and I can't say who they are at this point.
Story_ID: 97005
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, do you have any other plans to do anything different with the magazine?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes; we really, really do want to take our website and make it its own property.  Right now, the website has, I think, three or four stories that we have in the magazine, but we really need to take the website and have it a site that people cross--in California, South Africa--we don't care where they're located, but they want to found about what Atlanta [Georgia] black businesspeople are doing so--to have it more updated, so somebody can go there on a weekly basis to look at a calendar to see what business opportunities--business networking functions are happening and not wait for a piece to come in the mail 'cause people are picking up their information from PDAs [personal digital assistant]--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --all the time, and we want to be right there at the top.  If you're gonna look at the New York Times on your computer or your PDA, why not also say, "Okay, I'll take the Atlanta Tribune 'cause I want the black perspective; I know what the major people are saying, I know what NBC is sayin', but let's find out what a black-owned publication that's not owned by somebody else but black people, what they say about the situation."  So we really want to make a website more interactive and out there for the community to use.
Speaker 1: Where, where can you find the magazine?
Speaker 2: Well, you might be on our mail subscription list--we do that; or you may go into Kroger, Publix--some of the bookstores.  We have an independent distributor and he magically finds doctor's offices, lawyers who are willing to take fifteen free copies to distribute to their readers and their patients that come through the doors.  We also are with another distributor that actually puts our magazine where they sell other magazines around the city.  The only place that we were having a difficult time is delivery at the airport; since 9/11, you've got one person that can get things through security, and if you're not one of the majors willing to pay the high prices, you won't get in.  So, most of the bookstores in Metro-Atlanta, and supermarkets.
Speaker 1: It's a paid subscription?
Speaker 2: Paid subscription, uh-huh; twenty--what's it--two--twenty-four, but they discount it at twenty a year.
Speaker 1: And the ones that are in the doctor's office (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--They're complimentary (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--they get--they're complimentary?
Speaker 2: They're complimentary.
Speaker 1: And so they're on newsstands, you know, like you said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Newsstands, you'll pay $3.95 if you're a newsstand.  If your, your doctor is one of our bulk subscribers, he can pick up a free copy.
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Dentists, doctors--a lot of the libraries even stock us now.  The Schomburg Center [for Research in Black Culture], they have a paid subscription.  It's amazing the number of colleges that are away from Atlanta that use a subscription service and include us, and we're in their library and some of these other colleges away from Atlanta.
Speaker 1: So you're, you're sponsors of--you--advertising, I guess, you get--what, what type of advertising, I guess, I should ask (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Advertisers that support what we do?
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: They're in Atlanta, the home of Coca-Cola, the home of UPS, the home of Delta Airlines, they're all our supporters.  AirTran Airways has been our supporter since they became AirTran Airways 'cause they want our market; we reach a sophisticated black upscale business clientele who wants to fly first-class but not necessarily pay the first-class ticket price.  Macy's has always been a, a strong supporter of the Atlanta Tribune, General Motors, Ford Motor Company, most of your national companies that look at Atlanta and say, "Here is a great target for my product"--Publix Supermarket, Kroger Supermarket.  Magazines typically take more image advertising and product information advertising versus short-term but people like to say, "Buy bread today for--what is the price of bread, $1.99 on sale?"  That's not what--those are not the kind of people that advertise with the magazine; it's someone who wants to talk about their image within the community, or services that are targeted to a business owner.  Like when Wachovia [National] Bank [now Wells Fargo] first announced a business checking account, they became one of our clients, and they still are one of our clients.  Bank of America is a client--more image advertising or messaging back into the community that, that they serve.

Speaker 1: Well, is there anything that we--
Speaker 2: Missed?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: You've been very thorough.  I do have two wonderful sons--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --Chris Lottier is a computer genius I think; you have a computer that's not doing right, magically, he can open it up, figure out the new software on, do something, talk about a security fire, or whatever, and he's working.  He spent a year in Iraq as a consultant on a project that a major company had, so he went over for a year; yes, we were on our pins and needles, but he was in the--in the Embassy, U.S. Embassy, but still, just the idea of someone you love is in a country like that, but he spent a year there, and I think it was a good growing experience for him, too.  He understood what it meant that you just don't open the door and go out today; things have to be planned.  Our youngest son [Shawn Lottier], the one I said that just could not deal with the Jack and Jill [of America] program?  He also couldn't deal with INROADS; he was in that for a short time.  Again, I guess he's something like me, he doesn't want somebody to tell him, "On a Saturday, this is where you better go."  But he attended [The] Lovett School [Atlanta, Georgia], and had a very interesting experience with racism.  He was one of maybe three in his class at Lovett, and that would have been the year of mid-'70s [1970s].  He was a great soccer player; soccer coaches--everybody loved him; he had a good personality, did well with soccer, went to Germany with the team and just was a good, good soccer player.  But apparently, somehow in his class, he must have--he rubbed a few people wrong because on his very, very last day, in his locker, someone anonymously put a letter and said, "As a black person, you really need to think where you're going because I don't think you understand what the ramifications of that"--oh, very scathing letter.  So he brought it home, and I said, "What do you want me to do, Shawn?"  He said, "Nothing, I don't care!  It's my last week, I'm leaving."  So, I knew one, and I think, at that time, Lovett only had two or three black teachers.  So I knew one 'cause her husband was an artist that we sort of had known from another, another time, and I called her and I said, "Do you think we should do anything or say anything?"  And her name was Mrs. Gerald (ph.), and she said, "If Shawn doesn't want anything done, no, but I'm glad you told me because I think I have an idea who these people are.  So we won't say his name, but let me handle it internally."  And since then, I think Lovett has probably increased their enrollment of black students, and became one of our advertisers, too.  Increased their enrollment of black students, and they have a diversity program, and they have more black teachers there.  But again, I don't know if Shawn started all of that or what, but--and then he went off to University of Maryland Dental School [Baltimore, Maryland].  Actually sort of almost the way that I went to [Johns] Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland], he was able to qualify as an in-state student, so he was able to get tuition at a better rate (laughter).  We used our--George's sister's address, and it was a friend that George knew, you know.  Relationships sometimes help so many people if you call on people that you know, and you've got a good plan and good head on your shoulders; people are willing to help, and that's what this young lady did.  So he got a lotta student loans that he's paying back, but he went to dental school at a very good place there at University of Maryland.  And now he's in Atlanta, has his own dental practice; I think it's been open about a year and a-half, so he's learning to manage money, to be a business person, to understand you got employees if things that happen, things that don't necessary happen and you can't necessarily stay home when you don't want to work; you got bills to pay.  Plus, we get free dental service from him, which is wonderful.  And George [Lottier] and I have been happily married for, I think, almost close to thirty-seven years?  I always have to stop and think how long it's been and that this is our last stay.  We enjoy this city, we enjoy the, the climate, we enjoy making a difference and putting out a product that people--I can just go someplace--I can go down to the Hyatt just to go to somebody's dinner or somebody's birthday party, but I'm gonna meet somebody that will give me a really good story, say, "You may not know this, but because you had my picture and something about my company in your newspaper, it made a difference."
Story_ID: 97007
Speaker 1: I had a call once--we did a piece on Vicki Palmer with Coca-Cola Enterprises, and the story talked about, she started in Tennessee, some things she did, how she made it, and three, four months later, I get an email from someone I hadn't heard from in, since I lived in Danbury, Connecticut, but somehow his daughter got a copy of the magazine in Tennessee and said, "Wow, if this young lady who came from my state can make it to be a senior vice president at Coca-Cola Enterprises, hey, I can do it, too. I don't have to settle for being just a teacher or a nurse."  'Cause when I came through the educational system, the choices for a black female; wear a white dress and white shoes and a white cap--to be a nurse; to say, "Yes, doctor, I'll do this, doctor."  "Thank you, yes."  Sit down, stand up when he comes in.  Or to be a teacher, and there's nothing wrong with being a teacher, but those were the two options, you know; you couldn't be a principal, you couldn't talk about going to the moon, you couldn't talk about being president of a university.  So now, everyone has these options and that's, I think, is what the Atlanta Tribune is also trying to tell young minority students, do what you do well, and don't set your sights very low.  Your parents may have worked in somebody's kitchen--that's what my mother [Ruth Jennings Franklin] did.  My father [Melvin Franklin], I think they said he finished only the eighth grade and just stopped; and his father, I said had all these eight houses; I don't know how they got the houses, but--now he did day labor, you know, go to the houses and, you know--no education, probably couldn't read a blueprint; probably couldn't, I'm sure he couldn't.  Couldn't use a calculator, and--but if you say, "That's where they are, but if I do just a little bit more, I can get higher."  As we grow as black people, our children keep moving up, and you just never know who you're touching, so I mean I kind of saved that email for a long time.  And I also saved a voice message that Maynard Jackson left for me one day about how well one of my writers had interviewed him--saved it and saved it, and boy I said I should never delete it, but the phone system went down one day, and I lost it--I should of recorded it.  But I think that's what we're trying to do to make a difference for our young people.
Story_ID: 97008
Speaker 1: What are your concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I think we're gonna get too hung up where they're talkin' about the Hispanic population is growing; they're the new minority, so if we start to say, "Ah, you're Hispanic, I don't want you to move ahead, I need to get ahead; you know, that's not gonna work.  We need to forget that and just say, "We're all in the same boat here; if we don't work together, that whole boat's gonna sink with all of us in it."  And I know white people are gonna say, "I told you so."  They'll just sit there and say, "I told you so."  But I think we--you know, as a black female, we've got another charge, too, because typically, you know, we have to nurture our family, and we all want to be in business, too, and you got all these people pulling both sides.  I think you need to also figure out, 'How do I find time just for me, and not feel guilty about it?'  I think a lot of young women are really having issues with that, so I don't know what to tell 'em, but they need to make sure they do find time for themselves, and still on one hand take care of the children, the other hand take care of the men because we do have to take care of them; that's our motherly instinct.
Story_ID: 97009
Speaker 1: Well, I noticed that you must take some time for yourself; I see beautiful artwork.  Tell me about your--about your artwork.  Is that a very--is that very much a interest for you?
Speaker 2: I, I think so.  I think at one time--'cause I remember havin' the, the white Betsy Wetsy dolls and the rubber doll with the, the ceramic head or whatever, and I think when they did black dolls--I don't know who made them, but they weren't very pretty.  So something--when--I guess I started collecting black dolls--well, actually, when--I think when the National Black Arts Festival 'cause we were really an early, early supporter of them, but they--when they--they were every other year.  The festival, always--we would go to them early and say, "Whatever poster you're using, we'll put it on our cover for that month."  Every July--every other July, we would do that.  And we, we--also, I got involved with a young lady who would do a black doll festival, and nobody would support it--oh, no, but I said, "Rhonda, whatever I need to do, I will."  So we devoted about four or five pages to talk about the dolls, and we would host a reception; I would always find a sponsor.  So I started to buy them then, and I only want ones that look so different, you know.  I got more in storage someplace, but I don't--my husband [George Lottier] kills me if I put any more out.  But I think that's why I started liking different dolls, and one doll actually was made by someone over at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia]--a black man; typically, it's women, black women that are creating the black dolls, but one of my--well, actually, all three of the ceramic dolls are created by him over at Spelman, emm-hmm, James Felt (ph.); and my other skinny one came from South Africa.  So, yeah, that's how I got interested in black dolls, I think, 'cause I never really--then, when you're kinda poor--'cause we really were poor.  You got one doll at Christmas; maybe at a birthday we got one, too, but they were white dolls.
Speaker 1: Do you remember getting your first black doll?
Speaker 2: Actually, that's a really good question.  I remember getting a doll that was white that walked; you know, you hold the arms and the legs move, or something, but it was white.  I can't remember if my mother bought me one; I'm not sure when black dolls became en vogue.  Might have been at the point where I no longer played with dolls.
Speaker 1: Could have been.
Speaker 2: But then with the festival, I would see the quality of dolls, and that's only been what--the first Black Arts Festival was in 1984, maybe?  Or '85 [1985]?  Eighty-Six [1986]?
Speaker 1: I think so, yeah.
Speaker 2: And one of those--I bought the very first one.
Speaker 1: And what about your, your artwork?
Speaker 2: William Tolliver was--I knew him when he, you know, was in Atlanta; he did our first fifth anniversary poster, then I started to like his work, so I would save a little money and, and worked and bought a few pieces, so I had maybe four different pieces that are William Tolliver's.  And then the other art--if--I don't care what it--it could be cheap, it could be a poster; if I like the message or I like the look, or if the color kind of goes with what I want, then I, I, I'll buy it.  But now, I think I better stop buying; I don't have any more walls.  I don't have any walls left, and we're not moving to another house.
Speaker 1: Do you have any other favorite artists?
Speaker 2: Oh, William Tolliver, yes.  Any other favorite artists that I say I must have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--(Unclear) to have [Charles] Bibbs?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have--in my office I think I have two Bibbs pieces, and I've got one at the stairs, "Lady in Red"; my husband, I gave him one of a man.  I, I like--yeah, I think I do like Bibbs.  Very tall people that are striking, and the women are posing as if they own the world.  And I met him once or twice, so yes, I guess I do like Bibbs, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I'm not necessarily a name person, you know, I don't go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--You just buy what you like.
Speaker 2: Right.  I don't go in the department and say, "I must have this Chanel or whatever, I don't know."  I don't care about that; if I like it, I want it; then, hopefully, I can afford it--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --but I don't need names, I don't need to say, "Well, you know, I'm driving this BMW 1098," or whatever; I, I don't care about fashion in that sense.
Story_ID: 97010
Speaker 1: Well, when you look back over your life, what one thing stands out the most for you?
Speaker 2: One thing, I would have to say, having the counselor from Johns Hopkins University [School of Nursing, Baltimore, Maryland] say, "I need you," because once I went to Johns Hopkins, my education was paid for, and I met my husband [George Lottier].  If she had not arrived in our school, probably would still be in Ashland, Kentucky, and I would not have met my husband, would not have my two wonderful boys, and would not be so happy--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --so I think that was the one thing that if it hadn't happened, things would be really different for me.  Probably would not own the Atlanta Tribune, would not have had the opportunity to meet--I was an attache in the '96 [1996] Olympics for the Cayman Islands, so I--wherever I wanted to go, I could go.
Speaker 1: What does that mean, attache?
Speaker 2: Attache means someone who looks after you--whatever you need.  I mean I had a badge, I could go anywhere if--and they, they had only three athletes, and they brought about six--they're a small group; it wasn't a huge group.  So, I mean they called and said, "Okay, we have two other kids, we're going to the children's camp, but the plane doesn't take 'em 'til Tuesday; will you find where they can go for one day?  Piece-of-cake; I'll go to the airport, they can come to my house--they're two boys.  One of 'em wanted to know, "where do you find the best seafood?"  You know, small things.  Or one would say, "Look, we have all of these Olympic pens and we don't want to pass 'em out; do you want 'em?"  "Oh, yeah, I'll take them."  Just many things.  We--I was able to go to opening night in--opening day, opening night ceremonies; we walked the fields.  You know, if I had not gone to Hopkins, gone to Baltimore, met George--and his company brought us to Atlanta [George].  He invested in the magazine.  I went to Shirley Franklin before the Olympics and said, "I know Shirley, you're sitting here, you got a wonderful opportunity to make a difference; don't forget me, Shirley," and she smiled and said, "We'll see what we can do."  And within three weeks, I get a call saying "I want you to be an attache for the Cayman Islands."  So, those kind of things gave me some great opportunities.  In Leadership Atlanta, we talked about that earlier--some people I met.  I met my class--the young lady was [Dr.] Felicia Suttles.  Felecia is now the President of South African Tourism.  A year and a-half ago, a few of us said, "Oh, I wonder if we can go to South Africa, you know; how do we make that happen?"  I said, "Ah, let me find where Felicia" 'cause I knew she was in South Africa; I didn't know she was now president of tourism.  Put a call in, she calls me back with her beautiful South African accent, and says, "Ooh, yes, we will make that happen; you just tell people that you're coming with me."  Took fifty people over, and Felicia met us in South Africa, we went to her restaurant, we were wined and dined, we went--instead of going--the jazz festival was goin' on; we didn't go through the front door, we went through a side door--bypassed all the rigmarole and the people, and those opportunities of being able to meet people like that because she's making a difference.  She had a show in South Africa, almost like the Oprah Winfrey Show, where she was speaking out.  She'd bring people of importance on that the normal South African didn't have a chance, and Nelson Mandela was wonderful.  Bishop [Desmond] Tutu was great, but there are other people in South Africa that made a difference, so Felicia had these people on her show so folks in South Africa could see them; and not only see them, later touch them, you know.  They were people that--in the community.  So they felt, okay, these people made it.  And sometimes you think, 'Okay, Nelson, he did all these great things 'cause only a few could make it, so I don't know if I can do it.'  But if you see the normal citizen and what they can do, the businesses they can own, it gives you hope within.
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: So, when you asked, that's, that's what made a difference--that one person who came to Ashland, Kentucky and found me.
Story_ID: 97011
Speaker 1: Great.  Since this is for the future generations--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --to see, do you have a message to the future generations?
Speaker 2: Which--after talking with you, I would think most of them would be African Americans, probably doing a research paper on maybe black media, you know, twenty years from--forty years from now; there're no black whatever, everything is--you, you, you pick up your PDA and you see the news and nobody is sitting back there saying, "Well, we'll just put black people at the bottom," you know.  I mean maybe we'll have a black president--black female president even.  So, what I would say to the scholars that are doing this research that if you just sit and wait for it to happen, it's not gonna happen.  You need to look at a plan; write it down, too, and figure out, "This is what I want to do; I want to make a difference, and here're some steps--here're some people I need to get on my side" 'cause nobody's gonna be able to do whatever they want to do on their own; I could not have done it if I didn't have a great editor, Adrienne Harris, way back when, 'cause I did not have an English degree, you know, I just kinda took what English courses I had to.  If I hadn't had a really good graphic designer to give us a great look--I mean I was even able to knock on doors of people who owned a business and say, "Look, this is what I'm trying to do.  What about HR?  Do you have a book to talk about employee benefits?"  Give me--and I used to have a great board that I could call at any time in the very, very beginning.  Now, I have an advisory board, but that's another--that's--I guess when you think you've made it, you don't use your advisory people as much as you should; maybe that's part of the plan for the--our 20th, to get them back involved, to see what direction we really ought to take.  Those are the things I would tell the scholars who are reviewing your tapes.  Write it down, figure out what you want to do.  And you're gonna get some people that say, "That can't be done."  'Cause we moved to Roswell [Georgia], folks said, "You can't run something that's called the Atlanta Tribune away from the city."  I said, "Yes, I can."  And I've made them open up to say, "She was right."
Story_ID: 97012
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know you still have many years, so don't look at this as 'Oh, this is the end,' but what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Ahh, that's a really deep question.  That she was the owner of the Atlanta Tribune; somebody else may own it down the road, but she had standards, she made a difference, she was a female.  Because a lot of times, folks think that men are the one in the publishing industry that make a difference, but she was a female and she was fair to her employees; she helped some of her employees grow, some of them who could move on, and be with a New York Times or be with a Black Enterprise.  That's what I would like for them to remember, that I was a fair person, was an open person, and I helped people advance.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything else you'd like to say?
Speaker 2: I talked about my husband [George Lottier], I talked about my children--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --and I think that's it.  I think that's a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we would like to thank you for taking the time because it's so very important that we have your story, and we're just so glad that you would allow us to come in and, and do--and tell your story, and we really want you to know that we appreciate you.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you for doing what you all do, to tell the stories of all of these people because if you don't tell it, who will?
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 98703
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And you can start talking whenever you're ready.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's my mother, Ruth [Jennings] Franklin.  That would have been Ashland, Kentucky; I'm thinkin' 1980-something?--I think.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next?
Speaker 2: Okay, that is my mother--my mother Ruth Franklin, her nephew and I don't remember his name, and that's Cassie (ph.), one of her nieces, and that would have been in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and that's probably in the early 1980s.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, great--thank you; next?
Speaker 1: Well, that is my grandmother on my mother's side before she was married, and her last name was Tompkins (ph.); I remember she was the lady they say that she was part-Indian.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Oh, my--well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Yeah; let's see, that would have to have been in 1901--something? (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: And that is my mother's father, and he was Robert Jennings, and that was at somebody's funeral; I know she told us that, and that was probably one of her younger brothers' funeral.  That's probably in Philadelphia, and that was--that would have been in say 19--it was before I was born, so that would have had to be 1950-somethin'.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, good; next?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness; can I get--come in and look?  Those are--that's in Augusta, Georgia where my mother's from, and those are some of her nieces and nephews; I don't even know their name, and that would--again, it'd be 1890-somethin'?  Early, early 1900s; I don't even know their name.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next?
Speaker 2: Okay, that's my mother's sister Ann Jennings and one of her boyfriends--don't know his name; they had moved to New York City, and they would have been up there in--say 19--would have been 1940-ish--'40-somethin'--before I was born.
Speaker 1: That's 1935, good (laughter).  Again, that's my mother's sister and probably--I don't know if it's her husband or what, but my mother's sister; they also had moved to New Rochelle, New York, and that's 1935--that's what the picture says.
Speaker 2: That's one of my mother's nephews, and of course he was in the army and, again, Mitch--oh, that would have been 19--early 1940s.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Very good; next?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a recent picture; that's my uncle Warren Jennings in Augusta, Georgia, and that's probably 1980-something.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next?
Speaker 2: I have no idea who that lady is (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, good, that's my husband George [Lottier], and he was probably nine or ten years old--Baltimore, Maryland, so he's born in 1944 so that would have been 1954-ish?--if he's born in '44 [1944]?--I would think.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Emm-hmm.
Speaker 2: That's George Lottier.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Those are my two favorite sons, Shawn, the smaller one, and Chris on the right--Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and I guess Shawn was about two years, and Chris was probably three.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That is my mother, Ruth Franklin, and she had just met my father [Melvin Franklin], so I'm pretty sure that was taken in Augusta, Georgia at somebody's studio because she signed it over to Melvin, who's my father, and that year would have been 1940.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, great.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's a copy of the Atlanta Tribune; the date of that is December-January, 2007.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next?
Speaker 1: Okay, now you got me.  The young lady to the left (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Simultaneous)--Now, on this one, let's start--what we have to do is--do we wanna do all of 'em?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: All right, the graduation is Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia], master's in public health; that would have been 1984, I think May--the month of May, maybe, and that's me in the middle with two classmates, and I can't remember their names.  One was from Jamaica, and I can't remember the other young lady's name.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  When you're ready, we'll do the wedding.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, that was December the 14th, Baltimore, Maryland, 1968, when I married George Lottier; I was giving him wedding cake.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, that young lady is Pat Franklin--that's my maiden name, Ashland, Kentucky; I believe it's a early, early grade school picture at Booker T. Washington [High School, Ashland, Kentucky], which would be--I guess I was probably in third grade maybe?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead when you're ready.
Speaker 2: Okay, Josephine--we called her Jo; that's my mother's oldest sister, the one that's really her mother.  That's in the sewing laundry facility that she worked in Augusta, Georgia and, my goodness--that would have to be 1930-something.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Now, we're gonna go to the photo that's in the center.
Speaker 2: In the center, okay; that's my mother, Ruth Frank--Ruth Jennings before she married, and I think she said she was like in high school, or early, early first year of college, so--boy, that would be what, 1936, 19--that be 1936-ish, or somethin'.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: The two ladies on the bottom--those, again, are my mother's older sisters 'cause she was very young, so that would have been the 1920s, and that would have been Augusta, Georgia for sure, and that--one was called Kat, short for Kathleen (ph.), and the other would have been Annie.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: That's my grandfather, Warren Jennings; that would have been Aiken, South Carolina 'cause that's where he really was from first, before he married my grandmother, they say, so that would have been 1920-ish?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: All right, well we've moved to Ashland, Kentucky.  That's my father, Melvin Franklin, in the middle, and the two ladies are his sisters; one is Thelma, and Thelma was married then, they say, and then the other one was Greta, and Greta had lived in New York where she was home for whatever; that's outside the big family mansion--Ashland, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Ashland, Kentucky--that is my father Melvin Franklin; they were supposedly going to Sunday church; that's why he had that velvet jacket on, and his baby sister was Greta Green--well, it would have been Greta Franklin back then; she also moved to New York to find her fame and fortune but never came back.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Never--lived on Harlem Avenue.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Who's this?
Speaker 2: I think that is him as a baby, too.
Speaker 1: That's the baby sister--the one who moved to Harlem when she was no more than eighteen, and got hooked on drugs, we think.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  What year was this?
Speaker 1: Well, Greta--oh, my.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  The '30s [1930s], or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would have been '30 [1930]-somethin'.  Remember, I said they had a little money back then, so they had a little photo studio, took pictures.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, very good; thank you.
