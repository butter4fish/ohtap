Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, my favorite food?  I guess you--I have to generalize and say seafood of any kind.
Speaker 1: Okay, not the old joke, "you see food, and you eat it" (laughs)?
Speaker 2: (Laughs) No, no.  Fish and seafood, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I guess if I--not consciously, but I like blue.  So I guess blue might be my favorite color.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I guess that would be fall.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes, the Caribbean. Most specifically, I go to St. John a lot, but I go to other locations also, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  But I'm sure during this interview I'll probably say some things that'll come back (laughs), and that would probably be my favorite saying.
Story_ID: 7132
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your family tree and see if we can--how far can you go back?  Can you go back to the nineteenth century or beyond that?
Speaker 2: Only from the standpoint of one of my ancestors was, was a slave, and I knew her.  I knew her 'til she was, till she was about 104.  She died at 104.  She had been a slave and been rather severely mistreated.  She had the scars.  She was a very strong woman, even at the age of a hundred, small, but strong, secure, with a lot of pride.  And I guess what I remember there, is she didn't let it break her.  But that's, that's the only one of my ancestors that I knew from the nineteenth century.
Speaker 1: Now, who is this?  Was she--?
Speaker 2: Her name was Julia Morgan.  And she was my great, great grandmother.  Then there was Blanche Morgan Jackson, who was my great grandmother--this is on my father's side.  And her daughter was Julia Morgan who was my father's mother, Julia Morgan Floyd because she married Sam Floyd.  And they named my father Samuel, not Sam, but Samuel, and Alexander Floyd, and that's where my name comes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your great, great grandmother tell you any stories about that time or any of the struggles that she had to endure, I mean anything specific, you know, because--?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't talk very much.  She was introspective and, as a lot of older people are, tended to stay by herself.  So, no, there were no, no stories that I remember.
Speaker 1: And no one in your family passed on any stories that she may have told them or any other ancestors told--I mean any other person told them about the nineteenth century?
Speaker 2: No, there was very little of that because when I started to school, right after I started school, maybe, maybe--let's see, what I remember is at about eight years old, I think it was, my mother and father were divorced, and we moved--my mother and my brother and I moved to a different town, and moved to Lakeland, Florida.  So we didn't have very much contact with our grandparents after that, just from time to time.  And that whole period is very, very vague in my mind in terms of interacting with my ancestors.
Story_ID: 7133
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father.  Can you give us his name and spell it for us and?
Speaker 2: Yes, Samuel A. Floyd, S-A-M-U-E-L, A for Alexander, A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R, and Floyd, S--I'm sorry, F-L-O-Y-D.
Speaker 1: And when was he born?  If you don't know exact dates, give an approximate date?
Speaker 2: It was somewhere around the first, in the first decade.  For some reason, 1911 sticks in my mind, but somewhere around that period.  He was born in Tallahassee [Florida], grew up in Tallahassee, spent a little time at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], married my mother [Theora Combs Floyd]--I don't remember what year that was.  I, I don't have a recollection of that.  And in 1939--a lot of this I didn't know at the time--but in 1939 he left Tallahassee to go to New York [New York] to audition for a play that was gonna be put on--it was called 'John Henry'.  And it featured Paul Robeson.  That play lasted probably through--I think it, I think it had three nights and opening in two, two other runs.  And it didn't last very long.  And he became a professional musician.  In the 1940s, the, the people at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] wanted to revise, revive the Jubilee Singers which had been disbanded.  So they brought in some professional musicians to start a, a small group.  And these were professionals.  And my father was in that group.  He was with the, the Jubilee Singers under the direction of a woman who, whose last name was [Henrietta] Myers.  Then he went back to New York, and he was with the De Paur Infantry Chorus.  He joined that group, and they toured the United States in the '40s [1940s] and into the '50s [1950s].  I say infantry chorus--they weren't soldiers.  But they performed in, in uniforms, yeah.  But they went all over the world performing for a while.
Speaker 1: Were they sponsored by the government in any way?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I'm not very sure about that, but I don't think so.  We have a picture of them on the wall over there, a picture that he sent me in 1950 that appeared in 'Collier's [Weekly'] magazine.  And a few years ago, I had it framed, actually, I had the photograph copied and framed.  And it's on the wall in the, the lobby out there.
Speaker 1: Can you spell the name of it again?
Speaker 2: D-E-, capital D-E, space-P-A-U-E-R, no, P-A-U-R Infantry Chorus, yeah.  After the tour, he went back, he went to Puerto Rico and remarried, and he stayed there 'til--I think he died about 1970.
Speaker 1: So you didn't really see much of him?
Speaker 2: I never saw him after I was about four years old.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Much of what I told you was from newspaper clippings and also out of curiosity, back in, I believe it was about 1991, somewhere in there, maybe '92 [1992]. I--on one of my trips to the Caribbean, I decided to see if his name was still in the phone book (laughs).  And it was, although he died in 1970 or whatever it was.  So I gave a call to his wife.  She was still alive; went out and met her.  And she showed me some material.  So that also brought some more information about what he was doing.  The only other time I heard from him was when--I heard from him, there was a Christmas that I heard, he made a phone call, somewhere, one of the--I guess about twelve years old.  And then the only other time was when I received the Ph.D. and somehow he heard about it and sent me a letter.  But otherwise, that was the only contact I had with him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so well, was it rough on you not having your father around?  I mean you didn't really know him I guess at age four so I guess--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) No, no.  All I ever heard was positive things about him.  But no, I never--I don't think I ever missed him, 'cause I didn't know him, yeah.
Speaker 1: So how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: Just one brother.  He's two years younger than I am.
Speaker 1: So your household when you grew up consisted basically of you and your brother and your mother--?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And was anyone else in the household?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, grandmother or anything?
Speaker 2: No.  No, we were in Lakeland, Florida by then.  She moved to Lakeland because she got a job as a recreation director in that town.  And we stayed there until I went off to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what instrument did your father play?
Speaker 2: He was a singer.
Speaker 1: A singer, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, cause when you said he--Fisk brought in professional musicians to reconstitute the Fisk Jubilee Singers, I thought that maybe he did something else, but he was--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) No, these were all singers.
Speaker 1: Those were singers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was a very small group that they, they put together at that time.
Story_ID: 7134
Speaker 1: Tell me then about your mother.  And can you give her name and birth date too.
Speaker 2: The first name is Theora.  That's capital T-H-E-O-R-A, maiden name Combs, C-O-M-B-S, Floyd, F-L-O-Y-D.  She was the same age as my father [Samuel A. Floyd].  So I believe that was somewhere around in 1911, something like that.  And, in fact, she was--when we, when we left Tallahassee [Florida], my mother was going to college there.  But she met a lady who had influence in Lakeland, in that community, and somehow they struck up a relationship, and she went there and took a job.  So we moved to Lakeland, Florida.  And she served as the recreation director there from that year, which was probably--it was the war years or the war had just started because I remember the war ending while we were there, and that was, we hadn't been there too long, World War II.  She was very musical.  She had a beautiful voice.  She could play the piano.  She also taught swimming lessons.  She played tennis and taught tennis.  Later, she played golf.  So she did some of, some of everything.  I think the position that she held allowed her to develop skills in those areas.
Speaker 1: And she seemed to have really liked sports.
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: She seemed to have been athletically inclined, she liked sports.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I think it was because of the job that she had as athletic director.  She was responsible for kids learning how to swim and learning how to do all those kinds of things.  Yeah, but she did, she--in fact, in later years, she even took up bowling, bowling.  She must have been in her sixties or seventies when she started doing that.
Speaker 1: Now, you say that she went to school at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], I mean at--?
Speaker 2: No, at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 1: Florida A&M, I'm sorry.  And she met your, did she meet your father there?
Speaker 2: No, she must have met him probably in high school somewhere.  I, I--he, he was there--this is interesting because what this reminds me of is, there was a woman there who was his vocal coach and accompanist.  And when I went to college she ended up teaching me music theory, when I was in college as an undergraduate.  Later, she taught my daughter the piano when she was about five years old.  So that's three generations of Floyds, I guess.  I don't know who my mother studied with or, or anything like that.  She never talked about it.  But that's about all I remember about that.
Story_ID: 7135
Speaker 1: Now, did you grow up in Tallahassee [Florida]--or no, Lakeland [Florida], I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So can you reflect back on your years growing up and tell us what you can about some of the sights, sounds and smells of growing up in Lakeland?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a good question.  I never thought about it like that.  What struck me when we moved to Lakeland was the difference in the smells and the feel.  In Tallahassee, Florida, I remember in our backyard, we had mostly pecan trees and some fig trees.  And that was it.  Pecans don't smell very, very--it was not, they're not very aromatic.  But I remember those smells, and the figs I remember more than anything else, partly because the figs, if you didn't get them quickly, they would rot and you'd smell, smell the first, the sweetness of them and then the rotting of them.  And then when we went to Lakeland, it was different.  In the backyard where we lived, there were orange trees and grapefruit trees and lemon trees, an entirely different smell, avocados.  It was quite different.  The weather felt--the sun felt hotter.  I don't know if I remember 'cause I was a little older, but, and I, I remember when I always--my mother [Theora Combs Floyd] sent me to the store one day.  And I went to the store by way of the alley.  And on the way back home, I heard sirens, a lot of sirens all over the place.  And I didn't know what those--why those sirens were blowing, were sounding.  And when I got home, I saw people just jumping up and down and I learned very quickly that those things were sounding because the--World War II had ended.  I remember the smell of grasshoppers--there was a lot of foliage, hedges and stuff like that.  And the streets were sandy, they weren't paved and playing in the sand, playing with dirt daubers and shooting marbles, which I never see anymore, or spinning tops in the middle of the street, cars coming by.  I remember walking from that location to school and back and school and back.  I remember the--going to the movies which seemed to me quite a distance away, but a subsequent trip there showed that it was only a block.  The kids in the neighborhood playing baseball, things like that.  I remember, I have a vivid memory of a man--I, I talk about this in my book, 'The Power of Black Music [: Interpreting Its History from Africa to the United States'].  In the introduction, I mention a Mr. B, who was blind.  And he sold peanuts, and he walked all over that part of town singing the blues and spirituals and selling peanuts.  And you could give him any coin or any bill, and he'd know exactly what it was.  The coins, I could understand.  I could never understand the, the bills.
Story_ID: 7136
Speaker 1: In school, I guess I remember, not very much.  There was some very pleasant things that happened when I was in school.  There were some unpleasant things.  There was--I had one teacher who assigned a lot of memorization.  And, you'd go to school, and you'd have to stand up, and she'd tell you to recite.  And she would tell you what paragraph to start with.  And you couldn't look, but--and if, if you made mistakes, she would bring her--had a big ruler, heavy ruler, and she'd bring your hand back like that and hit you so many times for mistakes you'd make.  I, I remember her because I didn't like her (laughs).  And sometimes I, I didn't remember my stuff.  She taught me geography and she taught me math--two, two subjects.  And there were some other teachers that were wonderful that I enjoyed.  Not, not until though, I got in high school that I really started to relate to my teachers.  And one of those was my band director.  His name was Lawrence Pope.  And he had come out of the Army, he played in Army bands and he came there as a high school band director, and got me involved in the band.  That reminds me that I also--I started the piano--playing the piano when I was five years old, taking piano lessons.  So I took piano lessons all the way through high school.  And I also took organ lessons, after I got into high school and played drums in the band, studied the trumpet.  And I went on gigs with my, with my high school band director, and that's when I got really into, to playing music at that time.  The, the other person was my English teacher.  She was very, very, very good.  Her name, what was--Mrs. Bunche.  I don't remember her first name.  Her husband was my dentist. And his brother was the Ambassador to the United States [sic, United Nations], Ralph Bunche.  In fact, I think Ralph Bunche visited them when I was in high school.  I have that vague memory of that.  But those were two--my two favorite and very supportive teachers at the time. (Pause). I guess I didn't have a very good reputation among my teachers during that time because (laughs), they, they--and I, I understand this perfectly.  Most of them thought all I wanted to do was play music and beat on drums, and carry these drumsticks around.  Put those drumsticks up, you know.  And that was what mattered to me during that time, playing music.
Speaker 2: Were you a good student?
Speaker 1: If I wanted to be or, or when I had time to be (laughs).  But mostly I made Cs and Bs.  Not until I went to college, that I felt I had to buck--I had to do my work at that time.  I, I, I was--I didn't, I didn't work hard in high school at all.  And I, when I started--I graduated from high school at age sixteen, and it was because in the early years, they moved me along quickly because I was quick.  And I think that was a mistake because I didn't feel like I needed to do much after that.  But when I got in college, I, I knew I had to do the work.
Speaker 2: How old were you were you--you were sixteen when you graduated from high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that's about what year?  We're talking 19--?
Speaker 1: 1953.
Speaker 2: Four--'53 [1953]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I graduated from college in '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: Now, when you were a senior in high school, I mean did you have an idea that you wanted to pursue music?
Speaker 1: By then I knew it, yes.  I, I didn't know it when I was in the eleventh grade.  I didn't know that 'til I was in twelfth grade.  And two, two things happened to me to, to make me decide to, to do that in college.  This was not on my mind until I became a senior.  And one of the things is my band director took five of us, four of us--one, two, three, four of us to audition for the state high school band.  And in the auditions, I learned that I was far above, above everybody else.  And I didn't know that.  I mean--I knew that playing around that town, there was nobody else.  But when, when I became the, the section leader for that, that band, I started to think a little more serious about it.  And what was the second thing that happened?  I forgot what the second thing was. (Pause).  But when I, when I went, I was thinking about majoring in piano, but I ended up majoring in percussion.  My--I, I was taking, my first semester there [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] I was taking secondary piano.  Everybody had to take piano as a secondary instrument.  And I had decided to major in percussion.  But since I had been playing the piano since I was five years old, I mostly sight read my lessons, you know, when I went in there.  And I concentrated on, on the, the other stuff.  But I don't remember what that other, the, I had another something else that happened.  If I think it, I'll come--think about it, I'll come back to it.
Story_ID: 7137
Speaker 1: Tell me how you chose to attend Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is the second time I've done that. (Unclear) Florida A&M right?
Speaker 2: A scholarship offer.  And once I knew that a scholarship would be available, I just decided to go ahead and major in music.  If people thought that much, maybe that's what I ought to be doing, so and that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Were you considered one of the top students in the band when you were in high school [Rochelle High School, Lakeland, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but probably--there probably were only one of--(laughter) it was a small band.  And--.
Speaker 1: And you were a drummer, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's a little difficult to, to answer.  I was certainly the best drummer.
Speaker 1: Well, that's something.  I mean, you know, for those who have been in bands, the best drummer in a--especially in a marching band is really, adds a lot of prestige, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) So you were offered scholarship by Florida A&M?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: And took it?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was Florida A&M like?  You had to go back to Tallahassee?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, as a, as a perspective band member, I had to report early.  Everybody in the band reported early and went through a grueling series of drills and that kind of thing.  The thing is, there was no position for me.  They had, at the time, they had ten snare drummers.  And every slot was filled (laughter).  And so I had to earn it, and, and I did.  I found a slot.  And the person who'd been there for a couple of years--well, I, I replaced him in auditions.  So I got a slot, and I was in the band.  I certainly wasn't the best drummer in that band at that time.  I mean these peo--were people who were sophomores, juniors and seniors and very well experienced.  But in my junior, my junior year I became the section leader.  So it took me two years to, to reach that and, and for some other people to graduate.  But that was a good, good four years and a tremendous experience.  I wouldn't trade it for anything.  I don't know if I'd go through it today because it took an enormous amount of time away from other things.  But the discipline that I got with, especially with the high level of, of musicianship and the demand for that kind of musicianship is probably mostly responsible for me being where I am today, even though I'm not--it's not the same thing.
Speaker 1: Now, the director of band at Florida A&M was Dr. William Foster, right?
Speaker 2: Right, William P. Foster, yeah.
Speaker 1: And he's legendary--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When they think about black marching bands, people think of him.  You know, they're like, maybe--they of that, Florida A&M, they think of Southern University [and A&M College] in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], Grambling [Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] to some extent, you know, but, you know, they certainly think of Florida A&M as being the top, one of the top prototype programs.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So it was--so you had to arrive there early for what they called a band camp, is that what they called it?
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: And a couple of weeks before the school starts, and--,
Speaker 2: Yeah--right.
Speaker 1: And did you all have to work as hard as the football team?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Football players wouldn't think so, but I thought so.  I--it was rather grueling to learn how to do the kind of marching that you had to do and for as long as you had to do it and all the other stuff.  But what I remember is, is--mostly, is, is Dr. Foster's demand for excellence no matter what you do.  And they had a--the--not many people know about the symphonic band.  But after football season that band became the band, and his, his demand for high-level musicianship seemed to go up for that.  You know, you can be excused if you're marching on the field with a trumpet in your mouth and, you know, you know, (laughter), you don't hit everything just right, but on the stage it was a different situation.  So four years of, of that gave me a, a, the drive for being as good as I could be, a drive for excellence.  I had some good teachers there.  Some of them--aside from the, the woman who taught my father [Samuel A. Floyd], her name was Johnnie V. Lee, and aside from her, there were some people who had been in World War II who had come there to teach, who were musicians.  There were people who had formerly been active in the Harlem Renaissance like, there was H. [sic]  Randolph Edmonds who was a playwright and director.  So, you know, these people were coming in there, and it was very nice to--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 2: His first initial is H.[sic.], and Randolph, R-A-N-D-O-L-P-H, Edmonds, E-D-M-O--I'm sorry, E-M-, no, E-D-M-O-N-D-S for Edmonds, yeah.  These people who were well-trained musicians that I, I was around at that time, and all of them serving as exemplary people and exemplars for those of us who were still striving at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other people from the Harlem Renaissance period that you remember?
Speaker 2: There're some people I probably can't remember right now.  I don't remember their names.  There were some, some others there. But he, he was the big name, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, did Zora Neale Hurston ever come through Florida A&M when you were there?
Speaker 2: Not that I remember, not that I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My wife [Barbara Jean]  went to school at her hometown, at the school that she went to school.  She's from, my, my wife's is from Winter Park [Florida].
Story_ID: 7138
Speaker 1: As you were growing up in [Lakeland] Florida, you know, did you have, did you take note of, at all, I guess you'd have to--what did you see in terms of local black expression and church or musical expression in other venues that, that made an impression on you?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Yeah, that's, that's, that's a very, very simple--I mean the question for most people would be a simple one and they would answer it right away by saying this is what happened, and I loved that music.  I, I can't answer it like that.  And there're a variety of reasons why I can't.  In some ways, I guess I grew up conflicted about, about the music.  I mentioned that my father [Samuel A. Floyd] was a singer, and he went to New York, (unclear) with Paul Robeson and everything.  My mother [Theora C. Floyd] was a, a singer.  She also played the piano.  And the kind of music that they cherished and performed was right out of the Harlem Renaissance mentality.  You, you used black expression in order to, to elevate the race by elevating the music.  That was, that was the way people in the homes of my father and mother behaved.  I remember also the first recording that I remember hearing was an operatic aria on old crank-up Victrola, a little machine.  On the other hand, I remember going to church--well, when we lived in Tallahassee [Florida], the name of the church was Bethel AME [African Methodist Episcopal].  It was a Methodist Church, and in that church they would sing hymns out of the, the Methodist hymnal.  On some days, they would cut loose like a, a, a storefront gospel church.  My mother frowned on that kind of behavior (laughter).  And Tallahassee [Florida] was a college town.  And my mother and my father were aspiring to that.  And their values were much--geared mostly toward middle-class stuff, although my, my--my family was not--it was working class.  I had an uncle, his name was Uncle Willie.  And he used to walk the benches in that church.  He got everybody fired up.
Speaker 1: Watch the mic.
Speaker 2: Sorry, (laughter).  I start thinking about this, and forget about it, you know.  Yeah, so, he would get fired up in the church, and people would wait for him to get happy and start working the--that embarrassed my, my mother.  So I, I guess I also started relating to that music in that way.  In Lakeland, Florida, I had Mr. B [blind man in neighborhood who sold peanuts] with his singing the blues, was an experience for me.  I used to wait for him, to hear him sing, sing the blues.  So I liked that.  Jazz was okay, but other forms of vernacular black music were, were--was a music that the people that my mother associated with, like people who were doing the kind of things that, that she was doing, didn't hold in high esteem.  The popular music of the day, swing, that was okay.  The swing bands with [Duke] Ellington, [Count] Basie and all the rest of them, that was fine.  I guess, as I was growing up, I was trying to sort this out.  Not until my band director came to town, and I started playing with him, that I just, just embraced everything because I was playing it all (laughter).  So I don't remember what your question was, but--.
Speaker 1: Well, it was how the local music around there influenced you or what effect it had on you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I don't know if it had any kind--much of a--the local music.  Interestingly, the local music outside of church were in dives and bars--juke, juke joints.  And I was distanced from that until I started, until I started playing with my band director.  I was fourteen years old at that time.  And then I just embraced it all.

Speaker 1: So you didn't see it as, after a while you didn't really see it as music that was stigmatized by--?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah, but as you-- and since you asked the question, I, I'm really thinking back as how, how, in, in that town, in Lakeland [Florida], little town, how much the educated people were knowledgeable about Harlem Renaissance philosophy, and as I'm thinking back, it--some of these people--everybody was aspiring during that time to overcome the stigma of, of being black.  And it was important to them to look up to people like Zora Neale Hurston.  In school, there was some of her stuff, James Weldon Johnson's music and poetry.  And that's what they were doing at the time.  So it's not surprising that they would be frowning on this music like [W.E.B.] DuBois did and, and a bunch of the other people did.  The spiritual was okay.  Spirituals were all right.  Every group sang spirituals.  So what we called the Harlem Renaissance, of course, had its impact everywhere else.  In fact, in my book 'The Power of Black Music', I give a, over a chapter to the Chicago Renaissance and talk about some, some of these things.  But I had never 'til now really associated it with my hometown, the town we grew up in.  I did with college, but not, not the town.  But I see it now.

Speaker 1: Now, when you were in college [Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida], what else did you do besides play music?  I mean what were some of your other activities?  Were you involved in fraternities or--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --other college life type of things or stuff?
Speaker 2: All my other time was spent in the evenings cleaning up a fraternity hall, working with an uncle, cleaning hardwood floors and polishing hardwood floors and driving a truck for a cleaners, clothes cleaners and delivering clothes, picking up clothes.
Speaker 1: So you were working your way through school basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Scholarship, plus that, you know.  It made it possible.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, that makes sense then.  So you didn't really participate in a lot of extracurricular college life stuff except for the stuff associated with the band--,
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, the things that the band could afford you that had a social aspect?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was there a great deal of prestige associated with being a member of that band?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I guess I thought so.  Yeah, our band rehearsals had audiences, a lot of girls.  Usually, you find that on the football teams, but that happened there, yeah.
Speaker 1: I've been told the same thing about Southern's [Southern University and A&M College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] band.  When the Southern band practices--,
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: --when people go to see the band.  They don't, they--and when the game comes, they want to see the band.  Everybody is out there for halftime, but then they go to get their drinks when the game starts.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: And then you go down and mill around while the game was going on.  But they come out to see the band.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: It's interesting.  I think, I don't--I can't think of any other culture that has that kind of aspect going on in college life where the band is more important than some of the, emphasis on the team.
Story_ID: 7141
Speaker 1: Did you have any other teachers who were like mentors or took an interest in your development at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 2: I guess almost everybody did that I, that I came in contact with.  That, that was, that's one of the blessings of historically black institutions.  The people, the depth of caring and the, the attention that people would give anybody.  You know, I've always said that there are some students that shouldn't go to historically black institutions, and there are some that should go to historically black institutions.  And the opportunities you get for leadership in those schools, that you wouldn't get somewhere is, is good.  I don't think I would have been the leader of my section had I gone to a, a predominantly white institution.  And I surely wouldn't have had the kind of on-hands encouragement, I, I can't imagine anywhere else.  And one of the teachers there had been in the De Paur Infantry Chorus with my father [Samuel A. Floyd].  And he took an interest in me.  Anybody that, that played music, I mean it was just, you could go to anybody and talk to them.  If you didn't do it, they might send for you to talk to you.  So I mean I can't single out--Mrs. Lee and Curtis King.  He is the person that was in the chorus with my father.  And other people--all of them were just very, very willing to interact with you, encourage and help you.
Speaker 1: Okay, it sounds like a beautiful atmosphere to be in college in, you know.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: A real developmental type place.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 7142
Speaker 1: When you graduated from Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], what were your plans?
Speaker 2: Well, by the time I graduated I--.
Speaker 1: Be careful of your mic.
Speaker 2: Thank you. I went teaching high school [Smith-Brown High School, Arcadia, Florida].  The man who had been the principal of my elementary school had move to another town, and he heard that I was gonna be graduating from college.  And he contacted me and asked me if I wanted a job as band director.  So I went to this little town called Arcadia, Florida, where he was the principal.  And this was a small school.  The entire school from grade, grades one through twelve had about 325 students.  That was the size of the school.  And when I got there, they had a nine-piece band that was there.  By my third year, I had sixty-five pieces in that little school, a sixty-five-piece band.  And it was winning the top ratings in all the band contests.  The, the level of interest, the dedication of those kids and the support that their parents were giving them was just tremendous.  It allowed you to just--if you worked hard, to do, do whatever you wanted to do.  And, and those years there I cherish.  I was there for five years, and the last three, when they were getting top ratings.  We'd go in a room, put music on the stands we'd never seen.  You'd have to sight-read it, and it--they would read it from top to bottom.  They, they--I was really proud of those kids.  Some of them call me today.  They still call me.  That was a very, very, a racist town.  The, the--I mean this was in the late '50's [1950s], and everything was segregated, of course.  A very interesting thing happened to me though.  I had a, a doctor.  The doctor that, that, what would you call it, attended the birth of my first child [Wanda Rawls], he's white.  And one day I--he was my doctor too. And, and I, I was talking to him about something.  He was talking about, asking me if I knew of anybody who knew how to, how to take care of hardwood floors.  So I told him, nobody but, but me.  So he told me about the floors in his home that he'd just bought, and that the floors were in terrible shape.  And he asked me if I would be willing to, to do his floors.  He said, "I know you're a teacher, but I need somebody to--," so I told him yeah.  So I did his hardwood floors.  And while I was there, you know, he came in and he was--he talked to me, and he left and went to work.  And he knew I was a band director at the school so his wife called me, after I had done their floors, and asked me if I would--they had a son in the band in the white school.  And they wanted me to teach their son.  His, his, his wife, was a graduate of Juilliard, Juilliard School of Music [New York, New York], and she wasn't happy at all.  So I, I taught that kid on the QT (laughter), but it, it was amusing in that little town, like that, that they would do that.  He was Jewish.  She was too I think.  And I don't know what to say, what else to say about that experience except that in that little town, it was a very, very delightful experience to work with those kids and to take them where, where we were able to take them.  The, the last memories I have was that, because of that band, I was asked to, to do my first book.  I, I was--at one of these band contests was a composer by the name of Alfred Reed.  He wrote a lot of band music, and he was known all over the world.  And he heard my band, and he praised the band, but he asked me also--he was a, a publisher.  He, he was the editor of, of Hanson Publications.  They published music for band and all that kind of thing.  And he asked me if I would write a book of drum cadences for, for the company.  And I did.  And two years later, he asked me to do another one, and, and I did, did another one.  I, well, I had--my mind was on--my mind was not on publishing or anything like that.  But the opportunity came along, and it was because of that experience.  And another person who heard my band for two years was William P. Foster [director of the famous "Marching 100" of Florida A & M University].  And he said, come work for me as assistant band director.  So that's why at the, at the end of five years, I went to work for him.  And after I got there, I realized that I needed to get an advanced degree.  So I started thinking about graduate school.  And after two years there, I decided to go to graduate school.  He asked me to come back.  But the two years there, I'd had my fill with marching bands.  So that was, that was the end of that.  So I left and went to graduate school.
Story_ID: 7143
Speaker 1: General of the marching band is intense, I suppose, yeah?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's grueling and it takes a lot of time.  And--that year,  I think the thing that really got to me was the traveling.  We [Florida A & M Marching 100] went to, we went everywhere.  We went to the Bahamas.  They built a stadium for us to perform in and--that's right, they didn't even have one.  And we went over there, and we did all these shows.  And then when we got back from--and this was late.  I mean football season was over, and this was--we did this stuff during Christmas, went home for Christmas.  We came back in January, and Dr. [William P.] Foster brought a letter to--there was a meeting of the band, brought a letter, and it was an invitation to Paris [France].  And (laughter), you know, normally, you're all, everybody would jump up and scream.  It was, you could hear a pin fall.  Nobody wanted anymore of it.  I surely didn't, and I wasn't in the band.  I was, I had a cushy job as, as assistant director.  But that was enough.  So that ended my band career, very short.
Speaker 1: It could be too much of a good thing, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 7144
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a enough of marching band activity at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] after you were there--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: --decided to go to graduate school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So where did you go?
Speaker 2: Southern Illinois University [Carbondale, Illinois], got an assistantship there to teach percussion.  The band director was teaching percussion instruments there, and he ended up leaving to do some other things.  But I got an assistantship, and I taught that.  And I also taught--when I was working on my masters, I, I taught some general studies courses in music.  Then it took me a year to get my masters, and then I went right into a Ph.D. program, but they also hired me full time on the faculty at that point.  So it took me four years to get my Ph.D. while I was teaching full time.  This is another case of the people that I went to school for hired me.  That's been the story of my life.  I didn't, I didn't know what I was gonna do.  I, I--I knew that I could go back to doing stuff if I wanted to, but I didnt know what I, what I wanted to do until near the near the end of my, my graduate study.  My major was music education, and I fell in love with philosophy and philosophy of education.  So I decided to concentrate in that area with a specialty in music.  So I entered a Ph.D. program in the School of Education and got that finished.  And by that time, I was teaching graduate courses in musical aesthetics and some other things.  And I thought that's what I wanted to do.  In fact, my--one of my first publications following graduate school had to do with musical aesthetics.  I was quite taken with that.  Then in 1970 or was it '71 [1971], one of those two years, a book came out called 'The Music of Black Americans [A History'], Eileen Southern's great musicological study.  And I read that book, and that was the end of that.  I said, "No more.  I'm not gonna do anything else."
Story_ID: 7145
Speaker 1: I want to backtrack a little bit and have you explain what musical aesthetics are.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It might be self evident I mean, you know, explicit in the naming--,
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but just to be exact.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah, well, it's, it's about, beliefs about music, about what music is, what moves people about music.  It's about music valuation, you know, how do you determine what is music of quality and music of not quality.  Why does some music move some and some others and the literature for that whole field goes all the way back to Plato and Plato's beliefs about what music is and how it affects the state, and all of that.  And you can come on through history and there are tomes written on this.  Another book that I liked very much was a book by Edward Hanslick called 'The Beautiful in Music'.  That's, that was written in the nineteenth century.  Then there's a book by Edmund Gurney called 'The Power of Sound', where I stole the title for my, my book, 'The Power of Black Music'.  John Dewey's work called 'Art Is Experience' [sic, 'Art as Experience'] coming on up to the 1930s.  I think that was written in 1934.  That's the kind of stuff I was delving into.  And, as you know, that's graduate-level stuff.  And I--it was, it was wonderful to do.  And I've, I've always made use of it since that time.  Whatever I write, I make use of that kind of material.  But when, when that book came out, I read that book, and I wanted to teach.  I wanted to develop courses in black music.  So I started looking for material like scores, sheet music, things that she had mentioned in her book were not available.
Story_ID: 7146
Speaker 1: Tell us briefly, and can you spell the name for us, who was Eileen Southern?
Speaker 2: Okay, Eileen, E-I-L-E-E-N, Southern, S-O-U-T-H-E-R-N.  Eileen Southern, at the time was at NYU [New York University, New York, New York].  And, in fact, I think she got her degree at NYU, her Ph.D. and she was teaching there.  And she was getting ready--she tells me--she told this a long time ago--she was getting ready to write this book.  And she mentioned it to one of her colleagues at NYU, and she was younger--this guy was older.  And he said, "What are you talking about?  With black music, you're only talking about jazz and a few spirituals."  And all that did was make her more determined.  And that's all she had to work with, she said.  Yet she came up with a 600-page tome on black music ['The Music of Black Americans: A History'].  And it was, it covers everything.  When I, when I read the book, I just knew I had to explore this, this area.  And I wanted to teach kids.  In the process of trying to prepare that though, I could not find the scores or the sheet music.  None of that was in print.  A lot of the recordings that she had mentioned in the book were not available.  So I started to look around.  I got a Newberry Grant.  I spent a whole summer at the Newberry Library [Chicago, Illinois] looking through a collection called The J. Francis Driscoll Collection of American Sheet Music, looking for music by black composers.  I didn't finish it that summer because the collection at the time consisted of 87,000 pieces of sheet music.  I touched every single piece of sheet music in that collection, had to come back later to finish it.  That led me to some other places like the, the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] and like the Moorland-Spingarn [Research Center] collection at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  I got an NEH [National Endowment for the Humanities] grant to start doing this work.  And I never ended up--I didn't end up teaching that course because I started spending all my time tracking down music, information and material.  I, at one point, I got a little frustrated by it because I wanted to teach this course, and I also then decided I wanted to write a book, a different kind of book that Dr. Southern wrote.  So at a professional meeting, I was telling her about this problem.  And she said to me, "Well, it looks like you, you're gonna have to institutionalize what youre doing."  And I had never thought of it in that way.  But thinking about it for months and months, I finally realized that she was right because it was getting more and more difficult for me to keep up with all that stuff.  And also, to, to--to try to locate music and recordings in other places, I started a newsletter and started distributing it to black people all over the country.  And that was another thing that I--was on my plate.  So I realized that I was gonna have to start some kind of institute because I also wanted to hear the music that she'd mentioned and the sheet music.  I wanted to hear it come alive, to really see what it sounded like.  So I decided to set up an institute or something down there [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], and I, I proceeded to do that.
Story_ID: 7147
Speaker 1: It [Floyd's idea for a black music research center] was approved by the, the institution, I was still at Southern Illinois University [Carbondale, Illinois].  And it had gone to the Illinois Board of Higher Education and they had approved it.  However, there was some difficulty with funding.  That year they, they approved several new programs but without funding.  So I knew if I started it, I had to find some money to do it.  And I started putting together an advisory group to help me plan this thing and find some money.  Clark Terry was, was one person and some, some other people that I, that I knew around that time.  And in the process--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Clark Terry, the [jazz] trumpet player?
Speaker 1: Yeah--and, and, in, in the process, after the meeting we held--it was about maybe eight or ten people, after the meeting--we were talking about expanding the group of advisors.  So one of the things I wanted to do was to get somebody from a historically black institution involved.  So I went down to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and talked to the president at that time.  And he said, "Well, I like this very much, but if you want me to be involved, you have to do it at Fisk."  Well, I hadn't even thought about going to Fisk, but two things, two things made me decide to go there.  One was, my children were growing up in an almost all-white neighborhood.  And they, what they knew were white college professors.  I was at SIU for fifteen years, and, and when we first went, everything was segregated.  So in the early years, they went to school with white kids.  We lived in an all-white neighborhood until a couple of other professors came there and started teaching.  And my kids didn't know anything about black intellectuals.  So I decided that--my one child was already out of high school by this time, and I had two others.  So I said, I'm gonna go to Fisk and let my--my kids can go to school there.  And then the other thing was my father [Samuel A. Floyd] had been there as a Jubilee Singer.  So I decided to go to Fisk.  So I went to Fisk, and I started trying to do the same thing there.  Fisk was in horrible financial shape.  And the, the enrollment just dwindled down almost to, to nothing.  By that time, I was raising money for my journal, and I started the journal there, 'Black Music Research Journal'.  And things were moving along well for me. And one morning--I, I lived on, on campus in what used to be the home of Arna Bontemps.  He, he willed it to Fisk.  Anyway, I, I lived in that house there.  And--.
Speaker 2: About what year is this?
Speaker 1: I went there in 1978, yeah.  So, but by 1982, I had decided to leave because of the, the situation at Fisk.  I wasn't sure Fisk was, was ever recover during that time.  And it's still not back to where it was.  But anyway, I, I was there till '83 [1983].
Story_ID: 7148
Speaker 1: And in the summer of '82 [1982], the, the Mayor of Chicago [Illinois], Jane Byrne, was putting together--she was planning--and she had planning committees all over the city, planning to do a, an international arts festival, which never happened.  But somebody had recommended me to, to--to work on this thing that summer with two other people.  One was, used to be a 'Chicago Tribune' music critic, whose name I don't remember right now.  He's at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois], teaches at Northwestern.  And the other person was a young man, specialist in gospel music.  His name won't come to me now either.  But anyway, she asked me to come to Chicago and work on this, on the music part of this for that summer.  So I did.  When I got here, they didn't have an office for me.  So somebody called Columbia College [Chicago, Illinois] and asked them to provide an office for me, and they did.  And that's when I met the president.  To make a long story short, this was in '82 [1982], when I'd already decided to leave [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  So I had several conversations with [Mirron] 'Mike' [Alexandroff] and I liked him a lot.  Then I found out that he used to be one of Paul Robeson's bodyguards, and--.
Speaker 2: So this is, this is--?
Speaker 1: Mike Alexandroff.
Speaker 2: Mike Alexandroff.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: He was one of Paul Robeson's bodyguards?
Speaker 1: Yeah, whenever Paul would come to Chicago, he, he would bodyguard him.  And Mike--I learned so much about Mike.  So at the time, they wanted me to come back to SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] in an administrative capacity.  So I called up Mike one day, and I told Mike that I was gonna go back to SIU because I'd been talking to those people, and I could still develop my, my [black music research] institute there.  And Mike said "Well, why do you want to go back there?"  And I told him.  He said, "Before you do that, why don't you come talk to me."  So I came up to Chicago and talked to Mike, and again, to shorten this story, Mike asked me to give him a couple of weeks to see what he could do about bringing me here if I'd be willing.  And one of my problems in trying to set this thing up and those other towns was always the lack of foundations and corporations to get money from.  So I figured with, with Chicago's traditions and with all these institutions in place, Chicago might be the place.  So I decided to come here.  And, and I did.  And it was probably the best decision I ever made in my life.
Speaker 2: So you officially started here at Columbia, when?
Speaker 1: June, July of '83 [1983].
Story_ID: 7149
Speaker 1: Had you officially started the Center for Black Music Research [Columbia College, Chicago, Illinois] yet, I mean as an institution?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well, there was a little institute that I, I had started at, at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  I was on the verge of doing it at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois].  And then I went there because of what, what I just told you.  And the situation there was just not good at all.  You know, it was deteriorating.  I won't go into specific details about what was happening to that institution, but I, frankly, I started feeling guilty because I was raising money for, for what I was doing.  And, and it wasn't happening in other places within the institution.
Speaker 1: So you're being funded, but you see other departments falling by the wayside?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: So, well, fortunately, you had a different situation here.  Tell me now, when you did officially start the Center for Black Music Research?
Speaker 1: Oh, you know, I, I dont remember the month, but I do know that the first summer beginning in July when I came here [1983] was spent doing planning, writing planning documents, trying to determine what I wanted to do.  When I was at, at Fisk, I started this out, trying to develop it incrementally and feeling my way.  When I got here I, I formulated a concept.  And when I agreed to come, I agreed to come with only my salary because there was no other money available.  And what, what--the agreement that I had with the president, which turned out to be a wonderful thing, was that if I were to come here and started doing this, and he was, he was, he was betting on the fact that I could raise money. That every time I would raise money, then the college would, would raise the amount of support that they were giving me.  They would provide operational support. The first semester only with my salary, but every time I would raise more money, they would put more money in.  And that, that's not what you do in higher education.  But, but [Columbia College President Mirron] 'Mike' Alexandroff was a different kind of person.  So I was here.  I got a little grant.  And they gave me a half-time secretary.  Then later, I got a $20,000 grant to start collecting materials to develop a library.  Then I got a full-time position. And over the years--and I was in one little office that's maybe one third the size of, of this room at the time.  And I, I shared that with the half-time secretary.  Then we moved to a bigger room, and then I got two rooms.  And the more I'd raise money, the more we'd get.  And over the years, I ended up, before I gave up the directorship last summer, to this space, which is about almost 7,000 square feet, and eleven full-time people.  And that happened because of the agreement I had with the president.  So this worked beautifully.  The only reason I came, I decided to come after, after we talked, was because I felt I, I could trust Mike Alexandroff.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have come.  But not only has that worked, did it work with Mike, but two subsequent presidents.  It's worked fine.  And we went from that little room with only a newsletter and a journal ['Black Music Research Journal'], fledgling, to all the other stuff you, you see that weve done and with international influence, because of this institution, Columbia College.
Story_ID: 7150
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what is the mission of the Center for Black Music Research [Columbia College, Chicago, Illinois], exactly?
Speaker 2: The mission of the center is to conduct research, sponsor research and to publish research in the field of black music.  It's a dissemination mission.  That is, we gather the, the material and then disseminate it in some form.  And we disseminate it through our library here, through scholarly journals ['Black Music Research Journal' and 'Lenox Avenue: A Journal of Interarts Inquiry'], through--we've had anywhere from one to three newsletters going at the same time, through performances.  In fact, the only public face we have is our performance program.  And we take the results of our research into the community and, and perform it.  That's the way we disseminate the results of what we do to the general public.  In addition, we, weve published a dictionary, a huge, two-volume dictionary called the 'International Dictionary of Black Composers'.  And so its a dissemination, an information gathering and disseminating mission.
Story_ID: 7151
Speaker 1: You said that you [Center for Black Music Research, Columbia College, Chicago, Illinois] take performances based on the research out into the community.
Speaker 2: (Nods for yes).
Speaker 1: Can you give an example of, of some research in the performances that were taken out?
Speaker 2: Well, for example, we find information by well-known composers from the past going all the way back to the sixteenth century in Rome [Italy].  And there was a composer in the Vatican [City] at that time by the name of Vicente Lusitano.  Lusitano had been born of slave parents in Portugal and raised in the church in Portugal, composed music for the, for the church.  They brought him to Rome to teach, and he taught in the Vatican.  He wrote a textbook.  We have a copy of it here it now.  He wrote books of motets and nobody ever heard of this person.  We performed music in two churches in Chicago [Illinois] by him.  There was a composer from the nineteenth century that I wrote an article about.  Nobody knew this guy.  His name was J. W. Postlewaite from St. Louis [Missouri].  I finally tracked this guy down, and the only reason I knew that he was black was because I--in the process of the research, I found his manumission papers.  This guy had published music when he was a slave.  And I wrote two articles on this guy eventually.  It's this kind of thing that we, we play this music, take it out, write program notes for it so people will know about these figures, some important, some not so important.  But this certainly involved--important to African Americans who need to know about their heritage.  And we, we've been doing this constantly.  We, weve taken this music to New York to perform at Alice Tully Hall [Lincoln Center Plaza, New York, New York], Orchestra Hall [Chicago, Illinois].  For the last two years, weve been in residence at the South Shore Cultural Center [Chicago, Illinois] where we perform this music on a, on a regular basis.  So that's what I mean by--it's our public face.  Its where we can meet people, face-to-face so they can see what we do.
Story_ID: 7152
Speaker 1: You mentioned one of the personalities, but theres some other black personalities that wrote music that's come down to us through popular culture that we don't, were not aware of.  Could you talk about some of those?
Speaker 2: You know, what's interesting about, about that and popular culture, that's, that's the area in which--that everybody knows about mostly, but, but youre right, there are some--I dont know if you're, you're--in the nineteenth century, for example, J. W. Postlewaite, the one I just mentioned from, from St. Louis [Missouri], he, he performed the popular music at the time.  And then there was a, a man at the end of the century by the name of [John William] 'Blind' Boone who was performing early versions of ragtime--of what was later to become ragtime music in St. Louis.  Nobody--what people know about is Scott Joplin in the, in the nineteenth century.  But Blind Boone was writing some of this music that sounds very similar and has the traits of what would later become classic ragtime.  And you mentioned earlier, a 'Blind Tom' [Thomas Bethune, aka Thomas Wiggins], who was also playing popular music of the day from about the 1840s on to the end.  He, he was succeeded by another blind performer, that's the Blind Boone that I mentioned later.
Speaker 1: Thomas Bethune, he was a slave right, who--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: --basically remained a slave even after slavery.
Speaker 2: That's correct, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was--of all the stories of the exploitation of black musicians by white managers and publishers and so forth, this is the worst I've ever heard.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess this is the oldest story (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think you could, yeah, you could probably say that was the first of that kind of exploitation.  Another composer before him, though, and nobody exploited this guy, but he was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  His name was Francis [Frank] Johnson.  And his band was called Frank Johnson's Band.  Ive traced Frank Johnson as far as--as far north as points in Canada, as points--let's see, as far south as St. Louis where his band was arrested for being black and--the word black wasn't used--Negroes, free Negroes in the state of Missouri without free papers.  This band came out of Philadelphia, as I said.  And his first composition was published about 19--no, 1818.  And he published a lot of the popular music of the day.  He was in demand, not only in Philadelphia for--his band played for balls.  They played for military parades, for militias and that kind of thing.  But Frank Johnson was in complete control of his, of his destiny, unlike Blind Tom who came later, yeah.

Speaker 1: Tell me about, there were some other figures, James Bland, I think, was a very popular composer during the 19 century--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he wrote, you know, he wrote the state song of Virginia, 'Carry Me Back to Ole Virginny' and a bunch of other songs.  He, he was--during his heyday, he was probably the most famous of those songwriters, except for Stephen [Collins] Foster, one of the most effective writers of, of song during that period.  There was another one--a composer that was also popular, but his name doesn't come to me right now.  I thought I had it.  I was gonna lead from Bland to him--Gussie, Gussie Davis, Gussie L. Davis was another songwriter of great popularity during that time.  But I think probably none of their music survived except the Carry Me Back to Ole Virginny' like Stephen Foster's music has, has survived, unfortunately.
Speaker 1: What about, I had a question--what about, now, I've heard, and I'm searching and stuff I'm just--I've heard that might be of interest to people, but William Grant Still is somebody that might be of interest to people.  What, what did he, I've heard that he's written, he wrote quite a few pieces that were performed on radio and television, and they have no idea that--most people have no idea that he had anything to do with it, Grant--anybody black had anything to do with those songs, and songs for commercial radio and television.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Still wrote a lot for radio in the 1930s and the 1940s.  I believe he wrote for the 'Old Gold Hour' [Old Gold Paul Whiteman Hour'], Old Gold cigarettes.  I think it was Old Gold, but I'm sure, I can't be sure about that.  I have to check.  He did [sic] movies [music] for films.  He did music for television.  For example, I think he did the music for the 'Perry Mason' [tv]show and several other shows during that, that time.
Speaker 1: I heard a rumor that 'Gunsmoke' [tv show] had--he had something to do with maybe (unclear) 'Gunsmoke'?
Speaker 2: 'Gunsmoke', right--.  Others don't come to mind right now, but he's also written several operas, several have been produced, 'Troubled Island' from about 1941 was one of them.  Another one was called 'Blue Steel', another was called '[A] Bayou Legend', set in Mississippi.  He's probably had more operas produced than, than any other black composer, except Harry Lawrence Freeman.  Harry Lawrence Freeman is not nearly as well known as, as William Grant Still, but he wrote fourteen operas between about 1893 and the 1940s.  And most of them were produced in locations between New York and Denver [Colorado], starting in the late 1890s.  But again he's a very obscure composer.  I've seen some of his music.  I don't, I don't think it matches up to, to Still's music, but the fact that this guy was getting his operas produced that early says something about how his music was viewed during that time by contemporaneous colleagues.
Story_ID: 7154
Speaker 1: Here's a story--I had a discussion once with someone on Scott Joplin and Scott Joplin's--one of his ambitions was to produce an opera, see his opera, his opera 'Treemonisha' produced and maybe some others.  I don't know how many operas he actually wrote, but I know that was one he--,
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --tried to get produced during his lifetime.  And the discussion went like this, the person I was discussing it with said, you know, why are black people always trying to invade some white venue, you know?  Why wasn't he satisfied in playing, you know, in the, in the joints he was playing in and being a popular musician?  And my comment was, well, those were--aren't any more black than the opera necessarily.  He just, that's how he made a, you know, that's how he could make a living.  Pointing out that he died of syphilis, you know, which was perhaps a result of being in those environments--,
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so I mean I don't know.  What are your thoughts about it?
Speaker 2: Well, I think anybody should do whatever he or she wants to do.  And it's nobody's business what somebody was going to do and, and to identify the realm of opera as belonging to white people is to discount human freedom to pursue whatever pursuits they want to pursue, so I would dismiss that.  Besides, I don't view this as an invasion.  I--this is, this has been a historical trend.  This person probably only knew about, about Joplin.
Story_ID: 7155
Speaker 1: The first opera written by a black person was in the 1700s by a composer by the name of [Joseph Boulogne] Chevalier De Saint-Georges.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, right.  He was a famous swordsman and athlete and ice skater--,
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and everything else.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was anything he wanted to be apparently.  And he wrote this opera in Paris.  And it's called 'Ernestine'.  That music is--the music has finally been found and edited.  His--and he was born in Guadaloupe to a, a French planter and a black woman.
Speaker 2: Now, I'm gonna ask you to spell his name, just for the record, 'cause I--that's why I keep asking you--.
Speaker 1: His name is actually Joseph Boulogne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges.  Joseph, J-O-S-E-P-H, Boulogne, B-O-U-L-O-N-G-N-A [sic, Boulogne], Saint Georges, S-A-I-N-T hyphen G-E-O-R-G-E [sic, Georges], and maybe the S isn't pronounced in French, but it doesn't matter.  That's the, that's the spelling.  Anyway, Saint-Georges, although he was mixed race is probably as dark as I am--was, given the images that have come, come forward.  And his father took him to France and left him to be trained as a musician and as a, a person of, of civil importance.  And he became a conductor of one of the most famous operas in France.  He also wrote the first string quartets that were written in France.  And he wrote them before Mozart did his later on, but Mozart was famous for his quartets.  So I mean black people have been doing this stuff since forever.
Story_ID: 7156
Speaker 1: In, in, in the late 1700s and the very early 1800s, there were two hundred and fifty black and mulatto composers in Brazil in Minas Gerais writing concert music.
Speaker 2: Now, how--can you spell that name, Minas Gerais?
Speaker 1: M--, M-I-N-E-A-S [sic, Minas], Gerais is, G-E-R-A-I-S, yeah.  It's a remote area in Brazil that was rich in, in gold and diamonds in the late 1700s.  And these composers flourished there.  Now, and all that was forgotten.  I mean nobody knew about this until the 1940s when a German musicologist was in the Minas Gerais area looking for material, and he saw in front of this church, there was this pile of music that they were getting ready to burn.  And he stopped them.  He took the music, and he started doing research on it and found that all this music was written by black composers, orchestral music, masses and motifs for the church.  And in the 1950s he recorded some of it on, on, on vinyl.  And that's, that's a whole area of research that's been opened up.  Black people have always done this.  But somehow people today don't know this so they look this as having been a white realm.  You know, and nobody looks at Ignatius Sancho, for example, who was writing also in the 1700s in England and publishing country dances.  And these people lived in white society.  There was Chevalier J.J.O. De Meude-Monpas who, who wrote concertos in the 1700s.  I mean there's just tons of stuff that people don't know.  Slavery did more harm than anybody can imagine because all this would have been part of world, world culture and world knowledge had it not been for this virulent racism which served to just erase a lot of this stuff, erase the knowledge and everything else.  And, I mean it just forbidden to put this thing--this kind of thing in books once race became an, an issue.
Story_ID: 7157
Speaker 1: With [Scott] Joplin, he had two operas.  One was called 'The Guest of Honor', which has been lost.  We know it exists--no telling where it is.  It was, maybe just gone or burned up.  The second was 'Treemonisha'.  And, of course, he couldn't get it produced.  He, he did a version with piano unstaged to try to promote it.  And not until the 1960s was 'Treemonisha' done fully staged.  I, I think Scott Joplin did exactly what he was, what he thought his calling was, to write a black opera, celebrating black culture, and, and--what can I say, advancing his mission to bring blacks in the nineteenth century out of darkness into light as the opera says.
Speaker 2: What was the theme of the opera?  I mean what was the story?
Speaker 1: It centered around a little girl who was named Treemonisha.  She was named after a tree, Tree and Monisha--.
Speaker 2: It's not a name that would be--it's a name that's similar to many you would find in schools today.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Schools in the black community.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.  She, she was put forth as the savior of black culture.  She hated superstition, and Joplin's point at the time was that blacks were still dealing with superstition with charms and, and all the other stuff surrounding, things like obia and, and other forms of, of black cults during the time.  And the big trickster was named  Zodzetrick.  It's interesting how he put these, these names together.  And Zodzetrick and his, his henchmen kidnapped Treemonisha and took her away.  I, I forget the, the rest of the plot and all that, but she was--Treemonisha carried the day.  And this was supposed to be an example opera, of putting all that stuff behind us and let's moving--move forward into modernity.  And that's essentially what the, what the opera was about.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: But wonderful music in that opera.
Speaker 2: It is.  And it's been performed, I know it was performed in New York several years ago.  I don't know when that was.
Speaker 1: The first performance was in, in Atlanta [Georgia] with the--T.J. Anderson did the music.  You know who he is?  T.J. is an African American composer.  At the time, he was teaching at Tufts University [Medford, Massachusetts].  He was head of the music department and a composition teacher.  T.J. retired about, maybe fifteen years ago.  He's still writing.  He's writing operas and all that kind of thing.  But T.J. did the music to the first performance.  I don't when--it was done again, I, I believe it was in, in Texas, in Dallas.  But I know we did one at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] and Katherine Dunham did the dance, all the dance--it's full of dance music, dances and stuff.  Katherine Dunham did the dances.  This was in the '60s [1960s], late '60s [1960s] or early '70s [1970s].  And then Gunther Schuler did a, did a different score.  And that's the one that was performed in New York.  So those are the four performances that I know of that was done.  I'm not sure about it having been done any more.  It may have been, yeah.
Story_ID: 7158
Speaker 1: I guess I, I like the detective work in this, this, this field.  And when I look back in St. Louis [Missouri] in all the time that I spent trying to track down [Joseph W.] Postlewaite and all the stuff I had to find and ferret out, I probably feel as good about that as about anything because this was something that nobody knew.  And, however, there was, there was--I won't call this a discovery, the--well, the best way to explain is to let you, is to just tell you about it.  Back in the 1970s I was doing some research, and I was looking through the 'Indianapolis Freeman' newspaper, and I came across--and this was, I was looking in the '20s [1920s] and I don't know what I was working on at the time, but I came across a statement saying that Alton Augustus Adams was the first black man--bandmaster in the United States Navy in 1917.  I did not believe it because everything I knew about the Navy was that black, blacks could not serve in the United States Navy as, except as mess attendants and stewards and that's all.  They couldn't do this.  Not until World War II did, did that change.  So I just said somebody is making something up.  About a year later I was in New York.  I was--again, I was at the New York Public Library, and I ran into a similar statement, Alton Augustus Adams was the first black bandmaster in the United States Navy in 1917.  Then it said, in the Virgin Islands.  So I called the Virgin Islands, the, the Enid Baa Library [Enid M. Baa Public Library & Archives, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands] there.  It's a public library, and I asked them if they had any information on somebody who had been a Navy bandmaster in 1917.  I told them I had looked everywhere.  And I could find not a trace of information.  I told them I'd called the Navy.  So she said, "Well, hold the line a minute."  She came back, and she said, "Here's Mr. Adams's telephone number."  (Laughs)  So I called him up.  I called up Mr. Adams and I talked to him.  And I was stunned at what he was telling me.
Speaker 2: He was still alive?
Speaker 1: He was still alive.  This man had a little band on the Virgin Islands.  The Virgin Islands belonged to the Danes.  It was Danish territory.  He had a band that he organized in 1909.  He was a shoemaker's apprentice.  And in 1909, organized this juvenile band to help keep young black kids out of trouble.  1917, the United States detected submar--German submarine activity in the Caribbean.  So they decided that they were gonna buy the, the islands from the Danes and put bases there to use to protect the, the United States from submarine attacks.  So the Danes, of course, bought--they said, they wouldn't sell them.  So the United States just gave them twenty-five million dollars and took them over.  And during the time they were setting up there--this was in 1917, there was a wife of a Navy captain.  His name was Captain [R. William] White, I forget his first name right now.  She heard the Adams Juvenile Band play.  Well, he started it in 1909.  By 1917, they were of age.  They were no longer juveniles, but they still had this, had the same name.  She was shocked.  So she went and got her husband, Captain White.  He heard them.  He was shocked.  He went and got the admiral.  Well, to make a long story short, they got permission from the President of the United States to bring that whole band into the Navy, and with Adams a chief petty officer.  And that's how the first black Navy band got formed.  Now, I started looking at all kinds of newspapers and everywhere.  In 1917, that band was known--I mean no, 1921, that band was known as the best band in the United States Navy.  In 1924, that band toured the United States.  Once I knew where to look (laughter), you know, 1926, it toured the United States to great acclaim, articles in the 'The New York Times', in Washington, D.C. newspapers.  Nobody knew anything about this band.  The United States Navy Band didn't know anything about it.  The United States Navy knew nothing about it.
Story_ID: 7159
Speaker 1: This guy [Alton Augustus Adams] kept everything in duplicate and in triplicate.  I spent time at his house--when I walked into his living room, there were pictures of W.C. Handy, W.E.B. DuBois, John Phillip Sousa, all kinds of people in the United States.  And I'm gonna cut this short, but let me just say that that was the first band, and it was not anonymous.  In 1936--no, '30, '33 [1933], he was asked to organize a band in Cuba.  Now, he'd already organized a band in St. Thomas [Virgin Islands], on St. Croix [Virgin Islands]--two in St. Croix and one in St. Thomas.  And, and he put those bands together and made ninety-nine--no, one--it was a big band.  I forget the--sixty-six-piece band he put together.  And that's the band that got the great acclaim.  Now, in, in Cuba in 1933, I believe it was, he took the band there.  In 1936, he mustered out of the [U.S.] Navy and he moved back to St. Thomas.  He became a newspaper editor.  He wrote also for 'Time' magazine, for 'Pittsburgh Courier, 'Sports Illustrated', doing all this stuff, after having been a, a spit and polish bandmaster, Navy bandmaster.  In 1942, World War II broke out.  Adams was called back into the Navy--that's a long time.  They brought him back into the Navy, they sent him to Cuba to rejoin his band.  Now, all they were doing was shuffling paper, the Navy people.  They didn't know what was going on.  When Adams got there in Cuba, most of his band members had been mustered out.  Some, the ones that were left, were no longer in the band.  They were doing menial work, and there was an all-white band, which according to Mr. Adams, were full with drunks and dope fiends.  So what he did was, he contacted the Navy and asked the Navy, very innocently, if he could bring some of his band members back in and add them to the band.  And they gave him permission.  Well, he put the, the drunks out, kept the white guys who were good, and integrated that band on Cuba.  Now, this guy's got an integrated band in Cuba in 1942.  He mustered out in 1945 when, when the [World] war [II] ended.  And in, in 1968, wash it back up, John Philip Sousa and Edwin Franko Goldman--you know who?  Both of them are famous band, bandmasters.
Speaker 2: Sousa I know.
Speaker 1: Sousa was a Marine band director and Goldman had a professional band in New York.  Well, I can't rem--I can't--I get these two Goldmans mixed up.  One is Richard and one if Edwin Franko, and one is the father and one is the son.  But the Goldman Band used to play on the [National] Mall in New York [sic, Washington, D.C.].  It was a very--in fact, there's a march called 'On the Mall'.  Anyway Sousa and Goldman were so taken with Adams that in 1933, they put his name up for membership in the American Bandmasters Association.  It was an all-white group.  Well, there's a letter in the Adams collection from Goldman, telling of the fact that he was blackballed by a Southern contingent, and he and Mr. Foster--Foster--Mr. Sousa wanted to resubmit his name.  Adams told him he didn't care.  He wasn't interested any longer.  They put it through.  He was admitted, but he wouldn't accept admission.  In 1968, the Goldman's brought him to New York to conduct the Goldman Band.  See, Adams was also a composer in his own music.  And--.
Speaker 2: Fifty years, it was fifty-one years after he started.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they issued--or later on, you remember the New World Records collection, in, in the New World Records collection--I think this came out in the in the '60s [1960s] or '70s [1970s], it must be, they have a record in there called 'The Golden Age of the American March'.  And one of Adams' marches is the first cut on that, on that record.  I wrote an article about, about Adams, and included all this stuff in there.  In the process of writing the article, I went to the Navy Department [Library, Washington, D.C.], I went to the Naval archives.  I did my best to find a scrap of information on Adams, nothing.  This guy kept his stuff.  He kept his discharge papers, he kept, kept everything.  I found out later that the maj--some of the records from that material were warehoused in St. Louis [Missouri].  And the warehouse caught fire and burned down.  So it's a good thing he kept his material.  He had tons of letters.  We have all of his stuff here right now in the Center [for Black Music Research, Columbia College, Chicago, Illinois].  Letters from Souza to, to him, letters from Handy, from all, all those guys.  In 1980, I believe it was, I brought Mr. Adams to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] to receive an honorary degree, honorary doctorate degree for his accomplishments.  And I sent the Navy a copy of my article.  When they got the article, they invited Mr. Adams, since he was gonna be in the United States, to come to Washington [D.C.] and conduct the [United States] Navy Band, which, which really touched that guy, you know.  So we he went on up there in '80 [1980] and conducted the Navy Band in his own marches.  They knew that this, this 'Spirit of the United States Navy', that's one of them, they were playing it, by some guy named Adams. They didn't know who he was.  But that's, that's one of the, the most touching things that, that has happened to me.
Story_ID: 7160
Speaker 1: Well, what's the Great Lakes [Naval Training Center, Great Lakes, Illinois] experience?
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Well, I learned about Great Lakes before I learned about [Alton Augustus] Adams, and, and I--and what happened was, when I was teaching at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], another man was teaching there whose name was Leonard Bowden.  And Bowden was telling me about how blacks couldn't play in Navy bands until 1942.  And he said, "I did it."  I said, "What do you mean you did it?"  He said, "I was responsible for that."  So I found out that he wasn't really responsible for it, but Bowden had been a, a warrant officer or something down at a college in Alabama.  I forget the name of it.  He was in an ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corps] unit down there--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: A black college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a black college.
Speaker 1: Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama] or--?
Speaker 2: No, you know, I'd better not say right now.
Story_ID: 7161
Speaker 1: [Leonard] 'Len' Bowden was the guy's name at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  He was on the faculty there.  And at that time, Bowden was probably in his sixties.  And I thought this stuff was a lot of hyperbole.  He would say things like "Never in the history of the world have there been so many great musicians in one place at the same time," and made all these statements.  You just don't, you know, this old guy is, is just dreaming.  So he said, "I trained five thousand Navy musicians."  Five thousand Navy musicians, come on, 'Fox'--we called him 'the Fox', for the old fox who never slept, the old sly fox.  So, you know, I didn't believe that.  So he came in, and he brought me this picture.  And on this picture was this Navy band, and there was Leonard Bowden standing by the band.  Back in the trumpet section was Jimmy Nottingham, Clark Terry, what's the guy's name?  He was from Chicago [Illinois] too, he died a few years ago, Sykes Smith.  On trombone there was Al Gray and Booty Wood, [from the] [Duke] Ellington, [and] [Count] Basie [bands], there was--I, I was just floored.  I said, "Fox, this is your band?"  He said--(laughs).  He said, "That was one of them."  He said, "I had three bands at Great Lakes [Naval Training Center, Great Lakes, Illinois].  One was at Camp Smalls, one was at Camp Moffett and the other one is Camp Lawrence."  He said, "And all of them were good," he said, "But this is the A band.  This is, this was my band."  So I started paying a little more attention to him about the 5,000 thing and all that and I just thought it was interesting.  I left Florida A&M and, and went to school, of course.  And I was down at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], and Clark Terry came there.  So I told Clark I had seen this picture of the Navy Band, and Clark just went wild.  He said, "Man, let me tell you," (laughs).  He wanted to talk about Great Lakes, talked about Great Lakes.  So the more I talked--Clark talked, the more excited I got about it.  So I'd thought about this thing.  Then I, I called Clark up, and I said, "Hey, why don't we have a reunion of those guys?"  He said, "Man, if you would do that"--he, I mean he was just stunned.  To make a long story short, I started getting addresses for all these people.  And I brought all of them, that would come, and most of them came, to SIU for a weekend reunion.  And we formed the band, Great Lakes Band there.  And we did interviews with them.  What, what I eventually learned was that Leonard Bowden was then heading a band in St. Louis [Missouri] called The Melody Makers.  He had left Alabama and came to, to St. Louis.  And Clark Terry was an eighteen year old guy playing in the George Hudson Band.  So he grabbed Terry after he heard from the Navy Department.  They wanted 'the Fox', Len Bowden, to start recruiting Navy musicians.  So he and Clark Terry were the first ones to go there, and then he started bringing in other people.  He said they had a ruling though that he couldn't touch the Basie Band.  He couldn't touch the Ellington Band.  They wanted these good bands to be playing for the morale of the country.  And they didn't want to mess them up.  He got bands from the, people from the Jeter-Pillar [sic] Band [Orchestra] and all around.  And his job was to bring musicians in, train them in twenty-piece units, and send them out over the country to various naval stations.  And what that amounted to was twenty-five--five thousand band members.  And Clark Terry was one of the people that was helping him train the musicians at, at Great Lakes.  One of the things I--after I, after I learned that this was indeed true, that this happened (laughter), then I started going to documents.  Here's one that I found that was that was stunning.  In order to play in Navy bands, whites had to make a score of seventeen on, on this test.  Blacks had to make a score of thirty-nine.  This is not rumor.  This comes from official records.  I started finding out a lot of stuff, and I, I wrote that piece.  But this experience though, when, when you, when this experience was over in 1945, [Dr.] Huel [Davis] Perkins, who I worked with years, became the band director at Southern University [and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and eventually, the, the dean of the music department and eventually, the vice chancellor at LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]. [Dr. Thomas] Tom Bridge, the violinist, became head of the music department and then a dean at a school in Virginia.  There was another violinist, he was a Nashville [Tennessee] section head down there.  He went later to California as a studio musician, became extremely wealthy.  When you see what these guys-- [William] Sylvester White, the judge here, he was there.  When you see all these people that were there and what they accomplished, it says a lot.  Now, these bands were, were more famous than, than the white bands there.  But ironically, ironically, the discriminatory--the discriminatory requirement, they had to score so much higher than whites, resulted in this Great Lakes experience.  That's my name.  I, I named it that. Once--I, I wrote an article about this ['Great Lakes Experience'], and I published it in, in a journal called 'The Black Perspective in Music', and one of the things that resulted from my studying--let's see.  I did the Adams stuff after this.  I learned, I learned of Adams.  But then, after I did the [Alton Augustus] Adams, I wondered if there was any connection between the Great Lakes experience and the Adams Band.  So one day I was talking to Clark Terry, and I said, "You ever heard of a guy by the name of Alton Augustus Adams?"  And he said, "No, no, no."  And I said, "Well, Mr. Adams told me that he visited Great Lakes once.  And the reason he came to Great Lakes in the 1940s was because the Navy had really ensconced themselves in the Virgin Islands, and they wanted to play American dance music, including jazz.  And he said his musicians couldn't play jazz, the Virgin Islanders.  So he came here and picked up some musicians."  And Clark said, "You talking about 'Triple A'," (laughs).  He said, "You're talking about Triple A."  Everybody called him Triple A, and so he picked up some guys and took them back with him.  And, and that's how they started playing American dance music for the sailors over there.  Anyway, that's, that's another one, of one of the things that have been very refreshing, yeah.

Speaker 1: What are some of the--is there a tragic story, where something's been lost and it hasn't--just can't retrieve and--(unclear)--retrieving?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and, and there's some current things I'm very worried about.  I guess the most recent--well, let me, let me go back.  I'll go all the way back to the Chevalier J.J.O. de Meude-Monpas, who, who wrote a bunch of music and we only have three of his concertos.  There, there's other stuff that I, I wish he had.  And then there was another violinist in England, whose name I can't think of right now.  He also composed a bunch of music, and he lived in England for a long time.  He was, he was a--became a well-known violinist in County Cork [Ireland] and--also--and, and his family immigrated to the United States.  And when that happened, he was dead.  All of his music disappeared.  Nobody knows where it is, and--Joseph Emidy is his name, Emidy.  And all that's gone so we, we'll probably never find that music.  A recent one is what happened to [vibraphonist] Lionel Hampton, when all of his stuff burned down and it burned up in his house, an extremely valuable collection of material.  This guy was more important than people realize.  That's gone.  A local case is, you know Hortense Love, you know who she was?  She was a teacher around here, taught a lot of, of black kids.  And she was singer in her own right herself, in the 1940s, 1950s.  She was known all over the country.  And one day a lady came in, and she said, "I want to donate this book to the Center [for Black Music Research]."  And I opened it, and inside it was a book--it was a biography of William Warfield, inscribed by Warfield to Hortense Love.  So I said, "Where did you get this?"  And she said she got it at a flea market.  Well, I found out that Hortense Love had been to a nursing home.  And then they had sent her stuff out, and all--I mean all the valuable stuff she had.  We had been wanting that collection, want it to put it somewhere, but now scattered and gone.  And the thing I'm worried about right now, remember when I mentioned this person who wrote these fourteen operas [William Grant Still]?  All fourteen of those operas are in North Carolina in a little frame house.  And his heirs won't let it go anywhere.  Over and over again, you hear these stories.  This guy's gonna be erased from history, and he'll be a rumor rather than true.  It would be, it would be, in, in a lot of people's eyes, it's gonna be somebody trying to make up something, you know.  So, this is always a concern.
Speaker 1: Sir--.
Speaker 2: I hope I'm not destroying your, your (laughs).
Speaker 1: No, no, this is all, all valuable material.
Story_ID: 7163
Speaker 1: You said that Columbia's [Columbia College, Chicago, Illinois] been very supportive to your practice [Center for Black Music Research, Chicago, Illinois], and, but if you had your way, you know, what would you--what kind of resources would you have?
Speaker 2: Well, as, as--I don't know if you've been shown around here, but we're out of space.  We are, we are really out of space.  We, we're moving many of our collections into a room that's a computer room.  And I think that's, that's really what, what we need.  We need some kind of space.  And--
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) How large is your collection?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't have the number, but you might want to take a look down the hall, sometime.  But it's growing, I mean it's growing by leaps and bounds.  We--Theodore Charles Stone, you know who he was?  His collection, this guy had done--he, he founded the Chicago Music Association in Chicago.  And he'd been collecting material since the '30s [1930s] or the '20s [1920s], something.  He gave us all of his stuff. [Dr.] Eileen [Jackson] Southern, she, she died last year [2002], and her stuff is coming.  In fact, it's started already coming in.  What's her name?  The trombone player, a woman, played with Ellington, and she wrote the music, wrote music for, for [Duke] Ellington and some other people.  I forget her name now, but she gave us her material.  And we've got all these collections coming in.  And it--?
Speaker 1: I just thought of one of Chicago's more famous musical teachers, Captain Walter Dyett--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from [Jean Baptiste] DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois]. Are there any materials here that were--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) No.  I don't know whether--I, I, I would hope that there's some out at the 95th Street--.
Speaker 1: [Vivian G.] Harsh [Research] Collection [of Afro-American History and Literature, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I would hope so.  But you never know. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me, what are your--because I guess to try to--is there something else you want to tell me about the research and your career, I mean, your career here with--I mean, putting this together.  I mean what has it meant--how has it changed your life, you know, to do this?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It's hard to answer 'cause it is my life.  It's, it's, it's what, you know, who I am, and so I, I--it's hard for me to, to look at it because I'm so in it, you know what I mean? It's hard for me--I guess, frankly, the reason is that I don't have a life outside of this hardly.  You know, it's, this is it, all, all these years.
Story_ID: 7164
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense of the importance of any of this new music in the black community.  I mean hip-hop is fairly old now, you know, it's still relatively new compared to some other forms, and some of the local musicians and their creations and--are you--at Columbia [College, Chicago, Illinois] there's so many young people, black people coming through here, you know, and trying to create a musical legacy.  Have you encouraged them to, you know, document their stuff, preserve their stuff, keep records and, I mean is that part of what you all do here too?  Is that message you're giving out here?
Speaker 2: Well, we usually don't.  And I don't think there's any particular reason for it, but I, I guess the, the reason is--well, let, let's put it this way.  I, I think--what we do, we give workshops on documenting stuff.  And we hope that people will come to those workshops and, and do that kind of thing.  We did some in the Virgin Islands last year.  We've got a field office in, in the Caribbean, and we did some, some of that over there.  As far as documenting it, most of what people do today is gonna be worthless.  That's usually what happens. And the stuff that becomes important, you don't know what it's gonna--what it is, and, you know, will Snoop Doggy Dogg be significant in the future?  You know, or will it be Grandmaster Flash or somebody?  I, I--I--we don't know the answer to those questions.  So I think history sort of works this out somehow.  We don't know if history is right or wrong, but, but somehow, it, it works it out.  Regarding the, the type of music that we hear today, there's a bunch of criticism, as you know, of rap, hip-hop culture and that kind of thing.  I, I, I think that kind of criticism is based on the fact that people are uninformed.  They react to this, this music as if this is the first time in history this has ever happened. Not knowing that when ragtime came about, people were introducing bills into [U.S.] Congress to ban it.  The same thing happened with jazz.  People introduced bills into Congress to ban it.  They didn't mess with R&B [rhythm and blues].  But as soon as Elvis Presley came around, and we started calling it rock and roll, they introduced bills in the Congress to ban it.  There were people all over complaining about this stuff.  This is nothing new, and the reasons are the same.  Just look, look back at ragtime and study ragtime.  People were talking about the morals of our children, and all the same stuff they're talking about today.  So what's gonna happen is what always happens.  When you look back at the English madrigal in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, you see madrigals with the most dirty lyrics you're gonna find anywhere.  But all that stuff went by the wayside because a lot of that stuff, it turns out to be aesthetically trash anyway.  So history works this stuff out.  It's just that people can't seem to deal with it when it's there.  So I look at it and smile (laughs).  And, you know, they, they see me, you know, "What do you think about--isn't this awful?"  I say, "No, it's not.  It's just life.  It's, it's what happens," (laughs).  But, you know, we profit from, from the fact that we do history, and, and we, we can see that happened--that's happened in the past, and it will continue to happen in, in the future.  Therefore, insofar as I'm concerned, I, I don't get excited about it.  People talk about misogyny in rap.  Well, that's true.  You know, you don't want people to be misogynists, but you got to let it play itself out, 'cause you don't have any choice--none whatsoever.  You let history play it out and, and whatever history says is valuable, that's the way it'll be.  And I tell people, "Don't get excited about this."  Now, it's easy to say that if you don't have a nine-year old daughter who's, you know--I remember when I had a nine-year old daughter (laughs), so I can, I can understand it.  But, but I guess I'm in a very privileged position now.  So, but it'll all play itself out, and there's some stuff, people are gonna find there's some good stuff in the future.  And the, the trash usually awaits, you know, it just disappears.
Story_ID: 7165
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns about the black community?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know anymore.  I'm gonna try to explain this.  I guess I have to go back a little bit.  I, I, I--boy, can I just talk about it, and--okay.  In the 1950s--1960s, I'm sorry--when they got ready to integrate the bands in Florida--integrate the schools in Florida, they decided to integrate extracurricular activities the year before, let people get to know each other and all that.  One of the things they, they did was, they decided to integrate the high school--the all-state high school band.  I think they did it with the orchestra too and the choruses.  At that point--well, I'll, I'll get to that point later.  What happened was, when they did these auditions, what they found, to the shock of a number of people, that the kids who were making the first chairs were turning out to be black.  It--that gives you some idea of the critical mass of good musicians that existed in black communities at that time.  But the time that happened, I was somewhere between--I, I think I was at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] when, when that was happening.  And some of my friends who were training some of these kids, when school integration came, they became assistant band directors or supervisors in study halls or driver education teachers or something else.  And that's one thing that happened.  Another thing that happened was that during that same time, while I was at SIU, the schools in Carbondale were still segregated.  Now, this is up North, but you had a white school and a black school.  The black school had a band.  The white school had a bigger band, but the black school had a band, a nice-sized band.  I wouldn't say it was great, but it was, you know, a band.  They decided, of course, that they had to integrate schools also.  Everybody had to integrate schools.  A few years later, there come the integrated school band with a bass drummer and a tuba player that were black.  When I was growing up, when I was growing up, I lived--I mean we, we weren't, we weren't, we didn't have money.  I mean, but my mother [Theora Combs Floyd] was working to support two kids.  But a half of block from where I lived, there was a black doctor.  My dentist was black, and all of us lived in the same neighborhood.  And you had middle-class people who were concerned about the community and making the community better.  Then they started building interstates [highways].  People like me and others like me wanted to live better.  So, you know, we bought houses in white communities, and we started to move--move out.  And the kind of middle-class values started disappearing from, from those communities.  What I'm trying to say here is to some extent the plight of the black community is the fault of integration.  Now, I--no, desegregation--the fault of desegregation, because there was no--the integration that was promised, never happened.  And I guess this should have been very, very predictable.  In the meantime, in, in Chicago [Illinois], they were building Robert Taylor Homes [housing projects] and stuff like that, and Dempsey Travis was railing against it.  And what, what we, we lost a tremendous amount of leadership.  And another thing that happened was some of these kids who were playing flutes and clarinets, black kids. When black became beautiful, people started saying, "What you doing with that white instrument," you know?  "White people play violins, white people play the flute.  Man, you--play the saxophone, you know, like [Charlie] 'Bird' [Parker], okay."  Well, look what happened, the critical mass--and I hate to limit my concept--my, my view to music like this, but that critical mass of musicians started to disappear.  I used to come to Chicago to judge band and orchestra contests in the late '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s], and I heard some of the best organizations anywhere.  I heard an orchestra at Lane Tech[nical High School, Chicago, Illinois] that was better than, than college orchestras.  I didn't come back for several years, and I moved to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  Then I came back in 1980 to judge band contests, and I was appalled, absolutely appalled at what had happened to the bands in, in the City of Chicago.  And a lot of them have disappeared altogether.  And again, that was because of white flight and black flight also.  I, I'm not sure that, that we have taken that history into account or even believe it, or admit it, you know.  And, and the world has changed so much since then.  The--people's values changed with Sputnik.  There, all this emphasis on science and math, which I don't object to, but, but what has happened is we've run the music programs and the arts programs out of the schools.  And I, I don't know if we have the same values anymore that, that will make possible what I would like to see happen.  On the other, on the other hand, when you see projects like the, the Brownville projects, you have to have some hope that, that something is going to happen to, to bring the community together.  And there's a question anymore, what is the community?  Let me give you, give you an example.  You can take this stuff off the tape if you want to (laughter), but--
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) No, just keep going.
Speaker 2: (Laughs). Well, I've been raising money for what I do since 1970.  The only black organization that had ever given us any money until the last couple of years, were The Links [Inc.], and no black corporations have given us any money.  No--very few black individuals.  The only black individual in this town that has given us a consistent report is Dempsey Travis.  We've got nothing from the most wealthy of the black organizations--nothing, not a penny.  I have not been able to get to see many of them, can't get in the door. We've gotten significant money from white organizations--.
Story_ID: 7166
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't mean to give the impression that black people in Chicago [Illinois] as a whole haven't been helpful.  But it's just that the people who, who could really help--I mean some of these people are on the boards of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Lyric Opera and all these things.  And that's fine.  I, I don't object to that.  But the fact (laughter) that, that they could be helpful here [Center for Black Music Research, Columbia College, Chicago, Illinois], it does, does concern me.  There, there's one lady on the South Side [of Chicago, Illinois], she's old, I can tell by her handwriting.  Every year, I get a check for five dollars from her.  And that's worth a lot to me, you know.  But if she can send me five dollars (laughter), what--you know.  There, there's a, there's a--I won't name names, but I went to one place once to see the, the director of corporate contributions.  It's a white firm--I'm sorry, a black firm in town.  And I told him what we were trying to do here and was asking for them to consider giving a grant to the CBMR [Center for Black Music Research].  So the person listened to me and--patiently, you know.  And then he, he said, well, he said, "Well, tell me, Professor Floyd," I remember these words.  He said, "Tell me why I should give you money for that when we've got babies having babies, people on dope and so forth and so on."  I said, "I'm not asking for all your money," you know.  I said, "I just hope that, that you would consider making a contribution to our effort."  And he said he didn't see any, any way they could do that, given their other funding priorities.  And that's okay, but surely, if they, if they were gonna give away twenty-five thousand dollars that year, I'd take five hundred, you know.  But some, somehow our values are so, so different now. And that's important, to try to do something about those community problems, I mean, yeah, you got to do that.  But those same kids ought to know there's something beyond that, you know.  So I don't know anymore.  I, I guess that's what I'm trying to say.  I, I don't have a fix on it anymore.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and with something--would it be fair to say without something like this, there's no, there's alternative to, to that?  I mean to--.
Speaker 1: That's a good, good way to put it, yeah.  Yeah, I, I don't know.  And it, and I don't say, I, I'm not putting this up as the example--as, as more important than anything else.  It's just what I do and the way I, I have to look at this thing, you know.
Story_ID: 7167
Speaker 1: What do you see as, as your legacy thus far?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  I guess in some ways I, I'm not in control of it.  I can tell you what my, my wish is.  I guess the only thing I have any control over and not much, not much of that at all, but I, I hope somebody will be quoting from my books a hundred years from now.  I just--I started out to start writing about this field.  And I, I turned out to be spending a lot more time on administration and program development and, and editing and all that stuff, instead.  I've written a good bit while I'm, while I've been doing this, but I, I hope that my legacy will be in the 'The Power of Black Music' and some other of my writings and especially the, the, the two that I hope to finish when I complete this, the one I'm working on now.
Story_ID: 7168
Speaker 1: Can you kind of give us--go over what your publications are and kind of synopsize them for us, what you're trying to do with each one?
Speaker 2: Well, usually when I write I'm trying to solve problems, and, and I'm trying present to, to the scholarly community and to the general public, information that they don't, won't get otherwise--like the pieces on the Great Lakes [Great Lakes Naval Training Center, Great Lakes, Illinois] experience.  Nothing has been written about that.  Like Alton Adams, like composer [Joseph William] Postlewaite, information that I don't think anybody else knows about or would write about.  I, I try to do that for one thing.  The other thing I, I try to do is solve problems.  For example, a couple of years ago I published a piece called 'Black Music in Circum-Caribbean'.  I've always been intrigued by two things about the Caribbean.  One is that tremendous and contradictory array of music that exists out there.  It's a ton of music.  It's very confusing.  You've got the bolero in Brazil; you've got the bolero in Cuba.  You got a bolero over here, and none of them are the same.  They're all different.  If we're talking about the bolero, people start arguing about the bolero, and you're talking about two different kinds of music.  And, there, there are all kinds of contradictions and, and, and everything about the Caribbean.  So how do you understand the Caribbean.  You got Latin American music, you got West Indian music, and you got all kinds of genres and mixtures in between there.  So I wrote this music--this article called 'Black Music in the Circum-Caribbean', and what I tried to do was develop a concept, a way of understanding and looking at it and make sense.  I think it works.  Anyway, that's what I tried to do.  So in, in my articles, I--that's the kind of thing I like to work on.  The--I, I've done books before, but nothing like the--I, I kind of discount them because with 'The Power of Black Music' I really set out to solve a problem for myself in order to explain what makes black music so powerful.  That was the task I, I set for myself.  And I started with, with African music, and I dealt with black music in the United States and came up with a theory of, of--with an aesthetic theory about how this music--what, what makes it what it is.  Now, I came to that--the book I was telling about, I wanted to write and over the years, I've tried to get back to it.  And I would work on it a little bit, but I would--I never felt good about it because I didn't want to write a straight history book.  I wanted a book that people can read and say, yeah, that's, that's the way that, that is.  When Sterling Stuckey's book came out, 'Slave Culture', Stuckey in that book took the position that all black culture, all black expressive culture came out of the ring shout, the ring shout that existed in, in slave culture, and decided, you know, but when I read that book, I was, I was stunned to find, to start agreeing with him.  So I said, I think maybe, maybe this is gonna be part of my answer.  But I didn't know--I still didn't know what to do with it.  A few years later, I was over at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] at the humanities center.  I was in residence there for a while, and [Henry Louis] Skip Gates's book had just come, come out, 'The Signifying Monkey'.  I picked up Gates's book, and I started reading it.  And as I was reading it, I started to say, hey, this is, is, this fits like a glove into Stuckey's hypothesis.  Stuckey had developed a hypothesis that black expressive culture came out of the ring shout.  Gates had developed a theory of, of inquiry based on the concept of signifying.  So what I did was say, I'm gonna put Gates's theory into Sterling's hypothesis, and I'm gonna see where it goes.  So I wrote an art--wrote an article called 'Ring Shout', where I wedded, wed those two things. Published the article.  The next thing I knew, I got a call from the editor of Oxford University Press saying, "How about doing a book on this?"  So right away, I said, I--now, I got, I've got my foundation.  I knew all--I know all the information.  Now, I got a way to put this and conceive it.  And, and that's how I wrote 'The Power of Black Music'.  And it went out of press pretty quickly. They did a second printing, and then they did a, the, the--what do you call it,  the paperback edition.  So it, it went well.  But in that book, I only dealt with black music in the United States, coming out of Africa.  So I immediately started on a book that has the, the working title of 'Music in the Black Diaspora'.  In that book, I deal with everything I didn't deal with in 'The Power of Black Music'.  I deal with black music in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe, those, those three, three countries, spanning the entire range of genres and, and the entire chronological range.  And one of the reasons I wrote the Caribbean article was because I needed to have a concept that I could grab hold to and others could grab onto in writing, in dealing with this book I'm writing now.  So it's kind of problem solving and, and presenting information that hasn't been, been presented before.  People have been trying to get me to write a history book.  I don't want to do that.  You know, somebody was born in eighteen so and so and so, and this happened and then that happened.  To me, that's, that doesn't drive me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I support it being done because I wouldn't have--I wouldn't have the information I need if, if it hadn't been for Eileen Southern's book ['The Music of Black Americans: A History'], which is a straight history, you know.
Story_ID: 7169
Speaker 1: And you said that you also found a biographical dictionary of black composers here or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was called 'The International Dictionary of Black Composers'.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that kind of--you know, those kind of facts are needed for what you're talking about and it's needed probably even more, in being to understand what you (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, what's happened in this field is initially there was a, there was fact finding.  You'd find facts, and, and you put them, put them into context.  Now, while that facts finding was going on, there also emerged over here, some theorizing.  And the first example was in the '60s [1960s] with LeRoi Jones's [aka Amiri Baraka], 'Blues People' ['Blues People: Negro Music in White America'].  I mean that, that broke the, the string of, of fact finding, of fact presentation books.  And see, but we had them going on simultaneously.  After LeRoi Jones, there was--what's the guy's name?  He worked at the NEA [National Endowment for the Arts] for a while, called 'Black Music'.  He was a poet.  And it was a pretty darned good book.  There, there was that kind of thing.  But there was no theorizing, no more theorizing until I wrote 'The Power of Black Music', and what we see now as people are picking up on this. I edit a book series, the University of California Press.  And there are two books coming out of that thing, both of which I, I commissioned, that are gonna be humdingers.  One is by a guy from Chicago [Illinois].  He teaches at University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] now.  I met him on the street and urged him to go to graduate school.  And he's coming out with a, with a book that's going to be a hard-hitting--it deals with post-World War II black music, and it's, it's--it deals with the music, and what makes the music what it is.  And this other one is a book on--what's it called?  Black--, oh shoot.  It's about black sacred music, but in the process this deal--this guy deals with black secular music as, as much as he did--does with black sacred music.  And it's a powerful piece of work.  So we got this stuff in press right now, that's gonna come out.  And so things change, just like when Eileen Southern came--she had her day, and that book ['The Music of Black Americans: A History'] was powerful and it'll last.  But there'll never be another book written like that.  My book ['The Power of Black Music'] came along, and then my book seemed to be the one that was the thing.  These two books that are coming out are gonna make irrelevant (laughter).  They, they, they--in a way, in a sense.  Both of them draw on my work, like I drew on Eileen Southern, but these--the advance in scholarship on black music is, is has really been taking off.  And it's the way it should be.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean your work would never irrelevant.  It's to some link in this advance, you know, without, you know, you wouldn't be able to make the advance, and, you know?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I agree (laughter).
Speaker 2: It's true.  Now, did your mother [Theora Floyd] get a chance to, you know, see you as--I mean to see the importance of what you're really doing or?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.  She died in '90 [1990]-what?  '91 [1991], '92 [1992], somewhere around in there, and saw some of it.
Story_ID: 7170
Speaker 1: This last question is kind a little different from the legacy question, but how would you like to be remembered?  I mean it's not time yet, but it's only gonna come.
Speaker 2: You know, I, I never think about that.  What, what I think about--and maybe I don't want to think about it.  I don't, I don't know.  Since you asked the question, let me just try to answer it.  What I think about is making tracks, and, and the reason I think about that I guess is because I felt like all the time I've doing administration--I mean, I, I spent three years here in the early '90s [1990s] in administration.  I was the academic dean for the college [Columbia College, Chicago, Illinois].  Later, I spent two years as provost.  So added to the, added to the administration and fundraising work I do for the CBMR [Center for Black Music Research, Columbia College, Chicago, Illinois], there's that--all that took me away from writing, which, which I really wanted, wanted to do.  So right now I'm thinking about making tracks so that I will be remembered, and, and maybe somebody will be quoting me, like I'm quoting people.  I quote people from a hundred years ago right now.  And I, I guess that's important to me.  This I hadn't thought about until you answered the question.  And I guess your question was--triggered the fact that I'd been away from, from the CBMR.  But while I was away from the CBMR this last time, I took on the responsibility of restructuring the entire college.  And a very controversial move, one which saw a lot of opposition, and, but which happened successfully.  There was a lot of, of resistance.  I remember one person on campus said, "You will restructure this institution over my dead body."  I, I--now, what I knew because of my training, I knew that anytime you try to restructure an institution, this happens.  I mean, you get a lot of resistance.  You just don't do this in higher education.  I knew that--I also knew, because studies told me, that after an institution is restructured, those same people start asking why didn't we do this before?  That's already happening (laughter).  That, that's what gave me the courage to do this in the face of all this opposition.  I mean opposition from faculty all the way up to the board of trustees.  But I took the position with the understanding that that's what I would do.  And I, I guess, now that you're thinking about--now, that you mentioned, asked the question, and I'm thinking about it, I'd like, I'd like to be remembered as somebody who did a good thing for the college.  I think that's a fair thing to say.  I, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: And for founding the Center for Black Music Research?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, it, not--when you say that, it's very interesting because I think now, right--I don't think about this much, I think that that doesn't mean much to, to me because I guess I've always taken the position, looking at what happens in institutions, is that five or ten years, nobody'll know who Sam Floyd was, really.  The Center will at least be here, and nobody will know.  So I guess, I, I don't have that--I don't think wishfully about that because in my experience, that's just what happens.  But we've put out enough stuff.  I mean for twenty years, I've edited a scholarly journal, and that, that legacy is more important to me than the Center for Black Music and Research, although the Center made that possible.  'Dictionary' ['International Dictionary of Black Composers'], a book series that we're doing jointly with the University of California Press, I think all those things are important.  And, you know, as far as the legacy is concerned, my name is on, on all of it, as editor and author.  And I think that's what's really, really important.  I mean I would, I wouldn't knock it if one day I, I looked down here out of the sky and see that people remember Floyd for the CBMR, but I don't think it'll happen (laughter).  This is all so early.  I have some control over what I write, and I'm getting it in print.  I'm controlling that.  I don't think they'll burn all the books.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Speaker 2: (Laughter), but, but with, with the institution, with the, with the Center I--what I'd like for, for--to happen, is for people to remember that Rosita Sands was director of the Center.  I think she's my legacy, and I hand picked her.  When I took over the, the provost position, I started looking--I decided to retire.  And she had been involved with the Center for a while, and it's important to me now, as far as the Center is concerned that she succeeds and move things forward.  And she's gonna do that, no quest--no question.
Speaker 1: Okay, as long as there are books and as long as there're tapes, I guess, these tapes survive.
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: You'll be remembered.
Speaker 2: (Laughter), right.
