Speaker 1: Today is September 17, the year 2002.  I am Adele Hodge, the interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  And our camera person is Scott Stearns.  We're talking today with Dr. Billie Wright Adams.  Dr.--and we're, well I'll let you do the location.  Would you give us your full name and spell it for me?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My name is Billie Morris Wright Adams.  The first name is B-I-L-L-I-E, my middle name is M-O-R-R-I-S, my maiden name, Wright, W-R-I-G-H-T, and my married name, Adams, A-D-A-M-S.  The Billie Morris is related more to the fact that my family I think really wanted a junior.  My father's name was William Morris Wright and my oldest sibling, a sister, of course did not have that honor of being a junior.  So I'm pretty sure that my family wanted me to carry some of my father's name, hence I was named Billie Morris Wright.  The story is that my mother wanted me to be named Wilhelmina and I would have had my father's initials, WMW.  But I'm glad that they selected Billie.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.  Will you tell us where we're located (unclear)?
Speaker 2: In Chicago, Illinois in the studio of The HistoryMakers.
Speaker 1: 1900 S. Michigan.
Speaker 2: In 2002.
Story_ID: 72188
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your older sister--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --is the only other sibling?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My sister's--
Speaker 1: Her name?
Speaker 2: --name was Francis Eileen Wright Sanders who was born prior to the time that my family arrived in my Blue--my birthplace of Bluefield, West Virginia.  As a matter of fact I have the distinction in my family of being the only one born in Bluefield, West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.  And when were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born May 15th.
Speaker 1: Great.  And your family, where did they come from?
Speaker 2: Well my maternal family came from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with roots in North Carolina.  My mother was born and reared in Philadelphia.  However, her father and grandparents were born in Warrington, North Carolina.  And my--
Speaker 1: And--okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Give me her name, her full name--
Speaker 2: Okay, her name was--
Speaker 1: --and her birth date if you have it.
Speaker 2: Mamie Johnson Wright, and I am not quite sure of the year.  I would have to stop and think but December 17th in the early 1900s.  She was the daughter of an extremely active civilly minded, civic minded gentleman, William Thomas Mitchell Johnson.  All of those names, yes "W.T.M." as they called him.  And my maternal great-great grandfather had been a post-reconstruction state senator in North Carolina.  And my maternal great-great grandmother was originally from Washington, D.C.  But my mother of course had all of her early years in Philadelphia.  My father [William Morris Wright] was born in Forsyth, Georgia and went to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania which at that time was just on the outside of Philadelphia, which was an all-boys' school.  And the boys in Philadelphia used to date the girls and the girls from Lincoln University would go to Philadelphia and it was there through friends that my parents met.  And after being married, my dad went to Howard Medical School [Howard University College of Medicine in Washington, D.C.] and did his internship at Freedmen's Hospital in [Washington] D.C.  But while there he had a patient, a minister from Bluefield [West Virginia] and it was during that time that he developed a relationship with this gentleman who encouraged my father to move to Bluefield, West Virginia, telling him that it was an active community, he was sure he could make a living because by this time my parents had my sister and so they moved.  But Bluefield wasn't too foreign because my mother had a brother, my maternal uncle, Preston Johnson, was a professor at Bluefield State [College].  So that gave a little more credibility to Bluefield [West Virginia].  So my family moved to Bluefield [West Virginia] and that was where I was born.
Story_ID: 72189
Speaker 1: So your grandparents, great-grandparents were not in slavery, they were all free?
Speaker 2: No, my great grand--well my, yeah my maternal great-grandmother was.  Now I understand that my paternal great-grandfather was but my, as I understand, my maternal great-grandmother was fairly well educated and learned to play the piano early and did a lot of reading and was associated with a family in Forsyth [Georgia].  My maternal [sic, paternal] grandfather in addition to being a barber in that small community in Forsyth, he also--they were undertakers as well.
Speaker 1: Is--
Speaker 2: But they tell stories about their ancestors who had been in slavery.
Speaker 1: Oh wow, what kind of stories have you heard?
Speaker 2: Well for one thing on my maternal side I understand that my maternal great-grandmother had a, just a drive to learn to read and was sometimes punished in the form of corporal whipping because she was caught reading.  She was supposed to be in the house as a servant for the family who lived in North Carolina.  And I imagine their names were Johnsons, the family.  Now on my father's [William Morris Wright] side, the paternal family came from a plantation of Rutherfords that was outside of Forsyth, Georgia.  And I understand that they had the good fortune of learning fairly early to learn and it was a tremendous thirst for education in the family.  My father in that small town in Georgia had the--one thing that they talk about is that the senator [sic, governor] who was certainly known as an ardent segregationist, [Eugene] Talmadge, was from that community.  But my grandfather who had a barber shop owned a barber shop on one of the main streets in Forsyth [Georgia], had Talmadge as one of his customers as I understand.  And I used to hear stories about him and of course his ardent denial of rights for voting and all the other things.  But they were able particularly from my maternal--my paternal rather, grandfather had a lot of property there in Forsyth [Georgia].

Speaker 1: Your sister was how many years your senior?
Speaker 2: My sister [Francis Eileen Wright Sanders] was five years my senior and was a very loving big sister, though I'm sure I was a big nuisance to her because I was very curious as a child and wanted to hang around with her.  And she was indeed very interested in being a teacher.  She was a teacher.  She had gone to Virginia State [University in Ettrick, Chesterfield County, Virginia], then to Columbia [University in New York City, New York] where she got her masters in administration supervision in the early, early education and taught at Virginia State College.  And I used to go to visit her and I'm sure that I was a pain.  All of her friends knew me as the little sister.  But I do have loving memories.
Story_ID: 72191
Speaker 1: And what was it like growing up in the Wright household?
Speaker 2: Well first of all, our parents [William Morris Wright and Mamie Johnson Wright] were very warm, very hugging, loving, very demonstrative.  My father of course had to work extremely hard to make a living.  Bluefield was a community that was in that part of Southern West Virginia, one of the largest communities.  We had a college there, Bluefield State College which was a predominantly black institution and my father in addition to having a private practice, was a physician for the boys.  And they had a big football team and therefore living in Bluefield as it related to being black in that community, we had the debate teams, the drama teams, the choirs, the athletic groups be it basketball or football who would come to the college campus.  And so we did a lot of things around the college in addition to the fact that there was quite a community of middle class people in Bluefield while some of the principal institutions were segregated as it related to the public library and the schools.  But our parents insisted that we have lots of books, lots of books at home.  My mother felt it very important we read and we have social graces and when we were little my mother did not work.  It's interesting on both sides of the family, my mother's side of the family was extremely interested in education, higher education for the boys.  The girls were not quite as important for the completion.  My mother attended a junior college but it was important that the girls learn to have social graces and be good wives where her brothers were highly educated.  And if you think about it, her uncle, my great uncle, had received his M.D. and Ph.D. from the University of Chicago [Illinois] over seventy some odd years ago.  He's now deceased.  He went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  He had finished Penn State [Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pennsylvania] and then he came here to Chicago and then he went back to Howard as Professor of Physiology because he had gotten his Ph.D. in Physiology. His name was Joseph L. Johnson.  And then from that professorship he became chairperson and then was there as the dean for a term at Howard School of Medicine.  My mother--my father's side on the other hand was extremely interested in education for everybody but it felt very strong that the girls, so that the girls would not have to do what he considered menial work, that they would not have to work in the kitchens, exposure themselves to some of the indignities of having a white boss.  But the sisters, the two sisters were teachers.  But from that very small community in Forsyth, all of my father's brothers but one attended college.  One went for a couple of years and I had one uncle who was a physician who is younger than my father, moved to West Virginia to a place called Welch, West Virginia.  And then another brother was a professor at Clark University [Worcester, Massachusetts], chairman of the business department and left, went to New York to get his Ph.D., became involved in stocks and never went back, never got his Ph.D., but to get his masters.  The other brother did finish school in Georgia and then became a funeral director and the other brother, I have to stop and think.  The other brother finished Morris Brown [College] in Atlanta [Georgia] and got his masters and started teaching in New York but found out that when the summer time came because he had a wife, he was not able to sustain himself.  So he also worked very actively on the railroad with the Pullman Porters with Randolph [A. Philip Randolph] and he was very active with Randolph, very active with Adam Clayton Powell in New York.  So beside the two brothers, we are the only ones who were, had roots in Bluefield [West Virginia].
Story_ID: 72192
Speaker 1: So we knew that it was very important that we have training but even more so that we did community service.  My dad [William Morris Wright] was very civic minded and was active there in the city and at the college.  He likewise became interested in politics so he did not want an elective office but he did serve as chairman of the democratic branch for the Negroes as they called it, living in Southern West Virginia and was very supportive.  And also at that time there was a very active Lincoln University [Chester County, Pennsylvania] alumni club.  And as you can imagine in that small state because West Virginia is a small state, that there were few alumnists from Lincoln but the lovely thing about it is that we had Langston Hughes who came to our home.  Langston Hughes had graduated from Lincoln and came and spent time at our home and read and we have a book that he signed.  Somehow another, the other books were lost in moving but we just of course didn't value it as much.  Also Thurgood Marshall had been a graduate of Lincoln, Pennsylvania who had come to Bluefield [West Virginia].  It was not that far away from D.C. and some people would come there sort of as a respite, just to get a little rest.  But we did have the sponsorship of the Lincoln Alumni like Horace Mann Bond who was the president of Lincoln, the youngest one, [HM] Julian Bond's father who came to our home.  And then when my father [William Morris Wright] died, came there to eulogize my dad on the part of his activity at Lincoln University.  So they had people from the capital, Charleston [West Virginia], some of the smaller communities who all got together.  And because it was a college town and Bluefield was named as the gateway to the billion dollar coal fields, we didn't have coal mines right in Bluefield but within a radius of twenty some odd miles were coal mines.  But in our community we had coal operators, coal owners, the railroad was big.  In fact Bluefield was the center for the Norfolk and Western Railroad and that the purpose of that mainly was to transport the coal from the coal fields to other parts going east.  And so my dad knew all of those, knew a lot of the people in the community.  And I was getting ready to say, with it being the billion dollar coal fields, we also had a lot of musicians who would come there.  Some of the big bands we remember.  Duke Ellington would bring his band because at the college the sororities and fraternities and the alumni groups would sponsor them in addition to the fact they would go to their one night stands and what we called the coal mines.  So I just have good memories of having those people who were in and out of our home and then with my father being a physician, some of the band members who would become ill when they would travel that area, my dad would see them as patients.
Story_ID: 72193
Speaker 1: With all of that education in your background, around you, tell me, trace for me what you were like in school and some of the more outstanding memories you have from elementary school through high school?
Speaker 2: Well when I first started out, I went to a home where they had a private school.  There was a Mr. Toya and my family teased me because they told me I was attending Toya Institution.  Mr. Toya had about six or eight children there and was quite a disciplinarian when it came to the basic education, you know the reading and writing, literature and so forth and so on.
Speaker 1: And grade?
Speaker 2: And after that, I was there from about the level of kindergarten till about the fourth or fifth grade when Mr. Toya closed his school and then I attended Young Street School which was very close to our home and that was a school that had a, an all-black faculty.  Remember, those days that a lot of those blacks who had higher education could not get jobs elsewhere.  So we had some very strong teachers, not all equal but some of them were very strong. And then my dad [William Morris Wright] was very insistent, even some of my friends would say, "Does Dr. Wright always have to ask us about school when we come to play?"  I said, "Yes," but he would always want us to know about what we were doing in school and what were we learning and the books.  As a matter of fact we probably had more books in our home than we had in our school at that time.  That was because my parents were so insistent that we have book--and certainly books about African Americans as I told you, Langston Hughes.  And I remember my mother [Mamie Johnson Wright] on the other hand having born, been born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], father [William Thomas Mitchell Johnson] had attended the church that Marian Anderson's family attended and had been very instrumental in getting funds for her to have a scholarship.  And we would go to Bluefield--we would leave Bluefield every summer, my sister and I would go to Philadelphia and we would stay for a month or two.  Then my parents would drive up in around Labor Day and then drive back to Bluefield.  But going to Philadelphia we were, my dad would pay my aunt to be sure we went to Philadelphia and we would see plays or we'd see museums, the things that they felt we may not get in Bluefield.  And we would always at times see Marian Anderson would come to visit our grandfather who at that time unfortunately had a stroke and could not verbalize--sorry he couldn't have been one of The HistoryMakers but he was unable to verbalize.  But she was very gracious in coming to see him.  And then Matthew Henson who had been on the--Ice Paul the Iceman was also someone that my grandfather knew, my maternal grandfather.  So that combination between both the eastern part and having my father from Georgia.  So you can imagine that this was a biggie.  It was not a choice for us were we going to college, the choice was where are you going?
Story_ID: 72194
Speaker 1: Was it--so after your private tutoring how did your education process shift?
Speaker 2: Well they had, as I told you they had segregated schools and I did go to Young Street [School].  There were two, as a matter of fact at that time there were three grammar schools for black kids.  There were--both--all of them were named for the streets, Young Street, Lawson Street and then Young Street and that was very close to our home and we could, I could walk to that school.  And again, I think that with my parents' enhancement that I got a good beginning.  Then at that time they did have a junior high school which was called Genoa High School, was really behind our home in the alleyway behind our home.  And it was there that I had an opportunity to meet kids that I didn't know quite as well who had attended on the north side and the east side of comm--of the town.  As I told you, this was the center for the railroad and it was a shopping center for people who lived in the coal fields.  They had very nice shops and whatever you wanted if they didn't have it in stock your parents could order it for you and that made it really nice.  We were able to walk where we wanted to walk.  We could be driven over to the college, walk over to the college so that was very enriching having the college plus, as I said my family's interested.  And from that Genoa Junior High School I went to Genoa High School and the only thing that I regret is that we didn't have some of the equipment such as a big science laboratory.  We just did not have that equipment.  And because my parents [William Morris Wright and Mamie Johnson Mitchell Wright] were insistent that we have another language my parents had a Latin tutor and I don't remember hardly anything about Latin except what I've had to learn for medicine.  But they did try to exposure me to the tutor and of course I was teased a lot about that from some of my friends.  But it really didn't matter because I had some good bonding from friends.
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, you know grade school, high school years and were you aware that there was a set of experiences that were so unlike your own?  And what brought that awareness?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.  As you will recall that while West Virginia had succeeded from Virginia in terms of slavery but they still had facilities that were segregated.  I mean waiting rooms were not necessarily segregated in terms of the trains or the bus, but the movies were segregated.  And my father refused for us to go to the movie.  There was a movie there that I remember very well called The Colonial and the entrance for the black patrons was through an alley and my father refused to let us go, although my sister [Francis Eileen Wright Sanders] did go with her friends to see the movies.  And there was another movie called The Granada and there you would enter into the, sort of a door in the front, the side, but blacks had to go to the balcony.  And on rare occasions if there were movies that my mother felt may have some interest to us, we could go to that movie.  But I never went to The Colonial once I realized that one had to go down the alley, absolutely no way.
Story_ID: 72195
Speaker 1: So at college time how did you come to major in zoology?
Speaker 2: Well, I always thought I wanted to be a physician.  I used to go with my dad [William Morris Wright].  One of the big things was when you ask about growing up, no matter how late it was or how tired he was, he would use, he always tried to take us out for a ride, sometimes during the day.  If that was to make calls with him where he would go up and down the mountains and it was important to the families, we would go with him.  And I just had more interest than my sister [Francis Eileen Wright Sanders].  And I, in fact I was extremely interested and curious about what he was doing.  And I would ask permission "could I go?" and he would let me go.  He always felt again, that women should have the opportunity to be educated. But when I first went to--I attended, I got my undergraduate school degree rather from Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  As you know that was in Nashville, that is in Nashville, Tennessee and my paternal aunt had attended Fisk and we had talked about it.  But she was really the old school, everything was being, about being very proper and I was somewhat of a tomboy.  And Aunt May thought I should dress a certain way, sit a certain way, and likewise my mother [Mamie Johnson Wright].  But they knew that in spite of being a tomboy, I wasn't an athlete though my sister could skate well and ride the bicycle, but I guess I was more in the climbing of trees and being curious about things and particularly about things that my dad was doing in medicine.  So when I got to college, I knew that I liked animal life.  We had had a pet when I was young.  I wasn't interested in veterinary medicine which of course would have been a good choice.  But I thought getting into medical school--but toward the end I fell in love and thought that maybe it would be too long to go to medical school and at that time I was particularly interested in going into OB-GYNY and I just didn't think that would be compatible with a family life because I wanted a family life.  So I decided I would perhaps opt to get a Ph.D.  I knew I had to do more than a bachelor's, so I went to Indiana University in Bloomington, I got a master's and then I decided at that time that I did not want to get a Ph.D., that I really wanted to work.  So I did some research at Indiana University Medical School [School of Medicine] in Indianapolis and I soon got tired of that because I liked people and then I decided that I wanted to go back to medical school.  And in the meantime my husband at that time was living in Chicago [Illinois] so I came here and did for a short time some research at the University of Illinois Medical College as I was preparing to go back to school to get my M.D.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you got married?
Speaker 2: When I got married, I was twenty, twenty-six.
Speaker 1: And you met your husband [Frank McClinton Adams] in college?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 72196
Speaker 1: --We were going to continue in your history was how you met your husband.  And give me his full name again.
Speaker 2: My husband's name was Frank McClinton Adams who was born in Nashville, Tennessee, was unlike me, he was from an extraordinarily large family, from a family of 15 with one set of twins in the family.  And as far as I know he was the eleventh child.  And as you can imagine that in a family like that, some of the older sibling sort of took the younger ones and his older sister really became a surrogate mom to him, his sister Elizabeth.  Unfortunately, Frank's mother died when we were in school so I never had the pleasure of knowing his mother but I've heard wonderful things about him [her].  But his father lived to quite an old age, living in Nashville.  So we met first at Fisk [University in Nashville, Tennessee].  We had seen each other around the campus but actually did not develop any strong bonding to tort of--toward our senior year there.  He was a physical education major and I was more serious as a zoology major and also working as a teaching assistant there in zoology.  And we went to one of the fraternity dances together and we became very close and then we both went to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana].  But I thought at that time that I was in love with someone else who was from Indiana and we all were at IU for a while.  But I was the only one who really, really remained there and completed my graduate work.  Frank came to Chicago [Illinois], that time got a job as a salesperson in a button company but we still maintained a very close relationship and eventually married.  And since he was living in Chicago after I-- medical--in fact, we married when I was still in medical school, a sophomore in medical school and I used to come to Chicago a lot.  But because of him and for training, I then came to Chicago to complete my training, my internship and residency.
Speaker 1: How many children do you have?
Speaker 2: I have one, one child, although we lost four boys but we have one son, Frank McClinton Adams, Jr.
Speaker 1: And what is he doing today?
Speaker 2: He is an attorney.  He was born in Chicago, had his early education here at University of Chicago Lab School [Laboratory School], then he went to St. Ignatius College Prep, finished St. Ignatius, went to Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] and then came to Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois] to get his law degree and his masters in law in Northwestern and is currently in the city working on his own and still trying to grow.
Story_ID: 72197
Speaker 1: You said you had some other stories that you wanted to touch on that we didn't touch on earlier.
Speaker 2: Yes, about growing up in Bluefield [West Virginia].  I told you that we had a lot because of the college, we had a lot of the entertainers and writers and some of the public figures who did come to Bluefield and I just--so many of them I remember hearing my parents speak about but I really don't remember actually seeing them.  I have a vague recollection as I told you of Langston Hughes but also we had a cousin who is really a brother to me, Wallace Harris who I dearly loved who stayed with us who was born in Philadelphia but came to Bluefield for high school as well as for college.  And Wallace just, I loved a great deal.  And when any of the entertainers would come to the home because my--we had a piano and they would play the piano in the home and they'd tell stories about the fact that there was a man who taught in the high school there who had gone to Lincoln [University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] who was originally from Baltimore [Maryland] who played the piano but not extraordinarily well, but he loved played jazz.  And when--I remember the story telling that Earl Hines, Earl "Fatha" Hines who is one of the giants in jazz came to Bluefield.  My parents [William Morris Wright and Mamie Johnson Wright] told my--Wallace that he should come down and meet and hear Earl "Fatha" Hines.  He said, "I don't want to hear that man.  I'd rather hear Mr. Jefferson."  This was the teacher who wasn't as well known and of course who just played at the piano.  But little did we know of the giants who were in our home at that time.  Of course now we have thought about it and remembered and while Wallace enjoyed jazz and has become quite an enthusiast, we enjoyed it too.  But because my mother's connection with Marian Anderson, we always had the music of Marian Anderson, Dorothy Maynor, our next door neighbor had taught at Hampton [Institute in Virginia] and had taught Dorothy Maynor who was an opera singer at the time and so we used to hear her practice.  And next door to us, our neighbor used to practice the scales and we remember as little children hearing her going up and down the opera scales.  But we came to love mainly jazz and then we liked he spirituals.  We enjoyed more the spirituals.  It was very little gospel music that we heard growing up but we certainly did hear as I said with my mother and Marian Anderson.  And she remembered Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Symphony so we had a balance.  But for the most part, we were privy to hear so many of the early jazz people who came there and there were a lot of schools and a lot of colleges.  I remember hearing my parents talk about that Alabama State [University in Montgomery] had a good jazz band and many of those were students who left the school and traveled on the road. And my dad always had a special heart for students and particularly for college students and so there were a lot of these students who would come over, jazz--because he knew that they really didn't have decent places to eat or decent areas where they could live and there was always someone extra and the college boys.  And my mother would frequently say to my dad whose name was William but they affectionately called him "Mick."  "Mick, I don't have any more food."  He said, "Yes you can open up some cans.  You have baked beans.  You can always do something."  So always looking up and having someone else at our table or spending the night was definitely very commonplace in our home.  And that sort of enriched us and made us always interested in having people around.
Story_ID: 72198
Speaker 1: And then as I said, since Bluefield [West Virginia] had also a neighboring school which was predominantly school for whites, Bluefield College which was on the borderline of Bluefield, Virginia.  And again as I told you there were a lot of very wealthy coal operators and railroad executives.  So I remember as a little girl we would drive to what we call South Bluefield and there was a newspaper publisher and owner who had a very large estate with peacocks on the estate.  And our parents [William Morris Wright and Mamie Johnson Wright] would drive us--there was a fence that you could see through and we would see these peacocks.  So in our, through our travels with our dad, we were exposed to the lot of the things around.  There was a mountain there called East River Mountain and we would drive up on the mountain and while coming down my dad would sometimes lower the brake and there was that flip like in my stomach.  I can't say it any other way, thrill and I would just with glees say, "Daddy, do it again.  Daddy, do it again."  So there were a lot of things around there where we didn't have the recreational things other than at the school, we just had a very rich--it was warm.  There were so many friends of our family were very supportive us.  Our neighbors we had on one side of our neighbors as I told you, they had an undertaking parlor, funeral directors, and upstairs is where they lived.  And one sister was an opera singer, the other one was a teacher there in West Virginia for a while, then went to [Washington] D.C.  But they would bring nieces and nephews and one of the grandchildren would come from Detroit [Michigan] and we always had a lot of people to play with and talk about other places outside of Bluefield.  And to the right of us, we actually in that little town had some white neighbors who lived--there was a company below and they lived upstairs.  And as children we played with them but it was very clear that their educational ambitions were not quite the same as our family as well as our neighbors and the people who lived immediately around us.
Story_ID: 72199
Speaker 1: What was life like in your environment during the Civil Rights late--Movement, late Fifties [1950s] and through the Sixties [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well when I first went to Fisk [University in Nashville, Tennessee], there--that--Nashville was highly segregated.  I was not there at the height of when those very, very courageous people had the sit in.  But we did our form of protest by not going to any of the theaters downtown in Nashville.  Across from the campus on Jefferson Street was a theater and the students from Fisk would attend there.  And of course as you know also across the street was MeHarry [MeHarry Medical College] and much further up the street on Jefferson Street was Tennessee State [University] so that there were colleges there that we had a good exchange with and so we had a lot of the theater group.  But I remember so well that you know to barrow that term, I'm not a big George Bernard Straw--Shaw lover, but young--what "youth was wasted on the young" because on the campus at that time we had the likes of Aaron Douglas, outstanding artist and we would just speak to Mr. Douglas and say "hello" and look at what he was doing.  But did we ever stop to get Mr. Douglas' autograph?  No.  Also, we had Georgia O'Keeffe who came to Fisk because he developed the Carl Van Vechten Gallery on Fisk which at that time had the largest--are the best collection of modern American art anywhere in the South because the other institutions, be it Vanderbilt [University in Nashville, Tennessee] or Peabody [College in Nashville, Tennessee] or the other schools had more of the southern early American, the antebellum south.  But here, George O'Keeffe brought in a lot of the works of Carl Van Vechten and of course her husband, Stieglitz [Alfred Stieglitz] the photographer and donated a lot of work that she had there.  Some of the work she'd done even in New Mexico, the skulls, the big flowers.  And I remember very well seeing her on the campus in her goucher pants and the big hat and that was a thrill, but did we stop to get her autograph when we talked to her?  No, or to even get a print since that time obviously that this has become important to me with the Aaron Douglas.  The librarian at that time was Arna Bontemps [Arnaud "Arna" Wendell Bontemps].  And as you can imagine having those scholars at the time and Charles S. Johnson was the president.  And he as you know had done outstanding work in sociology and had developed the Race Relations Institute where they had a very large institute in the summer where they would bring in scholars from all over rather they were from University of Pennsylvania [in Philadelphia] or whether they were from University of Chicago [Illinois].  But many of the writers who were working on their scholarly discourses be it Horace Cayton or St. Clair Drake all those were people that we saw on the campus all the time.  And I just think about what a privilege we had but how little did we recognize in our midst all these wonderful people.
Speaker 1: You were reading about these people at the time.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, and we knew that certainly Arna Bontemps was writing but he was just Mr. Bontemps on the campus.  And Aaron Douglas was known because he had all those wonderful murals there in the library and we knew that he in the summer time went to New York.  And it just so happened that my roommate in college for three years was from New York who lived in a building that was a long, old building, 409 Edgestone where Walter [Francis] White, one of the earliest presidents, or executive directors NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], Aaron Douglas and just a lot of people were very active in what have been, would have been considered the Harlem Renaissance.  Out of that school The Renaissance, we knew that and we felt privileged but I don't think we really took full advantage of what these scholars had to offer.
Story_ID: 72200
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, one of these, if I knew then what I know now questions, how do you think you would have conducted yourself knowing what you know now?
Speaker 2: Well I think I would have asked more stories of Arna Bontemps and certainly while of course I had met Langston Hughes as a little girl, I couldn't really remember what his relationship with Langston Hughes and of course the earlier writers, the Margaret Walkers and whatever.  And probably with Aaron Douglas, coming out of the area where Romare Bearden was now in New York working and so many of the great artists of that time.  And I would have asked surely more about the Harlem Renaissance and the people who were there.  I, I'm sure I would have if I had known.  And also I would have been more aggressive in speaking to George O'Keeffe about her life as an artist and being originally the friendship with Carl Van Vechten.  As you remember [W.E.B.] Du Bois had gone to Fisk [University in Nashville, Tennessee] and had taught at Fisk and had really gotten sort of disenchanted with Van Vechten as you know had really championed the Harlem Renaissance and had written the black--the book about Harlem and many of the people thought--I think it was called 'Nigger Heaven' and a lot of people felt that that was sort of derogatory.  But apparently Georgia O'Keeffe had felt it significant enough to give some of the work that she had to Fisk and to name that gallery the Carl Van Vechten Gallery which still stands.  It had gone through a stage of disrepair but I was there about two years ago and the gallery has certainly now been updated and the permanent collection there--and you as a part of HistoryMakers had been very active in that conserve legacy too, in which you remember they had the paintings and the art work--not only the paintings but the artwork from some historically black schools.  And there were certainly pieces of art there from Aaron Douglas and Georgia O'Keeffe and a lot of those folks.  And I wish yes, if I had known then, I would have spent more quality time with them.
Speaker 1: And so a lot of pieces in that art exhibit that traveled you actually saw them when they were hanging--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --in their normal place?
Speaker 2: When they were hanging there at Fisk, could be there in the library and/or the Van Vechten Gallery.
Story_ID: 72201
Speaker 1: Let's go over to motherhood.  How did you deal with medical school [Howard University School of Medicine], motherhood, wife?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes. Well, I did not become pregnant until I was just toward the end of my fellowship and then I had a lot of difficulty, obstetrically speaking.  And I did have my baby the year that I was going into practice and I did not work for about six months.  And then I did go back and I of course got support by having--you got to have a homemaker, someone.  And I tried, made every attempt to spend quality time with my son [Frank McClinton Adams, Jr.].  I'm sure if I had it to do over again I probably would have been a little more of a disciplinarian in some ways. I tried not to make him think that he was being privileged at all but yes privileged by having a family where there were priorities given to education though he says that that is not as important, that I should have schooled him more in more political savvy but I couldn't teach things that I don't know and I'm not a political being.
Speaker 1: And not a lot of political type things happened in your life.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's true.  Most of the people were as I said in education, involved in education.
Speaker 1: And I'm sure he's talking about those things, the politics of business--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --the politics of politics?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And I'm not a good business person.
Story_ID: 72202
Speaker 1: So when you actively started working out in--how did you come to specialize in pediatrics?
Speaker 2: Well when I first went to Cook County Hospital [now called John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County] as an intern, my interest at that time was in OB-GYNY [obstetrics and gynecology].  I was extremely fascinated with just life, the development during pregnancy and just that miracle.  And I had prior to my father's [William Morris Wright] death gone with him on some deliveries.  He had asked permission of the family if I could come and I was just extremely fascinated by that.  But then I didn't think that that would be quite as compatible.  Little did I know that also pediatrics in terms of the time, after hours, away, can be very demanding.  In addition to the fact that it's the lowest paid specialty there is and that's one of the things that sort of disturbed me is that our society does not value children in the same way that we value o--not older people but adults.  Children don't vote. Children don't have the buying power so as a rule society does not value--when you think about daycare workers, elementary school teachers, pediatricians, people who care for children usually on the lower end of income and that's grossly unfair.  But more importantly, we must value children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So while I was there I then decided on my rotation in peds [pediatrics] that I would specialize in pediatrics and that was what I did.
Speaker 1: And from what I've read, you practiced pediatrics in a very special, nurturing way.
Speaker 2: I tried to.  First of all, one of the things that I got from my family in addition to in our household was called the GR, the Golden Rule, trying to do unto others as you'd have them do unto you, was always very important.  But also respect for the person is always big.  Our family practiced that.  Though we usually had someone to help us at home, we could never call them by their first names.  Our parents would not permit us to call older adults by their first name.  If there was someone who was there doing the laundry or whatever, we always had to call them Ms. or Mrs. Whatever.  Now my family also felt strongly as I told you about education so we usually had a college student who lived with us throughout their time in college.  In exchange for living they helped around the home.  They would help my mother [Mamie Johnson Wright], though my mother did most of the cooking but they would help and would help take care of us if our parents were away or doing something because my mother belonged to some book clubs and they belonged to Greek letter organizations and my dad with the medical society and things like that and so we usually had a college student.  Now those students we could call by their first names but anyone else we could not call them by their first names because my father used to say, "In the south they will call a black by any other name but Mr.  They can be called, no matter how old they are Mamma, Auntie, Professor, Judge, Doc, but it's an honor for you to call them Mr. or Mrs. or Miss," so we really grew up with that as a part of then getting respect for the person.  And in pediatrics, respect for children always had been, has been one of the principles that I try sometimes with the consternation of some of the parents because I will talk to the children, go in and speak to the child first.  And yes, I know the value of the parent and I respect them but we, we've just got to respect our kids.
Story_ID: 72203
Speaker 1: With your career, so within the context of knowing the condition of these children and here, and you're working with these children every day, that's what I wanted to know how you deal with attaching and detaching?
Speaker 2: The attachment part is very easy because you always hope that the child will be the mechanism by which this will be a better world.  That the child will recognize, respect, the child will then go on to explore their possibilities and again to help us, as I said to make this a better world.  So it's easy to attach to children and children respond to you.  They can certainly see love and respect.  Now the detachment you ask about is a bit more difficult because you know that you have to let go because what is that saying that it is a student and children act as teachers to you.  That it is the wise teacher who recognizes that their students can teach them.  And I try to be a student of medicine.  I can be very opinionated and at times my son [Frank McClinton Adams, Jr.] says judgmental.  I hope not so much but absolutely, positively I know that I have some very strong beliefs.  It takes a whole lot to get me detached from those beliefs.  And I do remember when I first went to Cook County [now called John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County]  as an intern and of course if you remember that at that time it was one of the largest hospitals in the world at, I think was it Belleview, but it was the largest hospital with like 3,000 beds.  I really became attached to that hospital because I saw it as a place where one could give service and one could learn.  I learned so much from my patients.  I learned on so many levels and I had made a commitment that I wanted to remain a student of medicine.  And yet, I felt having attended Howard Medical School [Howard University School of Medicine] which was a wonderful experience for me.  But when I first went to County there were only two black interns my year.  I was the only black female at that time and there was another gentleman there who was a graduate of one of the local schools who found it a little difficult to bond with other blacks.  But there were some who were in their residency but they interned and trust me that was a lot of work, physical work and a lot of emotional work, but so rewarding.  And I learned so much that it stayed with me the rest of my life.  And when I rotated as an intern through pediatrics that was then I decided that I wanted to specialize in pediatrics.  And I was so impressed with the quality of care, it wasn't perfect but the quality of care and all the good that could be done at that community.  That time when I first came, many of the black physicians were not permitted to join the staff of a major hospital and it was then in Chicago [Illinois] that we were--they were instituting the lawsuit--
Story_ID: 72204
Speaker 1: Now we were--you were telling me about Cook County [Hospital, now called John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois] and the experiences of early--you work there.  Tell me about Cook County today.
Speaker 2: Cook County of today, obviously in terms of the numbers of patients and the work that was expected of the house staff, the interns and residents is not like the County when I was there, but I love the place.  I returned to County on a part time basis teaching both residents and medical students because I coordinate the junior medical students who are doing their pediatric clerkship at Cook County and I just enjoy it.  It's such a wonderful learning experience.  You have great diversity on the staff, maybe not quite as much as I would like to see.  But we also see tremendous diversity in patients.  With the way the economics is in healthcare, you may have a patient who is a doctorial candidate who can't afford healthcare for their children, an M.B.A. who was downsized from their corporate job, they no longer have healthcare, or you may see a recent immigrant who doesn't really have the care, or you will see just from all nations.  I supervise a comprehensive care center where the residents, where we see patients, Polish speaking patients, first and second generation, we see obviously, we see patients who are from African countries.  Yesterday I was there and it was a family from Cameroon.  We have families who are from Romania.  There's a young man who works in the children's hospital who was the former journalist in Bosnia.  You certainly will see a large number of African Americans and you'll see a large number of Latinos.  But since I have a close association with students, I always tell them they must have respect for the person or the child.  They should treat the child as if the child is a child of Bill Gates the same they would not to have familiarity and disrespect.  The first day that they come and I give them orientation, I let them know that they are privileged to come to County.  They're privileged for the learning experience.  But if they have difficulty in dealing with patients who don't look exactly like them, who don't speak standard English all the time, those who may not have the same religion, who dress like them or the same nationality, if they can't deal with having all patients like that, they need to leave.  I also tell them that if they think they're going to see only unwed, poor, black, teen mothers on drugs, or Latino single mothers who are poor, they are wrong.  If--they will see some of those as well as they will see a variety and they must show respect.  No familiarity with patients, parents.  I am so intent on respect for the person.  But also I tell them they must learn flexibility and adaptability because if you don't have that in life, you have to--obviously there is discipline because you can't get form step A to step B in your life process without some discipline.  But you have to be flexible and accept the changes in people.
Story_ID: 72205
Speaker 1: Now the new hospital [Cook County Hospital, now called John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois] as you know will be opening soon [December 2002] and it is supposed to be the State of the Art building.  I am a bit distressed because the old building architecturally speaking has a beautiful facade facing Harrison Street when you go down Eisenhower.  It's a beautiful place, even their power plant has beautiful freeze--lot of bas relief, lot of architectural things.  The new building certainly is modern but the architectural design for me leaves a lot to be desired.  And I have written letters hoping that they would preserve much of the architectural pleasure.  Now I know that presumably the cost of maintaining and updating it to modern times would be prohibitive.  But we're the only country that throws away--you know when you visit other countries, where are the ruins in Athens [Greece]?  In the city.  What's in Rome [Italy]?  All the old--I mean we live with that history.  But here we don't do that.  We just sort of throw away.  So County is very personal and I have loving remember--memories.  I worked very hard, it was a hard wake, some of it shouldn't have been.  I'm glad that they have changed schedules for the residents because then we didn't have some of the help that we have now.  And I was much smaller but rolling large patients to x-ray yourself or going from one building to the other that the intern had to do is no longer expected.  But there are a lot of valuable lessons.
Speaker 2: How many beds will the new one (unclear)?
Speaker 1: I will tell you that I have forgotten.  I think I have blocked that out because I'm so sentimental about the old.  But there's no question about the fact that the new will be a beautiful update facility with computerized records and there will be again, those new facilities that should make diagnosing and treating patients so much easier and will be more efficient for the patients and for the staff.
Speaker 2: Oh, so you mean you won't have to send off for the physical--
Speaker 1: Right. Records--
Speaker 2: --records?
Speaker 1: The medical records, yes.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Okay.
Speaker 1: As well as so much of the x-ray, but it's a wonderful place and they do a wonderful service.  And I think that County frequently gets a negative image as any public hospital does where you have lots of patients and of course you have employees from vast backgrounds who don't always show respect.  But when I'm around I show them respect and I expect them to respect me and my patients and their families.  So you'll run into those occasions.  I think that's life.  People who feel that this is their one opportunity to show one-upsman or to show authority.  But I have nothing but positive things to say about training and Cook County Hospital because I did my internship there.  I did a pediatric residency there and I also did a fellowship in hematology.  I don't do as much hematology but my pediatric--to show--give you an idea, I'm a very good friend with whom I attend some of the pediatric meetings, the American Academy of Pediatrics.  And we just two days ago went to clinical scholars where they talked a lot about molecular biology.  And often times we will say to each other "Gee, you remember that patient at County?"  And I remember shortly after my training we were at an American Academy of Pediatrics meeting and they're what they call visual diagnosis.  They flash a photograph of a child who has a disease and I would say to my friend, "Does that look like so-and-so?"  Or she would say to me, "Is that so-and so," we would yell it out.  "Does anyone see this?"  And after a bit, some of the meetings, people would look at us and say, "I don't believe you saw all this?  Where did you see this?"  We said, "At Cook County Hospital in Chicago."  Then they became believers, "yes.  If you were at Cook County, you saw a lot."  So I feel privileged having had that Cook County experience.
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: And then close by the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Science System], I'm on the faculty at the University of Illinois and as a faculty member there is where I had my contact with the students which is most enjoyable.
Story_ID: 72206
Speaker 1: Which is what I was going to ask you.  In your professional teaching career, which student or type of student stands out the most?
Speaker 2: Usually a student who shows some compassion, respect for the person, who's adaptable to whatever the situation is, even though it may not be a part of their life experience and who shows great respect for the patient, but who in the meantime is aggressive with their learning.  They want to learn.  They hear things.  They write it down.  They read about it.  They ask questions and who always have that mentality of being a student of medicine, that's a student that I treasure.
Story_ID: 72207
Speaker 1: And what do you think you will be remembered for in medicine?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  But I would like to hope that I will be remembered as a caring, respectful person, certainly respectful of children and their families and one who had good work ethics because I certainly was exposed to good work ethics as a child growing up.  And also, one who made every attempt to remain a student of medicine.  That's what I hope.  When people say to me--a lot of times you meet people and they say "What kind of doctor are you?"  Depending upon the situation if someone who I perceive that they want to validate, are they going to talk with me, I may say, "One who makes every attempt to be a competent doctor."  Because I've made lots of mistakes but usually they were honest mistakes.  And then the next question is, "You know what I mean?"  I said, "No, what do you mean?"  "What kind of doctor?"  "Do you mean what is my specialty?"  And then when I say "My specialty, is that what you're interested in?"  And then they'll say, "Yes."  And I will tell them that I'm in pediatrics and then it's the, "oh."  And then the question is, "Well what kind of person are you?"  I said, "I'm every attempt to be a good person.  I'm human, I make mistakes but I hope that I will be remembered as one who cared about what they did, made every attempt to be the best that they could."
Story_ID: 72208
Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets anywhere along the line?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, there are those times that I wished that I had spent more time in academia but as a--full time academics without teaching--you know, I love people too much.  I enjoy bonding.  And in academia, at the time I was coming up, it was either publish or perish.  And I'm not a great writer.  I enjoy dealing with people more.  You know you have to write some but in terms of just really writing or doing more research, I wish maybe I'd done more clinical research that I wish that I had.  I wish that perhaps I had maybe been a little more politically smart.  I'm not politically smart and that probably would have helped my son [Frank McClinton Adams, Jr.] develop to more political sophistication.  And maybe I should have been a better business woman, been more concerned about making money but I wasn't.  And that was something that I didn't worry about.  They always said that our family was not as interested in money but in terms of either education or doing for others.  And I've tried with the community activities in which I've been involved.  I've tried to be involved with those activities and deal with children and young people and that give.
Speaker 1: But you practiced medicine rather than seeking it for the fame?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you have published personally cause the mark you leave on your students it's in a very, very dynamic form.
Speaker 2: I hope.
Story_ID: 72209
Speaker 1: That's right.  Is there anything I didn't ask you that perhaps I should have?
Speaker 2: What are some of my likes outside of medicine?
Speaker 1: That's right, my "People Magazine" questions.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Before we get to your serious likes, what's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I think I probably like shades of blue, but I like black.  I wear a lot of black too.
Speaker 1: Favorite food?
Speaker 2: I like watermelon and fruit and I'm always teased because I have a lot of things that are symbolic watermelon.
Speaker 1: And your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "Do unto others as you'd have them to do unto you."
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that all the favorite saying?
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 1: I didn't get to give my favorite sport?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: I love basketball and I try to be a student of basketball.  I just surrendered last year my seasons tickets to the [Chicago] Bulls that had preceded Michael Jordan and I kept them for over fourteen years and thoroughly enjoyed basketball though I like college basketball better.  I like NCAA, but I really enjoy that.  But I've become a little disenchanted with basketball, not with the game, I love the game.  But I've become disenchanted with the manipulation of the players, these very young and particularly the young black players who are being prostituted in many ways.  When you look at the schools that don't have a very good track record for graduating their students, not that everyone has to be a college graduate.  I don't want to imply that.  But when you look and see how the focus, even beginning in high school, think one of the most dangerous persons that I happened to realize in Chicago was a hosp--was a high school coach who had probably none of his players to be able to come, successfully complete their SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] and to be admitted into college right away to play.  So the devaluation of training them for other things, the way the media handles the players, and the lack of accountability that's given to them has made me very, very disenchanted with the way we--and my son teases me because, he said "But you still keep going?"  That's before I gave up my season's tickets when I would be concerned about the lack of respect that it was showing.  There's one thing that if you glorify these young men, but the actual respect and the demands, they have to have anticipations that--so I enjoy basketball, watermelon.  I love art.  I am--
Speaker 2: How did you get interested in basketball?
Speaker 1: I think when I was young, the game surprising enough though my father [William Morris Wright] liked baseball, was favorite.  And I used to go to some of the college games, the NCAA, the schools from North Carolina and Virginia would come to Bluefield State [College in West Virginia] and it was part of our recreation.  And I just liked the motion of basketball.  It's like dancing and I like the speed of it.  And I never developed the love for football that my husband [Frank MClinton Adams] had.  But basketball I just liked the motions and I like the game.
Speaker 2: So you must have been in the zone during that period (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  Absolutely, that was a fun time.  I thoroughly enjoyed that. I never realized one of my dreams--well yes I did.  When the final four--when the [Chicago] Bulls won the championship I was able to participate in that here in Chicago [Illinois].  When they had the All Star, those are outside of medicine, wonderful memories.  I always wanted to go to a Final Four NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association], and I never was able to go.  But now with nothing but high school players I can go to Chicago [Illinois] anywhere and see good basketball at the high school.  So that's why I theorized why should I pay them money for season's tickets to the [Chicago]Bulls when I can go to the high school, which I sometimes enjoy doing.
Story_ID: 72210
Speaker 1: That's great.  Is your son [Frank McClinton Adams, Jr.] married, any grand kids?
Speaker 2: No.  How I wish.  No.  No.  I look forward to that.
Speaker 1: How old is your son?
Speaker 2: My son is going to be thirty-five.
Speaker 1: He'll marry soon.
Speaker 2: Well can you imagine (unclear) he's a leap year baby, February the 29th.  So I have some unusual occurrences in my life.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's wonderful.  Well it's been absolutely delightful talking with you today.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Did we get all five of those Adele?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Color we got, food we got, blue--
Speaker 1: Blue.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  --watermelon.
Speaker 1: And vacation.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 1: And vacation?
Speaker 2: Okay. I enjoy the fall as it relates to the mountains, the cascading colors.  And you should really see West Virginia in October.  And if you ever come to the Shenandoah Valley, that to me is beautiful.  I like also the spring.  If you think about the rhododendron, those that are related to the camellia family, the blossoming trees.  But fall is so beautiful.  That I really like.  And as a little girl, I like walking on the fallen leaves, feeling that crunch, crunch, crunch, that's fun.
Speaker 1: And where do you take your vacations?
Speaker 2: Well that varies.  I have not been back to West Virginia for a while but I used to like to go to the mountains of West Virginia for vacation.  But I enjoy going in and out of some of the smaller historical communities.  I just came back on my first trip to Jamestown in Williamsburg, Virginia and in route I stopped along the way I Pennsylvania to a Mennonite Community, that was in Ohio, but to Bedford where they have the covered bridges.  So I like to look at nature.  So ask me that single one vacation spot, I'm not certain.  I was in Hawaii earlier which I enjoyed if you can get away from the commercialism.  And I did enjoy being on a safari in Africa.
Speaker 1: When did you go to Africa?
Speaker 2: I was there about five years ago in Kenya and that was most exciting, the natural beauty and seeing the variation in the topography from the--Mount Kenya, the mountains, all the way down to just at the base of Kilimanjaro.  I like where there are also mountains and nature.
