Speaker 1: Now, I ask five questions of everyone.  They're a little "People Magazine"-ish, but short answers.  I'd like to know what your favorite food is.
Speaker 2: Oh, my (laughs).  You know, I have several, so it's hard to say.  I can certainly give you my favorite desserts, and my favorite dessert is banana split, as a matter of fact (laughs).  I guess my favorite food is--and it's really hard to think about this.  I like several things, and I--maybe we should come back to that--
Speaker 1: Well, favorite--'cause banana split that's good (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --the banana split.  The banana split, which is a little bit different, I think.
Speaker 1: (Laughs.)  (Unclear.)

Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to start out talking about your parents and what you know about your family background, which you know a lot.  But I'd like first to start out taking about your father.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Reverend Julian Taylor.  Now, just give his name and give what you know about his family background.
Speaker 2: My father was named Reverend Julian A. Taylor; A for Augustus; and he was the third son of a minister, who was Reverend William Andrew Taylor.  My father was born in Hertford, North Carolina.  But soon after he was born, his father, who was a well-educated minister for his time, he was an early graduate of--my grandfather--of Shaw University in North Carolina before the turn of the century.  And so he was in the--really pretty much--first generation of educated black people after the Civil War and slavery was over who went--and actually went to college; the land-grant colleges set up for black people.  And he had started a private school in the little town where they lived, but he soon realized that he wanted his children to have a better education than the segregated schools would offer as they got older.  So my grandfather moved north; first to Newport News, Virginia; but then ultimately came to Washington, D.C., in the first decade of the twentieth century and established a church--founded a church--in Washington, which is now a large Baptist Church called the "Florida Avenue Baptist Church."  And so my father grew up and went to schools in Washington, D.C., and ultimately went to Howard University--Howard University Divinity School--and became a minister like his own father.
Story_ID: 60722
Speaker 1: And then he married young while in college; had two children.  That marriage did not work out, but I do have two older sisters--half sisters--who still live in Washington, D.C.  Then he met my mother in--you know, as the Depression was coming to an end, he met my mother who was ten years younger, and her name--my mother's name is--was Margaret Morris--is Margaret Morris.  And they married in the January 1933; moved to Stratford, Connecticut, where he had a small church.  My father was, as they say, "called to preach," at a small church called--I believe it was the First Baptist Church of Stratford, Connecticut.  And I was born exactly nine months later in November of 1933.  And then, over the years, my father always pastored in Connecticut.  He had his longest pastorate in Ansonia, Connecticut, at the Macedonia Baptist Church, which is 11 miles east of New Haven, Connecticut.  And at that church, he stayed over 40 years.  I believe it was about 42 years.  So I grew up, went to school in Ansonia, Connecticut.
Story_ID: 60723
Speaker 1: My father was very active in the community.  He was, established the local NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in the 1940s.  He was very active in the Democratic Party and rose to be the first black assistant chair of the--vice-chair of the Connecticut Democratic Party; and was recruited in 1960 to campaign for John F. Kennedy.  And John F. Kennedy was the first Catholic--as you know--the first Catholic president.  My father was recruited by John Bailey who was then the Democratic National Chairman, who came from Connecticut and was a friend of my father's.  And they wanted him to go south to West Virginia for the West Virginia Primary to talk to all the black Baptist ministers, so they could help win that primary against Hubert Humphrey, because if he had not run the primary in West Virginia, he'd probably would not had been nominated, because West Virginia was a southern state.  So my father made three trips to West Virginia in the spring of 1960 to visit the black ministers all over the state, particularly the big cities. And certainly the Kennedy campaign gave him a lot of credit for mobilizing the black vote.  And they did win the state of Virginia.  And, of course, my father was very proud to go to the Inauguration, with my mother, of the first Catholic president.  And so that was one of the--I think--the high points of their life; to be involved with the Kennedy Campaign, and subsequently with President Johnson.  Like, I have two pictures you might be interested in to show you; my father with Kennedy and with Johnson.  And subsequently he became a part of sort of what they call the "black kitchen cabinet."  He was often called in to talk to President John F. Kennedy and Governor Ribicoff, who became--I believe it was Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.  But Governor Ribicoff, who had been the governor of Connecticut, often called my father in Washington to advise him on, you know, social issues, racial issues, Civil Rights issues.  So he was a very--and he was a good role model for me, because he not only was a minister and was very involved in those kinds of issues, he was on the national board of the National Baptist Convention.  For many years, he was a member of that board.  And so he was active in his profession, plus he was active in politics.  And combined with the professional activities and the political activities, I think that he did make a difference in the lives of the black people and the poor people in Connecticut, because many of his activities were directed to Civil Rights, to helping blacks to understand it was important to vote.  He was very big on education.  So he got--helped to get scholarships for many of the black high school students in Ansonia, Connecticut; and was very interested, of course, in social issues; and was not afraid to make statements and to make controversial statements; helped to integrate the local YMCA; helped to integrate restaurants which would not like always to serve black people in that area; helped to integrate housing.  So he was a very, very important influence in my life, and I'm sure in the lives of my siblings for all the activities he was engaged in.
Story_ID: 60724
Speaker 1: Did he talk about anything that really sort of formed him growing up?  Was he the only son (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.  He was the third (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No.  Was he the only son that became a minister?
Speaker 2: Yes.  But--but my grandfather educated--all of his sons were professionals; one was a dentist, one was a professor.  In fact, one of my uncles, my second oldest uncle, started the art department at A and T University in Greensboro, North Carolina.  A third uncle was a journalist who was the editor of the "Washington Afro-American Newspaper."  And the baby, the youngest, was a professional pianist and organist.  So they were all well educated, and they were good role models for us growing up.  And my father had one sister who died at the age of 15.
Speaker 1: Are any of your uncles alive?
Speaker 2: No.  My last uncle died in 1992.
Story_ID: 60725
Speaker 1: Now your mother, her side of the family.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother comes from a very interesting family.  My mother comes from--well, she was born in Washington, D.C., and her family was--had been in Washington, D.C., for several generations.  And she is the product of things that went on during and before the Civil War between whites and blacks--the miscegenation and the relationships that were very widespread throughout the South--so that my mother's grandfather was a--what is now--what then was then called a quadroon, and really sort of left Richmond, Virginia, toward the end of the Civil War; just kind of ran away as a young man to Washington, D.C.  But he was the son of a very prominent judge in Richmond.  And the--his mother was a mulatto house servant at that time.  And he ran away--because, of course, they were still slaves until after the Civil War was over--and went to Washington, D.C., and met an Irish young woman in a convent who somehow they managed to marry and had four children.  Their oldest child was my mother's father, and she was one of seven children--my mother.  But at the time, they were poor.  At that time, of course, it was, you know, not very early in this century--in the twentieth century.  And my mother's father was a coachman and married a woman with a very similar background, my mother's mother, who was also racially mixed--white, black and Indian.  And they had these seven children.  And my grandfather was not really able to take care of all of these children and was not, I guess, a very responsible husband.  And so he--after his wife died very young--my grandmother--my mother's mother died when she was four, and she was the second oldest child--youngest child.  They--the children were dispersed and some of them went to live with their maternal grandmother--their paternal grandmother--I'm sorry--who was my Irish great-grandmother.  And she convinced the older children to pass for white, because they were--looked so white.  And so the two younger children, my mother and her younger brother, were left with a cousin of their mother's who lived in the black community.  And so the family was divided.  And my mother never saw her father again in life.  Although he lived until 1955, she never saw him after 1916, because he was living as a white man in Delaware, and he married again.  He married another woman.  She never saw her brothers again in life, but she did reunite with her older sister, who was named Grace.  And she reunited with her older sister in 1992 after all those years of being separated.  My mother was born in 1912.  So, you see, and they were separated at four.  Seventy-six years went by before they ever saw each other again.  And then they were reunited because my next younger sister named Shirlee Taylor Haizlip was researching the family history for a book.  She thought --she was writing a book about the family history--and located my aunt, Grace, through a private detective, through tracing the census where she had moved, and located my aunt Grace.  At that point, all the brothers were dead.  And there were only these two sisters left.  And they had a reunion at that time.  And a few years later, Grace died.  My mother is still alive, and she will be 90, God willing, in May of this year.
Story_ID: 60726
Speaker 1: So it was an interesting story because she really was raised in a series of foster homes--my mother--I mean, by cousins and godmothers and things like that; a series of foster homes.  She did not have a really happy childhood, but she graduated from Dunbar High School, which is a famous high school in Washington, D.C.  Both of my parents are graduates of Dunbar.  And then went for about a year to Miner Teachers College, but married my father young.  She was 20 years old when she married my father and was, I think, happy to be married, happy to leave Washington and move to Connecticut with my father.  And so her life was spent as a minister's wife.  She also was active in the community and was also a good role model for all of us.  They had, together, four children.  I had two younger sisters and one brother.  And my mother was--never worked.  While she was married to my father, she never worked, and basically worked as a--in the community; help my father and was a typical minister's wife, which meant--means that you're involved with the church and with the community, and also she was very active in politics.  And so, she was a good role model as a mother and a person who was also active in the community.
Story_ID: 60727
Speaker 1: One question I have about your mother's aunt, your--or your--her aunt.
Speaker 2: Her sister or her aunt?
Speaker 1: Her sister.
Speaker 2: Grace.
Speaker 1: Sister.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did Grace grow up poor or well-off as a--and was there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.  Actually what was really ironic is that, all of the sisters--the one sister and the brothers who passed for white didn't do as well economically as my mother did.  My mother married a minister.  And although when they married shortly after the Depression and, of course, everybody practically was poor at that time, my father managed to accumulate some property, and, you know, other things that--he was very entrepreneurial, even as a minister.  And so he bought some property in Connecticut and made some investments, which allowed us to live, you know, a middle-class life.  On the other hand, her sister, who really grew up pretty poor as a child, going again with the grandmother and other foster homes, she married a man who was a working-class man.  And, you know, they had a small house, but they didn't--she didn't live as well as my mother.  And none of my mother's brothers--one was a factory foreman.  And two died young.  Two died in the--World War Two.  And the other one had been a farmer.  And so we really don't know, you know, what incomes they had.  But none of them, as far as we know, went to college.  They didn't go to college, and they were not--basically not living middle-class lives.  They were more working-class people.  But my mother's life was--turned out, I think, in the end to be more comfortable, more successful.  And I think that it's ironic to say that she stayed in the black community, but I think she lived--that the quality of her life was more interesting; and that the activities she engaged in, they were more interesting; and the people she met through my father--they met so many interesting people, and people used to come to our house.  My parents had--I would say, when I was growing up, they entertained so many people who were well known, who'd stop by the house or my--they were involved with--my father once had to pick up Eleanor Roosevelt at the train station in New Haven to introduce her at a rally for President--when she was--she campaigned for President Truman when he was, you know, when her husband--after her husband died, and my father was the one who picked her up, and we met them.  Congressman Adam Clayton Powell was friend of my parents.  The Black congressman from Chicago, [William] Dawson, was a guest in our home.  We had, you know, well-known lawyers and doctors and jurists--judges, and diplomats; all kinds of people who came to our home or spoke at our church that we got to meet.  So my mother and father, I think, had a very interesting life.  And growing up, I met many, many people who were excellent role models for me and gave me encouragement to go to school and to get educated.
Story_ID: 60728
Speaker 1: Now, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My very earliest memory is of living in this--a very nice home in Stratford, Connecticut.  We lived about a block from Long Island Sound, and we had a little creek that passed our house that I guess came from the Sound.  And this little creek had little crabs in it.  And I can remember at probably around the age of three or  four trying to catch these crabs with my mother and, I guess, some neighbor children--trying to, you know--I remember the--I still have an affinity for water from those very early years of playing around the water, but trying to catch the crabs.  And about the same time, we had some green apples growing in our yard, and I got very sick and almost died because I ate too many green apples.  So those were the two earliest memories that I have.
Story_ID: 60729
Speaker 1: Now, how did your father end up coming to Stratford?  I know--it just seems, you know, they're in D.C., and you said he got called.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: But the black community had--what was the black community there like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was tiny.  It was a tiny black community in Stratford, Connecticut.  But at the time, they had a historic old church, First Baptist of--that church was established--it was one of the oldest churches for black people in New England.  I don't remember the year it was established, but it had probably been established by people who were right out of slavery; the early blacks who lived in New England.  Now, some of those were people who had intermarried with Indians.  So many of the people in that church were black Indians; what we call black Indians in New England.  There is a group of black Indians who have been intermarrying for many years.  And they established that church along with people who were coming up right after slavery was over to--and then there was a group of free blacks in New England even during slavery.  There was a group of free blacks.  So they had these very interesting group of people who had--some of whom had been free for--you know, had been indentured and then freed; some of whom were slaves who were freed after the Civil War and were in this group of the blacks and the Indians.  So it was an interesting small group.  And some of the people came from communities around Stratford, like, Bridgeport, Connecticut.  So, he had a small congregation, probably not more than 50 people.  And it was not a wealthy congregation, but a very dedicated congregation, and they needed a minister.  22:19:0ybout growing up in a minister'ford, Connecticut during her childhoodtes, Washington became involved with the local schooAnd after my mother and father married in January of 1933, she really was interested in leaving Washington because, you know, he had been married before and had two older daughters, so she wanted to make a new start, and I think wanted to just get away from some of the pain that she had experienced in her own life and wanted to make a new start, so.
Story_ID: 60730
Speaker 1: When they called him to preach, they actually, you know, talked to his father and said, "You know, is Julian ready to have a church on his own?"  He was an assistant pastor for his father at this church I mentioned earlier, Florida Avenue Baptist Church.  And his father was well known, and so someone in Connecticut called my grandfather and wanted to know did he think my father was ready to have his own church, and he said, "Yes.  You better call him."  So that's how he came to Connecticut.
Speaker 2: So how was it being--did you, as a--you know, as children feel--you know, a lot of times, people talk about being the preacher's kids.  Was there a great sort of sense of that?  And did you feel sort of constricted?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, there was a great sense of that, because when you are a preacher's child, and--my father had a medium-sized church--you know, you're--all eyes are on you.  You are expected to behave yourself, to be good, to look nice, to be smart, not to give anybody any trouble; and I was a little bit of a renegade as a child and always spoke my mind, and was often being told by my mother and my father that I couldn't say everything that was on my mind.  And when some of the--especially the sisters--the older sisters in the church would criticize me for something, you know; what I was wearing, whatever, I would speak up for myself.  And when I got to be about, oh, 14 and the age of wanting to date and have the boys coming over to the house and little teenage parties--somewhere between 14 and 16--we lived in the parsonage across the street from the church, so it was like living in a fishbowl, 'cause whenever people came to the church, our house was right across the street, and often they held meetings at the our house; the deacons and so forth.  So there was some complaints that the pastor was letting his teenage daughters have parties in the parsonage.  And my mother got up at a church meeting, and she said, "You know, my husband was called to preach.  I wasn't called to preach, and my children were not called to preach, and this is their home and they're going to have a normal life.  And if they want to have parties, and if they want to wear lipstick and makeup, as long as we agree--the parents--then they will have parties, and my daughters will wear makeup, and there isn't anybody here who is going to tell me how to raise my children."  So that sort of was the end of it (laughs).  From then on, we felt, you know, my mother took up for us.  And from then on, we felt that, you know, that we could have a normal teenage life.  And it was a--but it got easier after she made that statement.  I guess they felt that--that she was going to stand up to them, and we would stand up for ourselves.  And, you know, there were always attempts to tease ministers' children and take advantage of them.  And whenever people would be mad at my father about something in the church, they would try to take it out on us, but--but on the other hand, the other side of that, I have to say the church was also very supportive of the family; always encouraged us to do well in school.  And, you know, if you're a--grew up in a minister's family, people were always sending you good food and taking care of you and giving you gifts at Christmas.  So there were two sides of it. I mean, there was a very good side of it.  When I would--went to college, people would sometimes send--send me five dollars and a little note or something.  So the people were always very supportive and very encouraging.  At the same time, there was--being critical when we were younger.  But as we grew up, that sort of fell away, the criticism.
Story_ID: 60731
Speaker 1: And did you--we have a little time left on this tape, but did you find--what was--I want to know what Stratford was like back then.  What was the community like?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I showed you that picture where we--people were--a small group of people, and as I said, a lot of them were racially mixed either with white or Indian blood.  Stratford was a--what we would now call, like, a suburb of Bridgeport.  But at that time, they weren't even using the word "suburb."  But it was a little town located out of Bridgeport.  And many of the people worked in Bridgeport in the factories.  That was the time, especially in the late thirties [1930s] when we were building up the war effort for--Second World War--and so, a lot of the men worked in factories.  There weren't--there wasn't a lot of work for the women, so some of them were domestics mainly.  Some of them were domestics, those who did work.  And as time went by, there were other opportunities during the war that opened up to these people.  But, by and large, it was a working class community for black people.  The men worked in the factories, and the women either did domestic work or some kind of semi-skilled work.  And, as I said, as the war effort geared up, many of them also worked in the factories.  And there were more opportunities for blacks, you know, around World War Two; as War World Two came along.  And that was about the time we left Stratford anyway.  We left Stratford--my father left Stratford in the late thirties [1930s].
Story_ID: 60732
Speaker 1: (continuing) eight-and-a-half to nine years older than my mother.  And she--this, you know, the grandmother said to her--I mean, imagine one--like, on a Friday, she was in a black school, and then she stayed--went to live with the grandmother; and a few days later, she was in a white school in Washington [D.C].  And this grandmother says to her, "Now, don't ever, ever again mention that, you know, you have any black blood"--the Irish grandmother.  I mean--so that must have been traumatic for her, too.  And my mother always felt bitter.  She used to say, when we were growing up, "The one wish I had before I die, I want to see my sister Grace once.  She just--"I just want to see her once."  So we used to hear that once or twice a year.  "I just want to see my sister Grace."  So, you know, it was--we knew she was pining to see Grace more than the brothers, 'cause, you know, she wanted to see her sister.  And then--so when Shirlee started doing the research for the book, I mean, we never thought any of them were alive.  But she said, "You know, I don't care about the brothers.  I want to see if I can find Grace before my mother dies."  This was for my mother's 80th birthday.  My mother's birthday--80th birthday--was approaching, and we were working against the clock, 'cause we were going to give her an 80th birthday.  And Shirlee used to always say to her when she was growing up:  "Someday we'll find your sister."  And, you know, it was just an empty promise.  She hired a private detective; and, you know, they can do wonders with the census data and everything.  So they found Grace.  My mother knew that Grace had been in Cleveland at one time, and--it was--well, there's a very sad scene in the book.  When my mother's brother died, he had some money.  He had bought property and had saved a lot of money, and he didn't have children and had never married--my uncle.  And when he died, he left, in his will, his estate to his nieces and nephews.  In those days, I don't know if it's still true, you had to go to the lawyer's office and sign for your check.  I don't know.  Maybe now you can just have it mailed to you.  Things are different.  But in those days, they had to come.  So my mother was now married to my father, I was a baby, and the lawyer--she got the letter and said, "We're going to have this--you have to come this day and this time, the office in Washington [D.C.], to,"--you know, "You have to authenticate who you are.  Bring your birth certificate, and we will give you your share.  You get"--actually, for those days, it was not a bad little amount of money--and helped my mother and father to get on the path of buying property way back when I was born.  And they bought something right after with my mother's inheritance.  So she thought she would see her sister and her brothers.  She was looking forward to it.  She was all revved up.  So she comes to the office, and the man says--she says, "Well, where is my sister Grace and my brother?"  There was one named William.  And he said, "Well, they are coming at a different time."  She says, "What do you mean?  My father said he was with her.  What do you mean they're coming at a different time?"  "Well," he says, "they thought it would be easier not to come at the same time as you did."  Because, you see, they had all married white, they lived as white people, they lived in white communities, and they didn't want--they didn't want to be traced there.  Well, you can imagine that was very, very traumatic for my mother.  Very traumatic.  It just--it was just like a second rejection.  Okay?  'Cause now they were grown, so there's no excuse.  The grandmother can't be the excuse anymore.  But they decided.  Well, my father got so angry that he, at that time, figured out from something the lawyer said, that they lived--some of them lived in Cleveland.  So my mother knew.  And he wrote a letter to the Cleveland police chief saying he was trying to find some of my mother's relatives and mentioned the sister and the brother, who did in fact lived in--lived in Cleveland.  And the police chief wrote back and said they had been contacted, and they denied any knowledge of Margaret Taylor--Margaret Morris Taylor, and please do not harass them anymore.  That was terrible.  So she, you know, was just rejected.
Story_ID: 60733
Speaker 1: So finally when Shirlee finds the aunt, she--it's a scene in the book--she goes to visit.  And on the phone the aunt says she doesn't remember a sister.  But she didn't completely deny it, she just said--so Shirlee went to visit her, and they talked.  And I think it turned--at that time, the aunt--my aunt Grace had--her husband was dead, she was a widow; her daughter, her only daughter, died; she was alone, living in one of these communities--they're not trailers, but, you know, where you buy the--what do you--mobile home.  Mobile home.  My mother was, at that time, living in practically a mansion in New Haven.  I mean, we had a really big house.  And Shirlee was so surprised when she found Aunt Grace living in a mobile home, anyway, by herself and her cat.  So she was sort of glad to see somebody who's, "Well, this is your niece," and  glad to see her.  So, anyway, then she began--then Shirlee began visiting her and talking to her and recording it--and, for the book--and finding out what happened.  And it turns out all of the brothers were dead.  And finally she told her she had two grandchildren, also, living in Los Angeles--three--of her only daughter.  And Shirlee said, "Well, I'd like to meet them."  She said, "Well, I have to prepare them, because they don't know about you and about, you know, my background."  So anyway--then the thing is--I'll just tell you one of the things, 'cause you really need--this is a very dramatic scene in the book.  And also what's--what's really interesting--what's really interesting, if you think about the theories of Jung--you know--you know, those theories about the collective unconscious, and that sometimes there are things in families that go on for generations, but they're almost unconscious?  What's really interesting is, the names that Grace gave her oldest boy is Jeffrey.  Now, Grace was my--Grace's daughter was named Patricia.  My mother named her youngest daughter Patricia; both unknowing.  Okay?  Both then--it's completely unknown to each other that the two have daughters named Patricia.  Patricia--who would have been--was my first cousin who is now dead, had a son and two daughters.  Patricia's oldest son is named Jeffrey, which is the same name of my oldest son.  And it turns out that there are two other Jeffreys in the family in--among the other cousins that we didn't know.  And it's always the firstborn son is named Jeffrey.  And that is just amazing to us.  And there are several Patricias.  Another cousin has a daughter named Patricia.  So we don't understand this, but that's where it is--that there are--so there's this commonality somehow among the cousins.  So, anyway, this cousin named Jeffrey, who's a couple years older than my son Jeffrey, had been searching for his identity.  He knew that something was different about him, and he knew that his grandmother never wanted to talk about her family.  So the week before Shirlee went to visit Grace--now, this is Grace's grandson; week before, he says to his friends at work--he's sitting down at work, and he likes black music--and he says to his friends, "You know, I would love to be part-black or part-Indian."  All of a sudden he says this to his friends.  So the next--so finally Grace gives Shirlee this guy's number.  She says, "Well, you talk to him and he'll"--she says, "I think he'll be more--he'll be more understanding than the two girls."  So she called him, and the first thing he said, "I've been waiting for this call a long time."  He said, "I knew I had relatives.  I knew that there was something else.  My mother was always fascinated with American Indians"--'cause my--see, there're also this Indian on my mother's side.  Said, "And I knew that there was something else."  And then he was the one that went to visit my mother and made the--really reached out and--and after that, we had the big reunion in Los Angeles.  We all went down and met Grace, met her three grandchildren.  My mother came out and--so that was it.  It's really quite a story.  Seventy-six years now have gone by.  And, fortunately, Grace was still alive, and my mother was able to travel.  So she--shortly after her 80th birthday in the fall in October of that year is when we all met Grace.
Speaker 2: But they had--she had had a hard life, really.
Speaker 1: It wasn't that easy.  I mean, it wasn't that easy.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Anyway, we had the reunion.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 60734
Speaker 1: So that's it.  And we have--people always ask me, who read the book, "Have you kept in touch with your cousins?"  "Yes."  The answer is yes.  All of them have been accepting of this, because, you know, we all were on Oprah.  There was a big show that Oprah had where she reunited the two families.  Actually my mother and--was reunited with Grace, but then Grace told us about the other cousins in Ohio and Minnesota who didn't know, again, that their father--her brother--had married two different women.  And so one had children in Minnesota, and one had children in Ohio.  And so they came for Oprah, and that is, you know, they told the world, "Yes, we--this is our aunt."  And we were all on--and asked what we thought about it and told her.  But the short version is that, since then I've been to visit both cousins; the one--who are actually my first cousins--in--the one in Ohio, and the one--they're three--in Minnesota; outside of Minneapolis.  I've been to visit--the one in Ohio is--I'm closest to.  She's been here two or three times, and we talk on the phone, we email each other; I'm closest to her.  The ones in Minnesota, I've seen twice.  So, you know--and we're still--we still see the ones--there were three of them in Los Angeles.  So they have accepted it.  They have--they're in touch with us, and--I mean, it's wonderful for us to--at this age--to have first cousins and second cousins that we didn't know about, you know.  And the race is not important.  I mean, it's true, we call them--teasingly, we call them our white cousins, and they call us their black cousins; and that's fine.  But we are now, you know, as friendly as you would expect after all these years, you know.  So anyway, my mother's, I guess the answer, the short answer to your to your question is she is at peace now.  And she came out to Grace's funeral, and the minister knew about it--about the story.  And so, his obituary was called, "Amazing Grace."  And he told the story at the obituary for my--for Grace.  So it's really a sort of, you know, a full cycle.  Now my mother is still alive.  She's the last one, and she's at peace.  She met her sister.  She had her reunion with her sisters.  She forgave her sister, and so it's a nice story.  It ends up well.  It was sad for years, but it ends up well.
Story_ID: 60735
Speaker 1: It's an amazing story.  Now, I want to take you back to your youth, and I want you to talk about what--maybe smells, sights, or sounds--remind you of your childhood.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I mentioned one, which was water, I always liked to live near water, because my earliest memories are of water.  Long Island Sound was actually less than a block from our house, 'cause Long Island Sound comes up, you know, on the Connecticut shore.  And all my life we have lived--every single place, except maybe when we lived in Liberia--we lived in Liberia for two different periods with my husband--every single place we have lived near a creek or a lake.  There's a creek that runs right behind my house right there.  And we've always lived near a creek or a lake.  In Minneapolis, we lived a block from the lake.  Those were the two places that we lived the longest--in Minnesota, where my husband was assistant professor at--anthropologist--University of Minnesota, and then here.  And there's a lake on campus within walking distance.  So I've always lived near water.  Water has been somehow important to me.  I always think of it as a life-giving force.  And it also can be destructive, but to me it's--I always see it as something that's life-giving.  And the smells that I remember, my mother baked a lot.  You know, in those days, people didn't go and buy frozen rolls, frozen--and bakery cakes and pies.  They actually made them.  And my mother used to make fresh bread almost every weekend, and, you know, we loved that.  We loved it.  And so, the smell of fresh baking bread is very, very nurturing to me.  You know, it's like home cooking and home food.  So I remember that.  There was a river that ran behind our house, growing up in Connecticut.  The first place had a creek and then the place in Ansonia where I grew up.  There was a river right behind us.  So I always remember the sound, going to sleep with the sound.  It was right behind.  There was a bank and then there was a river.  And I always remember when--the spring, when there was a lot of rain in the fall, hearing, going to sleep at night with the, you know, sort of river crashing against the bank.  So it was soothing, too, to me.  And I guess, you say, sights, sounds, and smells; mainly baking bread is a smell that I guess I--that I remember mostly.  And as far as sights, I think what I always liked was spring, because if you grow up in New England, then you have a long winter.  I always liked--the two sights that I liked:  One was the green--the flowers in the trees becoming--coming into bloom.  I used to love to see that, 'cause then we knew that winter was over.  And then in the fall, you know, I grew up where the fall leaves are the most beautiful that you'd ever want to see were all the glorious colors.  But that always would make me a little sad because, although I enjoyed the fall--and I still feel that after all these years, that I get very happy in the spring, when I know spring is coming after the winter.  Even out here, it gets greener.  And I always feel a little sad in October and November when the leaves change, 'cause then I know we're having winter.  So those are some of the things that I remember.
Story_ID: 60736
Speaker 1: The other sight, I guess I have to tell you, and sounds, have to do with church; 'cause I went to church every Sunday, unless I was sick, all my growing up years.  And the sounds, I love gospel music to this day.  And, although, I suppose, my taste has also, you know, grown more sophisticated in many ways.  You go to college and you learn about classical music and so forth and so on and opera.  I still love classical music--I mean gospel music.  And I always start tapping my feet.  So that sound, besides the sound of water, is the sound of church choir singing gospel music, makes me feel--always want to tap my feet.  I also like jazz.  I have a cousin who's a well-known jazz music:  Billy Taylor.  Yeah.  You know Billy?  And he, you know--always been interested in his music.  He played at our wedding, and I've always followed jazz. So those early sounds.  My father and all of his brothers played the piano; and so another sound that I like is families and people singing in harmony besides in church.  We always used to sing at home.  And whenever my father was in a good mood, he would sit down at the piano and he would sing and he had a tenor voice; so the sounds of a tenor.  I love tenors, because my father had a tenor voice and would often, of course, sing in church.  You know, Baptist preachers, if they have good voices, often sing as part of their sermons and things.  So, I guess, those sounds of good gospel music and male tenors singing always remind me of my father and people playing the piano and harmonizing around the piano.  Those are some of the sounds.  And, finally, one final thing is, one of the sights I remember most as a child is Easter Sunday, when all the ladies had the beautiful hats.  So we always looked forward to Easter Sunday, because here you have the beautiful hats, and people were all dressed up.  So I still like to get dressed up after all these years on Easter Sunday.  I don't buy hats anymore like I used to, but I still feel that Easter Sunday is a time when you get dressed up in bright spring colors, and, you know, hopefully, you'll go to church.  But it's still a childhood memory, and, you know, anyone growing up in that era remembers the Easter Sunday and the Sunday parades after church; people showing off their finery.  So those are some of the things I remember.
Story_ID: 60737
Speaker 1: Now, was there--the Baptist church your father was part of--I know he was part of that, but was it the upper-end, sort of a Baptist Church?  Was there--or was it--was it a whooping and hollering (event)?
Speaker 2: I would like to tell you, it was sort of in the middle.  My father, over the years, tried to elevate the kind of service, yes, 'cause he--you know, they came from the South--about 90 percent of the people who belonged to my father's church came up from the South during World War Two, to work in the factories in Ansonia and Waterbury, which, again--and New Haven--which were gearing up for the war effort.  And they were--they had good wages, and so, you know, it's like the immigrants today, the exodus from the South; one family comes and they call their cousins and their brothers and their sisters; and then they come, and then their, you know, neighbors and friends started coming out.  So we had quite a group of people mainly from South Carolina--this little town in South Carolina called Society Hill.  And they brought up all their families and got good jobs in the factories.  And they were used to long services.  But the New Englanders, who belonged to the church, didn't like long services, and they were the ones that were mainly there when my father came; and they were more staid and more conservative and had been--you know, they'd grown up in a different culture.  So my father had to find a middle ground between what the original people in the church had liked to--who had called him and the Southerners, who wanted a very different kind of, maybe, what we would call a more charismatic service with a lot of shouting and singing and testifying; you know, that kind of church.  And so, I think growing up that--I mean, I can remember the church evolving, and he would say, "You know, we need to have shorter services."  And then when people got television, it made a difference, because I can remember when we got our first television set in the--I was in high school--and it was around--maybe it was around 19--in the late 1940s.  Then they were glad to leave church early, because there were things they wanted to see on television.  And I think that had something to do with it.  But--so, he did several things; he shortened the service, he introduced different kinds of music, like choral music and other kinds of music; and he always encouraged the deacons to make their prayers shorter, because they would try to compete with each other and with him in terms of the sermon.  So he tried to, I would have to say, strike a happy medium.  We certainly had gospel singing, and we certainly some testifying.  And the services were longer than any of the white churches in town, I can tell you. But, by and large, he tried to strike bounds; and he really kept emphasizing to the younger generation, Education, education, education.  So people started--more people graduated from high school, more people went to college.  And as you get a more educated group in your congregation, they also want shorter services and more intellectual sermons.  And my father was an educated man, so he gave--he could give both kinds, by the way; but he always--his--he was very--it was very important to him to be grammatical and to not just whoop and holler; but he could do both; I mean, he could be very emotional if, you know, at times.  So I would say that he mixed--little like a mixed metaphor.  There were times when, you know, his sermons were more intellectual, and there were times when sometimes they got pretty emotional, too.  So he was trying to please two different audiences.
Story_ID: 60738
Speaker 1: You know, another question I have that I want to go to you on your, you know, schooling and things like that.  But, was there any messaging in your family or in your community around the issue of color?  You know, whether subtle or unsubtle.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It wasn't so unsubtle in those days, when I was growing up.  Yes, there were messages from my parents, but what was interesting is, because of what had happened to my mother, she was always angry at her family growing up, and she would say unkind things about them that they, you know, wanted to be white, and they were passing for white.  So my mother identified with the black side of her ancestry and married a man--my father is a beautiful, brown color--and clearly, she was stating her preference there.  She wanted a man who looked like a black man.  My uncles were all--I'll show you a picture of my uncles.  I have a nice picture in the hall--good-looking black men, sort of medium brown.  And so we had--on my father's side--mostly brown-skinned people on my father's side.  On my mother's side, the few that we knew who--her one aunt who had married a black man who had stayed in the black community, were what we used to call "extremely fair" people.  And my mother was really quite ambivalent to those cousins, I think.  She was quite ambivalent, and she knew they didn't approve of her marrying a brown-skinned man.  In Washington, D.C., I don't know if you remember, it was notorious for that kind of color caste consciousness.  And so on the one side, her cousins--the one set of cousins that she had in the black community--were very fair-skinned, married fair-skinned men and had fair-skinned children, and the--and she had married a brown-skinned man; although our colors ranged--my sister's--and two of us were quite fair, and two of us were a little bit browner.  So I think we got the message from her that there is nothing--that you should be proud of your black heritage; you should not try to pass for white; you should not split your family, that that is not a good thing; and, that you should treat people as people according to what kind of people they are; and that skin color was absolutely irrelevant.  And we were never encouraged to be snobbish about that.
Story_ID: 60739
Speaker 1: Now, on the other hand--when I say the other hand, there was a value if you were a girl to having lighter skin.  And so we--of course, you grow up being aware of that as soon as you become a teenager, that the boys found that girls who were light skinned and had long hair, you know, boys were attracted to.  And that was true in college, too.  So, you know, you have to be aware that in a black community, that is a continuing issue.  And whether or not you make a big deal of it, other people may show certain preferences; certainly employees when I was growing up.  People--a lot of people who broke the early barriers, broke them because they were lighter skinned.  And that's unfortunate, but that is true:  that skin color was--somehow it was an asset, light-skin color, if you were working, looking for a job with a white employer.  There was probably no question that skin color was an asset and gave you some kind of advantages.  I think sometimes teachers preferred the lighter-skinned--I mean, it's always a question of range; but I think teachers preferred the lighter skinned.  That, again, is unfortunate.  But that was a reality in the--when I grew in the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s].  That was sort of a reality.  I think it is changing now, but I'm not--I don't think that we are ever completely free of that, because it's been so ingrained in us, in our culture.  And it's--we've been brainwashed partly by the white race that white and light skin is beautiful, straight hair is beautiful.  And we've have been brainwashed.  And so I think that sometimes you have to consciously try to get--to get rid of those attitudes.  In our case, the three sisters--my two--the three sisters by my mother and father--all of us are attracted to dark-skinned men.  All of us married dark-skinned men.  And clearly, we were marrying men in the image of our father and uncles.  So that's the--I mean, who you marry and who you're attracted to, that states our preference.  And clearly, we found that black is beautiful (laughs).
Story_ID: 60740
Speaker 1: So, you--did you have a sense as the older child, or do you think that made you a little more--you know, you didn't say rambunctious, but you said, "I was"--I don't--what did you say?  "I was feisty, I was"--
Speaker 2: No.  I was a little bit rebellious in some ways.  I mean, I was very--always--I was always--my mother says I was willful.  Okay.  Do you know--whatever that means.  I was always very determined to do what I wanted to do.  I sort of, very early on, felt that I wanted to do something important with my life--very early on.  I was outspoken.  I was sometimes too outspoken.  And I always, you know, wanted to defend myself with my opinions.  And I never felt intimidated by white people, or anyone else for that matter.  I never felt intimidated.  And I--I think I resolved early in my life never to let anyone personally discriminate against me; that I would not stand for it, and that I would stand up for myself if it meant my life.  I always decided.  Well, luckily I grew up in Connecticut.  So, you grow up in Connecticut, you don't have a whole lot of trouble with that.  But there were times--I mean, I have incidents in my life that I can recall--where I did stand up for myself with a positive results and not negative results, because I felt that--you know, when you know--I knew I was a good student, and I knew, you know--my mother and father used to tell me how smart I was.   When I was a little girl and turning the age of two, my mother used to tell me that I talked, and people would stop on the street and say, "What a smart little girl," and things like that.  So I knew that I had a lot (laughs) of confidence that I could do what I wanted to do.  And in school, the teachers would always, you know, reinforce that.  So I was a good student from the time I entered school.  And never had any academic problems except--maybe a little bit in math and science, which was not where my strength was.  But, you know, that was--in those days, I think a lot of girls just didn't feel--thought we didn't want to deal with math or science, but that was silly, and I'm sorry--I regret it.  But in all the other subjects, I did well.
Story_ID: 60741
Speaker 1: So what was the sense of, you know--'cause of first children we were talking about have an added sense of responsibility, or they're told that they have to have it.  I was wondering how that actualized in your family.
Speaker 2: Well, I think as a first child and the first daughter, you know, I was helping my mother with--by the time I was a teenager--with the younger children; she had three more.  And I think I felt the burden to, because as a first child, to do well in school so the others who followed me would have something to look up to.  And also, being a minister's daughter, the oldest daughter, there were all these--you know, as I said earlier--pressures on you to be a model child.  And sometimes I would rebel slightly, but I never rebelled that much.  I mean, I never went very far from, you know, the sort of standards that they set for me.
Story_ID: 60742
Speaker 1: Now, what--give me the names of your schools.  Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to--well, I ended up in M. E. Willis was the name of it--School.  And that was a kind of old building, you know, old New England building not far from my house.  And then I went to Ansonia High School, which was a public high school, but a good high school with an old New England curriculum, which meant I had to take four years of Latin and things like that.  And so, it gave you a really good education, 'cause I was surprised when I went to college how I didn't really have any trouble with, you know, the work.  And I'd gone to a public school.  Then I went from high school right to college.  I went to Radcliffe College, which, at that time, was the women's--sort of part Harvard University.  Now the two have merged, and there's only Harvard University.  But I do have a degree--my undergraduate degree--from Radcliffe, and then married a year after college.  I worked in between, and maybe we'll get back to my work; but married a year after college and went to Liberia to live with my husband, who was a graduate student at Harvard at the time, working on his research for his doctorate in anthropology.  And then I came back and did a year at what was then called the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in business administration, which was basically the first year of the Harvard Business School.  But they weren't admitting women directly to the business school.  It was kind of a backdoor admission to the business program, and we had to go in through Radcliffe.  We had classes over at the business school, but we couldn't get a degree.  And the year I finished that, we got a certificate for the first year.  The year I got the certificate, they admitted women to the second year of the Harvard Business School.  But I--we were moving to Minnesota, so I could have gotten an MBA, but I didn't.  And so then for a while, you know, I worked for a couple of years and then had children.  And then we moved out here in 1966.  A year later, I entered graduate school at the University of California, and then got a master's degree in social work.  Four years later, I went back to school, deciding I really wanted to be a psychologist.  My interests had kind of gone in that direction.  And, with two children and a husband, I went back to school, again, to the University of California at Berkeley, and got a Ph.D. in Psychology--in clinical psychology.  So my schools, basically, were Radcliffe for undergraduate; one year at the Harvard Business School under the guise of the Harvard-Radcliffe program in business administration; and then UC-Berkeley, where I got actually three graduate degrees: a master's in social work, an M.A. in psychology, and a Ph.D. in psychology.
Story_ID: 60743
Speaker 1: Okay, Dr. Gibbs, so I want to ask--I want to take you back to high school just for a teeny bit and try to figure out, also, what was forming you at that point, and how you even ultimately ended up going to, you know, Radcliffe.  And, was your--was--the name of the (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Ansonia High School.
Speaker 1: Ansonia.  Was it an integrated high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean everything in Connecticut except some of the restaurants and housing areas were integrated, yeah, when I grew up.  Yes.  It was really integrated, but they--we did not have a huge population of black people.  We might have had, oh, maybe about 10 or 15 percent of the town.  It was a small town, 20,000 people; 10 or 15 percent were black. And then we had some Portuguese who we would call blacks.  They wanted to be called something else, but they were Portuguese from the islands off the coast of Spain, which would--there's a lot of black and Portuguese mixture.  So there were two groups of brown-skinned people in town: the black people and the Portuguese people.  And so that those were the people in the school.  But I was in the academic track for college prep.  And so in my classes, really there were only three or four blacks all the way through high school, in my particular high classes.  And I was one of three or four blacks who took the academic curriculum.
Speaker 1: And were--did you have positive messaging coming from your teachers?  Was there anything where your parents had to do some intervention?  I know your father would had--by this time was active in starting his NAACP chapter(simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I think probably there was some protection for me in a sense that they--my father was very well known.  This is a little town of 20,000.  He had the biggest, black church--black Protestant Church.  He was very active in the community and the president of the NAACP.  My mother was in the college women's club, which included some of the teachers.  And they were--and we lived in an integrated neighborhood.  Actually, the church was in an integrated neighborhood.  Most of the blacks lived--this town was dissected or bisected by the Naugatuck River.  And on one side of the Naugatuck River, the east side, the black people and the Portuguese, most of them lived on that side.  Our church, because of its age--it was a very old church, too--was on the west side of the river.  And there were a couple of black neighborhoods on the west side of the river.  But we were in a neighborhood between the two black neighborhoods.  We were in a neighborhood which was mainly white.  So our street, Clifton Avenue, was where the church was, was a mainly white street, and that was the beginning of a white neighborhood that went up to the high school.  So we really grew up in an integrated neighborhood, and I went to school with, you know, mainly the--mainly kids from my neighborhood.  But I would have to say that, I've always said to people when they say there's a lot of racism in the schools, all teachers like good students.  There isn't really a teacher in the world who doesn't appreciate a good student.  So I think if students do their homework and come on time and are attentive in class and not troublemakers, even teachers who are prejudiced will recognize that you're a good student and will--and my experience is that I never had any negative--that I can remember--negative feedback as a student.
Story_ID: 60744
Speaker 1: I only had one incident in all of the four--and actually it was in junior high school--where I had to speak up for myself, because I felt there was discrimination, and that had to do with an eighth-grade operetta.  We used to do--the schools--every year did a big operetta in the spring that, of course, the whole community came to.  It was the only time I ever faced prejudice, and I spoke up for myself, and I knew--'cause I had a good voice.  I used to be (laughs) one of the leaders of my junior choir.  I knew I had a good voice, and I tried out for the operetta.  And the person in charge didn't--when they listed the names, did not have me on the list.  And I felt like I wanted to cry, because I knew my voice was better than half of the kids who were in the operetta.  But ironically--well, let me come back to that about the name of the operetta.  But it would--no.  It was called "Hilda of Holland" (ph).  So when I went home, my mother said, "Well, you know, because it's 'Hilda of Holland,' they probably didn't have any black kids, 'cause, you know, the Dutch are so fair skinned with blond hair."  I said, "That doesn't matter."  I said, "They're going to use wigs."  She says, "Well, when you go back to school tomorrow, you talk to"--I had a favorite teacher who was my English teacher.  She said, "You talk to Ms. Lane and see if Ms. Lane will intervene."  She said, "'Cause I don't really want to go up there for this, because," she said, "you know, I'm not sure it's really prejudice.  It may be just reality that they know that the Dutch are fair skinned."  So, she said, "But if you really want to do it, you're big enough, you're a big girl, you speak up."  And that's the kind of things my father and mother would tell me.  So I went back to school the next day, and I talked to Ms. Lane.  And I said, "You know, Ms. Lane, I have a better voice than half of the people who tried out, and I don't think it was fair that they didn't pick me."  And she said, "Well, let me see what I can do."  And before the end of the school day, the--the guy--the man who ran the music program had put me on the list to be in the operetta.  And I did have a blond wig.  Well, the funny--the ironic part of this is story is, they then had to find a black boy to cast to be with me 'cause there were couples in several of this operetta scene, "Hilda of Holland," and, you know, you dance.  And so the--that became the issue.  So then they picked my--one of my neighbors, who also was a boy that I sort of had a crush on, named Howard Kinney (ph), and Howard was my partner.  He couldn't sing at all (laughs), but they--and couldn't dance either (laughs).  But they had Howard so that I would have a--and he--again, had sort of light skinned.  I would have to say that that was part of it.  And we were the only two blacks who had ever been cast in an operetta in the history of the school.  They had never had any blacks in the operetta.  And so we broke the color barrier, and we both wore blond wigs.  So it was very funny.  And all the people in my father's church came to see us in the operetta.  And Howie was Methodist.  They had a small church in town, and all the Methodists came to see.  So they could see, "Gee, we can sell out the school auditorium (laughs) if we have a few black kids every year."  But the ironic part of this whole thing, "Hilda of Holland," when I married my husband--went to meet my husband's family years later, my husband's mother's name is Hilda, and his sister's name is Hilda. I said, "So in some place it's an omen that one time that I was in an operetta called "Hilda of Holland."  Is that funny (laughs)?  So that's why I love, my favorite stories.
Speaker 2: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But I also have to say the next year, they did the "Gypsy Rover" and I had a leading part in that, because, of course, they looked at me and said, "You know, she sort of looks like a gypsy."  So I had a leading role in the "Gypsy Rover."  And it's sort of, like, we just seen last night the Academy Awards, where two black--a black actor and a black actress--I mean, I know it's not at that level, but I want to make that comparison, because they are breaking barriers.  And we broke a barrier in that small town high school in the late--in the early '50s [1950s], when we were cast in the operetta.  And now I'm sure if I were to go back, they'd probably have lots of blacks and Asians and Latinos in the operetta.  So--but it's the first.  You have to break the barrier so people will realize it's okay, and then they will begin to recognize your talent.  The interesting thing is in the classroom, I always--you know, I was an all "A" student, and I was the top four of my graduating class.  In the academic track, I was the top four.  So, you know, it's just they like to have good students.

Speaker 1: How did the decision to go to Radcliffe come about?  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, that's interesting too, because at the age of 12, I read a magazine.  You may not remember this magazine.  It was called "Calling All Girls."  It was before "Seventeen," which became--replaced it.  "Calling All Girls" was a magazine, you know, in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] that girls in high school--teenage girls--would subscribe to or would buy on the newsstand.  And, you know, it was like "Seventeen" magazine; fashions, makeup, dating; all those things.  Of course, much tamer than the magazines now.  But, in any case, it taught girls a lot of how to makeup, how to dress, what are the current fashions; and so we liked "Seventeen."  And I was an early person to get it.  It was sort of for mid-teens.  It was a mid-teen magazine.  I was 12, and I think my mother gave me a subscription.  They had an article about Radcliffe College being one--the leading women's college in the country, and I said to my mother, "You know, that's where I'm going to go when I get--grow up."  And she told my father, and he--and I expected them to laugh.  He did not laugh.  He said, "Well, you know, that's part of Harvard, and you've got to be a good student."  He said, "So, if you keep up your grades and you're a good student and you want to go to Radcliffe, we will find a way to send you to Radcliffe."  And I never forgot it.  And so, four years later--'cause I was about in eighth grade--four years later, I applied to Radcliffe.  It was one of only three schools that I applied to, not realizing how competitive it must have been.  I didn't even realize it.  I knew I was a good student, and I didn't realize how competitive it was.  I just knew it was a good school.  But I applied and we had an interview and I got in.
Story_ID: 60746
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe the Radcliffe of that day in terms of its admission?  What--I mean, what-
Speaker 2: The Radcliffe of that day and all the other, what we call the seven sister colleges, some of them have now admitted men.  But Vassar, Smith, Mount Holyoke, Bryn Mawr, Radcliffe, and--I think I mentioned Vassar and Smith--they were--all had similar policies, which was--first of all, they had a very small quota for blacks and a slightly larger quota for Jewish girls.  I was--they admitted two blacks to my class at Radcliffe, only two out of a class of, maybe, 120 girls.  Of those two, the other one did not show up.  I don't know where she went and never even knew what her name was, but she--they had put us together as roommates.  We were supposed to be roommates, and that is what--so they did have segregated--they had quotas first; secondly, they had segregated rooming assignments.  If they knew you were a person of color, you were assigned to live with a person of color, preferably your own color.  We had, in my class I think we may have had one Asian girl.  We had, to my knowledge, no Latino girls, and--although we did have somebody who was Spanish but not American born.  And then we had--I was the lone black girl in that class.  And so they gave me a beautiful single room.  I had applied for a double room because it was cheaper, and, you know, it was a way to save money.  When you have a roommate, you pay a lower fee, and you can--I had a beautiful single room by myself because they didn't want to put a white girl with me.  And as it turned out, that was wonderful, because it helped me to--I liked to study late at night.  It helped me to adjust the first semester.  And the second I had a white roommate who came to me and said she was also from Connecticut, from an artist family, liberal artist family in Connecticut; beautiful redhead named Lorna Briggs (ph).  Her father was a famous illustrator.  And she was reared in a very liberal family.  And so, she came and said she'd like to room with me.  We were good friends.  So I then had two white roommates and one black roommate the rest of the time I was at Radcliffe.  Each year I, you know, had a different roommate.  But I had two white roommates and got along with them well, and then I had one black roommate.
Story_ID: 60747
Speaker 1: Was there anything about Radcliffe that was a culture shock?  I mean, you had already existed in a white world, so maybe that wasn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.  The fact that Radcliffe was white was not a culture shock.  What was somewhat of a culture shock, there were two things.  First of all, at that time, much more than today, it catered to a much more exclusive group of white girls, who had--basically were from moneyed families; wealthy families and upper middle-class professional families and business families.  These were girls who had a lot of wealth, had summer homes, had--you know, some of their fathers had their own planes, owned their own businesses, were heads of corporations.  I mean, after all, Radcliffe being outside of Boston, we had Cabots; Marjorie Cabot, one of the famous Cabot families lived next door to me; we had Lodges; we had, like--there were Kennedy boys at Harvard when I was there; Senator--the current Senator Kennedy was two years ahead of me and used to come to my dorm to date girls, so, you know--Teddy Kennedy.  So you had Kennedys, you had Rockefellers; you had all of these kinds of names and people from very wealthy, famous families, powerful families, diplomats' children.  And so, you know, I didn't grow up, you know, consorting with people from that background.  And most, I will have to say, were friendly, and many of them had grown up in somewhat liberal families.  And all my life, I have found that those who were truly wealthy and truly have--from the upper class--are really, genuinely more accepting of minorities and often more liberal than the new--what we call the new rich--and people who did not grow up with money and class.  So, as far as that goes, I had a very happy experience at Radcliffe.
Story_ID: 60748
Speaker 1: There was, at that time, mainly segregated dating.  Although, as I said, in the dorm we lived--often they put blacks together and Asians together and Jewish girls together--the dorms were not segregated.  I mean, we all lived in the same dorm.  The college activities were not segregated.  I sang with chorus, and I was one of the founders of the "Radcliffe Association for Minority People," which was like a chapter of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] on campus.  So I was one of the founders.  I was always an activist.  And I also led the fight against segregated rooming.  And by the end of my second year, I had joined the student council, and the student council voted and we went to the president and we said, "We don't want any more segregated rooming."  And so, in my junior year, they abolished segregated--so I take credit for that.  Of course, a few years later in the '60s [1960s], the black kids came and said they wanted segregated housing. (laughs.)  And I was just so shocked.  But that was another generation and another movement where I, you know, I called the "identity"--"the black identity movement."  But in our day, we thought it was bad to be at a white school and to have segregated rooming.  So through the efforts of my liberal friends, many of whom were Jewish in college--many of my closest friends were Jewish--came from liberal backgrounds.  We kind of took over the student council, and we got the vote.  And when the president saw that the leaders of the college were against segregated rooming--and some of them were Jewish--I was the--there were two of us who were black who were on the student council--I guess he must have taken this to the Board, but when we came back junior room, we didn't have it anymore.  So I really was proud of that and starting the college chapter of the NAACP, and trying to recruit more blacks.  So by the time I left, they were recruiting something like four to six in a class.  And then, of course, every year it went up until it got to be about a third of the class.  So it--that was the beginning of that progress.  And as I--getting back to the segregated dating, though, there was some interracial dating, but not much.  So we, you know, those girls who were going to the schools would sort of--have meet boys on the weekends from the other New England schools.  So you'd meet boys from Harvard, and Yale; and Princeton even would come up; from Bowdoin in Maine, they were--and Brown in Rhode Island.  They would all come to Boston.  So Boston became the magnet for the black college students in the Ivy League.  It became the magnet.  And so we actually had a very active social life.
Speaker 2: So how did you meet your husband?
Speaker 1: I met my husband at Harvard.  He was a graduate student in anthropology.  And I guess I might say that we met on a blind date and it was very interesting.  And we got together on a blind date, and I was actually going out with another young man from Boston University.  And my husband, Jim, came along, and I found him interesting.  And he told me all these tales about being an anthropologist and going to be--planning to go live in Africa, which was fascinating.  So we married a year after I graduated.
Story_ID: 60749
Speaker 1: And what were your thoughts at that point?  You know, was it that--at that point in time, were you thinking about going on to graduate school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.  I had been admitted to the Columbia School of Social Work--New York School of Social Work at Columbia.  And it was really quite a sort of choice that I had to make.  But what I did was--I said, well, I'll delay a year and see if we really--I really do want to go to Africa and get married.  So I had also taken the exam for what was then called the junior management intern program in the federal government.  And they had never appointed a black woman.  And I, again, I was determined that I was going to break that.  I said, you know, this is ridiculous that in Washington, D.C., and the government, that all the, you know, 10,000 people take this test, some blacks must pass it.  And then they have an oral exam, and that's where they would weed them out.  So I passed and got a very high grade.  And then they had an oral exam in Boston, and I was the only black at the oral exam.  And, you know, I just devised a strategy which I felt was going to be successful.  They ask certain questions, and you have to show that you can work with a group, and, you know, come to a conclusion.  They give you--used to give you problems.  And they really want to see how good are you at leadership, was the idea.  Well, I'd been leading things for a long time by then, but so had the other students.  They were all people who were active in their campuses.  But anyway, at the end, one of the examiners came up to me and he said, "Well, you were very good in there," he said.  And he was a white male, and he said, "And I'm going to recommend you highly, but I don't know what's going to happen."  And that was the code; that you'll be recommended, but you might not get it.  Anyway, he must have been an advocate for me because I did get it, and I was the first black woman to be hired as a--from--this is a federal civil service exam--to be hired from the register and went to work in the labor department.  And the women's bureau was my assignment, which, again, is a theme that has run through my life, because, at that time, I got interested in the problems of women all over the world; the status of women.  I worked with a woman who was head of a particular division, and she asked me--my assignment was to write a report on the status of women around the world; the economic and social status.  So I had to do a lot of research.  But that was my assignment.  And I finished the report in about six months, and some of it was--well, she incorporated a lot of it into her report.  But I got interested in the status of women around the world, and it has been a continuing theme of my activities and my interests ever since.
Speaker 1: Now, what made you interested in social work?
Speaker 2: Well, that was one of the things that got me interested in social work, this--by doing this report, because I went back to social work after I was married, 'cause at the end of the year, after getting--winning--after--winning a place, I got married, you know.  And that's what they used to say about women, they--you give them these opportunities, then they got married.  But I did work a year in Washington and enjoyed it.  Then I got married, went to Africa for 18 months.
Story_ID: 60750
Speaker 1: Now, what was that experience like--Liberia?  And that's still pretty early on, you know, in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: The country was stable, though.  It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was stable at that time under President Tubman, who was a kind of benign dictator in a way.  It was an eye-opening experience.  It was an interesting experience.  In some ways it was very difficult for us.  We were thousands of miles away from home.  My husband--actually, we lived in Monrovia for a few weeks, but then we had to go--up country to the--what is called the Bush--to an area, a little town called Foqwali (ph), which is, you know, off the main road.  You have to go in with a Jeep, the dirt road, way back.  And it was a really-a community that had very few educated people.  They were tribal people.  It was called the--they were called the Balli people, the Balli tribe. It was very traditional. The chief had a number of wives. The wives did all the work around the house and the farms and they had lots of children. Very few people spoke English and we actually lived in a mud hut, in fact I'll show you a picture, I have it on the porch. We lived in mud huts without any refrigeration, electricity, no TV, no radio, no regular bathrooms. That's how we lived for eighteen months. So it was difficult but it was also challenging and I must say I learned to be very resourceful. I learned to bake bread like my mother used to do. I learned, you know we had hired two young teenage boys to haul water for me from the well and we had to take care of our dishes and our bathroom needs just with water from the well. I learned how to run a house without any electricity or any modern sewage disposal. We had a house where we had rats up, we had to get a cat to catch the rat. And when the windows were open all day, people would just peer in.  We just had very little privacy. But we survived that.  And it made us very resourceful, I must say.  And I spent a lot of time interviewing the women in the village, collecting folk tales; because I'm a person who cannot be idle very long.  And my husband was doing his research on the village on tribal law.  So I figured, you know, I can help him.  I can interview the women about childrearing and about marriage customs and about how they adorn themselves, and you know, what their opinions are about things, and how they feel about multiple marriage--polygamy, because each man who could afford it would have two or three wives.  And so I did that.  Every day I would go out and I had an interpreter and I would interview the women in the village.  And I also would collect folk tales from them.  And the other thing that I did, I taught myself to type, and the two boys that we hired were teenagers who had only had like a sixth-grade education.  There was a mission school in the village.  There was one teacher in a mission school.  So I decided I would teach them, because they seemed very bright to me.  And I ordered materials--there were materials that are produced--I'm sure it's still for missionaries abroad and diplomats' children abroad who don't have school--American schools.  And it was really called the Calvert Method of teaching, and there--they go all around the world, they send these packages.  And you tell them what you need.  And so I applied for a package for--essentially for junior high school, I went and found that they had a hard time doing that.  So, but basically I sat down with them every afternoon for about two hours and concentrated on reading, writing, mathematics, and something about their own history in Liberia, and managed to bring them up to an eighth-grade level by the time I had--we left Liberia.  And one of them, who was really smart and wanted to be educated, we paid for him to go to a mission high school when we left.  So it was--you know, I felt that we had used our time well and that we had made a contribution to Liberia by, you know, getting these young men--getting them more educated.
Story_ID: 60751
Speaker 1: What was your thought there?  'Cause you said math was not your subject.  So I was just wondering how (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, what's interesting is, I was looking--it was a very pragmatic decision.  I was looking for a program I could complete in one year.  My husband had one year to work on his dissertation, and he expected to be finished and move on.  And I was going to be in Cambridge in Boston.  I thought, let me do one thing.  And also, it was a time when opportunities were beginning to open up for women in business--minority women--just beginning.  And I had had the experience at the Labor Department where I saw all these women in administrative positions in some of the departments, especially the women's bureau.  And it gave me the thought, you know, maybe I can get a job like that, being an administrator of some government program or business program, because I had seen these women who had these wonderful jobs and had been very impressed with them.  And so I said, "Well, I don't know where we're going to go.  I don't know where Jim is going to get a job, but wherever he goes, there's going to be a state government or some kind of government where I might be able to get a job or maybe a business."  And so, that's what this program offered.  It offered women education in business at the--mainly with one year, you know, you could certainly do administration.  A lot of the women went into marketing.  They had a good marketing course.  And it turns out maybe it wasn't a good decision at the time, because it was based on pragmatism.  'Cause my husband said, "Why don't you just go on and go to social work school and be used, since that's what you really wanted to do in the first place, and then we can do--wherever I go, you can do the second year."  And that's probably what I should have done, because in my heart I wanted to really be a social worker or a lawyer; that was my other choice.  But both of those programs were more than one year.  So he says, "Why don't you just go ahead Jewelle."  He did encourage me, and I didn't follow his advice.  Okay.  I was stubborn.  And I said, "No.  I want to be finished with my program in a year."  But it really wasn't a master's degree.
Story_ID: 60752
Speaker 1: However, it led me to a job, when he got a job, at--he was recruited by the University of Minnesota, and he was the third black professor that they ever hired at the University of Minnesota.  There was one woman and one man, and he was the third, but the first in his department of anthropology.  So when we went out there, there were very few blacks in that community, many offices did not have many blacks in 1959--I mean, it was a very white community, mainly Scandinavian and Irish.  And so, I had sent my CV, mailed it with letters to about six big companies, because it's the heart of the Midwest.  So you had the Pillsbury Company; you had the General Mills, which produced, you know, cakes and cereals and things; you had Three M, Minnesota Mining Company; and, you had a lot of big banks.  You had a lot of big companies.  So I sent about six CVs.  And I must say for the record, that everybody was impressed.  Of course, my CV does not mention race, and there were no black schools listed.  So there was really very few clues on my race on my CV at that time--my resume at that time.  So I got wonderful letters from four of the six companies, "We want you to interview," you know, "You're so impressive in your record."  When I got out there, they weren't as welcoming.  And I might say that General Mills gave me an interview.  When I walked in the room, they were so shocked the man could barely talk.  Then I realized that I had to, again, assert myself and not let discrimination, you know, ruin my chances for a good job.  So I didn't really like the atmosphere at General Mills, so I said, "Well, I'm not even going to pursue this."  But Pillsbury, the man was very friendly--the man who interviewed me--but he said to me, near the end of the interview, he said, "You know, I want to be frank with you."  He says, "You have a wonderful resume."  He says, "You interview well."  He says, "You're an attractive, intelligent, articulate young woman.  I want to ask you a question."  He said, "I'd like to give you this job in marketing."  He said, "Do you think your race would be a problem?"  And I looked him square in the eye, and I said, "You know, my race has never been a problem for me.  My race is a problem for you."  I said, "Now you just told me that I was qualified; that you think I'm attractive, articulate, and I interview well and I have good educational credentials."  I said, "Now, I think it's up to you to decide whether you are going to hire me on my merits or you're going to worry about the color of my skin."  He says, "You're hired."  And I decided, you know, that's the way you have to run your life.  You just can't let people intimidate you or discriminate against you when they know it's wrong.  He hired me, and we always got along.  I had two white colleagues, and we worked in marketing.
Story_ID: 60753
Speaker 1: And what we did was market those cakes that you've probably made. You know, people have made all their lives, the Pillsbury cakes.  And we used to do market research.  And we used to go out in the communities in the Midwest and actually go door to door.  At that time, it was a different time, and ask women would they bake a cake--two cakes that we give them.  And the next day, we'd come back, and we'd ask them which they like better, and what should be the name of the cake.  It was very interesting.  So we went all over to the town--mainly in Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin--and we would visit these little towns, and we would place these cakes.  And women would actually bake these cakes.  It's hard to believe now that we did that.  We weren't afraid, they weren't afraid.  And I never had one woman slam a door in my face.  And they were white people that I dealt with, all of them.  And they would take the cakes, they would bake the cakes, and I would go back the next day, and then I would--sometimes we had other products, too, like, macaroni mixes or things--potato, you know, whipped potato mixes.  And they would answer the questionnaires.  And that's the kind of job I had.  It was very interesting.  And then we would go back to the Pillsbury Company.  We would report our findings, and then they would decide how to name the cake mixes from our market research.  They would decide how to market the cakes from our market research.  Now the thing about that job, which was my first job in business--and I might add, my last job 'cause then I went on.  I was the first black person to be a junior executive at the Pillsbury Company.  And when I first joined that company, there were no black people in the building.  Not in the building.  And one of the elevator operators did not want to take me up to the fifth floor, which was the first executive floor--did not want--did not believe that I should go up there.  And I said, "Well, I'm starting my job today, and I'm working on the fifth floor."  And he did not believe it.  And he was nasty to me for about a year, and then finally relented.  So, you know, I stepped in and I thought, you know, I'm going to just do a good job and prove myself.  And now, I am very happy to report, that same company where I was the first black in the building--not--the janitors were not black; everybody was white.  I am happy to report that they have several black vice presidents.  And when I saw the article, I think in "Jet" that they had the first black woman vice president, I had to sit down and write her a note and congratulate her.  And I said, "You know, they've come a far distance from the time that I was the first black to work in the headquarters building."
Speaker 2: Now, when you--you left that because your husband got--came out here.
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  I left that 'cause I'd my two--just started having babies.
Speaker 2: Babies.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so we had our first child in 1961, and he was born in Minneapolis.  I worked at the Pillsbury Company, though, about 18 months.  And when I left, they gave me a beautiful, beautiful shower.  And I had my first child in April, 1961, named Jeffrey Taylor Gibbs.  And then we had a second child in 1963--June 1963.  And his name is Lowell Dabney Gibbs, after my husband's family, Dabneys, from Virginia.
Story_ID: 60754
Speaker 1: And this is all at the time that the Civil Rights Movement is heating up around the country.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And I was--because, I was glad that I was a housewife, because I got very active in the Minnesota Civil Rights Movement.  And Minnesota, although it did not have many blacks, it had a very liberal reputation.  You may remember we produced Senator [Hubert]Humphrey, who was probably the most liberal senator up until recent times and was almost wholly responsible for the first Civil Rights Bill to pass and the second Civil Rights Bill.  He was almost wholly responsible.  We also had Senator Eugene McCarthy, whose campaign I worked in very actively, and I was co-chair of the women's division of Senator's McCarthy's last senatorial campaign in Minnesota.  I also worked on Senator Humphrey's campaign while we were there.  We were only there six years, from 1959 to--well, seven years--1966.  But one of those years we were on sabbatical.  So we actually lived in the city from 1959 to 1965.  So I worked on both of their senatorial campaigns.  And Governor [Orville] Freeman was a very liberal governor, and he became Secretary of, I believe, Secretary of Agriculture under President--I think President Kennedy.  And then we had several congressmen who were very, very, very liberal.  So, although we had a small black population, they were very interested in Civil Rights.  And so, I got interested in Civil Rights and was the co-chair of the Minnesota Women's Committee for Civil Rights in the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: So this is interesting, because your father is playing a big, you know, role, also.
Speaker 2: That's right, in the Kennedy Campaign.
Speaker 1: On the national stage, the Kennedy Campaign.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're active in Minnesota.  Now, what have---now, extend--how do you get to--your husband comes to Berkeley?
Speaker 2: No.  My--okay.  So what happened was (laughs) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: He does the same thing.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  That's right.  What happened was, just about the time I was thinking of running for the City Council in Minneapolis, they had approached me--in 1965, they approached me to run for the City Council, and I was really interested, 'cause I had been really active, and I was, you know, was quite visible in Minnesota politics.  And so I, in fact, when [Walter] Mondale, who became the senator and ran for vice president--when Mondale ran, the first time he ran he was an attorney general, and then he decided that he was going to run for a higher office.  His campaign manager called me and--called us and said, "Would you give him a coffee party?"  They did a lot of coffee parties in Minnesota.  That part of the country loves coffee parties or cocktail parties.  "But would you give him either a coffee party," which is the morning party, "or a cocktail party?"  So I said--"to meet the black leaders in the community," 'cause we, you know, Fritz [Walter Mondale]--we used to call him Fritz--Fritz knew us and his wife knew us, because they were neighbors, and our two children, the two boys, went to the same nursery school and we were in a car pool.  I was in a car pool with his wife.  And, at that time, he was attorney general.  So he said, "Well, would you help out with the campaign by introducing Fritz to the black leaders?"  I said, "Sure."  So later on when he ran for vice president, I said, "Well, I wonder how many people can say that they once were called by the vice president to be, you know (laughs), a member--to help them get elected as senator."  So, you know, I have a lot of fond memories of Minnesota.  Anyway, then my husband was ready to go on sabbatical, and so he says, "Well, when we come back, let's talk about your running, but not right now.  It's not a good time."

Speaker 1: In the meantime, that same spring of 1965, he got an offer from Stanford, and we came out to Stanford to look at it.  And I guess he fell in love with it.  And we liked the weather, 'cause it's beautiful out here all year round.  You know, we never have snow.  I will say, once in a blue moon we have the light sprinkling.  There's snow in the mountains, but we almost never have snow.  And it's beautiful all year round.  You have flowers growing outside all year round.  And it's a more laid-back environment than the East, as you know, or even Chicago.  It's more laid back.  So Jim liked it right away.  He liked the department.  And, again, Stanford didn't have any black professors except one in the medical school.  So, again, he made--he's made--my husband's made a lot of history.  He said that he would come, but we had already slated this second trip to Liberia in 1965.  So they said, "Well, can you come after your sabbatical?"  So we went to Liberia 1955 [sic], 1965, with our boys.  And this time, we had a better house, 'cause I insisted that we needed a better house for two little boys.  And we lived in a bigger town with a Peace Corps doctor.  So that went better than--the first time was much more difficult.  So we stayed there for a year, and then we didn't go back to Minnesota.  We came right here and moved to Palo Alto and moved--actually this house, this is Stanford campus.  And he became the first professor--tenured professor in the school outside of the medical school; they had one black professor.  And so he became the first one at Stanford in the--you know, the general university, outside the medical school.
Speaker 2: In anthropology?
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And subsequently became chair and dean.  He became chair of the anthropology department, and also served as dean of the undergraduate studies, subsequently.
Story_ID: 60756
Speaker 1: Now, so you decide to go back to school.
Speaker 2: I decide that I am ready now to go back to school; that I didn't want to continue in business, 'cause I could see that in business they were opening up to women, but not as much to minority women, and that I would--I didn't want--you know, didn't want to have to go on every interview and say, "Yes, I'm qualified.  You need to hire me."  So what I did was got the boys settled a year.  Put--the older one went--was in nursery school.  No.  I guess he was in kindergarten.  And then the second year, the younger boy started nursery school.  So I had sort of three mornings a week when I could study.  So, anyway, the first year I applied to the School of Social Work at Berkeley, which was an hour's commute; little bit over an hour at that time.  And, you know, with a lot of support from my husband helping me out, I commuted, and I did it over three years.  And I got a master's at the School of Social Work.  That was my first degree at Berkeley.
Story_ID: 60757
Speaker 1: Then came and worked here at Stanford in the Student Mental Health Center. And I found out in the four years that I was working, that was a very historic time too, because that was--I finished my degree in 1970.  I remember Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968, and there were a few black students on this campus, a handful.  They protested like everybody else did, and that--and, you know, they used that opportunity to ask the universities to open up, to hire more black faculty, to bring in more black students.  So by 1970, two years after Martin Luther King died, they had significantly increased the number of black students the following two years.  So the counseling center was looking for a black counselor.  And I finished my degree and--and they have two counseling centers.  There's one that's for academic counseling.  And the other one is really mental health, psychiatric counseling.  And my degree was in psychiatric social work.  So they knew about me because I had done a year's internship at--my last year at Stanford Cowell Health Center.  And they liked me and they hired me right away at the end of the year.  They said, "We want you to stay," and they said, "You know"-- and I said--they said, "Well, you know, we like your work," and I said, "Yeah, and you want somebody for the black students, don't you?"  I said, "And I'll stay on one condition."  "What is it?" the boss said--my boss, who was a psychiatrist.  I said, "I don't want to just see black students."  I said, "I want to see all students.  I am qualified to see everybody, and I don't want to be ghettoized.  So if you hire me, I will take appointments as they come.  And the black students will find out I'm here, and they will make appointments with me if they want to, but I don't want to be ghettoized."  'Cause I think it's very important in people's careers not to define yourself and limit yourself.  And that, to me, is limiting.  He said, "Fine."  He said, "You know, you've been seeing all kinds of people this year, so we know you're just a good therapist," 'cause I was really doing psychotherapy and crisis intervention.  So they hired me, and I worked for four years at the Stanford's Student Health Center, and then--you know, the mental health department.
Story_ID: 60758
Speaker 1: And then about the fourth year, I realize that there were some issues about students and young people that I really wanted to do more research on, and that I might end up wanting to either do teaching or have a private practice; and applied to Berkeley's Department of Clinical Psychology to get a Ph.D.  And I did go back and finish my Ph.D. in five years.  And then, you know, was planning to start a practice in clinical psychology.  And that year was the year that California passed this horrible Proposition 13, which you probably don't even know about or you may, where, you know, they just cut out all sorts of services.  There were no entry positions at all for people, and that was the year that I came out--finished my Ph.D.  So I ended up--teaching was a second choice.  I wasn't even thinking about being a teacher, but it was a second choice.  And then Berkeley, the School of Social Welfare, where I got my master's, was looking for somebody.  You know, I seem to have been in the right place at the right time a lot--a lot of times in my life, and I have to say that.  You know, there are sort of things just came together for me.  And I--so, one of the--the spring I was finishing up my dissertation, I ran into my former--one of my former instructors at a coffee shop on campus.  He had become the dean, and he called me over.  He said, "Aren't you Jewelle Taylor?"  He remembered my maiden name.  And I said, "Yes."  He said, "Do you remember me?"  I said, "Yeah, I remember you, Harry."  And I had never gotten along with him, really.  And he said, "Well, you know, we're looking for somebody, and we'd be interested in having you apply for this job."  I said, "A lecturer?"  He said, "No.  A full-time, tenure track professor."  I said, "Well, you sure you want me to apply?" 'cause, you know, he and I had some tensions.  He said, "Oh, yes.  I hear you've been doing good work over there in the psychology department, and we would like you to apply."  Again, this is the time the university is expanding, worried about minority professors, worried about Affirmative Action, looking for qualified people.  I saw him in a coffee shop, and the rest is history.  Although I didn't apply at first, he kept pursuing me, and three times he called me and said, "We really want you to apply."  And I finally applied and got the job without any trouble.
Story_ID: 60759
Speaker 1: Now, I also want to just consider the times.  U.C.-Berkeley became a hotbed really (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Earlier than that.
Speaker 1: Earlier than that.
Speaker 2: There was a lot of student unrest in the '60s [1960s] of free speech movement.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was getting my master's when they had the free speech movement.  And I was a commuter and a parent, and I did not get involved.  But I did get maced one night.  I mean, I was--not personally, but the--when Reagan called the National Guard on campus--I think it was 1969--I was driving home to my family, innocent, and the National Guard had gassed the demonstrators on the campus, and I got a really strong--I mean, not maced, but a really strong--I opened my window just passing where they had been, and a really strong whiff of gas, which kind of made me sick to my stomach.  So I do remember that.
Story_ID: 60760
Speaker 1: Now, when you got the position on the full tenured track, what was your--what were--you said you had already started looking at some issues regarding, you know, students.
Speaker 2: Well, I was--yeah, I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Youth.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, college students.  But what I realized is that, I was interested in kind of--let me put it this way:  the trajectory of how do some students become successful and get into Stanford, and Harvard, and Ivy Leagues schools, University of Chicago and other places; and other students go to jail?  That was one of my main interests.  I mean, here we had a large--larger number of black students than we've ever had in history.  How did they survive?  How did they get out of school and come to this university?  Whereas, in my day we only had a few who managed to go to those kinds of schools; I mean, a handful.  Okay.  And they were privileged.  Most of the kids that I knew, they were all from middle-class professional families.  Very few were scholarship kids in those days.  There were a few, but a very few.  And so I wondered, here we have kids, some of whom now we're beginning--and it's early '70s [1970s]--to admit kids from the inner city, who never had been admitted to Ivy League schools.  You probably remember that time.  And they were struggling.  But they were struggling for a good cause.  They were struggling.  Talk about cultural shock.  Here you brought kids in from Watts and Harlem and inner-city South Side, Chicago, to a place, which was very alien to them, to mingle with students--again, wealthy, upper middle-class white students; fraternities and sororities.  A lot of the students on this campus were very wealthy and had cars, and, you know, would ride around all year in their convertibles, new convertibles.  And just the culture shock of taking these kinds of courses, where you have to write 25-page papers and do a lot of research and get used to debating things and issues.  And so, a lot of those kids came to me for counseling because of this culture shock.  And I got interested in this issue.  First of all, how do you overcome these barriers?  Once you admit them, we've got to give them services and we've got to support them and we've got to get them through; that was the first issue I got interested in.  And I wrote a couple of papers about that:  How do you give support services to minority students on campus with the focus on black students? How do black students adapt to this very different environment?  Now, some of them were--didn't have to adapt, you know.  They didn't all have to adapt.  But there were a significant number who didn't have this background and found difficulties.  So I wrote a couple of papers about that.  And then I like--I found out I liked writing and I liked doing research and I liked interviewing people and I liked finding answers to questions, which, of course, is part of what a professor does.  So, in any case, when I went back to the Ph.D.--when I wrote--you know, you have to write a statement why do you want to come back--I said that I was interested in this issue of adaptation of minority students to predominantly white environment; how do they adapt, and what do we need to do to help them.
Story_ID: 60761
Speaker 1: And then the other part of that issue is:  How do some make it and others don't?  What's going on?  Is it the family?  So we need to look before they get there, you see.  So when I went back, that's what I was studying and ended up doing a dissertation on delinquency, as a matter of fact, because I was so interested in the other side of that:  Who becomes delinquent and why?  And I looked at delinquent girls and compared four races:  whites, Asians, Latinos, and blacks; and patterns of delinquency, and what kind of families they came from; and, you know, what kind of support systems did they have?  What kind of activities did the engaged in?  I found clear differences in the patterns of delinquency between each group; between the whites, the blacks, the Latinos, and Asians.  And so, I got further, really interested in this whole issue of what are the factors that really contribute to teenagers who get involved in the criminal justice system:  Is it just prejudice or is it other things?  And I'd said, you know, I really have to devote my life--my life's work to finding some answers here.  And so, that's how my interest sort of began to change and expand and broaden. And then when I got the job--of course, as a professor in any major university, you have to do research, you have to publish.  And so I ended up publishing four different books in my career.  Two are co-authored and two I did, you know, myself.  The thing about my books is, they cover a range of issues, but they're at the core--the core issues.  Even though you look at the titles and you say, "Gee, these are kind of different."  The core issues is looking at the problems of minority youth, primarily black youths--African-American youths--and their families, and how their lives are impacted by our institutional system.  So those are really the core themes.  And I've gone off in different directions with each book.  But the core themes are:  How can we improve the fit between African-Americans, particularly low-income, inner-city African-Americans and their experiences, and the institutions of the American society, which are basically set up and focused on white, middle-class people with white, middle-class values?  How do we improve the fit?
Story_ID: 60762
Speaker 1: Because the only way minorities are going to make it in American society successfully, is to learn how to not necessarily fit in so that they deny their cultural background--'cause I don't think that's healthy--but to adapt to the institutions while maintaining the integrity of their own culture and ethnicity.  They have to--I think it's very important for your mental health to maintain your identity, to have a positive identity as a black person or Latino person or an Asian person, to be proud of your culture, your history, your background; but at the same time, to be able to learn the skills--the skills to me are the key--and the strategies to survive in mainstream, predominantly white, middle-class America.  And that's been the theme of all of my books and my work, because I don't see this as impossible.  I don't see this as something that is contradictory necessarily, and I think we pose it always as either-or.  We have posed that question as, "Well, you have to be black.  Being black means listening to black music, dancing black dance steps, eating soul food, living in the ghetto."  Well, see I reject that notion of being black.  Being black means you have to identify positively with your history, your culture, and your values.  But it doesn't mean that you can't listen to white--so-called white music.  It doesn't mean you can't live in white--so-called white neighborhoods.  It doesn't mean you can't work in a big corporation.  It doesn't mean you can't go to a predominantly white university.  What it means is that you have to carry yourself in a way that you can maintain that positive identity and also succeed; you have to learn the strategies and the skills, and I think they are identifiable to succeed if we're ever going to raise ourselves not just as individuals, but as a total group.  We have to learn how to succeed in the educational system.  We have to learn how to avoid the criminal justice system.  We have to learn how to survive and get higher education.  We have to learn how to survive in the economic system, both in terms of working for others and building up our own institutions--economic institutions; and our own wealth, which we have not built up very much in this country.  And we have to just learn how to succeed in general in getting the needs of our families met; and that includes health, housing, social welfare, spiritual needs, and, at the same time, maintaining our integrity and identity.
Story_ID: 60763
Speaker 1: Back to your first book, what was the reason behind it?  And what was--and what were the prevailing themes?  You know, 'cause you were talking about 1968.  Right?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, my first book didn't come out until 1988.
Speaker 1: Eighty-eight [1988].  That's right.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I joined the faculty of Berkeley in 1980.
Speaker 1: In 1950.
Speaker 2: Eighty.
Speaker 1: All right, 1980.  Okay.  So, what was the reason behind the book when it first came out?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting.  It came--a lot of these things are serendipitous.  My first book was really--really started as a speech that I gave to an Urban League--Joint Urban League, University of California conference.  They had a conference where--which was co-sponsored.  And I get--and the speech was about the plight--the status of black youth in America, and why we needed to address their problems and, particularly, the vulnerability of the black male.  So I started gathering statistics, and I did, you know, a 45-minute speech, and the audience was very interested.  And one of my senior colleagues said to me, "You know, Jewelle, you ought to write that up as a book, even if it's a small book."  He said, "This is a powerful statement, and you've shown how all these things are linked; poverty, poor education, poor health, then delinquency, then criminality, drug use; etc.; homicide, suicide."  I covered all those issues.  Said, "You've shown how these are linked.  You ought to do a book."  So then I thought about it.  I said, "You know, I have to have a book for when I come up for tenure, and this might be a good thing to do."  So I thought about it and went on sabbatical in 1985.  And to make a long story short, I got a--I sent a proposal to a couple of publishers.  And the publishers--my publisher in Auburn, Massachusetts, was interested--and he was very interested.  He said, "If you publish this--if you write this book, we'll publish this book."  And so then I got--there were some areas that I really didn't have enough experience or knowledge in, so I got several other authors to write chapters in the book.  So the book is really--I'm the editor and author of about half of the book.  The other half of the book is--people submitted chapters on teenage pregnancy, juvenile delinquency, education, and so forth.  So by having these other authors, I was able to get experts on several different topics.  And when we published the book, right away it got recognized and, you know, it did get a lot of attention.  And then I began to get invitations around the country to speak about this and then at conventions and various professional groups.  And then, you know, I was involved with a congressional hearing.  And then states started writing me about how to set up commissions to help with this issue.  So the book really was quite--I think it made an impact, and I hoped that it was a positive impact and people started paying attention to the problems.
Story_ID: 60764
Speaker 1: But now, why was it a seminal?  And I ask that because, what were the current prevailing theme or themes that it was sort of counteracting?  Or was it that people were looking, like, looking over here in one instance you said?  Was it seminal because it connected these things, or was it seminal because it counteracted some other prevailing circumstances?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was seminal in two reasons--for two reasons.  One is that, I really created a framework for people to understand what was happening.  These are not just bad kids and bad people.  These are kids who are caught up in a web of circumstances, where there is racism in every single institution they encounter; where their parents are underpaid, on welfare, and have no opportunities; and where this society does not support their positive development.  And if you look at all of these areas together and you see it as connected, you have--then you cannot see these kids as predators, but you can see them as victims.  And so--and, of course, let me just say that maybe I have a slightly different view today, but at that time, it was a very important way of changing the perception, that these are kids who are vulnerable.  We coined--I didn't coin the term "at risk," but it fit those kids.  They are at risk because they live in high-risk environments.  They are at risk because of the discrimination in this society against them.  They are at risk because of the barriers and their barriers to access to equal opportunities in education and employment.  And so they are at risk for a number of reasons, and we cannot throw away these kids.  And so, first of all, I think it helped to change the perception of them as--from these are bad kids who are predators on society to these are kids who are at risk.  They're vulnerable, they need our help, and they need intervention.  And that's the first thing.  I think the second reason that it became popular is it coincided--it was the right book for the right time.  It coincided with, you know, an upsurge in thinking about liberal policies, about thinking how we can change welfare, thinking about how we can increase coverage for health benefits for low-income people, it coincided with a number of foundations who were interested in reforming the schools.  So when my book came out, it was the right time, and it touched on all of those issues.  It touched on health care, it touched on education, it touched on reforming the juvenile justice system; all of which were coming under acute attention from policymakers, foundations, and so forth.  So I think it just happened, again, to come around--come--and maybe if it had been five years earlier, it would have been ignored; five years later, it would be--somebody else would have had the idea.
Story_ID: 60765
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing, I want to take you back to your childhood and community that you grew in and understand--also, in the context in which you're speaking.  Had the black community that you had experienced as a youth, was that a different type of black community than you were--you know, you were describing or finding--I mean, as it relates to black--you know, black male youth.  But was that community, you know, significantly different than--and was it a mainly urban community?  So, let's just try to put that in context.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, I think what happened is that my community had some of the same features as larger urban communities, but I do not--we had very few people on welfare.  This was when I grew up during the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] in Ansonia, Connecticut.  Everybody worked.  And so, my view, even of people who didn't have high school education, they worked.  They provided for their families.  They did not--they were not--we did not have high-crime rates.  There was some drug use, but it was really minimal.  There was some drug use.  The main problem in my community was the numbers.  There were people who were involved in gambling--illegal gambling with, you know, the numbers.  That was a big issue.  But that was true all over the country of black communities.  That was one way that they gambled.  They didn't go to Las Vegas.  They played the numbers.  So I knew about that, but I also knew that poor people could have dignity.  Low-income people could have dignity.  They worked and they gave their children a decent home to live in and they gave their children a decent education.  And I was also aware that you can live in a predominantly black neighborhood, but you don't have to have the values in some of--that you see in some of these inner city communities where there are high rates of welfare and your single-parent families.  And most of the--if a girl got pregnant, the boy usually married her.  And that was something certainly encouraged by all the black ministers in town.  So you did--you had some of the same underlying problems, but people were dealing with them in a--what I would consider--a more positive, productive way.  But since I grew up, of course, we've had other economic conditions which have caused the increase in teenage pregnancy and because men weren't getting jobs and unemployment and so forth.  So I knew there were other ways for people to live.  I knew that there were other options.  And I felt that what we needed to was not blame the community for the problems, but to blame the institutions of society which were creating the problems.
Story_ID: 60766
Speaker 1: "Children of Color," I'd say just brief, was with my coauthor, who's a Chinese woman, a psychologist named Larke N. Huang.  It's a book where we also were concerned about the mental health problems of minority children all over this country and decided there wasn't one good textbook for people who work with children of color in the schools, in the juvenile justice system, in the mental health system, in the social welfare system; etcetera.  And so we decided that we would develop a book, where, again, we invited six other authors to help us write a book about psychological--how do you--assess the psychological problems of children of color in different ethnic groups, how do you treat them, and how do you bring culture into the whole process of assessment and treatment.  So you have to understand the culture background, the history of the people; particularly immigration history.  Language issues will often affect the treatment and the assessment.  And you have to understand their values about education, their values about family life, their values about love and marriage and sex and all of those things.  And we were able to compile a book which addresses those issues for blacks, American Indians, Asian-Americans, Latinos, and biracial youth and immigrants.  So we were able to do this book where we were trying to educate the human services professionals.  That includes all of them:  the psychologists, psychiatrists, teachers, social workers, probation officers.  And, again, that book is widely used in training programs in colleges, in all the professional schools.  Nearly all the professional schools which train people to work with young people use that book.  So it--we've had another edition, and we're going into a third revised edition as of this year.  We're working on a third edition.  So it's been a very successful book.
Story_ID: 60767
Speaker 1: What was groundbreaking about the book?
Speaker 2: It was the first book ever to be published to deal--to focus solely on minority youth and their mental health issues; and, also, one of the first books to ever use the term "children of color" instead of minority children.  We use it because we think it's a better term, and we think it is less stigmatizing.  So we call--"Children of Color."  And so that in that way it broke some ground.
Speaker 1: Now, with the, you know, the people writing the different articles, were there some surprises that occurred along the way in that process or things that came out of the collaboration that you, you know, surprised you?  Or did you pretty much know people's viewpoints?
Speaker 2: Well, we pretty much chose the authors that we felt had the clinical experience and the academic experience, because we wanted research-based chapters.  And I will say, that I don't think there were too many surprises, because we knew the authors were other psychologists.  They all had good reputations.  But what we did was, in the process of writing the book, we developed a model of assessment and treatment, which has now been adopted by many other books that we see, use a model or a similar one that we use; that we invented, really.  We invented this model.  We developed this model of the various ways to conceptualize a child's environment.  So you would--it was starting with the family, the school, the culture and ethnicity, the religious institutions; and how those relate to the systems in which these children find themselves.  So you have the social welfare system, the juvenile justice system, the mental health system; and we were able to show a--diagrammatically how this works and why it's so important for these systems, each of which has its own culture, to be able to deal with the culture of the children.  And that's what makes the book unique.
Speaker 1: And you say that this is--so your model that you created for the evaluation.  Right?
Speaker 2: Assessment entry (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: For assessment (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: --has been--it has been--taken on and used in a wider community.
Speaker 2: Oh.  It's in--if you read any books since ours, ours was literally the first book.  There have been other books about minority children, which were--dealt with developmental issues; normal development.  Ours deals with mental health issues and behavioral problems.  And so ours was the first one to deal exclusively with these and to be so broad, not just black youth, but youth from the--as I said, the six groups.  So it was the first.  And others--people, when you read their books and look at their models, they have borrowed from our models.  Some of us--some give us credit, some don't.  I will say probably most of them do give us credit--do cite--the book has been widely cited, and I think it's the best-selling book of its type in the fields.  So we are very pleased about that.
Story_ID: 60768
Speaker 1: And, you know what sort of strikes me is that a lot--correct me if I'm wrong--but, a lot of your work or interests in the area was really looking at mainstream society in many ways and how people of different cultures could adapt (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --into mainstream society.
Speaker 2: How they can--rather than looking just at, say, African-American culture or Latino culture, I'm looking at the nexus between these people of color and their cultures and value systems by the way, and the mainstream institutions, and they didn't always match; they didn't always fit.  And I'm looking to see how we can--yes, I do think adaptation is important.  I don't think, as I said earlier, that one has to give up one's culture and identity.  I don't think it's a sellout. I have friends and colleagues who may think that way.  I don't think so.  I think that we have a society which is dominated 80 percent by Caucasian Americans, who have the power in every single institution that you can name.  They have the power.  And they determine who gets in.  They set up gates that you have to, you know--and hurdles that you have to jump over in order to gain access to good education, good housing, good jobs.  And they set the standards.  If we don't understand how to get that good education, get--buy those nice houses, get those good jobs, then we're going to be always marginalized.  We or other minority groups, we're gonna always be marginalized, always on the outside looking in at the candy window.  And my feeling, as a scholar and an educator, is that we need to teach our children, even if we haven't managed to do it in our generation, we need to teach our children the skills and the strategies, not only to survive in the wider world--because for a long time the whites are gonna dominate this world--but we have to teach them how to succeed and how to succeed without always having to fight and always having a chip on their shoulder and always being angry, because that is not good for your mental health, to be angry and fighting all the time.  So we need to teach them strategies and skills.  And one of--that's one of the aims of the book "Children of Color"; and teach their families that you can be a proud person of color; you can be proud of your heritage; you can maintain your heritage, your values, the food you eat, the church you go to or some other faith; and yet, at the same time--it's sort of like being--you develop a--in some ways, you may have a kind of a--everyone becomes bicultural; I guess that's the term I will use.  If you're a minority in this country, you have to become bicultural.  White people don't have to be bicultural, because white people run things.  Let's face it.  So you have to be bicultural.  And we also find, by the way, cognitively, that bicultural people are, in some ways, more cognitively sophisticated, because they learn more strategies and skills, especially if they speak two languages.  A lot of recent research shows that that--if you speak two languages and learn sort of two cultures, that you are cognitively in some ways more sophisticated and more complex because you have those skills.  So it actually has an added effect.  An added benefit.

Speaker 1: So let's to the Rodney King, O.J. Simpson, because that's a different sort of take on things.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: You're looking at, sort of, circumstances, and trying to look at them from, you know, why this whole thing was created in the (unclear).  And so I want to get to race and justice, and how, you know--what happened in the making of (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, that's a--that's a (unclear) a very interesting story, because I went to Los Angeles to study the impact of the Rodney King--the whole incident, which was, of course, his arrest, his beating, and the subsequent trial.  I wanted to see what impact it had for youth--black youths--in South Central Los Angeles, because it fit in with my previous interests in the problem of crime and justice; the problem of getting involved in juvenile justice system.  And Rodney King was clearly a victim of this police beating and, also, clearly a person who had not had a lot of opportunities in his life.  And I wondered what impact these young people had?  What was the impact of those riots and the police brutality on the--in terms of their view of American society, American equality, the justice system?  How did it impact their identity?  How did it impact their ideas about the system, you know, economic systems and other systems?  And how did it impact their aspirations?  How did it impact their feelings about the police?  So I wanted to know that.  And it was just by sheer coincidence that on the day that I finished the final interview with a very prominent minister in Los Angeles [California] and was on my way to the airport, was the day that the police chased O.J. Simpson on the freeway after they had found, you know, his wife and--his wife--previous wife--former wife and the waiter, who had been killed; and then they were trying to arrest him.  But just by sheer coincidence.  But when I talked to my editor a couple of weeks later, I was a little bit late with my, you know, my manuscript.  Obviously, I was going--I was actually several months late, 'cause I was still finishing up my interviews, and he said, "Jewelle, I want you to change your book."  He said, "I don't think anybody is going to be interested in Rodney King, but if you add the story of O.J. Simpson, sometime--somehow add that in the story and maybe contrast them," he says, "I think that'll be a great book."  "Well," I said, "I don't see any connection."  He did, and it turned out he was right in terms of the connection, but maybe wrong in terms of the book 'cause--that's another whole story.  But they--he said, "You know, I want you to just look at what's going on in the news about O.J. and about the trial. I think you'll see a connection."  Then I did see the connection. I looked for about a week, 'cause I really didn't want to change my book.  I really wanted this to be about Rodney King and the criminal justice system in Los Angeles and what had happened to him.  And he was clearly a victim. I didn't think O.J. was a victim, so I wanted to see what this was that my editor was telling me.  But, actually, it goes back to something I said earlier about different pathways.  O.J. was a successful athlete, who had, in fact, become almost what we call "race less."  He had become a celebrity; married a beautiful white woman, who was his second wife; lived in a beautiful section of Los Angeles called Brentwood; hobnobbed and played golf with presidents and diplomats and CEOs all over the world; and he had a--almost a storied life.  He had a very glamorous lifestyle; he had a lifestyle where he had become, what I call, an honorary white man.  And there are a few honorary white men in this country.  If you get enough power, enough money, and enough celebrity status, you can become an honorary white man. So he, in some ways, wasn't even a part of the black community at that time. He was not identified as just an average black person. He had special kind of life.  And yet at this point in his life, he was getting involved in the criminal justice system and was certainly beginning to be redefined by the media and demonized by the media, even before his trial. And he was, all of a sudden, being treated just like any other black man; and, in fact, being treated--he was being beat up by the media like Rodney King was beat up by the cops.  And then I saw the connection.
Story_ID: 60770
Speaker 1: And at that time, it was hard to know what was going to happen at the trial.  It was hard to know whether he was innocent or guilty.  It was hard to know any of those things.  But my editor sort of, at that point, in a way coerced me into bringing that story into the book and contrasting.  So I then had to spend the next whole year looking at the trial daily.  No matter where I was, I would have to have the summary at night, clipping articles out of the paper every day.  And it's a hard way to write a book, 'cause you're doing only contemporary research.  There's nothing behind the research in the libraries except there had been some books about his life, biographies.  So I had to do really current research every single day for a year, look at TV every single day; discuss it, of course, everybody had an opinion.  I'd gathered opinions.  And then I decided it would be fun to do some interviews.  And I did some interviews. Because I'd done interviews earlier on Rodney King, I did some interviews up here and by phone in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] about O.J. Simpson asking people some of the same questions I had asked them about Rodney King, but always relating it--always coming back to the criminal justice system and the black male in the criminal justice system, which was my focus of the book. In any case, when I finished the book, what I did, again, was to try to create a framework, to look at these two men in the criminal justice system; one who had been beaten by the cops, had no, you know, really, status in society to speak of; and the other one who had been a celebrity and been wealthy, and how he was treated in the courts.  And that was the focus of the book--and trying to create some general interpretations that would help people to view these cases as not that dissimilar and to view what happens to black men whether they are innocent or guilty in the criminal justice system.  And that was the point of the book.
Story_ID: 60771
Speaker 1: Okay.  I want to ask one other question with that particular book.  You said that there were--some things backfired--not backfired, but it didn't have that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I think what happened was, my first book was what I call my--a pure research-oriented book about a well-known case about police brutality.  This other story, you know, it was hard to cast O.J. as a victim.  The jury found him innocent, but there were some major lingering questions about the case and about his involvement and it caused tremendous division between blacks and whites, as you will remember, in America over whether he was innocent or guilty.  And I think it was a lot of racism on both sides, maybe, that came out about this case.  And the problem with putting it in the book is-- the book then was published at the time when all the other O.J. books were coming out. And it was defined as an O.J.--another O.J. book, which it really wasn't. It is not primarily about O.J. Simpson.  About half of the book discusses his trial and the issues involved in the trial.  But, the point is, the book was focusing on the criminal justice system and it was just contrasting these two men.  But, since the book came out at the time when there were dozens of people trying to, I say, cash in on O.J. Simpson, that was not what I had started to do.  I wasn't trying to cash in on O.J. Simpson.  Then it got confused with all the books which were mainly negative--mainly the book saying, "You know, of course, he was guilty. Let's look at it."  And then there was another genre of books--the people who were on his defense team trying to justify why they defended him and that he wasn't guilty. And my book kinda got lost.  And unlike my two previous books, which were for academic books; they were relatively--they are considered relatively successful books, 'cause academic books are not judged on the same--they're not like a steamy novel which will sell a hundred million copies.  So we--our books are judged on a different standard.  And those--my first two books were really considered relatively successful commercially, in terms of how many books were sold.  But this book did not do well, and I--although it got some pretty good reviews, it did not do well commercially, because it was, I think, competing with too many other O.J. junkie books, okay.
Story_ID: 60772
Speaker 1: What--With Preserving Privilege, was the theory behind that and what was the motivation behind that?
Speaker 2: Well, Preserving Privilege came about in a way because I was getting increasingly concerned about the number of political initiatives that were targeted to minorities and immigrants in California.  And I could see the handwriting on the wall, which is that Governor [Pete] Wilson and the Republican Party started in the mid-nineties [1990s], sort of using political propositions to scapegoat blacks and Latinos and other immigrants so--for his political gains.  And it was clear that they were scapegoating them with--you know, first of all, they have an initiative, which was an anti-crime initiative: three strikes and you're out.  But the wording of that initiative was so clearly aimed at, you know, minority youths, that it didn't, of course, use the word "race," and it was very harsh.  You know, if you commit a minor felony, it counts as a first strike, and then another minor felony is a second strike; if you steal a pizza, that's a minor felony.  And then a third strike puts you in jail for 25 years, you know, or a minimum of 25 years.  And so it was clear that many of the minor felonies in the state are committed by minority youths who don't have jobs.  And so, therefore, they would be the ones who would be impacted.  And then, at the same time, there was a proposition that was 187, which was an anti-immigrant--they said it was aimed at illegal immigrants.  The problem, is you can't always tell who's legal and illegal, and the immigrants are the backbone of the California economy.  There's just no question.  And many of them are illegal.  They're the ones who work in hotels, restaurants, construction, domestic work, service work; and without them, the economy in California would absolutely collapse.  And so, it was very hypocritical to have this whole initiative aimed at illegal immigrants, knowing that the economy can't get along without them.  And then a couple of years later, they passed the Affirmative Action--anti-Affirmative Action, which was Proposition 209, which had a very negative impact on college admissions of minority students, and also impacted on employment opportunities for minorities.  And about that time, I thought, you know, we need to see what's behind these initiatives; we need to begin to really do some research on who's supporting these initiatives; what is the purpose of these initiatives.
Story_ID: 60773
Speaker 1: So I got a very good graduate student, a young woman names Teiahsha Bankhead, who was working with me, and she was interested in community activism and politics and African-American issues of empowerment.  So she was a good person.  She had worked with me on the book about Rodney King.  And so I asked her would she like to work with me on this.  So we did interviews, we did a lot of research in the Secretary of State's office in Sacramento, finding out who actually funded these initiatives, and guess what?  We found the initiatives were heavily funded by groups outside the state of California, who were conservative groups; groups which were related to the most conservative think tanks in America; millionaires who were conservative donors to the Republican Party. So it was clear that there was some kind of agenda here, and it wasn't just coming from California.  We also found that in the polls, most Californians said they were against these things, but then they would go and vote for them.  And so it was partly the way they were framed.  In any case, it was clear that the initial impact of all of these propositions--the first three--were impacting very negatively on blacks and Latinos and, to some extent, Asians.  And while we were in the process of doing the research, along comes Proposition 227, which is the anti-bilingual education proposition, which, of course, impacts very heavily on Latino children who form about 40 percent of our school system in California.  And they were basically dismantling affirm--I mean, bilingual education and eviscerating the programs--trying to create a system where the kids had one year of bilingual education--Immersion they called it--and then afterwards, it was sink or swim.  And we knew many of the kids would sink after only one year of Spanish instruction--mainly Spanish.  So we put it all together, and I think we were able to document, in the book, number one, who funded these propositions; number two, that they were marketed in such a way, the publicity about the populations--about the propositions--they were marketed in such a way that they scapegoated minorities--the blacks, Latinos, and Asians; particularly, the immigrants; and that they were marketed in such a way to raise a lot of fear among the white population as to, these people were taking over the state.  And so when you put them all together, you saw this pattern.  And that is what the book is about.  And then the book proposes alternative policies that are humane, that are bicultural, that are meant to empower minority groups; not to take away their rights.  And so we have--in our final chapter we have a number of recommendations that are based on public policy experts who have recommended other kinds of policies for immigration, for bilingual education, for Affirmative Action, and for, you know, the criminal law on behavior.  So our book really does try to draw from a number of experts.
Story_ID: 60774
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask all three questions I have in one question.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: One, I want to know what your hopes and concerns for the black community are.  I want to know what you think, really, you know, it's going to take to make a truly multicultural society.  And I want to know what your legacy--what you want your legacy to be.  So I'm saying that because, otherwise, I won't get it in.  Okay (laughs).  So I'm just getting--okay.
Speaker 2: First (simultaneous) ----
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --what are my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Hopes and concerns.
Speaker 2: --concerns for the black community.
Speaker 1: The black youth.
Speaker 2: The black youth.  Well, concerns, first, is that I really feel we need to address the educational inequities which black youth are faced with from early, you know, childhood.  We need to build better schools; attract better teachers; create a curriculum that is going to really be relevant in the sense of understanding their learning styles, their cultural values; and schools which include their parental participation, because it is--there's a lot of research that shows that when parents participate and are committed to their children's education, the children do better.  So we have to improve the schools first, because a good educational foundation is really the basis for a productive life; a healthy productive life, a career, and with--and to civic participation.  And without a good basic education, you are already starting a person off at a disadvantage.  My concern is for the families of these youths, who are--often have high unemployment rates, do not have health insurance, live in deteriorating houses in crowded neighborhoods; so that the total environment for health care and housing I'm concerned about; that we need to develop more low-income housing; we need to develop housing outside the ghetto so people have an integrated experience; and we need to make sure that every child is insured with universal health insurance, so they have health and dental and mental health problems covered. And a lot of our children do not have those kinds of early-life experiences and benefits that middle-class children do have.  I'm concerned about reforming, first of all, police practices, so that they don't target minority youths and particularly don't target black youth and criminalize them at an early age; and funnel black youths into the juvenile justice system for exactly the same kind of crimes and offenses--often minor crimes, minor offenses--that white kids get involved in.  Black kids tend to have--be arrested at higher rates, be remanded to the court at higher rates, be often transferred to adult courts at higher rates, and be given longer sentences and stay in secure facilities--locked facilities--longer.  And that's very good research, and it proves that we need to really reform police training practices, education police about how to treat young black youths equally and with dignity, and we need to change our whole court system.  Our whole juvenile court system is biased and weighted against the black youth and other minority youth.  There's just really no question in my mind that that is true.  And, finally, I would like to look, you know, at the other institutions of American Society, where there is so much bias against black youths, especially in employment.  The military may be the best option for some of our youth, and at least, if they go to the military and if they do well, they are often able to climb up and be promoted and then sometimes get an education through the G.I. Bill and benefits.  But the employment system in this country, even for well-educated blacks, still discriminates, still gives preference to whites with the same or even less ability.  So we need to educate employers, we need to have strong laws to enforce anti-discrimination laws.  And in those four areas, if we can improve those four areas, then my hopes would be that we would bring black youth into the mainstream.  We would give them the opportunities, we would tear down the barriers to access; and then I think that they need to compete on their own terms. I think they do need to compete on their own terms once they're given equal opportunity and equal access.  Those--that's--so my hope is that, sometime before the end of this century, we will forget the color of a person's skin or the texture of their hair, and we will see them as fully functioning human beings who are--either have the qualifications for college or a job or they don't.
Story_ID: 60775
Speaker 1: And your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope that through my research and publications and my speeches and my advocacy for black youth, I hope that I will be one of many voices in--at the beginning of this century to call attention to their plight and to the plight of their families and their communities so that we will spawn another generation of scholars and activists and politicians, who will be more--first of all, knowledgeable about the problems and more able to do something about the problems; that we will gain more political power, because right now we are not going into--to the polls in the numbers we should be; that we will gain more political power; that we will develop more economic power and more wealth in our communities so that we can address these issues internally as well as externally; and that we will become better able to develop strategies to help black families and other minority families--low-income families--to help black youths; and to rebuild the strong institutions in our communities, which have also fallen into neglect.  But the black churches, for example, an institution which I grew up in, and I think is--was a very strong institution; and I think we need to rebuild it in terms having it play a more important part in the life of the black community in empowering people, educating people, letting people use their facilities for young--for youths' development and activities.  So I hope my legacy is that I am one voice among other voices trying to alert people about the need to education our youth and make them productive citizens, and other minority youth, because the number of minorities all together is going to be about half of our country in the year 2050 mid-century.  And without minority youths being educated and employable, without teaching them good skills, including computer skills--because there's still this tremendous disparity in terms of access to computer skills and to the networks, the World Wide Web and so forth--unless we do that, we're going to have some severe economic problems in this country just in terms of keeping Social Security alive, because the aging population is growing and the youth population now, in 20 years, will have to support the aging population with social security.  So it's very imperative that we educate them and that we train them to be productive citizens.  And so I hope my legacy is that I am one of the persons who keeps people informed and aware of the need to train and educate our youth and to empower black people to improve their economic situation and involve them politically so that we, as a community, can help ourselves, because I guess in the end, I think we are accountable, and we must help ourselves.  We cannot completely depend on the government and other groups to help us to build our community up.  So I think we need to be more accountable in the end.
Story_ID: 60776
Speaker 1: Family legacy.  Your--when you look back at your rich family history, what would you consider its legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the legacy of my family is, you know, because we did not know my--most of my mother's family until recent years.  I think the legacy of my father's family, I would say the legacy is three things:  I think they taught us as children, each generation, from my great-grandfather--great-great-grandfather, to my grandfather, to my father, to this generation, and what we have taught our children; I think the legacy is that, you have to be a person who is proud of yourself, has self-esteem, and you have to set high goals for yourself.  And that's basically--the first legacy is an internal legacy of recognizing your worth as a human being, and that you must always have dignity and must try to realize high goals for yourself--set high goals and realize them. I think the second thing is the importance of education and training so that you can not only prepare yourself for greater opportunities in each generation, but also that you can pass on these skills to your sons and daughters, and that you can help lift up your community; and which would be, third legacy is, my parents and grandparents always taught us to give back whatever you learned, whatever skills you developed, whatever assets that you gained, whether they are economic or cultural or social, that you should--you have an obligation to pass them on to the next generation, which I think we have done with our sons.  My oldest son is a lawyer, who works for a major corporation in Los Angeles and travels all over the world for them; and my younger son is an investment banker and lives in Oakland, California; works in San Francisco for one of the largest investment banks.  And I think that we educated them. They have good jobs.  They're good role models for young black men. But at the same time they both, in their own ways, give back to the community through various community activities, such as tutoring and youth development programs, and other charitable causes.  So they're both giving back, and I think they're carrying on the tradition that really has come down from several generations of my father's family.  And my mother's family, the ones that we're in touch with, have also--also value education and community service, and have also done a great deal; been associated with Howard University in Washington, D.C., and have done a great deal to educate black youths through Howard University.

Speaker 1: Well, one of my hobbies is traveling.  I love to travel to exotic places all over the world with my husband.  And here we are in India in November of 1993.  I was celebrating my 60th birthday and was getting a little depressed about it, and my husband said, "Well, I'm going to give you a special trip."  So we went to India, and there we are, and in the background is the Taj Mahal in Agra, India; one of the most beautiful buildings I've ever seen in my life.  And it was the very day of my birthday, so it was a wonderful way to celebrate my birthday and to ease the pain of turning 60 (laughs.)
Speaker 2: Right.  And could you--since this is the first time we've seen him on camera, could you spell your husband's name for us.
Speaker 1: It's James.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: James Lowell Gibbs, Jr.
Speaker 2: All right.  So this is the (unclear) if I don't goof it up.  Everything is here?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But, James--James is easy to spell.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And James Lowell Gibbs, Jr.  And I have a baby picture.  I was going to start with my baby picture.  I don't know if you saw it.
Speaker 2: I probably got them all out of order.  But that's okay, 'cause we will reorder them.  This is all just the raw material.  We extract one frame of this and create a still photo and crop it and retouch it, if we need to, and so on.  So go ahead with this.
Speaker 1: This is my engagement picture.  And I was, at that point, 22 years old; a year out of college, living and working in Washington, D.C., at the Labor Department; and I was about to be married in August of 1956.  And so this is my engagement picture.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is a picture that was taken when I was in my early years of teaching.  That's my office at Haviland Hall on the campus of University of California in Berkeley.  And in the background are some my--the awards that I'd been given for my work in my activities on behalf of black youths and families.
Speaker 1: Could you spell Haviland, please.
Speaker 2: Haviland is H-A-V-I-L-A-N-D.  Haviland Hall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you mention the time for this?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I'm going to have to think--late in my career.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This actually was in November of 1996.  It was only four years (simultaneous) (unclear)-- (pause)
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Please.
Speaker 2: This picture was taken for publicity reasons after I wrote my first book, which was the "Young Black and Male:  An Endangered Species."  And this picture was taken in 1988.  And you can see I was sitting in my office with my books behind me.
Speaker 1: That year.  I have to check the year we got those awards.  You know, you forget.
Speaker 2: You can keep talking just from where you are, please.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.  That picture was taken when my husband and I were both given awards by the--for community service by the Northern California Chapter of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Legal Defense Fund in San Francisco [California].  And there was a banquet where we were given these awards, and that was in November of 1993.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: November 1993.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Go ahead anytime.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Here is my baby picture, the earliest picture I have of myself as a baby.  And I was about six months old in that picture, taken in Stratford, Connecticut, where I was born and where we first lived and where my father had his first church--Stratford, Connecticut.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Then we'll go to the photo on the left, and if you could, in the group shot like this, our convention is to go from left to right.  So from your right.
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't all the other people.  I only know my mother and my godparents.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The other people's names, I don't know.
Speaker 2: As long as you (simultaneous) (unclear) and say, unidentified or unknown.  Just keep going through.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is a picture of--my godmother is holding me, and so I was about six months old.  And it's a chilly spring day.  And my mother is third from the left in the photo, and my godfather is on the far right of the photo.  This is--the other people, I don't know their names, but they were friends of my parents', and there was a very small group of black, middle-class people living in Stratford, Connecticut, at that time.  And these were some of my parents' friends and neighbors who they socialized with at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay  Go ahead, please.
Speaker 1: Now this picture is a picture of myself and my husband.  We had--I had just been given an endowed chair at the University of California at Berkeley.  He, also, had--held an endowed chair at Stanford University.  And so we became the first African-American couple in the United States to both hold endowed shares at major universities within the same geographical area.  And so mine was at Berkeley, a public university; his was at Stanford, a private university.  And he was the Martin Luther King Distinguished Chair Holder at Stanford.  And I was named the Zellerbach Family Fund, Professor of Social Policy Community Change and Practice, at the School of Social Welfare at the University of California at Berkeley.
Speaker 2: Can you spell Zellerbach for us.
Speaker 1: Zellerbach is, Z-E-L-L-E-R-B-A-C-H.  And this was in the spring of 1993; I was appointed to the chair in January of 1993.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Moving on to this photo, please.
Speaker 1: This is a photo when I received an award from the Black Leadership Forum, which is an umbrella organization of all the major Civil Rights activities in America--in the United States.  And that award was presented at their annual awards banquet at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, on April 11th of the year 2001.  And from left to right you have Elaine Jones, the president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Legal Defense Fund; next to her is Mayor [David] Dinkins, the former and first black mayor of New York City; on my right facing the camera is Reverend Joseph Lowery, who was one of the major movers of the Civil Rights movement and the President of the Southern Leadership Conference--Christian Conference Committee, who is now the chair of the Black Leadership Forum; and on the right is Yvonne--you now, I'm trying to think of Yvonne's last name.
Speaker 2: That's all right (unclear).
Speaker 1: And I know her (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Did you say it earlier?
Speaker 1: Can I get back to that?  Can you stop, and I'll ask my husband.  For some reason (unclear)--(pause)
Speaker 2: Okay.  Go ahead and say it now.
Speaker 1: So, Yvonne Leftwich Scruggs.  She has a--
Speaker 2: Leftwich Scruggs.
Speaker 1: Leftwich Scruggs.
Speaker 2: Leftwich is spelled, L-E-F-T-W (simultaneous)(unclear)-
Speaker 1: -W-I-C-H.  Okay?  Now, that's it.
Speaker 2: Is it hyphened?  (unclear)
Speaker 1: I don't know why.  I just couldn't think about.

Speaker 1: Now, this is one of my favorite family photos with my younger son Lowell, who graduated from Cornell University in 1985.  I'm on the left; Lowell is standing next to me, the graduate; my mother, Margaret Taylor, is standing next to Lowell; and then on the far right is my husband, James Lowell Gibbs, Jr.  He was, at that time, a trustee at Cornell University, and he's also an alumnus of Cornell.

He worked in--he had worked in the Clinton Campaign and had been the lawyer for the Senator Carol Moseley Braun.  He was her first lawyer when she became the Senator from Illinois--the first black woman Senator--and got inspired to run and left her office to run and didn't make it, so he came back to California to practice law.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: You think he'll seek public office in the future (simultaneous) (unclear)--

Speaker 1: This is a picture when my husband and I were chosen as Laureates for the San Francisco library.  The new library had been built, and there was a big fund-raiser, and they then decided every year they would have--they would honor local Bay Area authors.  And in this picture you see us wearing African robes that we had made in Mali on one of our trips to Africa--traditional African robes.  And the other couple on the left side of the picture, you have Doctor and Mrs. Arthur Coleman, who were on a fund-raising--who co-chaired a fund-raising committee to establish an endowment for an African-American reading room at the library, and we are there to dedicate our books.  Each of us dedicated a book to the collection, to help to start the collection of African-American authors, to donate to that collection for that room.  And we were, subsequently, honored as Laureates by the San Francisco Public Library.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I hope you only have a couple more--(unclear).  This is my book on "Children of Color," and the subtitle as you see is "Psychological Interventions with Minority Youth."  My co-author was Larke Nahme Huang, an Asian-American woman, and we had several other minority psychologists who contributed chapters about various ethnic groups.  We had chapters--we covered the chapters for American Indian youths, Chinese-American, Japanese-American; Puerto Ricans, Mexican-Americans; of course, African-Americans; and we also had a chapter on two emerging groups in this society: biracial children and Asian--Southeast Asian immigrants and refugees.  And the book really is intended for people work with minority youths in the schools, in mental health settings, in the foster care and child welfare system, and also in the juvenile justice system to help social workers, psychologists, counselors and probation officers to understand the cultures and the family values and the family practices of these children, to help them.

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so let's just go, and then we can--
Speaker 2: This is my first book, "Young, Black, and Male in America: An Endangered Species."  I also designed the cover for the book to show how black youth are somehow penned by ghetto walls, and they can't get out easily.  And this book, I was the editor and also author of half of the chapters in the book.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next please.  Go ahead when you're ready.
Speaker 2: This book was my third book.  It's called "Race and Justice: Rodney King and O.J. Simpson in a House Divided," and it deals with the famous trials of the officers who assaulted Rodney King and of the trial of O.J. Simpson, accused of murdering his wife and a friend of hers in Los Angeles.

Speaker 2: These three, yeah.  Now, this is my fourth book, "Preserving Privilege," which was written one of my doctoral students, Teiahsha Bankhead; and it's called the "Preserving Privilege."  The subtitle is "California Politics, Propositions and People of Color."
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next.  (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is a photograph taken at my retirement party at Berkeley, which was in--the party took place in February of 2000.

And I was presented that night with the Berkeley Citation, which is the highest award given to a faculty member for academic achievement and service to the universities.  So it was quite an honor.  And the department gave me a dinner to honor my retirement.
Speaker 1: All right.  Next please.
Speaker 2: Wait a minute.  Have we done the larger one?  I hung it up.
Speaker 1: The real big one, no.

Speaker 1: Can you center it so that it's not running down.  Okay.  Go ahead anytime.
Speaker 2: Let me see that picture again.  I think that's the wrong date.  That's not the same white graduated in, and I just want to correct that, 'cause actually, I can tell how old I was from Patty.  Patty was about--maybe she was two.  She was born in 1942.  That's 1944.  And so, then I was--what did I say?  I was (simultaneous)--
