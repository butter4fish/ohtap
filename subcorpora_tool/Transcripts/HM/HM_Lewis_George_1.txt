Speaker 1: Hello, my name is Adrienne Jones and I am the interviewer.  Neculai Burghelea is the videographer and there are no observers.  Today is September 7, 2007 and we are interviewing George Ralph Lewis [HistoryMaker George Lewis].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Will you state your name again.

Speaker 2: Yeah, George Ralph Lewis, G-E-O-R-G-E, Lewis, L-E-W-I-S.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us your date of birth and the location of your birth?
Speaker 2: March 7, 1941, born in Burgess, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Will you tell us the location of this interview?
Speaker 2: Stamford, Connecticut, approximately forty-five miles north of New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Are we are at your home?
Speaker 2: Yes we are.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well I am retired.  I have been retired for six and a half years.  Prior to retirement I was a senior executive of a major corporation, Philip Morris Companies, Inc. [Philip Morris Inc.], now known as Altria [Altria Group, Inc.].
Story_ID: 533906
Speaker 1: So, to start out I'm gonna ask you five People magazine-ish type questions.  I'll ask the question and you just respond with whatever comes to mind.  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, greens, I, I think I could eat greens seven days a week.  I had a lot of greens when I was growing up.  My wife [Lillian Glenn Lewis] cooks them occasionally.  I never get tired of them, and any type of seafood, and you'll understand why as we get further in the interview.  I can tell you I was born on Chesapeake Bay and I had seafood on a regular basis, oysters, crabs, fish, so I am a big seafood eater and I try to stay away from the sweets.
Speaker 1: What's your favor color?
Speaker 2: Probably, probably blue, if you look in my wardrobe you'll find that I have quite a few blue suits.  They all appear to look the same, quite a few blue shirts, blue ties, golfing outfits usually matched in blue, so I, I would say blue is probably the color I would go with most of the time.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I would say with the family we, we just, my wife and I just love to do cruises.  We've done the Mediterranean cruise, both ways, several times so I would say probably Europe.  We enjoyed Rome [Italy] quite a bit; with regards to a vacation with the boys for golf I would say Casa de Campo in the Dominican Republic.  With the boys we've been going to this location for almost thirty years, always the first week in March to play golf, a group of us.  So that would clearly be my favorite golfing location and I would say my favorite with the family with the wife is probably Rome.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite phrase or saying?  Do you have one?
Speaker 2: Probably stay focused, I use that a lot.  I use it quite a bit with my grandson [Jackson Lee], when we're out and we're doing something in sports; whether we're talking whatever, I say just stay focused.  I use it quite a bit with my wife, which she doesn't particularly enjoy but stay focused.  So I, I would say I use the phrase stay focused quite a bit, and I try to stay focused quite a bit.
Story_ID: 533907
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your family now, and let's start with your mother.  Can you tell me your mother's name and spell it?  Can you tell me where she was born and where she grew up?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Edith Toulson Lewis.  Toulson is spelled T-O-U-L-S-O-N.  She was born and raised in Burgess, Virginia in Northumberland County which is a very small town located approximately seventy-five to eighty miles north east of Richmond [Virginia], right on the Chesapeake Bay, a very, very, rural, rural area, but beautiful.
Speaker 1: Did your mother ever tell you any stories about when she was growing about what Burgess was like when she was a child and about her own upbringing?
Speaker 2: We talked a lot about Burgess in terms of the people.  I think one of the things she used to really enjoy about Burgess it was a small town, everybody knew everyone, so naturally there were always a lot of tales about different families and, and different folks in the community, but primarily about Burgess and how it developed and how it got its roots and you know just a little bit of history about the town itself.
Story_ID: 533908
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about the history of Burgess [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well, Burgess is about a mile and a half from Reedville, R-E-E-D-V-I-L-L-E, Virginia which very, very few people have heard about, very few people have heard about Reedville, Burgess because it's out in the middle of nowhere and it's in, as I said it's on the Chesapeake Bay. Reedville is known for fishing, commercial fishing since it is on the Chesapeake Bay and during the early, I would say the, the late 1800s, 1900s well, even in from 19--when I was born, probably up until 1987 commercial fishing was the primary industry there, and during the earlier years in the 1900s it was known as one of the towns that had more millionaires in it because they made a lot of money off of fishing.
Speaker 1: What specific fish?
Speaker 2: It was called a Menhaden fish, Menhaden, M-E-N-H-A-V-E-N [sic.].  I believe that's the spelling on it, and it's a commercial fish that is used for, still today, used for fertilizer.  It's used in pesticides, a number--it has a number of uses.  It's not as strong as it used to be but in the older days it kept the community going and that was essentially the industry in that area.
Story_ID: 533909
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Edith Toulson Lewis] tell you any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: You know it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Maybe--
Speaker 2: --it's interesting, I--she would talk about her, of course I knew her mother [Bessie Jackson Toulson], my grandmother quite well, and I knew my mother's grandmother which is my great-grandmother, but beyond that she really didn't talk a lot about it because I'm not sure they knew a lot about it, or either they didn't talk about it so, not a lot of conversation about it.
Speaker 1: About childhood?
Speaker 2: About childhood, about her childhood other than the fact about her school.  You know she, she went to--she finished high school and then she became a homemaker and she stressed education, spent a lot of time with me, brought me a lot of books.  I read a lot of books, always had magazines around, always had lots of comic books around because in those days we didn't have, in early years we didn't have TV in that part of the country.  Very little radio, a little bit, but, but she made sure that we had books and that we were kept current.  So she was very focused on education and always made sure that I, that I did my homework and that I got things done in the right manner.
Speaker 1: Perhaps that you stayed focused?
Speaker 2: Stayed focused and the other thing I would say that she was, she was very involved in the church and as a result of that I was very involved in the church [Shiloh Baptist Church, Reedville, Virginia].  I--she made sure I was in Sunday school, BTU [Baptist Training Union], all the youth activities, vacation bible school, anything dealing--I had to go to church every single Sunday morning and if there was a youth program, she made sure that I participated in it.  So very, very much community oriented, very much involved in the church, very much involved in civic activities; she belonged to a number of clubs throughout the community.  The, the missionary club, she was involved in the sewing club so she was very, very active in the community and made sure that I was also active in the community.
Story_ID: 533910
Speaker 1: What was your [maternal] grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Bessie, Bessie Toulson [Bessie Jackson Toulson], she was a homemaker and my grandfather [Charles T. Toulson] was a farmer and of course she, what I remember about my Grandmother Bessie was during the summer she did a lot of what we call canning of vegetables, fruits, getting ready for the winter.  You would go down, I would go and visit my grandmother and she would be canning tomatoes, canning peaches, greens, just about anything you could put in a jar, and that would be how they would live during the winter.  During the summer they lived off the land.  They would live off of the garden and off of the fish and the crabs and the oysters in the area, so she was, she was always doing something. Always asking how school was and that we have to improve, we have to get better, just a sweet, sweet lady.
Speaker 1: What about your great-grandmother?  Do you remember--?
Speaker 2: I remember very little of my great-grandmother on my mother's side, she died at a pretty early age so I didn't, I didn't know too much about her.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother [Edith Toulson Lewis] just as a person?
Speaker 2: Very strong individual, focused, and by focused I mean she, she was determined that I would get an education, very family-oriented.  Always involved with doing something for the family, very giving and very supportive, and just a person that would instill a lot of confidence in you, even if you were wrong (laughter), so you know kept saying you can do it, you just got to hang in there, just do it, so just a strong, sweet, strong black woman.
Story_ID: 533911
Speaker 1: If you will now, please tell me about your father.  If you could start off telling me what his name was and where he was from?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father was Spencer Lewis [Spencer H. Lewis], S-P-E-N-C-E-R, and he, he lived, both my mother [Edith Toulson Lewis] and my father, my father lived--he passed away when he was ninety, ninety-two and my mom passed away at ninety-one, so there's longevity in the family.  My father started working when he was about seven years old.  His father [Theodore H. Lewis] passed away at a very young age. There was a large family of about, I think there were nine in the family and he was among the oldest and he, he started working to, to help support the family and was a workaholic.
Speaker 1: What kind of work did he do?
Speaker 2: Well, when he first started out as a kid, he, he worked on the docks in the fishing industry, bringing funds home to the family and then as he got older he went on the boats and he was a cook on the commercial fish boat and he did that for almost, during his almost entire life except for the last twenty years of his life where he started a business in renovating and painting houses and that kind of business, but very successful at what he did.  On a fishing boat you would have, in those days about thirty, thirty men on a boat and they went out every day in the Chesapeake Bay or either the Delaware Bay or wherever they were and he would do all the cooking for these guys.  That was during the summer and then during the winter he had an oyster boat and he would go out in the Bay and he would catch oysters.  So my father was the, was the hardest working person that I have ever known and he worked up until he was seventy-five years old.
Story_ID: 533912
Speaker 1: And although he [Lewis' father, Spencer H. Lewis], I don't think he certainly didn't make a lot of money in his time, but he was able to save it and he was able to make investments and the investments that he made generated substantial returns, better returns than I've ever gotten, and what, you know he would, he would always save and he would roll his savings, the little bit of savings he had, he would buy land, real estate.  Even if it was just a thousand dollars he would try to find a piece of property that he could invest a thousand dollars and he'd sit on it, and when he, when he passed away he had accumulated hundreds and hundreds of acres of valuable land.  I mean it's just remarkable what he was able to achieve with what he had to work with and was probably I would say accumulated more wealth than probably any other black person in Northumberland County [Virginia] by the time he passed away.
Speaker 2: Was much of the land he purchased in that area?
Speaker 1: It was all in that area, he had a knack for finding land that no one else wanted and being able to visualize how you could you use this land in the future, quite a bit of it was on the water.  Some of it was, a lot of it was timber, timberland that people just--were, decided that they were gonna walk away from and he would, he would buy it and wait for the timber to grow and it'd become, became quite valuable.  So he just had an eye for, for valuable property that could generate a return in the future so I, I was amazed at, at the values he had accumulated as I got, as I got older and very, very successful.
Speaker 2: You said that Burgess County [sic. Burgess, Virginia] produced a number of millionaires, would you put your father in that category?
Speaker 1: I, I would put him--produced a lot of white millionaires.  I don't think they produced, very, very few black millionaires, but I would say my father was in that, was in that area.
Story_ID: 533913
Speaker 1: Did you know your father's [Spencer H. Lewis] parents?
Speaker 2: I knew my, my grandmother.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Mary Cockrell [Mary Cockrell Lewis], and my great, my grandfather [Theodore H. Lewis] as I said passed away at a very early age.  My grandfather on my father's side of course was, was he was born into slavery and my--he was born in 1861 and my great-great-grandfather [sic. great-grandfather], his father was born in 1846 so he was, he was, he was a slave so both my grandfather and my grandmothers, both my great-great-parents [sic. great-great-grandparents] were slaves.
Speaker 1: And were they slaves in the Virginia area?
Speaker 2: In the Virginia area, they, they--on both sides of my family they had been as, as far as I can determine both families had been there since the late 1700s, but you know it's hard to track how they got there but they had been there since the 1700s.
Speaker 1: On your, we're talking about your father's side now, but on either side do you have a sense of the transition of those, of your great-grandfather on your father's side, your grandfather and then your great-father [sic. great-grandfather] on your mother's [Edith Toulson Lewis] side, do you have a sense of the transition that these people made?  Well obviously your great-grandfather did not perhaps become free, but what about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather on my, on my father's side, I know, I know that he, he started selling fish you know, and became pretty successful, he died at, he was about thirty-five or forty when he died but he was doing very well at it.  My grandfather [Charles T. Toulson] on my mother's side was able to acquire land so he became a farmer so he was farming and my grandfather on my father's side was, was selling fish and other kinds of seafood.
Speaker 1: And do you know if either of them were doing that while they were still slaves or perhaps they purchased themselves out of--?
Speaker 2: Well my grandfather on my mother's side was, was not a slave he was born later on.  My grandfather on my father's side was born into slavery in 1861 so that by the time he got a little bit older they were, they were free and he was able to make a living (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had a nice business.
Speaker 2: As a salesmen.
Speaker 1: And just for the record, do you know, can you tell me your father's father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's father's [sic. Lewis' great-grandfather] name was William, William [William Lewis] and my father's father's mother was Sally [Sally Lewis].
Speaker 1: And you spoke about the last name of one of your grandparents was Cochran or--?
Speaker 2: Cockrell.
Speaker 1: Would you mind spelling that?
Speaker 2: C-O-C-K-R-E-L-L.
Story_ID: 533914
Speaker 1: So if you had to describe your father [Spencer H. Lewis] to someone, what, how would you describe him?
Speaker 2: A brilliant person who had just a great feel for how to make money and how to make investments and I would say a person who, who did not have a lot of formal education, but clearly knew the value of it and made sure that his son went to college and I had no other choice and even when he was growing up, when, when he was a child he had two brothers who wanted to go to college and he worked to make sure in those days that they went off to school and helped them get through college so education was at the top of his list and he just stressed it all the time, very involved in the community, very involved in the church [Shiloh Baptist Church, Reedville, Virginia], helped to build the church.  We had a new church, he helped build the church, very involved in all civic activities, well-known in the community, but very low key as far as what he had and what he was doing, nothing extravagant so you never would know what he had, just a humble person.
Speaker 1: Do you know which colleges your uncles went to?  Did they (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One went to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], this was back in the 1940s, and that was really something in those days 'cause he was the first one to go from my family on either side, and he finished Virginia Union in, with a degree in biology and my father wanted him to go to med school, very disappointed he didn't go to med school, but he just didn't see doing it.
Speaker 1: What did he do?
Speaker 2: He became a lab technician (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Research scientist?
Speaker 2: In Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and moved away from the community, and my other uncle went to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], and later became an insurance, an insurance manager and then I was the next one to go to college from the, from the family.
Story_ID: 533915
Speaker 1: How did your parents [Edith Toulson Lewis and Spencer H. Lewis] meet?
Speaker 2: Well it's a small community they were both right there in Burgess [Virginia] and he lived about ten miles from my mother and they met when my, when my [paternal] grandfather [Theodore H. Lewis] went by my mother's house selling fish and they developed a relationship and in those days they didn't have automobiles so he would walk the seven to ten miles to see her twice a week and they were married for I think it was sixty-five years, no seventy years, seventy years, wonderful relationship (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How old were they when they got started, well actually being married?
Speaker 2: Very young, very, I've forgotten, let's see my mother, it must've been eighteen or something like that, yeah, yeah, it's almost sixty-five years they were married.
Story_ID: 533916
Speaker 1: I'm gonna start to ask you about your childhood and life, but first I thought we might talk about the space that you were in, you seem like you really loved the Chesapeake Bay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so it would be great if you could start off by just telling us about that space and what, what's so lovely about it?
Speaker 2: Well, it's remote, there's nothing there other than the Bay, and you don't go through it to get anywhere.  You have to want to go there, it's at, it's at the end of 360 [U.S. Route 360] and if you keep going 360 you'll run into the Bay, so there's absolutely no way you would go there, not unless you want to go there and that's a good thing and that's a bad thing.  The good thing about it is you know everybody in the community and as I said earlier, it was a community where everybody supported each other.  The church was very strong in the community, so that was good.  You had the Bay where you could go out in the boat and do fishing, do crabbing, you could go swimming so it was a great place to grow up.  You had no crime at that time, now it's got some but still not compared to most areas, so it was, it was a good place to grow up, but at the same time it was remote, so you were sort of cut off from the rest of the world and you know I remember going to Baltimore [Maryland] on several occasions and seeing what the other side of the world looks like and coming to New York [New York].  So except for the newspapers and that type of thing it really, you know you were kind of isolated, kind of isolated.
Story_ID: 533917
Speaker 1: So we're talking about your hometown, could you tell us a little bit about the atmosphere of the town itself, what was the racial makeup of your town, Burgess [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: It was, population of Burgess is about two thousand people, very small and I would say that the makeup was probably 30 percent, 40 percent African American and 60 percent whites.  So I grew up in a segregated environment.  I went to segregated schools throughout my early education.  I was not allowed to go to the movies, the movies were segregated and if you went, there was one that you could go to in the area, you had to go upstairs and my parents [Edith Toulson Lewis and Spencer H. Lewis] absolutely forbid me for going upstairs so I saw very, very few movies growing up.  There was a small town where you could go and sit down in a restaurant but we couldn't.  We weren't allowed to go to the restaurant.  Our schools were old, dilapidated, very, very little modern equipment whereas the white schools were brick, all of the latest equipment.  So everything was, was segregated in the area and you know you dealt with it.  So I left, I left in 1959 to go off to college.  When I left to go off to college at that time, you could not eat in a restaurant.  You could not go to a movie.  In the earlier days, in those days also we did not have a hospital in the area, we had to go to Richmond [Virginia] which is seventy-five miles away and even in Richmond in those days, the hospitals were, were segregated.  You had a wing for the black folk, the African American people--either you went to a black hospital.  So it was, it was very, very difficult and it was difficult, we talked about my father earlier acquiring land and making investments and I mentioned that he was very low-key, he's a low-key individual.  One of the reason that he is low-key, if the people knew that he was acquiring this land, I think it would have been very difficult for him to do it because it was difficult for people to move forward in that area.
Speaker 1: In that, on that subject do you have any sense of how your father was doing it?  Did he perhaps make alliances in order to purchase land?
Speaker 2: I think, I think in some cases, in many cases he acquired property from, from the black African American community and he would get to it before the whites, 'cause the whites wanted it so he was able to, to move before they knew about it because if he tried to buy any property from, from white property owners in those days in would have been very, very difficult.
Speaker 1: And in Burgess when you were on the street, let's say if there was a downtown area, was there a lot of tension on the street if you were (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well you know you get used to it so you didn't feel, you know, when you, when you're there you know what you're supposed to do, where you're supposed to go so you, you know it's there but you don't constantly think about it, otherwise it just eats away at you so, so growing up in it was not, it was not pleasant, but at the same time you just didn't allow it to just get to you on a day-to-day basis.
Story_ID: 533918
Speaker 1: Tell us your earliest memory of growing up, what's the first thing you can remember?
Speaker 2: First thing I can remember in growing up?  Oh, I don't--first thing?  I guess I started working at a very young age.  I didn't have to work because my parent's [Edith Toulson Lewis and Spencer H. Lewis] focus was on education, and but at the same I did want to work so when I was about, during the summer when I was about thirteen I had a little business, a lawn business cutting grass for people.  I must've had about fifteen or twenty lawns that I would cut during the week and made some money, and I would bring it home and talk to my dad about it and he said, "Well, you gotta put it in the bank," (laughter).  So I think, you know, just being able to work and to start accumulating some dollars in those days and it was, it was fun, you know getting business and seeing how much you could really make.  I would say that was and that was about thirteen, and really, you know, going to the beach, we used to go to the bay [Chesapeake Bay] quite a bit and we had, it was good times, good times.
Story_ID: 533919
Speaker 1: What was your family life like, you said earlier that you spent quite a bit of time with your mother [Edith Toulson Lewis] and then you indicated also that your father [Spencer H. Lewis] worked a lot.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what was it like in your household?
Speaker 2: Being a, my father being a commercial fisherman, and I mentioned that they would go out every day to catch the fish, most of the time he worked out of Delaware, out of Delaware Bay because that's where a lot of the fish were so he would, he would leave home on Sundays and he would be gone for two weeks, he would come home every two weeks during the summer.  He would come home on Friday nights and then he would leave on Sunday morning.  So during my earlier years, during the summer, my dad was gone most of the time and my, just my mom and myself and she, she made sure that everything was available to me, and we spent a lot of time together as you can imagine.  We would go to the beach, we'd go shopping, we'd read and being a rural community the nearest house to me is about a mile, a mile and a half away, so she would make sure that I got to the next door neighbor, neighbor a mile away to play with the kids. So she always would do the right thing and make sure from a social point of view, from an educational point of view, from a community point of view that I was involved and she had to do it pretty much by herself during the summer.  Now during the winter he was, my father was there and we spent a lot of time during the winter, but of course during the summer when you can get out and play baseball and football, not football but baseball and do other kinds of sports, he was working, so--
Speaker 1: What kind of activities did you do with him in the winter?
Speaker 2: During the winter, I used to go out on the oyster boat with him (laughter).  He would take me out on weekends and that was, that was work for him but it was fun for me just being out in the ocean and we'd just do a lot of talking, we talked a lot.  So I really enjoyed it, I enjoyed the time that I could spent with him.  In the latter years when his health started to fail him, I moved him to Connecticut from Virginia and I had him for, captive year around for three years and we spent a lot of time together and it was, it was fantastic.  We talked a lot.
Speaker 1: What kind of things did your father like to talk about?
Speaker 2: What, what I was doing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When you were young, when you were--
Speaker 2: He talked, he talked a lot about what I was doing, how I did it and was interested in the stock market so we talked about that quite a bit, you know, just, just guy stuff, it was, it was great.
Story_ID: 533920
Speaker 1: What church did you attend?
Speaker 2: I attended Shiloh, S-H-I-L-O-H Baptist Church [Shiloh Baptist Church, Reedville, Virginia] in Virginia, great ministers you know.  One of, I attribute one of the reasons for my success was the ministers in the area.  We talked about the advantages of growing up in a segregated community, the teachers, the ministers were always there to support me and they got the most out of the kids.  My--we had four, four ministers during my time at Shiloh, all educated and it was a very, I would say progressive church, teachers and very involved in the church, people just overall were involved in the church, dynamic church and the ministers were the ones that really got on the kids.  The last minister, Reverend Ruffin [Henry M. Ruffin], would ask, would ask me to drive him to conventions.  So I would drive him to conventions, we would go to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], we would go to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], we would go to Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and again he was doing it to expose me to the different colleges and universities.  Whenever we had plays at Church I would be involved.  I was officer of BTU [Baptist Training Union] in all of the youth organizations.  Church played a major, major role in my upbringing; I was always at church (laughter).
Speaker 1: You said were (laughter), you said you went every Sunday but it sounds like you would go for different activities during the week (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) During the week, yeah during the week, and, and it just, it was a major part of my growing up.
Speaker 1: And how far was the Church from where you lived?
Speaker 2: About five miles, about five miles.
Speaker 1: Did you walk there?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 533921
Speaker 1: Tell us about the street, the particular street and the house that you lived in, can you just (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was no street (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter) can you describe the house that you lived in?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was a boondock (laughter), it was out in the boondocks, there was no street.  It was a little bungalow, little bungalow and I would say footage wise, maybe 2,000 or 3,000 square feet, you know, a kitchen, living room, dining room, three bedrooms.  During the latter years we got, we were one of the first people to get running water and indoor plumbing.  In the earlier days, they would, that part of the country was probably the last person, last place in Virginia to get running water and electricity and those kinds of things, but we had electricity, we had indoor plumbing, very comfortable, very nice, well maintained, nice lawn, I would have garden out back and would have a garden during the summer so it was very, very pleasant, very warm, very pleasant.
Speaker 1: That was your garden?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What did you grow?
Speaker 2: Greens (laughter), greens, corn, string beans, potatoes, tomatoes and I knew how to do it, yeah very, very, very nice.
Story_ID: 533922
Speaker 1: What were the most important holidays or celebration days at your house?
Speaker 2: You know everybody was working on holidays; you know there weren't too many holidays for us.  Holidays were for the other people.  Most of the time on the Fourth of July, my father [Spencer H. Lewis] was working, he was out in the bay [Delaware Bay].  Labor Day he was out in the Bay, so that the holidays, Memorial Days, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Fourth of July wasn't a big deal, everybody was working, all the black people were working.  Now Thanksgiving was always a big day for us.  The family got together we had, you know the traditional Thanksgiving dinner.
Speaker 1: Who came?
Speaker 2: Well we would rotate, my brot- my father had brothers so we'd go from one house to the other, and Christmas, of course, was a, was the biggest, was the biggest time where we exchanged gifts and, and had a real celebration, very, very, very nice.
Speaker 1: And who did the cooking, you said your father cooked on the boat?
Speaker 2: In the earlier years my mother [Edith Toulson Lewis] did a lot of the cooking, the latter years once he came off the boats he did all the cooking, but for holidays he would, he would do the turkey and for Christmas he would do most of the cooking.  He was very good at baking and just an overall excellent cook, excellent cook and he learned to cook when he was growing up and he was a cook when he was in the [U.S. military] service, he was in World War II [WWII].
Speaker 1: So how early did you know that greens were your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, from day one I think (laughter), I can't recall (laughter) I've always liked 'em.
Story_ID: 533923
Speaker 1: Today, what sights and smells and sounds take you back to your growing up?
Speaker 2: Hmm, I would say whenever I see the sound, you know the Long Island Sound which is not far from, from here it reminds me of the bay [Chesapeake Bay] a little bit. I always recognize the smell of greens if my wife [Lillian Glenn Lewis] is cooking it so, you know, I would say water and the smell of greens always takes me back to my childhood days.

Speaker 1: What elementary school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Went to a elementary school called (unclear) and I can't spell it for you now I've forgotten how you spell it.  It was a four-room school house and again the facility itself was not well kept, but the teachers were fantastic.  They made sure you did what you were supposed to do and if you did not do it, by the time you got home your mother, your parents, your father would know it, it was that type of thing.  They would make sure that the family was involved and as I said before they instilled a lot of confidence in you and they were just fantastic and as I said before, to me that was, we talk about segregation, but, but that was a real, that was an advantage to have those teachers there who really cared about you and made sure that you got your work done and did what you were supposed to do.
Speaker 1: How many grades were in that four room?
Speaker 2: Seven, seven grades, seven grades and four rooms, so you'd double up and then you went from, then you went from the elementary school to the high school in the eighth grade, and the high school was awful.  That, that looked like it was about ready to fall down, it was called Julius, Julius Rosenwald High School [Reedville, Virginia], and the Rosenwalds from the Sears Roebuck Company [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] made, I think it was a grant for negroes in the South so that they could build schools as part of the Julius Rosenwald Foundation [Julius Rosenwald Fund] that helped build that school.  We didn't have central heat, was wood heat, so during the winter we had to go out and get wood and bring it in and make sure so, so you would have, so you would be comfortable.  Be sitting there cold, you know, wind blowing right through the school.  The white folks had nice brick schools so they were doing very well.  So it was it's amazing when you, and again the teachers were just, just fantastic.
Story_ID: 533925
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about the teachers.  In elementary school did you have a teacher or particular teachers who really stood out for you?
Speaker 2: I think they were all; they were all very, very good.  I wouldn't say that they, that any of them really stood out they were just great.  In high school [Julius Rosenwald High School, Reedville, Virginia] I would say that there's one that really stood out and I kept in touch with all of 'em after I finished school.  Gloria Ruffin, R-U-F-F-I-N, she was the English teacher, the French teacher and she just stayed on me twenty-four hours a day and she said, you know, "You're gonna be something, you're gonna do something, you're gonna do something great and I'm gonna make sure you do it," and she just kept, just kept giving me assignment after assignment, got me involved in all the activities, not, and sometimes I didn't want to be involved, but she would call my mother [Edith Toulson Lewis] and say, "You know I want him involved," and that was it, so just a great, great person.
Speaker 1: What kind of activities were you participating in?
Speaker 2: The drama club, you know I wasn't interested in drama (laughter).  I wanted to play basketball, the band you know, she made sure I got in the band, I played the trumpet.  Debating, the debate club, you know I didn't want to be in, I didn't want to debate; you know I had to do that.  So I was involved in that, played basketball, wasn't, wasn't a great basketball player but enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: And do you feel like that was beneficial to you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --to participate in these, particularly in the things that you didn't like?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, absolutely, I think it was, helped to broaden me quite a bit, and clearly well, well worth the effort and time.
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as an elementary and high school student?
Speaker 2: I was okay.
Speaker 1: Were you well behaved?
Speaker 2: By today's standards I was, I was extremely well behaved (laughter).  I didn't, you know I was the average, you know teenager who got into a little mischief, but, but nothing serious, you know so, I was a good student, got along well with my classmates, never got into any major trouble, love automobiles. I, you know, we had always had nice automobiles and I would make sure they were clean and never did anything terribly wrong with them, so I would say I was, I was, I was okay.
Story_ID: 533926
Speaker 1: You said that your father [Spencer H. Lewis] was insistent that you go to college and I'm assuming that he made that clear fairly early, particularly after his experience with your uncles.  When you were in school [Julius Rosenwald High School, Reedville, Virginia], did you have a sense of where you would go to college and what you would do there for your future?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said earlier there was no question.  If I didn't go to college I just felt I may as well just off and never come back, so I knew I was going to college.  My teacher, Mrs. Ruffin [Gloria Ruffin], wanted me to go to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia].  She had finished Virginia Union and she had said, "This is where you're going," and I had thought up until--and my minister, Reverend Ruffin [Henry M. Ruffin], they weren't married but just happened to have the same last names, she married his brother.  The minister had gone to Virginia Union, so both the minister and the teacher had me slotted for Virginia Union.  Quite frankly, I was convinced pretty much up until my senior year that I was going to Virginia Union, because in those days you didn't have anyone coming from that area going to the white schools directly out of high school.  In fact very few of us really from the high school went off to college.  Most of the kids that finished, primarily because of economic reasons, had to go to work.  So out of my senior class, there were probably five of us who went off to college and the size of the class there were about fifty of us.  So--
Speaker 1: Do you remember who those people were?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, it was three young ladies and two guys.  So, so Virginia Union was at the top of my, my pastor's list and my teacher's list and I was thinking along Virginia Union, and then I said, well maybe I should just consider some other schools, and I said well there's Hampton, which is Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia].  It was Hampton Institute [Hampton, Virginia] in those days, not too far away, and Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], and Howard [Howard University] which is in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  So I just started thinking about those schools, and then a couple of my buddies who had graduated earlier had gone off to Hampton and they would come back and they would talk about what a great time they were having at Hampton.  So I started to give some time, some of my--focus some of my time to Hampton and it came down to Hampton, Virginia Union and Howard, and did a little research on Hampton and found that it was a pretty good school and that I had some friends there.  So that's how I made the, made the switch and broke my teacher's heart but I'm very happy I went there.
Story_ID: 533927
Speaker 1: Before you chose a school, did you have a sense about what you wanted to study when you went to school?
Speaker 2: I didn't, my father [Spencer H. Lewis] did (laughter).  My father and my mother [Edith Toulson Lewis] clearly had decided what I would do and you know, I, I had, I was thinking I might be at that time a teacher or something like that, but my father wanted me to be doctor, and my mother also wanted me to be a doctor, so as far as they were concerned, I was going to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and to and get into pre-med and then I would go to med school, and when I went off to Hampton, that's, that's pretty much what I was looking to do was to major in pre-med and go to medical school.  So they had convinced me that was the, that was the way to go.
Speaker 1: So you were pre-med for that first year?
Speaker 2: No, not even for the first year (laughter).  Well the first year you didn't have to take, you didn't have to choose a major so it was just general, you know, courses.  So it, but still I was still focused on the fact that I would probably go into, into pre-med and then the second year, by the end of, by the end of the first year I had met some of the other students there who said they were going to major in accounting, business administration and they said that you know, we talked about it 'cause I had never given accounting a thought, and we talked about why they were doing it.  They said, "Oh you know you can go to work for the government, the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] and you know you can do accounting work, it's fantastic."  So I began to think about it a little bit and by the first semester of my sophomore year, I went home and told my parents that really I'm thinking about majoring in accounting, and they said, "Well how are you gonna get a job," black people don't work in large corporations, in those times.  This is 1960; there were no black finance people, that I'm aware of, in a major corporation in a responsible position.  So what are you gonna do, how are you gonna get a job, and I told them, I said, "Well, you know, I think I can make it work. I can certainly go to work for the government.  I can hang out my own shingle, and you know I've always enjoyed numbers.  I just have a passion for numbers and I think it's something that I would enjoy," and they said, "Well, we're disappointed, but if that's what you want to do we're behind you 100 percent and go ahead and do it."
Story_ID: 533928
Speaker 1: So, Mr. Lewis [HistoryMaker George Lewis], did anything else influence your interest in becoming a--going into business as opposed to medicine?
Speaker 2: Yeah, during the summers, my senior year in high school [Julius Rosenwald High School, Reedville, Virginia], my freshman year in college, I worked in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and I worked in a restaurant and my job in the restaurant was delivering food to, to the corporations downtown Philadelphia, and one of the major companies that, that I delivered food to was Sun Oil Company [Sunoco, Inc.] and there were a number of other major corporations, and I would walk into these offices delivering sandwiches and soft drinks and I would hear these guys, because there were very few women in those days, there absolutely no African Americans in these corporations, nobody who looked like me, but I would hear them talking about deals.  "You know, we're gonna do this deal, we're gonna make this acquisition, we're gonna build this plant and we're talking X amount of dollars and we're gonna get this amount of return," and they just sounded like they were having so much fun and as I said earlier, I had a passion for numbers so it really, it really generated a great deal of interest and I started looking into it a little bit more.  What kind of deals are they looking at and I started talking to them when they would come into the store. I said, "When I was in the office I heard you talking about deals, what do you guy do?"  By the time I got back to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], I said this, this is it.  This is what I have to do.  So, the summer experience was very, very valuable.  It convinced me that it was something that I wanted to do.  I wanted to be in the world of wheeling and dealing and involved in big, big deals and, so it had a tremendous influence on me.
Speaker 1: Were you at all discomforted by the fact that you didn't see anyone who looked like yourself when you were visiting these companies?
Speaker 2: Well, I, in the back of my mind, I, I had a concern about where I would work because Corporate America had not opened up at that point in time to really seek African Americans out.  So I did have concerns about where I would work and how I would get a job, but again, I, I thought it was something that even if I weren't able to get into the corporate world, I'll just do something on my own.  I could do my own thing and fortunately up until 1962, no corporation had recruited at Hampton University for accounting or finance positions, in fact, hadn't recruited at all at Hampton University or any other black school that I'm aware of, and in 1962 Sun Oil Company came to Hampton's campus and recruited an African American for an accounting position, and when that happened, I said, things are beginning to open up.  My timing could not have been better 'cause in 1963 the year I graduated from Hampton, we must have had ten recruiters come to the campus.  We had General Foods [General Foods Corporation], we had Sun Oil, we had Pepsi [PepsiCo] and others, DuPont [E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company], and I got interviews for three of those companies.  If it had been two years earlier, the doors were closed.  So this is during the Civil Rights Movement when things began to open up for us, so there's a lot to be said for luck and timing.
Story_ID: 533929
Speaker 1: What was happening in the movement to encourage these companies to wanna open their doors or at least (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, this was during the Civil Rights Movement, you know, you had the March on Washington, that was coming up in '63 [1963], you had the sit-ins during the '60s [1960], things were beginning to, to really pop.  Corporations, because of affirmative action, corporations were beginning to say, "Let's try to do the right thing.  We have African American consumers out there."  They were finally waking up so in the early '60s [1960s] Corporate America finally started to wake up and say, "We got some talent out there that we're not taking advantage of," and I happened to be in the right spot at the right time.
Speaker 1: Were you aware of any pioneers who were working in corporations, perhaps--?
Speaker 2: I wasn't aware of any pioneers in Corporate America in the early '60s [1960s].  I don't know if there were any in a senior position in the 1960s, early 1960s.
Speaker 1: So, when you investigated the companies that came to interview at Hampton, there, there wasn't really an element of diversity that was involved (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was no diversity at all, there were no pioneers you could look forward to, and you know we were breaking; we were breaking ground at that point.
Story_ID: 533930
Speaker 1: You chose General Foods [General Foods Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I got, as I said I got an interview at General Foods and--White Plains, New York and had, had a full day of interviews.  My first interview was in the Jell-O division.  I spent pretty much the full day there and I wasn't sure the interview had gone that well.  I had thought that they were just going through the exercise because they were told that they had to interview some African Americans, but I, I wasn't quite sure that they were serious, and I didn't see, didn't see anybody that looked me during the interviewing process, and I happened to be sitting in the lobby of General Foods waiting for a cab going back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] because it was in the, going back to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] quite frankly and this black woman walked through the lobby, and she said, "Who are you?" And I said, I told her who I was and she said, "But why are you here?"  I told her I had gotten an interview with Jell-O and I didn't think it had gone that well, I just didn't think they were serious about it, I just thought someone had told them they had to interview African Americans.  She said, "I'm manager of--," I forgot her title, she was manager of human resources at the corporate area.  She was the only black person at General Foods at that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember her name?
Speaker 2: Eileen Johnson [Eileen Williams Johnson], I will never forget her as long as I live and I've kept in contact.  She died about five years ago, but I've kept in contact, I did keep in contact with her, and she said, "Sit here, we're gonna do something for you."  So she came back, and she said, "I'm gonna have to give you a little test, a little quiz."  So she gave me a test, you know different kinds of multiple choices, and little math problems and I did that and then she said, "I'm gonna have you interview the comptroller for the Kool-Aid division."  Interviewed the comptroller he had me interview some others, went back to her and she said, "We're gonna get this done before you leave."  So by the time I left there I had a job.  If it had not been for that black woman, I would not have gotten the job at General Foods.
Story_ID: 533931
Speaker 1: So I started at General Foods [General Foods Corporation] in 1963, I was the first African American in a financial position at General Foods.  I was in the Kool-Aid division.  There were no blacks in sales or marketing at that point in time.  We had the one in human resources, nothing, nobody in the line positions, position.  So I started there as a sales accountant, just doing accounting kind of work and then I was promoted to a financial analyst and from there I was promoted to a product analyst doing all kinds of analysis for a group of products like S.O.S soap pads they had at the time, Open Pit barbecue sauce, Good Seasons salad dressings, any kind of, any kind of financial analysis relating to those products, I did, and again it, it was very lonely because initially I was the only one I the financial area.  I saw nobody that looked like me.  The next couple of years, that was in 1966 that I went to '63 [1963] I went to GF.  The next year in '64 [1964] a couple of other African Americans came in and I got to know them.  So it was, it was very, very lonely and, but you know it was, it was great, because you know you were doing what, what you were trained to do.
Speaker 2: So before the other black financial worker, were the analysts or before the other people joined the company, what was the atmosphere like during the day?  Did people sort of, were they standoffish?
Speaker 1: No, they were, you know, they were, it was fine.  You know, I, you knew that there were some, it wasn't great, there were some who welcomed you with open arms, there were others who stood back, but you just decided that you know that you were going to deal with it and, what I realized was that, that I could do the work.  I thought I was very, very good, I was a hard worker.  I made it a point, I said they're not gonna outwork me, so I was usually the first one in, and the last one out.  I was there on weekends.  I made sure all of the I's were dotted and the T's were crossed, and I got these promotions that I had talked about earlier.
Story_ID: 533932
Speaker 1: After about two, two years there I said, you know, I gotta have a plan.  I gotta have a short-term plan, and I gotta have a long-term plan, and the short-term plan that I developed was that I had to have an M.B.A., and the long-term plan was I wanted to be a senior executive in a major corporation, and I said I wanna do it here at General Foods [General Foods Corporation] or I'm gonna do it somewhere in Corporate America, and what happened was at GF, at General Foods you looked around.  All of the major top guys in the corporation all went through a division called Maxwell House Coffee Division.  If you were gonna be a senior executive at General Foods, you got to go through Maxwell House, and at that time they didn't have any of us in Maxwell House, so I tried to get a sponsor, a mentor to get me in Maxwell House, and it didn't look like it was going to develop.  So I said I was gonna go ahead and get my short-term goal working, that was to get the M.B.A. and I started going at NYU [New York University, New York, New York], down in the city, but coming from Westchester [New York] all the way down to NYU when I'm getting in early and working late, became a problem so I transferred to Iona [Iona College, New Rochelle, New York], which was only about ten or fifteen minutes away.  Went to school at night, took me four years at night to get my M.B.A.  So I got my, my first objective achieved and I was just about to finish with it when I left General Foods, and then I decided that it didn't appear that I was going to be able to get into Maxwell House so I said, well let me start to see how I'm gonna achieve my long-term objective, and I decided to, to make a move.
Speaker 2: Did you have any mentors at General Food?
Speaker 1: No, there were none.  You know there were some relationships that I worked with that were good, but I certainly wouldn't, wouldn't say that I had a, had a mentor that I could go to if I had some problems or some issues.
Story_ID: 533933
Speaker 1: Were you married yet?
Speaker 2: I was married, I got married.  In 1963 I met my wife [Lillian Glenn Lewis] at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], she--
Speaker 1: How did you meet her?
Speaker 2: She was a friend, she is a friend of a young lady from the same town that I'm from [Burgess, Virginia], and I got to know her through my home girl as we say and we started to have, started to date and she was a biology major from (unclear) and we both finished in 1963, and we were married in--we have an anniversary coming up October 11th, so it will be forty-four years in October.
Speaker 1: Congratulations.
Speaker 2: Thank you and I must say as I've gone through the corporate world, she was the one person who kept me, kept me going.  We talked about mentors or having someone to talk to.  It was very lonely in those days, and she was the pillar where I could come home, and I could let it all hang out.  I'd come home and talk about it, laugh about it, cry about it and she always said, you know, "You hang in there, but if you want to walk away from it, you do it," but she was, she's always been very encouraging and very supportive and without her I wouldn't have made it.  There is no question about it, you know.  You got to have someone that you can talk to and that has, that was the problem with the earlier movement of blacks into corporations.  You couldn't go to a co-worker and say, "Well I don't understand this problem," because you can't trust 'em you know.  So you had to figure it, try to work it out yourself and you'd come home and you dig in, you work, you know fifteen, sixteen hours at the office and then you come home and work another five hours trying to figure out what in the hell is going on, but she was, she was always there.
Story_ID: 533934
Speaker 1: Can you tell us was--about anyone else that you went to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] with, pardon me, that we might want you to mention (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In our, in our class in 1963, as I said that was the first year that Corporate America began to recruit at traditionally black institutions and that year they recruited three of us out of Hampton, two went to DuPont [E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company] and I went to General Foods [General Foods Corporation].
Speaker 1: Who were those who went to DuPont?
Speaker 2: A guy by the name of Phil Riddick [ph.] from Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia and another young lady, Marian Manze [ph.] from North Carolina, they went to DuPont, so just three of us that came out that went into the corporate world.
Speaker 1: So you got your M.B.A., you satisfied your short-term goal, how did you go about making a move from General Foods?
Speaker 2: In 1966, '67 [1967] Corporate America was very interested in African Americans.  They, they realized, affirmative action was in place, they realized that there was a great consumer base out there, so we were sort of in, in demand as a result of that you found that quite a few minority recruiting firms had started to pop up, prior to that you didn't have many minority black recruiting firms for major corporations.  There was a recruiting firm headed by Charles Fields.  Charles lives in Westchester [New York], and I don't know how he got my name, but he had contacted me.  He contacted me and said, you know, "I read about you, I heard about you at General Foods, got a lot of things going on, we should chat."  Talked to Charles and he said, "How much you making?"  I said I'm making $105 per week which is about $5,800 bucks [dollars] a year, and he said, "Oh, we can make it, we can get a lot more money than that," and he had a client, W.R. Grace [W.R. Grace and Company] had an opening as a financial analyst, paying about $10,000 a year which is a significant jump, and we talked about it and by that time I had also told Charlie that I wanted a position that would give me exposure to senior management, 'cause I always felt that if you got close to senior management, and if you did well, then you could develop some relationships and you could also get a feel for what's happening in a corporation.  So I said if I can get something close to the top, senior management that's what I'm looking for.  So I got a job at W.R. Grace, as a financial analyst, and finally, W.R. Grace was a conglomerate that had restaurants, mining companies, sports goods companies, just an overall conglomerate.  I got a job as a financial analyst on the staff of the CEO.  He had a personal staff of about seven of us who just did special projects for him, so and these guys, all the guys were very, very good.  So I went in as a financial analyst and we worked on special projects for the CEO (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who was the--?
Speaker 2: The CEO was W.R. Grace [sic. J. Peter Grace] who was the owner of the company at the time.  So I got exposure to the CEO, the executive VPs [vice presidents], the senior VPs, and it was valuable experience to see how they, the thought process, how they arranged deals, what they did, how they analyzed situations, but the CEO was numbers driven.  We would do some analysis but he really didn't pay a lot of attention to our analysis, he would do his own analysis.  So we became more or less number crunchers, and I felt just to generate numbers in the long term would not help me to further my career.  So after being there about nine months, I decided that if I'm gonna stay on track to meet my long-term goals, I've got to make a move.
Story_ID: 533935
Speaker 1: I have one question that then bumped into another.  What were those--what kinds of projects were special for W.R. Grace [W.R. Grace and Company]?  It sounds like they were into lots of different types of business?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we would look at--they had, they owned Herman's Sports Good Company [Herman Sporting Goods Inc.], I don't know if you, you're probably too young to know about that, but they had, it was a national sporting goods company.  We looked at profitability by store; we would make profitability of our store, where the margins were, what they should be, what kind of margins they should be generating, what kind of returns they should be generating.  They were in the mining business, we'd look at, analyze their business W.R. Grace's business versus the competitors' business.  We would be able to tell the CEO what margins the competitors had, why they had these margins, so he would be able to make a decision, those type of analysis.
Speaker 1: And how long, how long was your long-term plan?  You know you said you had this long-term plan.  What was your sense of how many years it was going take you to become a senior executive (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, by this time, by this time I wanted to be a CFO in a major corporation.  There were no black CFOs of major corporations, and my time frame was, I had said within ten years, and I was twenty-five at that point in time.  I wanted to be well on my way to being a senior financial executive.
Story_ID: 533936
Speaker 1: So after nine months with at with Mr. Grace [J. Peter Grace], what did you do?
Speaker 2: Again, minority firms had become quite popular and they, they had a lot of clients and there was a job fair in New York City [New York, New York] on a Saturday morning and it was run by Richard Clarke Associates [Richard Clarke and Associates], which is a search firm, and what you did, you would sign up for the companies that you wanted to see, send them your resume in advance, and if they were--had an interest, they would get back to you.  So I got, I was, I got four companies that were interested in talking to me that morning and Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] was one, and of course I had known Philip Morris from growing up in Virginia and the other, you know and I had known about some of its track record.  Certainly they didn't have any African Americans in a financial position, but they were one of the first major corporations to open up their manufacturing facilities, integrate their manufacturing facilities.  They were one of the first to have African American salesmen to go into white communities, so they seemed to be moving in the right direction.  They clearly didn't have any senior executives, nor did any of these companies.  So by, by this time I had said that it appeared that Philip Morris might be a company that would give me a good opportunity.  So when I got the interview, I went to the job fair, had a very nice meeting with the human resource person, and she said that they'd probably get back to me.  They did, and got back to me and I went for an interview at corporate headquarters at 1-, it was 100 Park Avenue, talked to the vice president of human resources, and he, he said, "Yeah, I think we might be able to do something," and he said, "that clearly in the area of accounting we can probably do something and accounts receivable, accounts payable," but accounts receivable and accounts payable don't get you close to the top.  So I said, "That's just not going to, to work, I'm looking for something that would be close to senior management, working on projects for senior management and I know that you're going to be diversifying, you've said that you're looking to diversify your product line, you want to get involved in more than a one-product company, so you're going to be looking for different kinds of businesses.  So as a result of that what I'm interested in doing is helping you fulfill your strategic, long-range plan of diversification and if I can, if you can find a position for me in that area, that's what I'm interested in."  He said, well he's not sure about that.  So I said, "Well if you find something, let me know," and a couple of days later I got a call, come back and I met the person in strategic planning.  We had a nice chat and I was off and running.
Speaker 1: Now, where were you living at this time?
Speaker 2: We were living in--when I went to Philip Morris we were living in Yonkers [New York].  We had an apartment, three-room apartment, and one, one child at that point, so I had one child [HistoryMaker Tonya Lewis Lee], married [to Lillian Glenn Lewis], and I was still going to school [Iona College, New Rochelle, New York] for my M.B.A., working sixteen hours a day.
Story_ID: 533937
Speaker 1: So you indicated you were living in Yonkers [New York] and you had one child, Tonya [HistoryMaker Tonya Lewis Lee], and you were working sixteen hours a day.  How did your, how did you work your family life when you were at the office so much (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, fortunately I had a wonderful wife [Lillian Glenn Lewis] and she was able to keep things balanced and when I was home I spent as much time as possible with the family, but it was difficult, it was difficult trying to, trying to stay on track climbing that ladder and also keeping the family balanced at the same time, it was very difficult.
Speaker 1: When did you have your second daughter?
Speaker 2: About three years later, Tracey [Tracey Lewis-Elligan], so, but again, my wife did a superb job, and we on weekends, we spent a lot of time together and whenever I was there we always made sure that we had dinner together and we talked business a little bit, we talked sports a little bit, just talked about everything.  So it was, it was nice.  The unfortunate thing about it is it just wasn't enough time, and when you're trying to climb that corporate ladder and you're on an airplane or you're in the office, you do lose a little bit.  So I think, I think one thing you have to sometimes step back and try to balance a little bit, but it worked and it worked because I had an excellent spouse.
Story_ID: 533938
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you're starting at Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.], where's your office located?
Speaker 2: 120 Park Avenue, New York [New York] and you know it was Philip Morris when I went there it was--had revenues of sales of one billion dollars and by the time I retired, six and a half years ago, it was about a hundred billion dollars, so I saw a lot of growth.  At the time I went there we were number six in the industry, within five years we were number one in the industry.  It was a dynamic company, as I said luck and timing have a lot to do with everything, but, but I was very fortunate to be able to be in that position and to have gotten the support that I got, and when I went in, in '67 [1967] I was doing strategic planning, again because they, they were looking at diversifying the company so I was helping them identify opportunities outside of the business, outside of the cigarette business.  So I would look at different industries and see if there was some, if it was something that would fit with our business or if it was something that we should explore and then after, I went in as a planning analyst, three years after that I became a senior planning analyst and that's when I actually got involved in doing deals.  Actually going out, identifying companies to purchase, doing all of the negotiation to buy companies, coming back making a presentation to the CEO, CFO to the board of directors and again I was twenty-eight years old at that point in time.  A lot of responsibility, I was in and out of the office of the CEO, president, CFO on a continuous basis.  They got to know me, I was learning a lot from them, the senior managers and how they operate.  I was careful to dot all the I's, cross all the T's.  As I said I was always the first one in and the last one out.  That was an advantage, 'cause these guys worked different hours.  Sometimes seven o'clock they would call, make a call to corporate planning where I was working, nobody, I was the only one there, said, "Can you, can you do something for me."  I did it, in the mornings, they get in early, I was there, they called.  So, I, I got to know the guys very well, and I think they became very comfortable with me.
Story_ID: 533939
Speaker 1: After being there about three years, CEO, I was in his office and he said, "Well where would you like to go in the organization?"  I said, "Well I wanna be CFO"  He said, "CFO," and recognizing at this point in time, in Corporate America there are no black comptrollers of a top one hundred company.  There are no treasurers, vice president or treasurers of any Fortune 500 companies, there are no black CFOs of any Fortune 500 company, so you know, this, this is sort of, this is fantasy world as far as he was probably thinking this is probably not going to happen, but he said, "Okay," he said, "we'll get back to you."  So after being in the corporate planning department for about three years, I got a call from the CFO and he said, "We, we're gonna make a move on you, we're gonna move you to investor relations, and investor relations deals with Wall Street [New York, New York], you know you're communicating the financial aspects of the company to the security analysts to stockholders, so you get a feel for how the Street looks at a company, you get a feel for how analysts evaluates the company, so it was a great tool, great learning experience for me and again, it, it I was constantly in and out of senior management's office telling them how the analysts are looking at Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.], what kind of values they're putting on the overall company as a whole.  So again, I did a pretty good job there.  I was involved in the annual report, all interim reports that went to the shareholders, all reports that went to analysts so it required great communication skills and good analytical skills, it, it was wonderful.
Speaker 2: Who was the most influential, I mean you're saying you're meeting with the CEO and the CFO, are they the most influential in your time, your start time at Philip Morris, can you name anyone else perhaps, perhaps who was on the board, who was important and--?
Speaker 1: I would say the CEO at the time was CEO and the president; both were very, very supportive.  I wouldn't call them mentors but, but I would say that if I had a problem, if I had a problem I knew that I could go to 'em and I knew that they would get results, it would get resolved, but I wouldn't go to 'em not unless it was something very, very important. So I would say the CEO and the president were pretty--they had gotten to know me pretty well, and not unless, not unless it was very important, you know, I wouldn't come to 'em, but if I had a problem, I wouldn't hesitate to go to 'em and they would get it resolved.
Story_ID: 533940
Speaker 1: How was investor relations--
Speaker 2: It was a wonderful experience (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) once you actually got there?
Speaker 2: Wonderful experience and I spent two and half to three years in that position and after that position they said, you need some treasury experience, which again is keeping me on track for CFO type job, a treasurer-type position.  I went in as assistant treasurer of the parent company, again, unheard of in Corporate America at that time.  This is 1972, '73 [1973], you couldn't find any in major corporations and this job dealt with dealing with banks, helping to manage the pension funds of the corporations, getting involved in foreign currency transactions, and again getting to know a lot of the financial people throughout the organization.  Even in Europe I had to talk to executives in Europe and dealing with foreign currency, so you got exposure not only externally with the banks, but also internally with other people in the organization.
Speaker 1: How much traveling are you doing at this time?
Speaker 2: Not a lot of traveling, I did a lot of traveling in strategic planning 'cause I was constantly looking for jobs, looking for companies.  This one, not a lot of, not a lot of travel, I was dealing primarily with the major banks and most of the major banks were in New York City [New York, New York], the investment bankers as well as the commercial banks.  So I was in this job, that was an officer of the company, that was, that was the first black officer of Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] and then about after about three years, the CEO called me in and said, "You know we'd like for you to get some operating company experience," 'cause all my experience had been at corporate and I did want some operating experience.  Quite frankly, I wanted to go international, but I don't think they were ready for it at that point in time, but that's where I wanted to go.  Now they had, they did have African Americans in international in Africa, in sales and running one of their manufacturing facilities, but no one in finance outside of the United States, but they said, "We want you to have some operating company experience.  We want you to go Milwaukee [Wisconsin] to be senior vice president of finance for Philip Morris Industrial," which was about an $800 million dollar company, reporting to the CEO of that, of that company.  And Philip Morris Industrial was a specialty chemical company, it also had paper products and it also had flexible packaging products.  So I really wasn't interested in going to Milwaukee.  Milwaukee was the last place on my agenda, you know, I would, I would have loved to have gone international, but Milwaukee, it was too cold out there for me (laughter), but talked to my wife [Lillian Glenn Lewis] and we both agreed that for a three-year period it wouldn't be too bad, you know it would be great for the kids [HistoryMaker Tonya Lewis Lee and Tracey Lewis-Elligan], you know they would get exposed to the Midwest and they had told me they were gonna bring me back in three years, so you go out for three years and you come back.  So we went out to Milwaukee.
Story_ID: 533941
Speaker 1: Before we talk about Milwaukee [Wisconsin], you had talked about your, your being an analyst for Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] and you're making a consideration about how other companies are looking at your company.  Now of late, of course, there's a lot of litigation and you know, tobacco the industry is really looked down upon, how is Philip Morris perceived in the late '60s [1960], early '70s [1970] when you're there and you're analyzing and also sharing that information with other companies?
Speaker 2: Philip Morris was the most admired corporation in the world at that time.  Fortune magazine does ratings on companies, most admired corporations in the world [World's Most Admired Companies], we would always be up until probably in early 1990s, we would always rank one or two of the most admired corporation in the world.
Speaker 1: What did you attribute to that?
Speaker 2: Oh, we had a great, we had great brand recognitions, we had great management and by this time through some of our efforts, we had been able to bring in African American people and they were very visible and they had, they were beginning to get a good track record in hiring African Americans and females, so I think it was the brand image, the diversification that we had going for us, the freedom for employees to be a creative, so we just had a lot and we contributed an awful lot of money to the arts, we contributed a lot of money to the minority organizations like the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the Urban League [National Urban League], very much in the community, so it was, it was very much thought of as an outstanding company and very much admired throughout the world.
Speaker 1: And in the mid-'70s [1970] what are you most recognizable brands?
Speaker 2: It was Marlboro, Virginia Slims and Benson and Hedges.
Speaker 1: So the tobacco brands (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 533942
Speaker 1: You go to Milwaukee [Wisconsin], what do you think about Milwaukee?
Speaker 2: Milwaukee was Milwaukee (laughter), no it was a, it was a great experience, certainly from a professional point of view.  You know I was CFO of a, a operating division [Philip Morris Industrial] of Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] at thirty-three years old, youngest vice president of Philip Morris that they had at that point in time, thirty-three years old, and I had full responsibility, responsibility for the financial accounting, audit function.  I was reporting to the CEO, was involved in just about all of the management, major management decisions of that operating company.
Speaker 1: How, how are your parents [Edith Toulson Lewis and Spencer H. Lewis] feeling at this point about our career choice?
Speaker 2: Well, they were very, very proud of it.  You know when I left General Foods [General Foods Corporation], I think they were a little bit concerned because they said, "Now you've gotten a shot, you're African American, you're in a corporate environment, they're not many of you, don't you think you should stay there?"  So when I left I think they were a little bit concerned and then when I left General Foods and went to Grace [W.R. Grace and Company] they were really concerned, but after they saw what I was able to achieve at Philip Morris, they were just very, very proud of what, what I had been able to accomplish and understood, and understood very clearly what I had to go through to get there.
Speaker 1: And do you think that your forthrightness in telling the CEO what your career trajectory was contributed to their giving you the experience in the different areas that were necessary for you later?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I think it's very important when you have the opportunity to let people know what your career objectives are, and what you hope to achieve, and let them know what your plan is to achieve your objectives.  I think it's very important.  I think that clearly helped an awful lot and helped them focus on where they should be positioning me for the future.
Story_ID: 533943
Speaker 1: If we could just change the subject for a moment, did you start playing golf when you moved to Milwaukee [Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: I started playing golf in Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: How did you begin, what got you interested and who took you out on the green?
Speaker 2: Tom Shropshire, Tom Shropshire [Thomas B. Shropshire] worked for Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] and Tom was in the sales area at the time.  He came up through the sales area in Philip Morris and Tom was a vice president at the Miller Brewing Company, which Philip Morris owned at that time.  So Tom and I were very, very close.  I was playing tennis, Tom was playing golf and he'd convince me that I would like golf.  So he took me out and I was at thirty-seven, thirty-seven years old when I started to play golf, and I found that golf was very important, because it gave me the opportunity when you get out there to clear your mind because it's nothing else you can think about other than how you're gonna execute the shot and hit this little white ball, but I really didn't start playing that much until the kids [HistoryMaker Tonya Lewis Lee and Tracey Lewis-Elligan] got a little bit older, because golf is very time consuming, and on the weekends and the time that I did have I spent with the kids, once the kids got to be teenagers didn't want to be seen with dad and mom [Lillian Glenn Lewis] that much then I really got into it and really become a good golfer.
Speaker 1: And where did you play in Milwaukee?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was very different in Milwaukee, a little bit different in Milwaukee than it was here on the East Coast.  Here on the East Coast it's very difficult to get into a country club in the '70s [1970], in fact there were no African American, African American golfers in any of the country clubs in Westchester County [New York].
Speaker 1: How many country clubs are we talking about?
Speaker 2: We're talking a lot of country clubs in Westchester County and Fairfield County; we're in Fairfield County, Connecticut.  You're talking a lot of country clubs.
Speaker 1: Fifty, one hundred?
Speaker 2: Oh, at least fifty, at least fifty, all New York, Long Island [New York].  There were no, in the '70s [1970] no African Americans in any of the country clubs in Metropolitan New York [New York].  They would not let you in.  So Milwaukee was a little bit different, it's a small town and you're a senior executive, so there were a few of us in country clubs in Milwaukee.  Tom Schropshar, who was vice president of Miller Brewing Company, he joined the club.  I was the vice president at Industrial [Philip Morris Industrial], I belonged to a club.  [HistoryMaker] Wayne Embry was general manager of the Milwaukee Bucks, very nice guy; African American joined the country club.  So the Midwest started to open up a little bit earlier, much earlier than the clubs here in Metropolitan New York area.
Speaker 1: And when you guys are joining these clubs, are you aware of that tension?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh I mean it, everybody knew it was tough 'cause even in Milwaukee there was only one in Tom's club, there was only one in my club [Ville du Parc Country Club, Mequon, Wisconsin] and there was only one in Wayne's club so, you know they hadn't just opened the flood gates, even now you know, it's still not a bunch, not a lot.
Story_ID: 533944
Speaker 1: Were you a member of the Ville du Parc Country Club [Mequon, Wisconsin] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's correct.
Speaker 1: So can you tell us a little bit about what that club was like and how you became chosen, became a member and what their feeling was about inviting you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were very open about it because at the time I joined, my CEO joined the company and the vice president of human resources joined the company and they were told that if I couldn't come, the others weren't coming.  So they didn't have a problem.  It all came down to that and people were fine.  No issues, no concerns and at the club that Tom [Thomas B. Shropshire] belonged to, several of the senior executives of Miller [Miller Brewing Company] belonged to the club, so it worked.  It wasn't a problem at all.
Speaker 1: And did you visit each other's clubs?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we played yeah, a lot of times.
Speaker 1: And did you bring other black members into the clubs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah, no issues at all, no issues.  Milwaukee [Wisconsin] was very unique in that regard.  Now you go to some other places, you know we moved to St. Louis [Missouri] from Milwaukee and we get into that, they didn't have any African American members at any of those clubs, so I never belonged to a club there, but Milwaukee was very unique in that regards.  Again, because it was a small community and we were senior executives and they just decided that they would accept us.
Story_ID: 533945
Speaker 1: So you're in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] for three years, how and when, how do you make your way back into New York City [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well I mentioned earlier, I went out there really for three years, that was my intent. Three years went and came.  I was having fun, I had helped to grow the company and when I went there it was about five hundred million dollars and after about four, four years we had doubled to a billion and made several acquisitions.  The company was profitable, it was doing well, so from a professional point of view, I was okay, but after four or five years you want to do something different, and I mentioned it to the CEO back in Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.].  He said, "Be patient, you know we'll get you back," and I said okay, so the sixth year came and went and I told my wife [Lillian Glenn Lewis], I said, you know, I'm not sure this is going to work, but what happened, I met [HistoryMaker] Wayne Embry I mentioned earlier, the general manager of the Milwaukee Bucks, got to know Wayne pretty well, and Wayne had met, met someone from General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company], and had interested Wayne into starting up a manufacturing, automotive manufacturing supply company, and Wayne wanted to know if I would be interested in joining him in this venture and I said sure.  So we started up, Wayne's still the general manager of the Bucks, I'm vice president of Philip Morris Industrial.  We start up an automotive supply business, supplying parts to General Motors and later to Ford [Ford Motor Company], and we hired a professional manager, we hired other people--
Speaker 1: What did you call that company?
Speaker 2: MALCO [MALCO, Inc.], M-A-L-C-O, and we hired other professionals and by the second year I guess we were up to about twenty-five million dollars in revenues and the plan had been that once we got it to a certain level, one of us would probably step out and run the business.
Story_ID: 533946
Speaker 1: Just as I was thinking about stepping out, I got this call from the CEO of Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.], saying, "I want you to go to St. Louis [Missouri]."  So then I said should I, should I stay with MALCO [MALCO, Inc.], 'cause I'm spending more time with that; I'm still working for Philip Morris, but I'm spending time with it, or should I go to 7-Up, and 7-Up at the time was a major soft drink company, and Philip Morris had purchased it probably about five years earlier, I'm not sure of the year, and it hadn't done that well.  It was very difficult for a lemon-lime drink to compete against colas, and we didn't have a cola, and we had tried everything, but we just couldn't get it to grow.  Pepsi [PepsiCo] and Coke [The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, Georgia] was, was just killing us.  So the CEO--and we also owned a food business as part of 7-Up.  So the CEO said, "What I want you to do is go to St. Louis, be CFO of 7-Up, clean up the balance sheet, work with management and food and profitability, see if we can grow and if we can't grow it we're gonna have to make some decisions on whether we divest it or spin it off or whatever," and this was a big operation, so you know I looked at it, I said, I've got to do this, I've got to do it, not only for me, but I've got to do it for other black, African American financial people.  We don't get this opportunity too often and when you get this opportunity, you've got to do it.  So I talked to my wife [Lillian Glenn Lewis], I said, "What do you think about St. Louis?"  She said, "Well, you know, why not, let's go."  So we moved to St. Louis in 1982.
Speaker 2: What about our MALCO partner?
Speaker 1: Well, I talked to Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne Embry], told Wayne, I said, "Listen, you're gonna have to hold it down for a while.  I'm gonna go and run 7-Up, the financial side of 7-Up, we'll see how it works, but just keep, I'm not that far away, I'm only, I'm only by plane about forty-five minutes to an hour, on weekends, I'll be in Milwaukee, so we can hold it together."  So went to, went to St. Louis and we enjoyed St. Louis.  Had a wonderful home, the weather was certainly far more attractive than Milwaukee.  It was a wonderful professional experience.  I worked very hard on cleaning up the balance sheet, helping to improve profitability and we quickly came to the conclusion that we would either have to buy a cola brand or either get out, and the only cola brand that was available was RC [RC Cola], and for taste purposes and financial reasons, it wasn't attractive, so we started to wind it down and we still had it when I left, but it was in the process of being, being wind down, and I got a call again from the CEO of Philip Morris saying, "We want you to come back to New York [New York]."
Story_ID: 533947
Speaker 1: What are you asked to return to New York [New York] to do?
Speaker 2: It was a big job and I was, I was very, very surprised at the time when I got the call.  It was to come back to New York as a corporate vice president to be, which is the first corporate vice president at Philip Morris Companies, Inc. [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.], to be vice president and treasurer of Philip Morris Companies which at the time was from a profitability point, the seventh largest corporation in the world, and I was to be in charge of all world-wide treasury activities.  You know we do business, we did businesses in every country you can imagine, so I had to manage currencies, I had to manage bank relations, I had to manage pension funds, I had to manage credits revolvers, big, big position.  So when I got it, when I got the call, I called my partner in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne Embry], and I said, you know, I'm not sure this is gonna work, because I am, I have to take this.  I said, "This is a first, there are no African American treasurers in the Fortune 100 and I don't think in the Fortune 500.  It is an opportunity that I have got to do, so I'm gonna be going to New York and with MALCO [MALCO, Inc.], I'll give you as much time as I can, but I can tell you that certainly initially this job is going to consume just all my time," and he said, "No you gotta take it, you gotta do it, and you know if you can make some of the meetings, I'll just hold it down."  Wayne is, Wayne is a super guy, he, we had a great relationship.  So, so we came back to New York in 1984, came back as treasurer of Philip Morris, and it was fantastic.  It was, it was, it was wonderful.
Story_ID: 533948
Speaker 1: Who's also working with you in Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] when you--?
Speaker 2: In terms (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At that time?
Speaker 2: At that time?
Speaker 1: Who were the other officers?
Speaker 2: Hamish Maxwell was the CEO that really brought me back and Hamish had just become, Hamish had just become CEO.  They had just made a change in management, George Weissman had been CEO.  I knew George very, very well.  George was the one who sent me out to Milwaukee [Wisconsin]; he was the one that sent me to St. Louis [Missouri] and then Hamish took George's place, and I had worked with Hamish over the years, he had been president of international [Philip Morris International, Inc.], so I knew Hamish.  I didn't know he knew me that well, but clearly he was very interested in my coming back to New York and the CFO of Philip Morris, I had known, I had developed relationships with him, Hans Storr [Hans G. Storr] was his name.  Hans, Hans' wife [Carol Schoenfeld Storr] was from Milwaukee, and Hans used to come out to Milwaukee on his vacations during the summer and at that time I played a lot of tennis and Hans played tennis.  So I got to know Hans very, very well and when we would have our financial conferences on a world-wide basis, Hans had started to play golf and I had started to play golf so we would always end up in a foursome together, playing golf, so through golf and tennis it's amazing how you really get to know a person.  So he knew me well and I knew him well and I had worked with him in New York.  So both Hamish and Hans had, had, had worked with and knew exactly what they were getting and they were, they were enthusiastic about it and I was too, because what happened, when I came back they said, listen, this is not, this is not, the treasurer's position prior to that had been more or less taking the bankers out to lunch, wining and dining, that kind of thing and they told me it's not gonna be that way.  He said we're gonna make some big moves in this organization.  We're going to buy some companies and you're going to be major player, you're going to have to do the financing for these companies, and you're probably going to have about a year of learning curve, if that much; so you're gonna have to hit the deck running.
Story_ID: 533949
Speaker 1: So I came back in '84 [1984] and in '85 [1985] we made the largest acquisition at the time of any company other than oil companies in the world which was General Foods [General Foods Corporation], and Hamish [Hamish Maxwell] called me up one day and said we're gonna buy General Foods and we gotta raise some money, you got, you got forty-eight hours to raise, I've forgotten the amount, seven billion dollars or something like that, and we were successful.  I called all my banks, I had gotten back and developed my relationships with the banks.  We were able to successfully arrange the financing.  I did the financing for it, then I did the refinancing with the investment banks, and then two years later came back and we said we got another we gotta do.  We bought Kraft [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.] and that was about twelve and a half billion dollars or somewhere in that area.  I did the financing and refinancing for that and then they came back in 1991 and they said we're gonna do Jacobs Suchard [Jacobs Suchard AG] in Switzerland, that's another big one, and we just--then we did another one in Sweden, so during my tenure of treasurer, as treasurer, I must've done financing for pretty close to fifty or sixty billion dollars of companies, all in a short time frame, which dealing with the banks, dealing with management, it was a wonderful experience, wonderful experience.
Speaker 2: And it sounds like it's a satisfying your long-term goal.
Speaker 1: That was it, that was it; I mean it was the right place to be at the right time and it was non-stop, it was non-stop, because you do the acquisition and then once you do the acquisition you have to do the integration of these companies into Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] and you're dealing with all different currencies, you're dealing with the Swiss currency, the Swiss franc, the deutsche mark, you're dealing with the chrono- you're dealing with all the currencies that you got to bring together and how you hedge against the exposure, I mean it was, everything was there.  It was, and again since I was doing the major financing, I, I knew all of the board members, 'cause I had to make presentations to the board.  I attended all of the finance committee meetings of the board.
Speaker 2: Who's on the board?
Speaker 1: We had a tremendous board, John Reed [John S. Reed] who ran Citibank [Citibank, N.A.], Bill Donaldson [William H. Donaldson], who ran the New York Stock Exchange [New York, New York] was on the board, Harold Brown, the former Defense secretary [U.S. Secretary of Defense], Rupert Murdoch came on later on, Dick Parsons [HistoryMaker Richard Parsons] was on the board, Margaret Young [Margaret Buckner Young], I mean it was just a tremendous board and a very, very nice board.  I mean it was, I mean it was a fun place to work, it was a fun place to work.

Speaker 1: Where were you living when you came back to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: I came back to Stamford [Connecticut], before I left I was living in Montclair, New Jersey and when we came back since Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] was right across the street from Grand Central [Grand Central Terminal, New York, New York] we decided we would come to Connecticut, 'cause I could just walk across the street as opposed to the bus, and it was the right move.  We've met some very, very good friends here.  It has, it has a sizeable professional African American population, a lot of corporate people here, so we met a lot of good friends and it's been a wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: And now you're back in New York where you're not allowed to play golf, what do you do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but that's interesting, you're, you're right.  You know I was very disappointed.  I really had the golf bug at this point in time.  When I went to St. Louis [Missouri], I, you know the clubs were closed.  No African Americans in St. Louis, you couldn't get in a club.
Speaker 1: Could you even play for the day perhaps?
Speaker 2: Not in a private club unh-uh, and I lived right across--in St. Louis I lived right across the street from a wonderful club.  Couldn't get in, and then came back to New York, I said well, being treasurer of such a dynamic company, major corporation in the world, shouldn't have a problem, and you have to be sponsored.  You have to have someone sponsor you in these clubs.  So I get back in '84 [1984], I looked around and I said there no, still no African Americans in any of these country clubs, but I said, I shouldn't have a problem.  So I started asking around, particularly the banks, all of the banks belonged, every banker you can imagine belongs to a country club, and I would go on these outings, they would have outings with treasurers of other companies.  They belonged to the club so I said, oh, this shouldn't be a problem at all, and I started to notice there weren't any.  I started asking these treasurers and they said, well we'll see what we can do.  Never hear from them, I started asking the bankers to sponsor me, they would always come up with an excuse.  So I played public courses, played public courses from 1984 to 1988, and in 1988 I happened to play golf with a guy from Golf Digest magazine at Saint Andrews [Saint Andrews Golf Club], Hastings-on-the-Hudson [sic. Hastings-on-Hudson, New York], and we're there playing golf and I said, you know, "Wouldn't mind joining this club," and he said, "Well I'll see what I can do."  I was shocked and I thought I'd never hear, I was sure I'd never hear from him.  Monday morning he said, he called and he said, "I want you to contact such and such a person, and I think it should work," and within two months, I was into Saint Andrews, the first African American member in Saint Andrews and I believe the first African American to join a country club in Westchester County, New York and Fairfield County [Connecticut].  So I joined and then I brought in Darwin Davis [HistoryMaker Darwin N. Davis, Sr.], who was a senior executive at Equitable [AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company], we brought in Ron Gault [HistoryMaker Ronald T. Gault] who was investment banker at First Boston [First Boston Corporation, New York, New York], we brought in Carl Horton who was the CEO of Absolut Vodka.  So we really integrated Saint Andrews, we were the most integrated club in the area.
Story_ID: 533951
Speaker 1: And then what happened in 1991, Shoal Creek [Shoal Creek Golf and Country Club, Shoal Creek, Alabama].  They had this experience at Shoal Creek where they were having a PGA Championship [Professional Golfers' Association] there, and they said they will never, ever have blacks as members and it just exploded, and all of these sponsors and, you know it was fine to have it but when you come out publicly and say it, it's a different thing and all the sponsors started to say we're gonna pull out sponsorship, we're not gonna sponsor this event and then these country clubs started to change their tune and after 1991 I would get calls from just about every club here in the New York metropolitan area wanting to know if I would join, and I said absolutely not, you know, I said Saint Andrews [Saint Andrews Golf Club, Hastings-on-Hudson, New York] was the one that stepped up when I couldn't find anywhere else so I'm gonna stay where I am.  I could have joined you know far better clubs, but I stayed where I was and I had my buddies there, we had a good time, but I was very, very surprised at how clubs were closed in 1984 when I came back to New York.  Now, it's a non-event.  To give you an example, we have, we have eight members, we have nine members at Saint Andrews.  Wykagyl Country Club in New Rochelle [New York] I think have about fifteen.  We have an annual event.  I was the first member at Saint Andrews, [HistoryMaker] Roy Johnson who writes for, used to write for Sports Illustrated was the first member at Wykagyl.  So we have a Lewis-Johnson event once a year and we alternate, we play at Saint Andrews one year, and Wykagyl the next year and we have a cup, a traveling cup when we play each other, African American tournament.  So this Saturday, tomorrow is the tournament, Wykagyl against Saint Andrews.
Speaker 2: And where are you playing this time?
Speaker 1: At Wykagyl in New Rochelle.
Speaker 2: Do you expect to earn the Cup? Do you already have it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, we've won it every year except one.  So we'll do it; Johnny Graves [John C. Graves], Earl's son is a member there, and several other investment bankers, they have a good membership.
Speaker 2: And did, you play golf with Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] also?
Speaker 1: Earl doesn't play, Butch [HistoryMaker Earl "Butch" Graves, Jr.], his son I play with quite a bit and Johnny I play with.  Earl is now beginning to play, but I have not played with Earl.  So now, you know, it's amazing I'm sure, I'm not sure all these guys who belong to these clubs recognize the history in Westchester [Westchester County, New York] and Fairfield [Fairfield County, Connecticut] in 1984.  It wasn't until after Shoal Creek when things really began to open up.
Speaker 2: And do you think that the presence of Tiger Woods has made any difference in the diversity of golf (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I think it has had--
Speaker 2: How?
Speaker 1: I think, I think with Tiger, I'm not sure it's had that much of an influence on opening up country clubs, because I think it started, it was open before he came.  It was beginning to, it had the momentum when he came on the tour, but where he's made the impact, I think is on the young kids.  On the young African American kids and helping the PGA of America [Professional Golfers' Association of America] and the PGA Tour help them to establish these programs for young African American kids.  The First Tee, is his program.  I think he's helped the league to--the Tour and the American, PGA of America to help establish that, so he's had a tremendous impact on bringing in more African Americans' kids and adults as well into the game of golf.
Story_ID: 533952
Speaker 1: How did you become involved with the PGA [Professional Golfers' Association of America]?
Speaker 2: It's interesting, I was, I was at a cocktail party in New York [New York] and I met this guy, and he said, we talked I told him I was very interested in golf and he said, "You know you should be on our advisory board," and I said "Oh I'd love, I would love to do that," and he said, "Well I'll be in touch with you"; because the PGA back until 1960, I mean they didn't have any you know, I mean they had a clause in there, no--only Caucasians you know could be on the PGA.  So I never expected to hear from this guy.  This must've been '88 [1988], '89 [1989].  So two years later he calls me, said, "I'd really like you to come down and talk to the CEO of PGA of America, I want you to go the advisory board."  So I went down, talked to the CEO they liked me, I liked them.  Said, "We know we haven't done things right, we're trying to get them fixed, we need your help.  We've got to diversify the game of golf, we've to have people of color," and I said, "If you're really interested in doing that, I'll be very happy to join you."  So I went on the advisory committee and after two years on the advisory committee they wanted me to come on the board of PG of America and we, I think I was very instrumental in helping them to open up the game of golf for people of color.  One of the things we did was to whenever there's a PGA event, PG of America event, we do, we do four tournaments a year, well not every year, but we have four major tournaments, the Ryder Cup, the PGA Championship, the PGA senior championship [Senior PGA Championship] and the Pro, Pro Championship [PGA Professional Championship].  And one of the things that we've done when I was there, whenever we have these tournaments, we have someone go into the community and say you will have people of color participating in this event if they are marshals or whatever, people of color have got to be involved.  So, and we now have assistant pros who are African Americans where before you didn't have hardly any. They are giving money to minority scholarships so I feel very good about having been a part of that and being on the board and I'm still involved, I'm not on the board, it was a three-year term, but now I chair their investment committee of the PGA of America and we're involved in investing their endowment for the betterment of golf.  So the game of golf, the PGA has, has done a lot in the short timeframe and they had, I knew they had to do it.  It's too many customers, too consumers out there and it's the right thing to do, but prior to that, we didn't-- nobody was involved.
Story_ID: 533953
Speaker 1: And how important is the game of golf to business, to being a corporate executive?
Speaker 2: I think, I think golf is very important.  I think it's another vehicle, another tool that allows you to get exposure to people that you normally wouldn't get exposed to.  I think back over my career, and I've had the opportunity to play golf with the senior executives of Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.], and when you're, when you're out there for somebody for five hours, four hours, four and a half hours on the golf course and you're talking to 'em and you're watching how they react to certain situations, certain shots, you learn a lot about people, and then you come in for cocktails, usually for another hour, so you have, it's a--you get to know a person, very, very well.  So I think it's a, it's a very important tool for you to get, for them to get to know you and you get to know them as well, and I, I encourage all the kids that I run into to get involved in golf.  If not you're gonna be left out, because when everybody else goes to play golf, they're out there talking business and you're somewhere else not knowing what's going on.  So it gives you another avenue in a relaxed kind of environment where they talk pretty freely about different situations.  You get to know a lot about what's going on.  So I think it's, I think it's helpful, I think it's very helpful.
Story_ID: 533954
Speaker 1: Now, you're in New York [New York], how do you make your way towards the CEO position?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In 1997?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was treasurer of the company [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] for thirteen years, and I had gotten to the point where I wanted to run something.  I wanted to run my own show.  So I call the CEO up and I said, "I'd really like to have a few minutes of your time."  He said--
Speaker 1: Is it the same person?
Speaker 2: No, this is a different CEO.  Hamish [Hamish Maxwell] was the CEO who brought me back to New York.  This CEO is Geoff Bible [Geoffrey C. Bible].  Geoff had, Geoff was CEO for about five years, and again I had known Geoff for many years.  Geoff was president of international [Philip Morris International, Inc.] and we had been at different seminars together, so I knew Geoff very well.  Told 'em, I wanna talk to him, and he so I went up, I said, "Geoff you know, I really want to run a company."  I said, "I've done a great job as treasurer, I'm not getting bored but I wanna do something different, and the only thing I want to do different is run and operate the company.  I want to know if I can really do it, I think I can do it but I want a shot at it," and Geoff said, well, talked about why I wanted to do it, what, why I thought I could do it and he said, I must have spent about an hour and half with him talking about it, and he said, "I'll get back to you." and about five months later he called up and he said, "I want you to run the Philip Morris Capital Corporation [Stamford, Connecticut].  I want you to be CEO and president," and it was at 120, it's still at 120 Park Avenue.
Story_ID: 533955
Speaker 1: Philip Morris Capital Corp. [Philip Morris Capital Corporation, Stamford, Connecticut] is, is a financial service company that is engaged in doing leverage leases, financial structured deals, and anything that single, single investor leases, things of that nature.  We compete against GE Capital, they're one of our competitors and sometimes we co-invest with GE Capital.  So for an example of it, American Airlines, American Airlines, Continental [Continental Airlines], you fly Continental, we probably own that plane that you, that you've flown on.  We can use the tax benefits.  Continental might not be able to use it so we'll buy the plane and lease it back to Continental.  We get the tax benefits and make a profit.  So we own airlines for American, airplanes for American, United [United Airlines], Continental, U.S. Airways, we must, we must own about thirty something planes.  We also own real estate, cold generation facilities, manufacturing facilities, anything that you can put a lease on and lease it back, and when I went there we must have had assets of about seven billion [dollars], by the time I left it must have been about nineteen [nineteen billion dollars], tremendous growth and Geoff [Geoffrey C. Bible] said, one thing I want to do is want to grow this business.  He said, "The business has been very good for Philip Morris, but it think it has greater potential, so I want you to really go up, go in there, I want you to grow the business, look at acquisitions if you want to expand it, it's your show, you run it."  So I was able to double their margins, I doubled the profits, and after, after being there for two years, Geoff called me up, CEO, said, "We're very pleased with your performance at the Capital Corp.  I want you to join their management committee, of Altria [Altria Group, Inc.]," which is now the old, which the new name for Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.].  "I want you to join the management committee of the parent company."  So I became a member of the management committee of Philip, of Altria.  There were about six or seven of us of the top executives in the company that were involved, that were on the management committee, and the management committee really helped run the total corporation.
Speaker 2: Who else was on that committee?
Speaker 1: The president of domestic cigarettes, the president of the international operation [Philip Morris International, Inc.].  At the time we had Miller [Miller Brewing Company], the president of Miller, the president of Kraft [Kraft Food Group, Inc.], and the CFO and the general counsel.
Story_ID: 533956
Speaker 1: So, any more tobacco, which is Philip Morris' [Philip Morris USA] main product, has become very controversial.  There's been a lot of litigation against Philip Morris also.  How's that impacted the company's brand name and--can you hear me?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, and what do you think about the awards that have been made and some of that litigation?  Has it been fair?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I think that the company is still doing well.  My position on the company that it is, I think the industry's gone a long way, you know we, we the industry does not advertise in certain magazines, there's nothing on TV.  They support anti-smoking ads, so you know I think the industry's come a long way.  It think that it is still a legal product and as long as it's a legal product, I think it should have the right to market their products and earn a fair return.  I think on the legal side, I think that we've been very successful on the legal side, and people have a choice.  So it comes down to choice, if you like to smoke you recognize the dangers, it's your choice and that's it.  So, you know I still look at it as, as a great company, I think it has great people working for it and you know it's been, it's been a great stock and it's been, it's been great being a part of it.
Story_ID: 533957
Speaker 1: You said that you joined the management committee of the parent company [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] when you were, after several years of being president and CEO of Philip Morris Capital Corporation [Stamford, Connecticut].  Did you do anything else besides join that committee that you want to tell us about a CEO in relationship to the parent company?
Speaker 2: No, none other than just the fact that we were, during my tenure, we were very, very successful, as I said the profitability increased.
Speaker 1: What are some of the choices you made in order in order to make that profit increase?
Speaker 2: We looked at different product lines.  One of the, one of the things I felt strongly about is that we just should not be a domestic U.S. company, and when I went into the organization I thought there was great potential internationally, which we had not tapped before.  So I set up an operation company in Europe, in Germany and in Switzerland and we were able to do quite a bit of business on the international side that we had not done before.  We also invested in different kinds of structures that we had not done before.  There were several new products that we considered.  So we did break ground in several ways that, that old management had not done and I feel very pleased about it.
Speaker 1: We talked about what brands were most popular in the '70s [1970] with Philip Morris, obviously, still tobacco, but what brands are most prominent today?
Speaker 2: Still the same old brands yeah (laughter), they have staying power and they are well-known on a world-wide basis.  People recognize them very well.  You know, if you, if you look at the well-known brand names in the world that keep coming up from the old times, Coca Cola [The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, Georgia], Marlboro, always McDonalds, are world-wide recognizable brands, they've been that way for years and still are so Marlboro still falls in that category.
Story_ID: 533958
Speaker 1: Did becoming president and CEO of Philip Morris Capital Corporation [Stamford, Connecticut] satisfy your goal of becoming CFO of a major corporation?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or was it better?
Speaker 2: No, it was clearly, I felt it was--it helped me achieve my objective, and I was very happy with the way it ended, and when I left my CEO said, "You don't want to do this, you don't want to leave," and he was shocked that I had come to that decision, but I, my wife [Lillian Glenn Lewis] and I had discussed it when I was fifty-eight and I told her at sixty I'm coming out, I wanna retire and she said, "I don't believe it," but I felt there were some things I wanted to do, and that I had a very successful career.  It was now time for me to step out and do some things differently, did different things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What other, what other things are you going to do besides golf (laughter), which we can assume that you are going to do?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well you know when I retired, I had too much on my plate.  I retired because I wanted to control my own schedule.  I was, when I was working I was always on an airplane, I was in a different country, a different time zone, I was going to dinner, I was doing this.  I just didn't have any time for myself and I really wanted to step back and do whatever I wanted to do.  Primarily I wanted to do, I wanted to see how low I could get my handicap down, and I just wanted to have some free time to just do whatever I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 533959
Speaker 1: So when I retired, I think my wife [Lillian Glenn Lewis] was concerned, you know how was I gonna spend my time, but when I retired I was on three corporate boards.  I was on Wachovia's [Wachovia Corporation; Wells Fargo and Company] board, I was on Ceridian's [Ceridian HCM, Inc.] board, Ceridian is a New York Stock Exchange [New York, New York] company that's engaged in human resource systems, outsourcing systems, located in Minneapolis [Minnesota].  Kemper insurance [Kemper Corporation] board which is located in Chicago [Illinois] and for Kemper and for Ceridian, I chair the audit committees for those companies and with some of the new regulations, Sarbanes-Oxley [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002], audit committees have been very, very busy, so I was on Wachovia's board, Ceridian's board, Kemper's board.  I was on the board of two universities: Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia], Iona College [New Rochelle, New York].  I chaired the investment committee of PG of America [Professional Golfers' Association of America] and I was also doing some community work, so I, you know it got to the point after I retired, I just, I just had too many things.  I just could not find time to play golf.  So, Wachovia, First Union [First Union Corporation] and Wachovia came together so I elected to go off of that board, and then I told the president of Hampton, I had been on Hampton's board for sixteen years and Bill Harvey [HistoryMaker William Harvey] was president, great institution the college has done exceptionally well and at Hampton I was chair of the investment committee and just really involved in the school that consumed a lot time.  I told Bill, I said you know, "I think sixteen years is enough time, you should get new blood on the board."  He said, "Okay, I won't get upset if you promise to come back on," and I said, "Well I can't promise you that I'll come back on but I'm here if you need me."  So I resigned from Hampton's board and Bill has been trying to get me to come back on, but Bill and I talk quite a bit and the school is doing very, very well.
Speaker 2: Who did you serve on that board with, or who, who were some of the other members that have been boards during that sixteen year period?
Speaker 1: Let's see, who's on that board that, Roger Enrico who is president and CEO of Pepsi [PepsiCo]; Dr. Ellison [ph.] who, who I've forgotten what his position was, the former president and CEO of Celanese [Celanese Corporation]; several doctors, several architects.  It was a good board, good board, we had, we must've had about twenty, about twenty people on the board.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, it was a good board and it was a good experience.  So I told Bill, I said, "I'm here if you want to, anytime you need me," and as I said we talk quite a bit and I see Bill at different social functions and the institution is doing very well.  Iona I was on for about three years, and I told the president, I said you know my time is just getting jammed up. I just, I just want more time for myself.
Story_ID: 533960
Speaker 1: So now I have my schedule at least to a manageable level and I play a fair amount of golf.  I have not reached my goal yet, you know, I did reach my primary goal.  My primary goal was to get the single digit handicap.  So I've gotten as low as an eight, now my goal is to get a little bit lower and I thoroughly enjoy the game, I enjoy the people that I play with, and we travel, we travel.  My wife [Lillian Glenn Lewis] and I travel quite a bit and we thoroughly enjoy the grandkids.  We have three grandkids [Satchel Lee, Jackson Lee, and Conner Elligan], so we spend a lot of time with them and this summer was great because my grandson is ten years old.  He and I went to golf camp together for a week, so it's, it's retirement is really allowing me to do whatever I want to do whenever I want to do it and I feel that, you know, I've, I've contributed a lot, you know I've been a lot of non-profit boards, you know I was on the National Urban League in the past.  I've been involved with the minority banks and you know (unclear) the National Bankers committee [National Bankers Association] advisory committee, I've been involved with a lot of minority organizations, so you know I feel I've contributed and I still get involved, but not to the extent that I used to get involved.  So I'm just having a great time.
Story_ID: 533961
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about your family a bit more.  Your daughter Tonya [HistoryMaker Tonya Lewis Lee] is married to Spike Lee?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they have, do they have two children (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two [Satchel Lee and Jackson Lee], yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then your other daughter has one?
Speaker 2: One [Conner Elligan].
Speaker 1: Could you tell us a little bit about being married to Spike Lee and bringing him into your family (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, he's great!
Speaker 1: How did he and your daughter meet?
Speaker 2: Actually, again I can thank Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] for that.  It was at the time when I was, I think I was doing the financing for Kraft [Kraft Foods Group Inc.] and it was during the Black Caucus [Congressional Black Caucus] weekend which I always attended, and I was scheduled to go to the activities, and since we were buying Kraft I wasn't able to make it and Tonya, my daughter as practicing law in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]  She was working for a law firm, major law firm in Washington, D.C. and my other daughter, Tracey [Tracey Lewis-Elligan] was, I think Tracey was a senior at Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia] at the time.  So I called Tonya up and I said, "I can't make it to the Caucus, I'm busy with work, so maybe you and Tracey can go and represent me, represent Philip Morris."  So she said, "Oh, that'd be great."  I said, "Well call Tracey and the two of you just hook up and go the Caucus," so they did and I get this call from Tracey the next day saying interesting developments.  So I said what happened, she said, "Well Tonya at the Caucus had gotten up to go to make a phone call, she was going up the escalators to make a phone call and Spike Lee was coming down and the next thing she knew he had turned around and had come back up, and was asking Tonya for her phone number, and she had not, she resisted."  So I said, "Oh that's interesting," so she said, "Well you haven't heard the best part about it.  The next thing we know he and his entourage show up at our table and again, wants to have her phone number."  So, she said, 'Well I'm not going to give you my home phone but I'll give you where I work.'"  So she told him where she worked and then he said, "Well why don't we have dinner or lunch."  She said, "I don't think so," and then he started sending roses, roses every day to the office.  So she said you just gotta stop sending these roses (laughter), and so she finally agreed to have, have lunch and the relationship developed.  He's just been a wonderful son-in-law, we get along very well.  We all spend a lot of time together, just about, well every holiday the family is together and they both are very busy but they seem to do a great job of balancing their schedules and the kids are doing well, so it's worked out very well.  You know it's been great.
Story_ID: 533962
Speaker 1: So your daughter was practicing corporate law initially and then it seems that after she met Spike [Spike Lee] she sort of expanded into more of her creative side. She's written a book, actually a children's book and a novel.  Did you have any resistance to that shift, but similar perhaps to your parents [Edith Toulson Lewis and Spencer H. Lewis], or were you more open to your daughter doing both the big business and perhaps something more creative?
Speaker 2: No, I, with both of my daughters I told them that they should like what they're doing, they should love what they're doing, and you know if you find something that you like doing, that's what you should do, and I think she enjoyed law, but I think she's always been on the creative side.  You know she went to Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York] which is a very artsy, creative kind of environment and she writes very well, she always was a good writer and you know I wasn't sure if she would stay with law, but it's a good discipline for whatever you want to do, and you know I'm just very happy with what she's been able to achieve and she's doing a lot of great stuff on the writing side, on the producing side, always got a project going.  I just keep telling her sometimes you gotta calm down, don't get too much on your plate.  She does a great job of balancing work and raising the kids, and we just, we seem them a lot, it's very nice having them close by 'cause we can run in the city and they can come out so it's worked out very, very well.
Speaker 1: What does your daughter Tracey [Tracey Lewis-Elligan] do?  Is she in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes, she's in Chicago, she's a college professor.  We call her Dr. Tracey (laughter).  She teaches at DePaul [DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois] and she has, we have a grandson, Conner [Connor Elligan], Conner is, he's going on eighteen months old I think, so he's walking and she's married to a psychologist [Don Elligan] and he has a private practice and he also teaches at the college level, so both of them have done very well, they have a wonderful home in the South Loop in Chicago and we are spending much more time in Chicago these days.  I used to travel in and out of Chicago, but I never got a chance to see it and since Tracey has been out there we spend quite a bit of time--it's a wonderful city, it really is a wonderful city and we enjoy it.  In fact, my wife [Lillian Glenn Lewis] has spent a lot of time, she's going out next week for four or five days with Conner so, they both are doing, both of the girls are doing very, very well.
Speaker 1: And let's hear the names of Tonya [HistoryMaker Tonya Lewis Lee] and Spike's two children.
Speaker 2: Satchel [Satchel Lee] is the girl, Jackson [Jackson Lee] is the boy.
Speaker 1: And what are their ages now?
Speaker 2: Satchel is twelve and Jackson is ten.  Satchel is approaching that teenage (laughter) level, you know and I keep telling Tonya, it's gonna be very interesting (laughter) and as a grandparent you can sit back and just watch and say, oh, that's nice you know.  So, that, they're all doing a great job, great kids they really are.

Speaker 1: So the last thing I'd like to ask you about are a couple of the awards that you've won, and I was hoping that you would tell us a little bit about the award, about your experience and for the first, the CNN Trumpet Tower of Power Award, I was hoping you would talk a little bit about that experience and the others who were honored with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I got that award in think in 2000 I think it was 2002 and it was in recognition of having achieved at a high level in Corporate America and it was a great event.  Receiving that award with me was Earl, Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.], Ann Fudge [Ann M. Fudge]--
Speaker 1: Well I have a list of the people, but perhaps you could just talk a bit about each of them.  So I have [HistoryMaker] Tracey Edmonds, Ann Fudge, [HistoryMaker] Debra Lee, Earl Graves, Richard "Dick" Parsons [HistoryMaker Richard Parsons], [HistoryMaker] Linda Johnson Rice and Lloyd Ward.
Speaker 2: Yep, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Earl Graves is a good friend?
Speaker 2: Yep, know Earl very well, we've been good friends well for the last twenty years.  Earl and Barbara [Barbara Kydd Graves] are very good dear friends of ours and it's interesting that I've gotten to know Earl's kids very well, you know as I play golf with Butch [HistoryMaker Earl "Butch" Graves, Jr.] and Johnny [Johnny Graves] and they've done a wonderful job of raising their kids.  The boys are just fantastic, and Earl's just done a tremendous job in his company [Black Enterprise], they're, they're just wonderful people, so I see Earl quite a bit and we have some good times and he's done a wonderful job.
Speaker 1: And then Ann Fudge was executive vice president of Kraft Foods [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Yep, know Ann very well and Ann and I talk quite a bit from time-to-time.  I saw Ann this summer and she's now retired, and she, she moved from Connecticut to Boston [Massachusetts].  She's living in Boston, and she has a home in, up on the Cape [Cape Cod, Massachusetts].  So we keep in touch and she's on, when I say retired from Corporate America but she's still on several corporate boards and she's doing a lot of non-profit type work and she's also enjoying being a grandmother, as well.  So Ann is doing it, she's just having a good time.
Speaker 1: And then how about Dick Parsons?
Speaker 2: Dick I know very well.  Dick was on our board and I see Dick occasionally.  I think the last time, I think I saw Dick about six months ago and I read about him in the paper quite a bit with Time Warner [Time Warner, Inc.] he's got his hands full, but Dick handles it exceptionally well, he's just a brilliant guy and as a board member, just made a fantastic contribution to Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] and I'm just, I'm just curious as to what he's gonna do in his next life.
Speaker 1: Do you think he'll (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think, I don't think he's gonna retire.  I think we're gonna see a lot more of Dick Parsons, I really do.  He's got so much going for him.

Speaker 1: And then you also received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Jackie Robinson Foundation and there you were honored with Clifton Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], Darwin Davis [HistoryMaker Darwin N. Davis, Sr.], Lee Archer, [HistoryMaker] James Avery and I guess the presenter was [HistoryMaker] Danny Glover.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah that was a fun evening and it was very special to me 'cause my wife [Lillian Glenn Lewis] has been involved with the Jackie Robinson Foundation for probably twenty years, and of those twenty years she chaired the selection committee for Connecticut so she loves the Jackie Robinson Foundation, she spends a lot of time with it so for me to, to achieve this award from it, it was very, very special to me and then to be among such a distinguished group, 'cause Cliff Wharton was someone who I always looked up to, you know, he, when I was coming along, Cliff was one of the few guys that was out there.  He was on, he was on corporate boards probably before any other African American that I can think of.  I can remember when he was on the board of Ford [Ford Motor Company], and he was on several other boards and I've told Cliff, I said I really admired you, I look up to you and you are, you've paid your dues, and you've really paved the way for many of us, just a great guy.  I don't see him as much as I'd like to see him but we do hook up once and a while.  Darwin was a dear, dear friend of mine.  In fact, he was my neighbor for thirteen years.  Before we moved to this house we had a house right next to Darwin and we used to ride the train together every morning.  We played golf every weekend and he was a very unique person.  He had a tremendous personality, great interpersonal skills, everybody knew him and I really miss him, he passed away, I guess almost two years now, time flies, but I really do, just a super human being, and the other member, Lee Archer, whom I've known for many years and I see Lee on TV probably more than I see him in person with the Tuskegee, Tuskegee Airmen and he's, he's doing very, very well.  He continues to be involved, and you know, I'm trying to think.  I'm trying to think, I think I've seen, I think I saw Lee about a year ago.  I haven't seen him in the past year, but I understand that he's doing very, very well, yeah, that was a fun evening, that was a fun evening.

Speaker 1: Is there anything that we haven't talked about today that I should be asking you about?
Speaker 2: No, I think that when I, when I look back at it, I think that clearly African Americans have come a long way in Corporate America.  I think that the playing field is still probably not level, but it's gotten a little bit flatter, but we still, we've got CEOs now of top corporations, we have CFOs, we have treasurers.  We have African Americans in just about every position you can think of, but, but we still don't have them there in numbers and I think that we just have to keep, keep working at it.  We have to keep the heat on these corporations to make sure that the playing field is, is level and I also feel that those who are in Corporate America have to step back and think about their role in bringing others along.  Certainly when we were in Corporate America that was one of the primary things that we thought about and now I think they have to, they've been able to achieve some success, they have to reach back and bring some along as well.

Speaker 1: So do you think the black executive will ever be as recognizable as perhaps the black musician or the black sport star?
Speaker 2: I think so, I think that over time we'll get there 'cause I think that, I think that those who have gotten into these positions currently are doing a great job.  I think Ken [Kenneth Chenault] is just doing a super job.  I think Dick [HistoryMaker Richard Parsons] is doing a great job.  Stan is doing a great job and they are paving the way for others to come.
Speaker 1: Stanley is at Equitable Life [sic.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Stanley O'Neal at Merrill.
Speaker 1: Merrill Lynch [Merrill Lynch and Co., Inc.; Merrill Lynch Wealth Management].
Speaker 2: Merrill Lynch, so you know these guys are really paving the way for others and I think that, that you will see more of 'em.  I think just like when I came along and looked at Wall Street [New York, New York], there weren't a lot of African Americans on Wall Street, you find quite a few managing directors, other positions in Wall Street, superstars doing very well.  So I'm very encouraged I think you're gonna see much more of it, but it is not going to be easy, it's not gonna happen overnight, but it will come.

Speaker 1: And finally after you finish your second life now that you have commenced upon it, ultimately what would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I just, I, I would just like to be remembered as giving it all, gave it the best shot and hope that I opened some doors for some other people, and made life easier for them, and that would be it.
Speaker 1: We really appreciate you taking the time to talk with us today.
Speaker 2: You're perfectly welcome.
