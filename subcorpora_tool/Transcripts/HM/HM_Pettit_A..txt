Story_ID: 220408
Speaker 1: Now, if you would, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [A. Dwight] Pettit, let's talk a little bit about your mother, starting with her name and where she was born and where she grew up, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Mildred Henry Louise Miller Pettit.  She was born in a small town, again, the same place that I was, Rutherfordton, North Carolina, and that's basically where she grew up.  She met my father [George Pettit] while she was a teenager in Rutherfordton and they married early and they moved to Greensboro, North Carolina, where she worked as a beautician.  She was a beautician by profession; or is, rather.
Speaker 1: And did your mother--did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, she, sort is of the baby or close to being the baby in a large family, I think, of something like nine girls and two boys, and she seemed to have a pretty normal, well-adjusted family life.  Her father [Garland Miller] wasn't the most stable person, but her mother [Hattie Miller] was a very strong figure, as I gathered, in the household.  When I see her father, I don't think the father was the rock of the family.  I think, in her instance, it was her mother.
Speaker 1: And, what was it like in Rutherfordton?  Does she ever talk about that?  Like, you know, what kinds of things she did as a little girl, like the times, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: No, my mother doesn't spend too much time on her childhood.  Not like my father does, or did.  She and her sisters were very close, because I ended up being the first born in both families, even though my mother wasn't the oldest, nor was my father.  As a result, my mother's sisters became, all became, instead of my aunts they became my mothers, so I had all of these mother figures in my life and it was a very strong, very close family.  She lost her, one of her brothers at a young age, because I remember going to the funeral when I guess I was seven or eight years old, and it was a very difficult thing for me because they kept the body in the house, in the living room, and I was sleeping in the bedroom with my mother and you could see the body there all night, so it wasn't a night that I could really sleep and I remember that, and her other brother, she was very close to.  She wasn't that close to this brother.  He was sort of the heavy around the house, sort of very much even in combat with his father and what have you.  He was like the, more or less, the disruptive or the problem.  As I can understand, my mother and all the other girls had to hide from this big brother who had come home inebriated and what have you, and sort of terrorized the family, and so that was one of the things I recall from her early childhood, that it was this thing with J.T. that kept folks hiding under the steps and what have you.  So, his funeral, well I don't know whether it was a very sad occasion, but her other brother, my Uncle Lonnie [Miller], she was very close to in the family.  My Aunt Emma, my Aunt Irene, my Aunt Flora [Florence], all of them were very, very close, very close family, and they had a very strong family grouping in her early years, as I understand it.
Story_ID: 220409
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother [Mildred Miller Pettit]?
Speaker 2: My mother is a very, very strong woman.  She had to be to deal with my father [George Pettit], all those years.  And not only that, but I began to see as an adult she might have been more, even though my father was brilliant, an engineer, and doing all kinds of things.  My mother was sort of the rock that held the family together, and not only with that but I began to find that my mother was probably what gave me the attributes also to being an entrepreneur, because my mother now, pushing eighty years old, is still just as aggressive (laughter) and money conscious and very much a negotiator, and so a lot of those traits that I really didn't see thinking that my father was the total center of the universe in terms of my family, I began to find later on that it was probably my mother who, not only shared but was maybe 60 to 70 percent of us being a family.
Story_ID: 220410
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father now, starting with his name, where he was born and where he grew up.
Speaker 2: George David Pettit, and born in Sylver, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Like the color, Sylver?
Speaker 2: I think it's with an S-Y, L-V-E-R, [sic. Sylva, North Carolina] and we grew up in a place which is still quite historical, it's right there by the Rocky Mountains [sic. Smoky Mountains], right on the border, I think, of North Carolina.  I think it borders southern North Carolina, and it's on the very southern part of the state, the Rocky Mountains, and it's very close to the Tennessee border.  That's what I was tryin' for.  And, we have a thing, remember Walton's Mountain [Virginia]?  We have a thing in North Carolina, it's just about like "Pettit's Mountain," and even though my father and all of my uncles except one, and one aunt, they're all deceased at this point, and we still own that mountain, and in fact we leased that mountain out, one of my uncles who is surviving.  He does manage it and he leases that mountain out for campers, and so forth.  It's right on the Cherokee reservation and so, in fact, my great-grandmother is full Cherokee [Native American] and they grew up, and my father and his ten brothers and his one sister, they grew up on this huge mountain with the river and the swinging bridge across the river.  I mean it's so gorgeous and so classic and so my father, grandfather [Abraham Pettit] being a preacher, so they had an opportunity to grow up in this wooded, mountainous splendor and, in fact, a lot of my family is buried at the top of that mountain, and when you come up that mountain after going through all the hills of North Carolina and you get there and you just wind and it's almost like a straight shot going up and you just wind up to the top of that mountain. And so my father was sort of the dominant member of the family, even though he wasn't the first born.  He grew up, as I understand, a very brash, aggressive independent child who the family sort of gave a wide berth and so there is a lot of respect (laughter).  I described it very extensively in some of my writings.  He is a profile unto himself.
Speaker 1: And, did he ever share any stories with you about growing up on the mountain?
Speaker 2: Everybody shares stories about George.  I mean, George is the family icon.  There are stories about when George got thrown in the river, when he had his leg broken and by this guy who just picked on all the kids and how my father grew up and came back and found him one day messing with the kids in a marble game and did certain things to him and threw him in the river (laughter).  He was, my father was this child who was legendary.  All the uncles have George stories.  George was, as they used to say it and I've coined, I've used this expression and Muhammad Ali coined it, I think, in the old slave days when they talk about, I think they talk about certain black men who were very independent, very arrogant and are very aggressive, and so they sort of labelled those people bad niggers.  And so, even in my book ['Under Color of Law,' A. Dwight Pettit] when I talk about this, I label my father as truly one of those people that had been described in black history as a bad nigger and he just was totally walking to a different drumbeat, totally independent, totally confident, totally arrogant, I'll put it to you like this.  I've been around athletes, I've been around great people, I've been around regular people, I've been around street people.  He is truly one of the, I would say, most arrogant, toughest, non-fearing black men I've ever met.  I've never seen him afraid of anything.
Story_ID: 220411
Speaker 1: Well actually let's talk a little bit about your family origin.  You talked a little bit about your great-grandmother being full Cherokee [Native American].  How far back can you trace your family origin on both sides?
Speaker 2: I basically have done not the research, but in family funerals, which we've had quite a few, they've taken me back basically to my great-grandparents and I haven't really taken the opportunity to go back beyond that, but I have taped a couple of my uncles in terms of, and I've done most of this, I might say, on my father's [George Pettit] side.  Because of my writings, my father's side is where I have spent the most of the concentration.
Speaker 1: And so, well, what do you know about your mother's [Mildred Miller Pettit] side?  You said you go back to your great, great-grandparents.  Do you know if they were free people, if they were slaves, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Not in detail enough to really articulate about it.  My mother is very, very sketchy.  She has never really talked much about it, nor did her family go back in terms of history.  Most of the history that I have received has been on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your grandparents.  Did you have the opportunity to spend a lot of time with them?
Speaker 2: No.  I--that's why I'm skep--that's why I have this lack of knowledge.  I never spent, I only recall spending like four years of my life, maybe up to five years in North Carolina.  Then my parents, my father came to Baltimore, Maryland.  So, really I grew up in Baltimore.  So, the only time I saw my grandparents on my father's side [Nina Pettit and Abraham Pettit] or my mother's side [Hattie Miller and Garland Miller], when we take that once a year trip down south.  (Laughter) But I do have very fond memories of my grandparents on my father's side, and my grandmother on my mother's side; again, I never spent too much time with Garland on my mother's side.  But my grandfather was a very stately man.
Speaker 1: What was his name, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [A. Dwight] Pettit?
Speaker 2: Abraham.  And, he was a very stately man, who was a minister and highly revered in the community; in fact, when we buried him not only was the procession long, but all the folks, and particularly in this town there are not a lot of black folks, mostly white folks and the white folks, everybody lowered their flags at half-mast.  They were standing all along the, I was just, I was over powered, all along the funeral route.  It was very interesting to see a black man in the South who had attained that type of respect and raised those boys up on the mountain, and the one girl (laughter), but when I would go there as a child, we'd always, the first thing we did in my family was (unclear) and I do remember being with him, but his closeness was more so to my father, his boys.  I don't ever remember he and I, or him, or there were never any grandchildren there, because I was always the oldest.  Like I said, I was the oldest in both families, even thought my parents weren't the first born.  So, I didn't have an estranged, I didn't have a removed relationship with him, but I don't remember, (unclear) my father did with my children.  Now, my grandmother was very interested in that and my grandfather looked like a white man and my grandmother is jet black, and so my grandmother, when I would get to, we'd always stop at my father's home first, I'm sorry, my mother's home first, so when I'd get, and my mother's parents, my grandfather looked, again, like a white man.  My grandmother was sort of light brown.  But, when we would get to my grand--my father's home in Sylva [North Carolina], my grandmother would always make these heavy remarks about--didn't wanna come see me, did you?  Didn't wanna come see your black grandma!  (Laughter) Wanna stay out there with your white grandma!  I would get so perturbed about this 'cause she would just make this judgment (laughter) because I was light skinned and in my family, my uncle's about 50/50 dark, middle, my father's light brown skinned, my mother's light complexioned.  But, I just always felt that she'd make these divisive conclusory remarks about me when I hadn't done anything to justify that, and so it was very interesting, first I've got a little anecdote to tell you.  When my grandmother was on her dying bed and I brought my, my wife [Barbara Pettit] and I came home along with the rest of the family, and my wife, like her, is very dark and chocolate, black and she looked up at me and she said, "I'll be darned.  There's that ol' Dwight Pettit."  Well, everybody was standing around her bed and she was just so dramatized that my wife was her complexion she actually said "I guess I was wrong about that boy!" (Laughter) And so, those are some of the things that I remember about her and him.
Speaker 1: And what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Nina.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that?
Speaker 2: N-I-N-A.
Story_ID: 220412
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [A. Dwight] Pettit, tell me, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I think my earliest memory was my mother [Mildred Miller Pettit] had a beauty shop in A&T [Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] and my father [George Pettit] and I, my father was a senior in 1949, and he was graduating in 1949, and I had vague memories of being the first graduate.  My father and I graduated at the same time from A&T College, later A & T University.  My father graduated from the school of engineering and I was the first to graduate from the nursery school, and so I remember my father carrying me all around.  He was known as the man that always carried his little boy with him, and I remember my father, and being in the car with him and going to classes.  I remember all the little girls, college girls at the time running up about the pretty little baby.  I guess I was three, four years old, and I remember he also had a night club called the South Side Tavern [Greensboro, North Carolina] that he and my Uncle Argel operated together.  And I always remember that my daddy was like the bouncer as well as the owner, but I could never seem like, and he let me work the tables and I could serve beer.  I got a beating one night when I turned this beer over to one lady I was serving and my father was like, and then afterwards he came by and said he was sorry and I was sitting in the corner, and he said, "You still my boy?  I said, "Yeah, Daddy, I'm still your boy."  And so we had that type of close relationship, but one of the things I remember, every Friday night it seemed like he threw somebody through the plate glass window, and I always wondered to myself, why didn't he open the door and throw them out the door!  (Laughter) Plus every night we had this big glass window at the bar and it was the South Side Tavern and it seems like every Friday or Saturday night, he would throw somebody through that window.  Somebody would get drunk, be beating his wife, or be disruptive and my father would grab him by the top of the neck and by the belt, and there he goes, through that window (laughter).
Story_ID: 220413
Speaker 1: Was your father [George Pettit] a big man in stature?
Speaker 2: In that time, right.  He was, he had been in the [U.S.] military and the military intercedes with all of 'em at that age, 'cause this is in the 1940s, of course.  All of them came out of school and did the military thing.  But he was a good 6'1", solid 190 pounds, which was a good-sized man at that time.  And, he had boxed in the C.C. [(CCC) Civilian Conservation Corps] camp.  In fact, all of my uncles in some kind of way were athletes, boxers, and fighters and what have you, football and what have you.  So, I came up in a very masculine sports, big men, who, and I was the only child, and since I was the oldest of the children, I grew up in this very physical, playful atmosphere, being around my uncles.  My boxing and everything was just part of the family tradition.  We'd get together on picnics, that's what we did, athletics (laughter).
Story_ID: 220414
Speaker 1: One thing I want to ask you, just out of curiosity, did your aunt ever have any good stories, or even your father [George Pettit] and your uncles, about this one girl growing up in a family of ten boys?
Speaker 2: Well Dorothy Mae seemed, and she's still one of the remaining people too, she's still alive, but she seemed to be such a rock and such and independent spirit.  In fact, she's a professor still.  I think she's in her eighties and she still teaches in some capacity, 'cause she's always writing me or calling me about family notes or what have you.  So, I think she was able to handle herself, both in an academic environment as well as the family environment.  I remember her, when you talk about my earliest, going back to the last question, I remember her very vividly, as one of the first things that I remember as a child, because my father did not like her selection for a husband, her fiancee, and several things that I remember in those days, if you went to the beauty shop, laying around were comic books where my mother [Mildred Miller Pettit] worked, because we had a man in Greensboro [North Carolina] called Boss Webster, who owned the facility where my mother did hair, and he gave me the run of the place, and so I had comic books galore, I'd read all the time.  If I wasn't reading, I guess I was looking at pictures, and I remember Boss Webster, and my mother, and I remember always, my mother always had a switch for me.  I wore these little short pants.  I always had to go get my own switch.  I tell judges now a days, if the child abuse statutes that they have today were applicable then, my mother and father both would still be under the chair (laughter) all the switches and the welts that I had on my legs, but then I was always doin' something.  Her, my father's best friend who turned out to be one of the biggest lawyers at Greensboro, his son was Michael Lee [ph.].  He was, his mother was also a beautician, so we were at the beauty shop together all day long at four and five years old, and so those are the days I remember.  But going back to Dorothy Mae, my aunt, my father didn't like this fiancee, and so like everything else, my father took him to task, and I think they got into a shoving match with my father.  He probably threw him around a little bit and before he accepted him into the family, and it was just one of those situations, I think, where my father had to fight his sister as well as the fiancee.  He sort of lived with this or something like that, but like everybody, everybody had their confrontation with George.
Story_ID: 220415
Speaker 1: What precipitated the move to Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Well, my dad [George Pettit], by graduating from A&T [Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], he taught for a year at the university, although I don't think it was the university then, it was North Carolina College.  He taught engineering and then I think, of course, he was out of the [U.S.] military, but he still, I guess had connections to the military.  He was hired by Fort Holabird in Baltimore County [Maryland], as I think at the time he was probably the first black engineer hired in the State of Maryland by the federal government.  And so, we came here and not only that, but he had, his brothers had migrated to Baltimore and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and so he had family.  He had the "Petty" boys, like, they didn't call them the Pettit boys; down south they it was like the "Petty" boys.  The "Petty" boys had come north.  I think we have one in Newport News [Virginia], maybe four in Philadelphia, and about four of them here, so that would have been about eight or about nine.  One was killed in the war [World War II, WWII].
Story_ID: 220416
Speaker 1: Can you kinda tell us a little bit about what holidays were like in your family and special occasions?  What were those times like in your family?
Speaker 2: Well, I alluded to that earlier by saying my family, whether we lived in Baltimore [Maryland] or whether we lived in Turner Station [Maryland], which is a county area of Baltimore, we were like always at my house, all the big gatherings, and especially when we moved to Aberdeen [Maryland], because we had a big place land wise, and it was in between Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and Baltimore, so my house, not only was my father [George Pettit] the leader of the family, but his house was always logistically acceptable to everybody for the family meetings, for the decision making meetings of the brothers and my aunt [Dorothy Mae], of course, and her husband who turned out to be a great member of the family.  And, it was always a big picnic, plenty of food, all the families and as they got older, the kids, and there was an athlete, it was a major athletic event; boxing was always on the menu.  It was always on schedule (laughter).  I knew I was gonna, you know, my Uncle Hayes, for example, he was supposed to be the big boxer down at the--he was a longshoreman.  They called him like the heavyweight champion of the union and the longshoremen, I can't think of the name of it right now, but in Baltimore, there's a name for 'em, but I'm having a mental block on that.  But, my Uncle John had boxed in the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] and had boxed in college, my Uncle Argel was one of the champions in the CIAA [Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association] in terms of boxing, and there were a couple more that were very athletic and so it was always like the Olympics, "Let the games begin!"  (Laughter) Soon as everybody had a couple beers and all the women would be at the picnic tables, the competition would start.  (Laughter)  And so, for me as a young man it was great, because I had tremendous learning advantage over other kids, and in those days being light skinned with freckles, it was very good that I learned how to fight very quickly, (laughter) while by the time I was growing up in that atmosphere, I thought, before I saw Muhammad Ali, I thought I was Muhammad Ali (laughter)!
Story_ID: 220417
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your street, do you remember the name of the street that you lived on in your community?  Can you kind of describe it for us?
Speaker 2: Well, that begins to take shape.  We lived right across the base, from the base where my dad [George Pettit] works, that's Fort Holabird [Baltimore County, Maryland], and it was an area called Dundalk [Maryland], but we lived there about two years, and I think it was Piper Court [Maryland], and then we moved to what is called today a very historic place, Turner Station [Dundalk, Maryland], and at that time, Turner Station was so historic because of the fact the steel mill [Bethlehem Steel Corporation] was there.  Sparrows Point [Maryland] was very, very popular and big and growing and aggressive at the time, and so most blacks had great jobs 'cause they worked for Sparrows Point.  We moved there, it was a very affluent neighborhood in terms of the black community.  There were three black communities there in Turner Station, Ernest Lyon [Defense Housing Project], Sollers Homes [ph.], and Day Village.  Well, it was all a stratus class type of thing, and we lived in the top, I guess you would call the upper middle class was Day Village, where your doctors and your accountants, and my father being an engineer, and all the people that worked at Sparrows Point, who had these great salaries and great incomes, and so there we lived in a place called Peach Orchard Lane and, Racine [Tucker-Hamilton], it was absolutely gorgeous!  It was a peninsula [Delmarva Peninsula], and behind us was the inlet from the bay, the Chesapeake Bay; in fact, during hurricanes you could step right out and step into the water.  The water always came up right around the houses, but it was such a beautiful area and I'm sure, even today, there are negotiations to buy it, to convert the whole area for boats and what have you.  That was one of the great times of my life.  I didn't know anything about discrimination.  I didn't know anything about problems.  I guess we moved there from Piper Court when I was about six or seven.  I was going into, like, I think I went into the third grade there.  It was like a utopia.  We were there from, I guess from, like seven, we did not move until my father relocated at thirteen years of age, and I'll tell you for example, Kweisi Mfume lived there, Larry Middleton, who fought for the, who fought professionally, I'm not sure whether he fought [Muhammad] Ali or not, he lived there, the big running back for Dallas [Cowboys], Calvin Hill, lived there, so there's a lot of people that lived in that community who have gone on to celebrity areas, all there at the same time, so Turner Station was quite a historical place.
Speaker 1: Were there any clashes between the classes, or did everyone kind of live harmoniously together?
Speaker 2: It was a very harmonious community.  If anything clashed, the kids clashed.  If we beat Sollers Holmes, which was supposed to be on the lower part of the totem pole, if we won the Little League ball game, then we knew we had to get a head start running before the ninth inning came (laughter) 'cause we knew they were usually bigger than us, so we knew there was gonna be a fight, but that was, it was nothing of any consequence, it was just kids who were territorial about the three different communities that made up the peninsula.
Story_ID: 220418
Speaker 1: Tell me this--what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: I guess music in terms of sounds, 'cause my mother [Mildred Miller Pettit], there was Jackie Wilson and all the big stars, Sam Cooke, and my parents had parties and what-have-you.  I guess the smells would be more reflective of the water that we were around, and you said the sights--
Speaker 1: And what sights remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: I guess that [Delmarva] Peninsula, living right there on the water, being able to get up and go right out and fish.  My dad [George Pettit] and I were working on our old junky boat that we were trying to rehab, and although you could go right in the water, you weren't supposed to 'cause kids were drowned doing this, but we'd go in for a dip.  I mean, you could, it was like a community paradise, so, I guess the sights and sounds were that water in that community that were my most developmental years, I guess.  I won't say that conclusively, but for that period of time.
Story_ID: 220419
Speaker 1: One thing we just kind of chatted about that I'd like for you to talk a little bit about is, you talked a little bit about your uncles and how, you know, so many of them went to A&T [Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], and how one would help the other.  Can you kinda tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I found that to be remarkable.  They all went to A&T College at the time, now A&T University, and they, as I can read the documentation and talk to the one who is alive, they sort of rotated.  Two would stay out and work and let the other two go forward, and then they would switch places and the others would work and help the others, and they all went through A&T, not all of, when I say the size of the family, six of 'em I identified as graduating, including the girl [Dorothy Mae], from A&T University; in fact, I played football for Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  I was always so glad we didn't have A&T on the schedule, 'cause my family would have had such divided loyalty (laughter).  I was the first one not to go to A&T, and with Howard University, but then they, with the War [World War II, WWII] breaking in the middle, they went to, it was like a preparatory school called Lincoln Academy [Kings Mountain, North Carolina], and they came out of Lincoln Academy to be prepared to go to A&T, and then the C.C. [(CCC) Civilian Conservation Corps] camp, and so they were in this mixture, which is sort of quasi-military.  They were in this mixture of the C.C. Camp, Lincoln Academy, A&T, and the war, all revolving around the same time.  Because, as we know, the war doesn't end 'til 45 [1945], and so a lot of 'em, their education matriculation was broken by the war, and they went on to be, and my Uncle Ray was killed in the war.  My father [George Pettit] served in England, my Uncle John, the baby brothers, one of them was a Marine [U.S. Marine Corps], and he went through his trials and tribulations at the time being in the U.S. Marines, but he was shore patrol, military police.  I had another uncle, Argel, who I understand was actually there as one of the honor guards at the signing of the Japanese surrender on the USS Missouri, and I mean, for an African American, that would be something 'cause African Americans in the [U.S.] Navy were supposed to be in the kitchen.  But I understand he was one of the color honor guards that was fully decked out at the Japanese surrender.  My Uncle Abraham was Navy when he was decorated, so they all did this, it was so amazing, and none of these kids ever went to jail.  All of 'em graduated, I mean, went to either college, businesses or the military.  These eleven kids, they all were very, very successful in their professions, business-wise, they own their own businesses, they own their own companies, and so this family just, my father's side particularly, not to neglect my mother's [Mildred Miller Pettit] side, but the father's side of my family has just always fascinated me in terms of these kids being able to do all of this in the '30s [19330s], the '40s [1940s], and '50s [1950s], in an African American family, and they were the first generation educated 'cause my grandfather [Abraham Pettit]; as I said, my grandmother [Nina Pettit] lived on the mountain, [grand]father was a preacher, but they sort of lived by off the land, like a small farm and things like that.

Speaker 1: So let's go back.  We were kind of around talking about your childhood.  What was it like growing up as an only child?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to say it was lonely because my parents [Mildred Miller Pettit and George Pettit] came to me at one point in time and asked me do I want a brother, sister, or a dog.  Now, I took the dog and the dog was what I got, but I sometimes (laughter) regret that decision because when the other kids would go in, in the evenings my parents seemed like they were always busy or doing something and it's like we'd go watch 'Frankenstein' at the movies or something like that when it was at Turner Station [Maryland]; well that was fine until it was time for everybody to go in, and everybody else had brothers or sisters and I wasn't allowed to just go to anybody's house and so at that point in time, it was quite lonely, I would say, not having anybody to deal with in terms of in my house except the dog.  And to be quite candid, because this, I spent a lot of time in my book ['Under Color of Law,' A. Dwight Pettit] on this subject, I didn't have the most stable childhood.  I think it has to be said and I have to say it, not to criticize my father, but my father was a very, very, he could be a very violent man and was a very moody man.  I think, no offense to indigenous Americans, Indian Americans [Native American], or what have you, but I think that Indian blood in him, he was a man who couldn't very much, very well handle alcohol, and his reputation was far and wide when he had a couple drinks.  And so my mother and I never knew which George Pettit was coming home.  We never knew whether the engineer, the scientist, the educator George Pettit was coming home (laughter) or whether the street George Pettit was gonna come in and terrorize the house.  So, I grew up under a lot of pressure in terms of my father.  I mean, he loved my mother and myself dearly, and I had the greatest childhood in terms of hunting and fishing and, there would be no more that a man could do with a child than my father did with me.  But the turmoil that existed between my mother and father was a totally different issue, and being an only child, and many times I was in the middle of it, because my mother and I would be looking out of the window to see which George was coming in.
Story_ID: 220421
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little about the elementary school years.  What was the name of the elementary school you attended?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been to so many schools because of my father's [George Pettit] movement in terms of his job as well as the integration process that we probably will cover later, but I remember going to the school in Dundalk [Maryland], and I'm having a mental block as to the exact name, but maybe it'll come back to me, but when we got to Turner Station [Maryland], I went to a school called Fleming [Elementary School, Turner Station, Maryland].  I was in the third grade in Fleming.  Then, because of the steel mill [Bethlehem Steel Corporation], when you came out of the fifth grade, you had to go across the bay to Sparrows Point [Maryland] and you went to Bragg [Elementary School, Sparrows Point, Maryland] for a couple of years, and so Fleming, I'm sorry, yeah Fleming and then Bragg, and then Sollers Point [High School, Sparrows Point, Maryland], that made the big high school that I loved tremendously, started in the seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your teachers from elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember Ms. Dobbins in the fifth grade, I remember Ms. Sembley [ph.] in the fourth grade, I remember Ms. Thornton [ph.] in the seventh grade, I remember Ms. Greene [ph.] in the second, first or second grade when she told me that I should wash my hands, or something that I picked up off the floor and I told her my mother [Mildred Miller Pettit] says, my mother says my hands are as dirty as the floor, so it doesn't matter, and she went and told my mother and a switch was waiting for me! (Laughter) And I had very strong teachers but I went through something that was quite traumatic.  I was in some type of rebellion as a child, and therefore all my report cards reflect the same thing, that [HistoryMaker A.] Dwight [Pettit] sees everything as a game.  He sees everything as fun.  He harasses the other children and plays jokes, practical jokes that the other kids don't see as a joke.  So, I was always busy and I could draw.  My son [Alvin Dwight Pettit, Jr.] is a full-fledged artist, but either I was drawing, I was pulling the girls' ponytails, or I was, I was always into something devilish, so I was always being sanctioned, I was always being sanctioned, I was always being punished, I was always being disciplined, and it got to the point that I think the faculty didn't think that I was very academically inclined and so Ms. Sembley in the fourth grade, by the time I got to fourth grade, which was a special, fourth grade was like, that's when you had the classification A, B, C, D.  I wasn't in special, but I guess I was sort of in D or E, so all we did is draw.  Ms. Sembley, because you sit around and draw all day because the kids there were just, just totally out of control, and so Ms. Sembley, she was a big, heavyset lady who was just the perfect old grandmother and she loved me to pieces.  I mean, she just adored me and I adored her and I could just basically sit and do anything I want to do.  Well, at some point in time, they came in and started testing, and this becomes very dramatic in my legal cases later because I test very low, and I know why I test very low, because I'm doing something, I'm sure, during the test (laughter).  I don't even remember the test, but the achievement tests, IQ [Intelligence Quotient] tests, I'm probably spitting rubber bands or shooting darts or harassing somebody, and so I stay in these classes and then happens in the fifth grade, where they give a reading test.  Some type of tester comes and all of a sudden I notice that everybody, for some reason I decide to participate.  And then I notice that everybody's conferencing and they're bringing in counselors and they're bringing in the vice principal and everything, so the next day I'm taken out of this whatever I'm in, 4E or 4D, and I moved up to 5A.  I guess I'm in the fifth grade now, it's the beginning of the year, and I moved up into the number one class, and Ms. Dobbins [ph.] is the teacher, gorgeous lady, very voluptuous, I mean, I immediately got involved in academics (laughter) just looking at her.  I'll never forget, we were doin', they were doin' Roman numerals, and she was just beautiful.  She had this great figure; in fact, she had a sister ended up going with my Uncle Argel, and all of a sudden I became inspired.  But the point is, they had discovered something.  What they had discovered was my reading and comprehension ability and I guess I had some math, whatever, I decided to participate.  So all of a sudden, I'm in this great class, but here's what's even better about the class.  This class is pure academic.  And in this class, they have like maybe three boys, and maybe twenty-five girls, and so all the prettiest girls and all with the little grease legs and the little ruffle skirts and the plaids with the big ribbon, all the pretty, I've been there in the D section and the E section with the hardheads fighting, and at (unclear) so all of a sudden I'm there in this almost all female class with all these pretty girls and this gorgeous teacher and all of a sudden I'm in academia, and all of a sudden I decide to be popular I've got to be able to compete and I'm there now; for some reason they made the decision I've got to be academic, and I think that's the beginning of my academic birth, you might say.
Story_ID: 220422
Speaker 1: What were your parents' [Mildred Miller Pettit and George Pettit] thoughts on this transformation?  Did they always know that you were a very bright boy?
Speaker 2: Well, that was part of the fun.  My father and I, that was the stress part.  That was the tension part, because he was just so perturbed at me for being an underachiever, and so when, I mean, bringing my report cards home was a major thing.  I mean, I knew that there was gonna be major discipline.  I knew that I was gonna be ordered to my room for days, if not weeks, and his assignments to me were to do a book report.  And so, not only would he give me books to read and report back to him, but I already had this fabulous love of comic books.  I had every comic book in the world.  So, I was just an absorbed reader, so this wasn't really punishment to me, so I didn't really mind it, but the physical.  I knew I was gonna get my whipping and everything, so he just could not, he just could not resolve the issue that he was an electronic engineer, that he was a straight A's in college [at Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], that he taught engineering, that he was, in my opinion, a genius, and that my mother had scored in the top of her class at beauty school to get her beauty license.  He could not reconcile that they had this kid that was having these academic problems (laughter) but it wasn't academic problems.  I think it ties back into what was happening in my home life, which nobody knew about.  What I was going through with my mother and father, there wasn't really the opportunity to concentrate at home.  I'm not blaming it all on my parents, but I came out of a very volatile disoriented childhood.
Speaker 1: And what was going on in your home life?  Was that kind of a secret that just stayed in the home, or do you think that--
Speaker 2: No, it began to creep out in the community, because George had developed this reputation.  I mean, they talk about him as a legend today.  They said he would come into a night club, at the time a very famous night club, it was the Sphinx Club [Baltimore, Maryland], which I would later become a member.  It was one of the top private clubs and for black folks across the country, your athletes, your big name entertainers, and everything coming in, but they talk about my father.  They said my father would come in and he was Mr. Pettit, scientist, engineer, and he'd take the first drink and drink it straight down and then he'd start telling about his academic accomplishments, and so forth, and then he'd have his second drink and he'd come out of his jacket, and he'd come out of his jacket and he'd start telling you that he was the smartest person (laughter) and the third or fourth drink would come out after his cufflinks, and then roll up his sleeves and then said, "I'm also the baddest mother in the house" and (laughter) that was just that it was a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde transition, and so as a child with no other brothers or sisters to absorb that but me and, my mother and I, it was a very, very volatile household.  We just never knew what we were dealing with, which was quite stressful, so I think as a result, I retaliated by shutting down and maybe even translated some of what he had at home--
Story_ID: 220423
Speaker 1: --I was translating it to the other kids, since I had these athletic skills, I had all these uncles who I could fight, and so I had actually gotten to the point, even though I was a little red, freckle-faced kid who was skinny as a rail, but I actually became the show-person for the schools, because I was, it was like who was [HistoryMaker A.] Dwight [Pettit] fighting that night.  Who was--the kids were gonna come out and watch me fight, and I was gonna jump around and dance and, you know, show time.  And so, that was a sort of a degree of popularity.  I was always, and I thought I could sing, too.  So, I would sing at lunchtime; oh, I would be in the student assemblies.  I would be singing, or I'd be Elvis Presley, or I would be in the contests.  All the kids would demand that I sing at lunchtime, and then with the fighting and I was always elected the most popular kid, and the most--even when I went to Sollers Point [High School, Sparrows Point, Maryland].  Sollers Point was a high school.  I was elected May Day king in the seventh grade!  I've got this big bride, or the May Day queen standing a foot over me.  She's a senior.  They have never elected another senior, so I was preoccupied with being popular.  I was preoccupied with everything but academics and so my father [George Pettit] and I, I mean, it was a toe-to-toe battle about that.
Story_ID: 220424
Speaker 1: What happened with you and your father's [George Pettit] relationship once you made this academic turnaround in the fifth grade [at Fleming Elementary School, Turner Station, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess he was still, I guess he had a lot of reservations and doubts, and you gotta, I think the other part, even though I made the academic turnaround, there was another factor going on.  I began to discover my academic abilities, but at the same time, in his opinion and he was correct, I still wasn't applying myself.  I still, okay, I can do this.  Big deal!  I still was in this rebellion mode.  I would do what I wanted to do (laughter) and not do if I didn't want to do.  And this all becomes to a head when we, not to get ahead of you or myself at this point in time, but it all comes to a head when he is transferred to Aberdeen [Maryland] and he attempts to put me into a white school.
Speaker 1: Well, okay.  Let's talk a little bit about junior high school.  Did you go to junior high school, or was it elementary school all the way through the eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Well, we left Turner Station [Maryland] in the eighth grade.  I was just entering puberty; I mean, it was so disastrous to me.  I was, like I tell you, I was king of the school, I was May Day king, I was beginning to play basketball, the coaches loved me, I had an entourage of the little girls with me everywhere I went.  I was president of the Day Village [Maryland] Boys Club [Boys & Girls Clubs of America], my father was scoutmaster.  I was ringleader in [Boy] Scouts [of America].  We were doing everything, and one day my dad comes and he says we have to move.  This was so shocking and had such an impact on me.  Move where?  He said, "Well, you have two choices; a place called Tobyhanna, New Jersey [sic. Pennsylvania] and because he is [U.S.] military, I think it was in ballistic research laboratory.  They were relocating; or, a place called Aberdeen, Maryland. So we go look at Tobyhanna.  There is nothing at Tobyhanna.  Then we go look at Aberdeen.  Aberdeen, at that time, there was nothing there but white folks, skunks, deer, and raccoons, even on a military base [Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland].  I mean, I didn't see any black kids, I didn't see anything that I was relating to coming out of sort of a semi-urban environment, and finally the choice was made.  They were going to Aberdeen.  I mean, you talking about a kid whose whole world becomes wrecked overnight.  I mean, I'm in tears.  I'm not going, and all of a sudden we move to Aberdeen and we pull up in front of this big school.  I'm going into the eighth grade, Aberdeen High School [Aberdeen, Maryland], the same school that Cal Ripken [Jr.] would graduate from.  In fact, I would speak to the classes as Commencement Day speaker the year before Cal Ripken graduated, which was such an honor to me, but that's another story.  So, we pull in front of Aberdeen High School with all these kids out there screaming "Nigger go home," and the tension as we walked in, we were so naive about race, we thought this was, this is post-Brown versus Board of Education Case [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  Brown versus Board of Education is '54 [1954].  We now are into '58, [1958], et cetera.  Schools in Baltimore City [Maryland] are integrated, even though my school was de facto integrated in terms of Sollers Point [High School, Sparrows Point, Maryland], but that was just because it was a black neighborhood. And we walk in there and they, in no certain terms, note that we have a Negro school down the street, and he takes me to the Negro school, which is Havre de Grace Consolidated [School, Havre de Grace, Maryland], and I'm enrolled there for my eighth grade year.
Speaker 1: And, what were your experiences like there?
Speaker 2: What we found out was that in my matriculation, it appears that the school was about two years behind, where I had come out of the Baltimore City schools, although that was all black, but the academic levels were, this goes back to Plessy versus Ferguson [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896], the black schools in Baltimore might have been separate but they were equal, but they weren't separate and equal there.
Story_ID: 220425
Speaker 1: Because Aberdeen [Maryland] was a more rural area and not nearly as progressive as the City [of Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: No, Aberdeen is thirty-five, thirty miles out of the city.  There's nothing there but a [U.S.] military base [Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland] at the time, and like farmland.  I mean, you got your kids in the school, you got your kids in the community.  You got your military brats, and even though we weren't military, my father [George Pettit] was civilian, but we were just like military brats.  We could live on the post, what have you.  So that part, you know, with the privileges of the post, and the pool and all that, on one side I will have a great life, but on the other side in the city, I'm into a very, very segregated life.  But even on the base, there just wasn't that many black kids there.  It was like the whole base was like five black families, and that included officers, non-commission officers, what-have-you.  And so, when I ended at Havre de Grace Consolidated [School, Havre de Grace, Maryland], it's the first, but I always had the confrontation thing.  You know, here comes little red freckled face mammal, "I'm a Baltimore slickster now, coming from Baltimore."  Said he thinks he's bad.  We're gonna kick his butt right away.  Well, like all the other kids, nobody knew that I had this great athletic background in terms of boxing and self-defense.  So that always resolved itself, every place I went, all the way up through, even outside of law school [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.], that always presented itself and always sawed itself very quickly, and that was gone.  By the next day it was like that kid could fight!  He's all right.  (Laughter) So, all of a sudden I had friends.  And, I had great teachers there.  They were understanding that their careers were in jeopardy by integration, including the principal who testified against me in my trial.  But they understand that times were changing and that we're in the grips of those times, and so after a year there, my father decided I was falling further and further behind; again, I wasn't proud of myself, so everything I was doing I had done before, but still my grades are sort of mediocre, but I'm going through this transitional period, so he decides to make a decision and in my ninth grade year, he decides to enroll me back in Baltimore City, pay the taxes and board me out with a friend of his, first relatives, but then friends of the family and I entered the school called [William H.] Lemmel Junior High School [Baltimore, Maryland] here in Baltimore City for my ninth grade year.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that please?
Speaker 2: L-E-M-M-E-L.  Spelling has never been my forte, but I think it's double m's.
Speaker 1: Were you glad to get back to the city?
Speaker 2: I was glad to get back, but I was very, very uncomfortable and stressed out about living in the city during the week and then going home for the weekends, which means that I had no social life.  Weeks were dedicated--I was with a very nice family, the Hollingsworths [ph.].  One of the good things is they had a lot of nieces and what have you, who were always running through the house.  I did have a social life in terms of their family, but I had no social life of my own because the kids that I went to school with, their social lives were on the weekends, and on the weekends, I was back in Aberdeen with skunks and the deer, and the raccoons, and I had not established any type of relationship other than the kids and my neighbors.  The guys, in terms of playing football, et cetera, I was very much accepted, but I had no social life in terms of parties and what have you.  The black school had been in a place called Havre de Grace [Maryland], which was five miles from Aberdeen, and so not having any transportation, I didn't have a way to even get to where the black kids were that I had gone to the school with in eighth grade.  So, here in that short period of time, I'm going to go from Sollers Point [High School, Sparrows Point, Maryland] to Havre de Grace Consolidated, to Lemmel, and so I apply.  I supposed to be going to [Baltimore] City College [Baltimore, Maryland] for high school; it's not a college but that's what they call it, or [Frederick] Douglass [High School, Baltimore, Maryland] when the court rules that I'm to be ordered into Aberdeen High School [Aberdeen, Maryland], so Aberdeen High School will be my fourth school inside of three years.
Story_ID: 220426
Speaker 1: Well actually let's back up just a little bit.  Let me ask you this, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [A. Dwight] Pettit, when did you start to have dreams and aspirations about what you wanted to do with your life?  What did you want to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, two factors were going on.  The first factor was my father [George Pettit] evidently harbored the ambition of being a lawyer.  His best friend, Kenneth Lee [ph.], of Greensboro [North Carolina], who did come out of engineering with him and go on to law school, was like the lawyer in Greensboro, while my father was coming out of engineering and he became very, very wealthy.  Remember I told you I played with his son?  He and I played together, and so my father, the whole time I was growing up, my father, one of the things he would always say in a very disappointed way, that he should have done like Kenneth Lee, and gone ahead and become a lawyer.  Also, he had become now with the event of me being denied driving for high school, he had also become a civil rights advocate and later he'd join the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Color People], become vice president, so his whole thing was I should have been a lawyer.  I could do this myself.  That was the first factor.  The second factor was upon the arrival of the new world to me of discrimination and race, then all of a sudden I had lawyers.  Thurgood Marshall was one of my lawyers for the integration of schools, Juanita Jackson Mitchell, who is head of the NAACP at (unclear), Jack Greenberg of the [NAACP] Legal Defense Fund.  So now, all of a sudden I'm watching these great people around me, preparing me in terms of my trial and so it was like then it became almost like it was God-mandated.  Between my father's aspirations that he had not completed, and between the change in my life, it's almost like this is not even an issue.
Story_ID: 220427
Speaker 1: And so, let's talk a little bit about this case you were preparing for.  Why did your father [George Pettit] make the decision to now send you to Aberdeen High School [Aberdeen, Maryland] after you were already in Baltimore City [Maryland] and going to schools in Baltimore City and, you know, were considering two schools in Baltimore City, why did he make that decision?
Speaker 2: Well, one thing, I'm away from home.  I'm a fourteen-year-old kid that's boarding up with another family, so my father desperately wanted me back with my family.  I wanted to be back with my family; regardless of how tumultuous it was, I still wanted to be home.  I wanted to have some, some semblance of a normal life with some type of stability.
Speaker 1: And in your father's opinion, the high school in Aberdeen for blacks just was not acceptable.
Speaker 2: It was not acceptable.  It was two years behind in its curriculum.  It was just not acceptable, and so the whole goal was for me to go to Aberdeen High School, so when the court ruled in my favor, well I guess--
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk a little bit about the process.  So, your father makes this decision that his son is going to go to Aberdeen High School.  So, what do you all have to do next?  How do the wheels start moving?
Speaker 2: Well, he is referred to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and that's where he meets Ms. Mitchell [Juanita Jackson Mitchell], who is, at that time, the champion of civil rights in the State of Maryland, and he joins the NAACP, and she is not satisfied with Brown versus Topeka Board of Education's [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] implementation in Harford County [Maryland], and so she takes the case.
Story_ID: 220428
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Aberdeen [Maryland] is in Harford County [Maryland].
Speaker 2: Yes, so that's what brings in Thurgood Marshall, 'cause Thurgood is very upset at this point in time that Maryland is still trying to implement Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], that he was very much a part of, and Jack Greenberg of the [NAACP] Legal Defense Fund, as I said, and Tucker Dearing, who was a local (unclear), so they bring the case, they put the case together and they bring the case in the U.S. Federal District Court here.  Well, lo and behold, when the case hits the newspapers and everything, "Retarded child being put in white school," because of defense of the state, and the [Maryland State] Board [of Education], the superintendent and school board [Board of Education of Harford County], they go back to these old tests back in the fourth and beginning of the fifth grade, before this academic discovery, and they argue that I'm academically unqualified and they want to protect me from having to compete with white students, that it would be not in my interest because the court says you have to discriminate, but the court said "With all deliberate speed," the United States Supreme Court, so they gave the latitude, and this has become very historical, of different states to break up to manifest and create their own discrimination procedures, or integration procedures.  So, what Harford County has done is put into place is a stair step integration system, where they are integrating a year at a time, but the problem is I'm ahead of this system.  When they integrated the seventh, I would have been in the eighth, eighth, I'd have been in the ninth, and so the year that I applied, they did admit African Americans, but they admitted three African American females.  They didn't, they would not allow the two, I think it was another African American male.  So, they denied my admission, and then they based that denial on my inadequacies as a student and argued that the IQ test and achievement tests that I had taken back years before, that I was not qualified, though should not be allowed to be threatened academically in the competition with white students.  Well, this was devastating to a kid.  You know, you're walking around, even in [William H.] Lemmel [Junior High School, Baltimore, Maryland] and everybody's, are you the kid, are you the stupid kid (laughter), and the teachers, some of 'em, but you know, I had great teachers and Lemmel and one of 'em is still alive, Mr. [Ray] Carpenter.  He was my homeroom teacher, so when I walked in he says, tells the kids, "Well, we have a star in class.  We have a media star and we're happy 'cause it's all over the papers," and I think it was in the Washington Times and the New York Times, Washington Post, what-have-you, that this major integration battle is going on." Well, the kids loved me instantly, if I can use that word.  They elected me chief judge of the school court, they elected me president of the class, because they immediately, the teachers and everybody, began to read automatically that this was a sham, what was in the newspapers.
Speaker 1: Because they knew what you could achieve academically.
Speaker 2: Well, they discovered me right away.  In fact, my homeroom teacher, Mr. Carpenter, I mean if I was a minute late, it was like, "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [A. Dwight] Pettit, you are such a celebrity and we read about you, why don't you stand up and give us the Gettysburg Address?"  Or, stand up and give us volume so-and-so of [William] Shakespeare.  And I was always able to perform, 'cause now I'm into it.  Now, I've got to prove something to me, I've got to prove something to the world.  Here I'm in the newspapers where my whole life is being called into question, and so now it's not just my father [George Pettit] telling me that I've got to produce, now I'm getting to the realization of adulthood, moving toward as a young teenager, that I've got to prove myself and may have to prove myself over and over, and have to prove myself in a court of law.
Story_ID: 220429
Speaker 1: You're in the throes of this court case, ninth grade, the decision will be made about where you're going to high school [Aberdeen High School, Aberdeen, Maryland].  What happens?
Speaker 2: Well, the court rules, Judge Rosell Thompson, we think at the time might have been, I won't go that far whether he was chief judge, but he rules in my favor.  But it's the interesting thing about it.  He doesn't rule in my favor based on Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  A good friend of mine, [HistoryMaker] Larry Gibson, is working on the opinion now and it just cracks him up but he believes that my case might have been the last ruling on the basis of Plessy versus Ferguson [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896].  The court concludes, after moving through all the parameters of Brown, he concludes that the black school [Havre de Grace Consolidated School] in Harford County [Maryland] at Havre de Grace [Maryland], was inferior to the white school, Aberdeen, in terms of testing scores, funding, curriculum, mainly curriculum, and other things that the Board of Education [of Harford County] has manifested, and so he basically then says, obviously I could not get a fair education in Baltimore [Maryland], I mean in Harford County, and so he says, he almost rules that it's inconsequential as to what my academic levels are.  He almost says any opinion that even if I turn out to be not qualified, that I have a constitutional right to compete with white kids, and he almost just basically says he doesn't do any great literary or legal writings, he basically says if this kid wants to go, if he's not smart enough, then he still has the right to take that chance and so he finds that because the school systems are unequal on that basis, not Brown, on Plessy, I have the right to go to Aberdeen High School in order to be admitted--
Story_ID: 220430
Speaker 1: Now, understand something, because of his remarks earlier, Thurgood Marshall has already stormed out of his courtroom.  I mean, they have tremendous words and I don't recall that now, but it has been told to me subsequently, particularly by my law partner, former law partner, Mike Mitchell [HistoryMaker Michael Mitchell, Sr.], who is the son of Juanita [Jackson] Mitchell and also Clarence Mitchell III, [sic. Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr.] not the Clarence Mitchell III who worked on my case, but Juanita Mitchell, as you know, she did.  And so I understand through the historical development, that Thurgood Marshall lit into the judge, basically calling him a racist and basically accusing him of ignoring Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], and making defamatory remarks toward me, the plaintiff, and my understanding is Thurgood Marshall walks out of his courtroom, never to return back to the federal courts in Baltimore City [Maryland], but he had that much disdain for the judge.  And so, I'm ordered in in 1960 at Aberdeen High School [Aberdeen, Maryland] in the tenth grade.
Speaker 2: Tell us a little about what Thurgood Marshall was like and what it was like, you know, being around him and watching him--
Speaker 1: See, being quite candid, I didn't know the magnitude of the man, and my basic, I'm in school.  They're monitoring my grades, Ms. Mitchell is preparing me for trial, they gave me another IQ [Intelligence Quotient] test.  They gave me new achievement tests.
Speaker 2: How are you doing on those tests?
Speaker 1: Hold it, I'm doin' all right, but I'm still not raisin' any hell, but I'm doin' much better than what they said I did in the fourth grade.  I mean, all of this is in the evidence, all of this is in the case thing.  I think I do 100, I'm not sure whether it was 103 or 107, something like that, but everything is significantly in the range of acceptability, as the court says, even for Aberdeen High School, whether my IQ is going to turn out to be 120, or whether it's in the range of normal.  It's not where they had put it before in terms of 90 or close to handicapped.  So, all that is resolving, but I don't have the opportunity to really see or observe Thurgood, as I do Mrs. Mitchell, and she is a fireball, second to none.  I mean, she will call the judge anything she wants to call him, and then she will not accept anything less than justice in the courtroom.  Jack Greenberg, I didn't really, he was more or less the administrator, and Thurgood Marshall, I mean Tucker Dearing was more or less Ms. Mitchell's right hand, but she was the moving, driving, litigation force and she was one of the black, may have been the first black female to graduate from the University of Maryland [School of Law; University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland], but she is one of the first black females in Maryland, and she was legendary.  I mean, Thurgood, everybody jumped with Ms. Mitchell; (laughter) my father [George Pettit], and that was really unusual.
Speaker 2: And so, were you like inspired by all of this?
Speaker 1: Yes, particularly Ms. Mitchell.  I don't recall, you know, I think at the same time I probably was having a blackout.  I think it was probably so stressful on me I don't really remember--
Speaker 2: That is a lot of stress for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A fourteen-year-old child.  I don't really remember the court experience.  I do not really remember my testimony or what I was like in court.  I just don't remember it.
Story_ID: 220431
Speaker 1: But you said that your principal from your junior high school [William H. Lemmel Junior High School] in Baltimore City [Maryland] testified against you.
Speaker 2: Now see, a lot of this procedure, I'm not even sure that I was there for the whole proceedings.  I still might have been in class, but Mr. [Leon S.] Roye came in and testified against me that I hadn't been the greatest student at Havre de Grace [Consolidated School, Havre de Grace, Maryland], but obviously he was fighting for his job, because once that school would be closed, then his principal-ship would be abolished.  So, you had your blacks who were fighting to maintain segregation, because they were fighting to maintain their own economic wherewithal.  And then you have those who were being progressive in the community, and wanted to see the schools integrated.  Now, even when we won, my father [George Pettit] came to me and said, "You know, [HistoryMaker A.] Dwight [Pettit], we've won the case and I think through the judge's ruling, everybody can go to school.  My father went through the community as vice president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and still nobody wanted to go to school.  I mean, the black community said, "Well, Mr. Pettit, you know, he's going to be up there [Aberdeen High School, Aberdeen, Maryland] by himself, you know.  There are three black females.  They're already having some problems.  I don't know whether I want to put my children and expose them to the potential threats and violence and all that can erupt there.  So, when I entered in my tenth grade year, I entered as the only black male in the senior high school.  You had a couple at the seventh and eighth grade level, but my entry was a major entry because I was a black male coming into the tenth grade--
Story_ID: 220432
Speaker 1: What was that like? What was that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we go back to the same story, (laughter) the boxing.  I'm admitted, my father [George Pettit] calls the principal, Mr. Potter, and asks him, Mr. Potter and I were on a panel together a couple of months ago to celebrate the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  He was a very fair man.  He was not a part of this.  He was just the man, the principal at the time.  In fact, on one of the pictures up there when I speak to Aberdeen High School [Aberdeen, Maryland] years later in 1978, when I'm the commencement speaker, I said "Everybody be cool.  Nobody get nervous, I'm not gonna talk about anybody," because it was the same principal, same vice-principal, same administration was still there, and so I didn't want to put anybody in the hot seat, because they were just doing what they were told to do.  So, he tells my father, he says, my father asked him if he'd be able to play football, and there's a little secret I have to tell you about that.  I think that was one of my driving forces about Aberdeen High School, 'cause the black school didn't have a football team, just a basketball team, and I was a football fanatic.  As soon as I saw when we pulled up the first day, and I saw those goal posts and that stadium, I knew I wanted to go.  Even in Baltimore City [Maryland], Sollers Point [High School, Sparrows Point, Maryland] didn't have a football team.  So, I knew I had to go to the white school for more than, it was academic reasons on the surface, but it was a personal agenda there too (laughter).  So, he asked, Mr. Potter, "Can I play football?" And Mr. Potter says, "Mr. Pettit, (I hear him on the phone), your kid, you won.  The court said he's entitled to do anything that any other kid does, and so therefore, he can play football."  Well, as soon as I arrived on the football field, which is just before school opens, I meet a couple of kids and one of them is my counter today, John (unclear), who befriends me, and he and I throw in towels or something.  He's one of the few kids that is speaking to me, and he ducks and my towel hits this other kid.  So this kid, shoulders, and he's been in a lot of my interviews, I don't, I don't call him by his name anymore 'cause he since came in and retained his lawyers to apologize, and what have you.  But this kid puts on the, straps on the weight of the white establishment, and so he approaches me, I said, his name is Jerry, and I apologized profusely and what have you.  He says, "Oh no, no, no.  You're gonna pick up all the towels in this locker room until I tell you," and I can't say whether he uses the nigger or not, but the point was everybody's listening.  I said, "Well Jerry, I can't do that."  He said, "Well, you're gonna do that," and he was a star athlete, "or you're gonna step outside."  I said, "Do we have to do this?"  And to make a long story short, we step outside.  The coaches are there, all the summertime, all the families are there to pick their kids up, and the varsity and junior varsity is there.  So, football is like sainthood in Aberdeen [Maryland].  I mean, that's like, almost like a professional team in terms of the admiration and following of the community, so we stepped out there and I know, not exaggerating, there had to be over two hundred people between the kids who came up on both teams, the parents who came up to watch practice, and everybody jumps out of the cars.  Well, we get right out in front of everybody, and he says again about picking up the towels, and I tell him again that I can't do this, and my father runs up and grabs me and he and another little kid, who my father has given a ride home, the other little black kid in the school who will later become my best friend, and so I tell my father, "Dad, I can handle this."  So my father steps back.  So, it's just like Hollywood, this movie I love so much, 'Battle of the Titans' [sic. 'Remember the Titans'].  I can't think--but I think about it all the time, but that football integration, it was a true story, and in Virginia, but I always think about it because I was by myself.  At least they had the other kids on the team.  So anyway, the fight starts.  It lasted about ten or fifteen seconds, I knock him out.  He's unconscious.  They had to bring an ambulance.  They try to revive him.  My father and I back out and as we're backing out, the crowd beings to sort of close on us, and this big Indian [Native American], his name is Lance Gracin, he's on the varsity.  He steps in front of me, my father, and Larry [Stokes], my father, Larry, and I, he steps in front of us, and he says, "I saw it, it was a fair fight."  He's a tackle on the football team.  He's about 6'2", maybe 220 pounds, big muscular kid.  He steps in front of them and said, "If you got to get to them, you got to go over me."  (Laughter) And that was the way I integrated out in high school.  So, when I show up the next day for class, or whenever classes started the next day, I'm legendary in the school already.  I walk down the hallways and the hallways part, you know, and when I go into the classroom, it's, "That's the kid who knocked out Terry Hatchman [ph.]."  "This kid knocked out Terry Hatchman."  So, I'll put it to you like this, Racine [Tucker-Hamilton].  I went to the school for three years and never had another confrontation or fight.  It just became legendary that I could box.
Story_ID: 220433
Speaker 1: Did you become a big star on the football team [at Aberdeen High School, Aberdeen, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I'd like to think so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Had you scored a winning touchdown against Wicomico [High School, Salisbury, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Well, that was the interesting part.  I had some problems in junior varsity, because I was arrogant enough to go out for quarterback, and my father [George Pettit] told me, he said, "[HistoryMaker A.] Dwight [Pettit], they're not gonna let you play quarterback, son."  I said, "But daddy, I can throw the ball, I can do this, I can do that."  "They're not gonna let you play quarterback.  Now you can sit here and fool yourself and hurt--set yourself up for hurt if you want to; you're not gonna play, they're not gonna let you play quarterback."  Well, sure enough I came home and I told him, I said, "Daddy, I'm on the starting team, I'm starting quarterback, the other quarterbacks have been moved to end, this and that." He's like, "You can say what you want, son, but you're not gonna play quarterback."  And sure enough, about two days before the game, the first game, my junior varsity coach, and I can't remember his name right now, but came to me and said, "Son, you're a good athlete, you can play any position you want to choose, but I can't let you play quarterback."  He said, "It's not my decision.  You just can't play quarterback."  Well, my head coach, who will be the varsity coach, Jim Smith, that I talk about all the time, he will disavow this today, and he and I are the greatest friends.  He doesn't, I just have to say, it's a senior moment.  He says he doesn't realize anything about me being quarterback, but he was the varsity coach.  He was legendary.  So, the next, I played fullback and I played linebacker, and I played in, and I have a great junior varsity year, I think, and then the next year, I go out for the varsity.  Now, this is the real deal, here.  This is Jim Smith, so I'm not even gonna fool myself and try to go out for quarterback.  I don't try that again until I get to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], 'cause I didn't play quarterback, and I never experienced it.  So I come out for the varsity, and I notice some unusual things.  And then Jim Smith calls us all over one day in the summertime, and he calls us over to the goalpost and he says, "Everybody sit down."  And he pulls, he's a war hero, a real live, true World War II [WWII] hero; I think Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] or something.  And he tells everybody, he says, "Look, this kid over here, Dwight, he's gonna make this football team," and he's a very aggressive, bold, just young, brash, white guy who looks like he came right out of Hollywood, and with the blonde hair and everything, muscles, and the female teachers love him.  So he steps up and he says, "This kid is gonna," but everything he says is laced with profanity.  "This kid is gonna play on this football team," and I'll leave the profanity out, "but anybody that doesn't play for him, doesn't block for him, I will put my foot up your, and you will be off the team.  Now, does anybody have anything to say?"  So that's, I never saw this quiet, silence.  He stands there and he says, "Okay, let's go play football" and that's how I come on to the varsity.  And, you know, I was a, I played offensive and defensive, and both offense and defense.  I had, it was my eleventh grade year, eleventh grade and twelfth grade year.  I think I was very good defensively, and I won that famous game.  The reason that's such a fabulous story to me is that if I, he disputes me, Coach Smith, but like I said, I always charge it off to senility.  If he ever sees this, he's gonna beat me up.  (Laughter) He's in his eighties.  But, I love it.  In fact, in one of the articles on the wall, I call him my second father figure.  But we played Wicomico High School to my recollection, and I've since checked that, and Wicomico High School is on the Eastern Shore [Maryland]; well, through the whole conference that we played Aberdeen High School, there are no other black kids in the conference except one kid, and we played against him.  His name is Scott.  He played for Laurel [High School, Laurel, Maryland].  But all these places, I'm the only black kid on the field.  Well, when we go down to Wicomico High, that's the Eastern Shore.  That's where [H.] Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] was put in a cage.  That's where the riots were.  That's where the demonstrations were.  So, when I come onto the field, there's no problem, but we gotta remember another factor.  I had my helmet on, and I'm light complexioned, and with the bars coming around me, you can't see my African American features that I had.  So, they finally, and I don't whether they know that I'm not a white kid or not.  But anyway, as history would have it and as God would mandate it, in the last thirty seconds of the game, I intercept a pass and I go like 80 yards for the winning touchdown, and it happens to be on my birthday, so the band comes out and surrounds me and the cheerleaders, I know whether they're surrounding me for protection or for celebration, because by this time, I do take off my helmet and in this state it has changed in terms of its--it sounds to me and a lot of people that you can hear them openly saying, "That's a Negro boy" and blah-blah-blah.  So, they picked me up, we go into the showers, they pick me up, they sing happy birthday to me, it's my birthday.  All the cheerleaders, all the band, everybody on the team sang happy birthday.  We rush in to the showers, we shower up and we get right back on the bus and we leave at night.  I don't whether that was intentional (laughter) whether we were supposed to get to dance on that, but we came back from Salisbury, Maryland, and Wicomico, Maryland, back to Aberdeen [Maryland] that night.  But that was one of my great, great moments.  I mean, I can't ask for any more.  Some things--I'm so religious.  Some things, I believe, are just touched by God, and I just believe that God just reached down on my birthday and gave me that birthday present.

Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from Aberdeen [High School, Aberdeen, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: In '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: And so, before you graduated what were some of your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: Well, the reason--I didn't want to go to Morgan [College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] because I did want to get away from--
Speaker 1: Did you know you were going to college then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was no question by that time.  Morgan was too close, and I did want to escape this home environment, which was still, it had calmed down but the residue was still there, and then I, in applying I didn't want to go to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], because I was tired of being on stage, and I went out there and saw 25,000 white kids and there was one black kid, not saying that I had a scholarship, but I didn't even want to go through that; in fact, I see [Historymaker] Darryl Hill, on the [Board of] Regents University System of Maryland, so I see Darryl Hill all the time, who is the first--so every time we have a regents thing at the Presidents Bowl, I see Darryl.  I really got into Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] because Howard, having a law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], seemed to fit me totally because if you graduated from Howard as an undergraduate, you didn't have to take the [L]SATs, you didn't have to do anything.  You could just, you were considered deemed acceptable to the law school.  And so, I said, well this is perfect.  I can get back to a black institution, I can get back into a black and social world, and upon graduation I will be going to law school and you can't ask for any more than that.  So, I was accepted, but I had had some problems, of course, in terms of the grades again, so Howard had what was a pre-college program.  And, I went for the summer and I had done, on my tests I had done extremely well in math.  I had done, scored very high in terms of reading comprehension.  My problem is spelling, and so, it became a college joke and everything every year, how long I stayed in English I, because I could never pass the spelling part of the test.  But otherwise, I went to Howard University and my first days there, I actually got down on the ground and kissed the ground when I saw all the beautiful kids and all the beautiful people, and last (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the beautiful girls.
Speaker 2: Especially the beautiful girls--
Story_ID: 220435
Speaker 1: As I read one of the books, the autobiographies on [W.E.B.] Du Bois, I was on vacation and I was reading it and Du Bois got into the same type of thing in one of his books in terms of his going to, I think it was Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  And, he had come from Boston [Massachusetts] and he had been in a white environment and how it was to see beautiful black people and beautiful black ladies and kids of prestige and families of power.  He spent--he did a whole chapter on that.  As I was reading it, I was on vacation and the tears just welled up in my eyes and I'm sitting there reading and the tears are just dropping.  Nobody can imagine the world that I was in, sharing W.E.B. Du Bois' experiences and equating them with mine; his arrival, I think, to Hampton and my arrival at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  I cried like a baby.
Speaker 2: What kinds of activities were you involved in at Howard?  You played football and what else?
Speaker 1: ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], I didn't pledge a fraternity until I was a senior, and that was under some crazy dare, I pledged Kappa [Alpha Psi Fraternity].  But I decided I wasn't gonna try to do any more than one sport, 'cause you get to the college level, and sports is big time serious, whether it's UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], or whether it's Howard University.  It consumes a lot of time, and so I had, I met my fiancee [Barbara Pettit], like two weeks into my freshman year.  She was freshman also, is my wife of thirty-seven years, and we were together for four years, so we've been together forty-one years.  It was just a great life, but, again I still had this insecurity about academics through all that I had been through, and I had some experiences at Howard that, again, made me have to stand up and make assessments and now, not only this struggle with my dad [George Pettit] and struggle in terms of my early academic career, but my refusal to participate, my disdain for academics.  I would have other occasions where I would be tested, where the line would be drawn in the sand and I had to shake off any insecurities that had been created by the media or by the establishment in terms of a child.  And, as those things began to happen, I began to have a realization that, hey, these folks lied.  I mean, I always knew they lied, but they lied big time, and I began to discover that I was really still lazy, that I could do what I wanted to do, but I could do it, I could call it up and do it at a moment's notice, and when I decided to call it up, I not only could do it but I was the best in it, in whatever it was; for example, in physical science and in my first year, it's a big class.  It's about two hundred kids in the class, auditorium.  Well, I go to see the professor 'cause I get a note that I'm going to go on academic probation.  See, Howard, you can party now.  You can have a great time, but they will send you home quick.  It sits in the right in the middle, as you know, middle of [Washington] D.C. and they tell you (laughter) just as quick to look to your left, look to your right, 'cause those folks won't be here.
Story_ID: 220436
Speaker 1: So I'm playing football [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.], travelling all over the country, got my girlfriend [Barbara Pettit], living the good life, so they called me in and tell me and I get a notice that I'm going on academic probation.  Well, if I'm going on academic probation, that means no football!  You can't play football on academic probation.  So I go to the professor and I ask him what do I need to do?  He just knows me as a number, of course, and he looks at my records and he says, "Well son, you're in bad shape.  You almost gotta get a B in physical science."  Now, my father [George Pettit] and I had fought this battle in high school, 'cause I dropped out of physics, 'cause I told him I didn't need physics and trigonometry to be a lawyer.  That was one of the biggest fights that we ever had, 'cause in high school, I mean Aberdeen High School [Aberdeen, Maryland] was a school on a scientific base, they were splitting the atom and all.  I said, "Why do I have to do this?  I want to be a"--I've used my physical science trainings and what-have-you in many cases in court.  I see it now as a necessity, but then as a kid I didn't see it.  But anyway, so he told me what I had to do.  Well, we took the examination, we come in for the results about a week later, and he's telling the class how bad that the class has done and how disappointed he is in the class, and he says the curve, the highest grade in the class was 87.5, he said, so the rest, A starts there and everything else breaks down on the curve.  He said the highest grade in the class, 87.5, was set by 624845; would 624845 please stand up?  Well, when I stood up, everybody was like "The football player???"  (Laughter) And, so it was things like that where I really began to find myself.  I did the same thing in philosophy.  I aced philosophy with the highest grade in the class.  I had this white, Jewish professor [Bernard Fall] in international foreign policy; in fact, I kept taking him over and over, just defiance.  He would get to the--he was so racist; in fact, I was very sorry when he died, I really wanted him to live to have some impact in his life, because he put me through so much.  But, when I would ace, like, most of his kids, in a black school now, follow this, most of the kids in his class were white, even though he's teaching at Howard, because he, he was such a great national figure.  He wrote the book, 'Two Vietnams.' ['The Two Viet-Nams: A Political and Military Analysis,' Bernard B. Fall].  In fact, he died at Vietnam.  He was advisor to the [President Lyndon Baines] Johnson administration.  He was on Walter Cronkite, big superstar, academician superstar.  So every time I would score, like number one in his class, he would walk and say, "Oh, football player got an A.  Somebody must have stolen the examination or something.  I'm gonna disqualify him and we'll do this over."  So, I went through three years with this man.  (Laughter) In fact, when I wrote one of my first papers in one of his first classes, he read the paper and he said, "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [A. Dwight] Pettit, this has to be plagiarized."  He says, "It's too damn good."  He said, "The problem with it, the only reason you're still in my class, 'cause I can't find where you stole it from."  He said, "But I tell you what, this is a Friday.  I'm disqualifying this paper.  I want another one from you by Monday."  So, it was these type of things which were still aggravating me, but it was showing me at the same time, that I was academically superior in that I hadn't been mixed up with childhood, discrimination, self-doubts--but then I began to kind of do my own and realized that anything I wanted to do, that I did have the gifts from God, my mother [Mildred Miller Pettit] and father, that I was academically on the top of my game and I wanted to be serious and be on the top.  When I wanted to be on the top of my game, I decided I couldn't be beat.
Story_ID: 220437
Speaker 1: You knew you were gonna go to Howard's law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about what law school was like for you.  What were some of your favorite courses in law school?
Speaker 2: Well see, again, I hate to make everything a struggle, but I get back to law school and I'm confronted with the same type of--Howard was crazy!  (Laughter) I mean, I love it.  It's a great school, but when I came into law school, it's like I went into a world of superstars who had great neurotic problems, and psychotic.  (Laughter) I mean, these professors were--I had never seen anything like this.  I mean, they sat up in the classroom putting on makeup, and, I mean (laughter) I had this guy Chick Chisholm, who was just like Bernard Fall was to me in undergraduate [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  He was my nemesis.  But he was a black man.  He was a black man who had been practicing in New York [New York].  He was a pretty boy, and he had been disbarred, and in some kind of way he had a connection to get into Howard as a professor.  So, this clown would sit up there, and talk like Moms Mabley.  You couldn't understand a word he was saying and he would tell these jokes that you couldn't understand them and everybody had to laugh.  Well, I didn't find them funny, so right away I was dubbed as the football player from undergraduate, 'cause I was well known, very popular and had a big career, and so right away these certain professors were going to put the football player in his place; in fact, he failed me in civil procedure, which was a five-hour course, and but for the fact that some other courses carried me over, I would have been out in my first year, and he tried and my senior year, to get me for federal jurisdiction.  He used to walk around and say, "You gotta come through me again, and I don't care how big you are, how popular" cause, sophomore year, my junior year, my second and third year, I was acing courses and what-have-you, but he was so determined that I was gonna--you know, he just told me, when you take federal jurisdiction, I'm gonna fail you again.  He says, "You're not gonna, you got away from me your freshman year, but I'm gonna get you in your senior year."  Just, just total out dislike, I don't know, some type of black jealousy or self-hatred, I don't know what it was, but fortunately the dean assigned me to federal jurisdiction under one of the top professors at Howard law, Red Morse, Dr. Red Morse, and I think I got either an 87 or a 91.  I aced the course.  I used to walk past Chick Chisholm.  I wanted to go (laughter).  But I had a great experience by the time I was in my second or third year.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite course?  A lot--some--a lot of boys will say that they really like evidence or some--did you have a favorite?
Speaker 2: I guess my practice reflects, I guess, that my first love is probably criminal law.  I guess my second was probably federal jurisdiction, because of my practice, basically now, I get a lot of credit as being a civil rights attorney, which was early in my life, but my practice over the years has been basically around the criminal and personal injury and wrongful death.  But, I did spend a lot of time in the federal courts before the coming of [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan and the changing of the federal bench, where it became just ridiculous to go into federal court, especially in this circuit.

Speaker 1: And, what kind of law were you thinking you wanted to practice and specialize in?
Speaker 2: Well, I had no doubt that I wanted to return to my home state of Maryland, and I wanted to practice a general practice, but I came out of Howard law and it was very interesting because the [President Richard Milhous] Nixon administration had come to Howard under affirmative action to recruit, and all the big corporations were there and I decided to be interviewed by [U.S.] Small Business Administration, so then I was called in for an interview downtown at the national headquarters [Washington, D.C.], and my potential boss told me he didn't believe in affirmative action and I tried to explain to him affirmative action didn't mean less qualified, affirmative action meant to be given an opportunity where you wouldn't have had the opportunity under other circumstances; you know, "Mr. [Bob] Webber," I said, "if you guys had not come to Howard you would have dealt just with Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.], we would have never gotten in the door.  But the fact that you have, you know, accepted this affirmative action as a diverse stream of tools, it doesn't mean anybody is lesser, it just means that you are looking at a larger range of pool."  And so he was from Kansas, and he said, "Well, [HistoryMaker A.] Dwight [Pettit], I'm a very conservative Republican."  He said, "But the White House [Washington, D.C.] is moving in terms of this affirmative action.  I don't like the concept of affirmative action" he said, "but interviewing you, everybody tells me that you are on the money and so I'm going to hire you.  You will be the second black person on the national litigation team for the Small Business Administration."  In fact, the first black that had been moved back to Louisiana in the district office, so I would be the first, I mean not the first, but the only black on the national litigation team for the Small Business Administration.  So I was hired, and I also had a [U.S.] military obligation.  I had been commissioned by the United States Air Force.
Speaker 1: Because you were in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I had been deferred to go to the Small Business Administration, and--
Speaker 1: So did you go to the Small Business Administration right after law school in 1970?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I was hired on the--my title was trial attorney on the national litigation staff for the Small Business Administration, or general council staff.
Speaker 1: Um-hm--
Story_ID: 220439
Speaker 1: And what were some of your responsibilities there [U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, here was the thing.  All of a sudden, I mean, I had been smart enough to take some corporate courses in my senior year [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I hadn't taken anything.  I was a political science major, political science major, psychology minor in undergrad, and I hadn't taken any business courses.  I didn't even take legal accounting.  That was a struggle because when I was in law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], the kids had already taken legal accounting.  They threw the accounting book out and said we're going to talk about law.  If you don't know accounting, go home and learn it.  (Laughter) So, but fortunately my senior year, I had taken a national law, labor relations, I had taken everything, I knew my weakness.  So, I had taken everything that I could in terms of electives in terms of the financial area.  And sure as it would be, I'm thrown directly into heavy-duty, white-collar litigation and research.  What we would, what we did, we would prepare the briefs and do all the gut and grunt work for the [U.S.] Department of Justice in terms of major fraud cases with banks and SBA loans as well as when I went to the local office, I would be involved in loan lending, bonding issues and what-have-you.  So, all of a sudden, I'm hired and Mr. [Bob] Webber told me, he said, "You know, [HistoryMaker A.] Dwight [Pettit], I don't believe in affirmative action.  You don't live up.  You're out of here, but I'm gonna hire you because you seem like you're everything that we want and the White House [Washington, D.C.] wants.  And, I went into this library and I looked around and I saw the bankruptcy codes, I saw all this finance, I saw the, all the national reporters, I said, "Oh, my God.  What have I gotten myself into?"  (Laughter) I mean, it was like it was terrifying.  I'll never forget the sweat.  I could remember the sweat just dropping off.  I had this one white Jewish kid, Eric Benson [ph.].  He kept looking me and looking at me and looking at me, and I'm trying to look intelligent.  It was my first day on the job.  I'm trying to--Uniform Commercial Code, I had never seen commercial code (Laughter) So, he came over and he said, "Dwight, c'mon, let's go to lunch." And he said, "Look man, calm down."  He said, "I went through the same thing that you went through." He said, "If I can do anything to help you, I will", and so he and I became so tight; in fact, Mr. Webber, it became a fun thing up at the office, because we had about three black secretaries and they were urging and they were pushing for me so much.  They were just hoping that I was the real deal.  And so, when I first got there, I noticed how Mr. Webber, if something came from the White House, [U.S.] Congress, or if it was an emergency or justice department [U.S. Department of Justice], the first person he would buzz was Eric, and before I left, I know he must have had a staff of about, I guess sixty lawyers were there, but before I left, you'd always hear the buzzer go off twice, Eric's office and my office whenever an emergency came up, so I felt that I had really proved myself--
Story_ID: 220440
Speaker 1: When did you file your suit against, in reference to the [Maryland State] Bar [Association] examination.  Was that in 1970 as well?
Speaker 2: That was done, well let's see, it was done, yeah, 'cause both things happened simultaneously.  I was not, I failed the Maryland bar and for reasons that I believe with Maryland was passing one or two people--
Speaker 1: African Americans...
Speaker 2: At a time.  One or two African Americans at a time.  So, the numbers were so horrendous.  I mean, Maryland, Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] was a joke when you take the Maryland bar.  When I told my dean I was going to go back to Maryland and practice law, he said, "Yeah, right, okay."  He said, "Son, do you know where Maryland is in terms of African Americans?"  So, whites were passing at an eventual rate.  I did all the statistics.  I did all the statistics myself and I convinced a local attorney here at the time who had been national attorney of the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice], Ken Johnson [Kenneth L. Johnson], to take the case and cause we show that whites, if you went to the University of Maryland [School of Law; University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland], was overall passing with percentages in the 90s.  If you're white and didn't go to the University of Maryland, you're still in the 70s.  If you're African American and you went to the University of Maryland, you might be in the 20s or 10 percent from around ten, but if you're African American and you didn't go to the University of Maryland, it was less than six or seven percent eventual passing rate.  So, the figures were so horrendous.  So, I brought that suit, but what I had done at the same time was also picked up the case of my father [George Pettit], who had been represented by Mrs. [Juanita Jackson] Mitchell, Jack Greenburg, and [HistoryMaker] Elaine Jones.  I picked up his case, but by being a federal employee, I had to go and get an exemption from the [President Richard Milhous] Nixon administration to litigate against the United States, 'cause I was United States, I was an attorney with the United States--
Story_ID: 220441
Speaker 1: Just really quickly, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [A. Dwight] Pettit, in your father's [George Pettit] case he was denied (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He had been denied promotion ever since I was put into Aberdeen High School [Aberdeen, Maryland].  They called him in.  They put Confederate flags in his office.  When he'd come to work in the morning, they'd hit a little music thing that would play 'Dixie' ['I Wish I Was In Dixie'].  They called him in, and in no uncertain terms told him they did not appreciate what he had done in Aberdeen [Maryland], and as far as they were concerned, he would never be promoted again.  Well he was not promoted.  He stayed a GS [General Schedule] 11 for my whole childhood and that was part of his stress and part of his frustration, which lent itself over to the domestic discord that we would have in my home.  He was such a brilliant man and such a gifted man.  He flew airplanes, he was one of the first African Americans to try to get in the fighter pilot corps.  My father predates even the Tennessee--what is it--
Speaker 1: Tuskegee.
Speaker 2: Tuskegee Airmen.  I mean, that's a whole different story in my book, where they transferred him out to England, rather than telling him he was too tall for the bomber squad, fighter squad, then created a bomber squad.  So, he goes, he does all that battle before me, and the funny thing about it, I will go through the same battle in the [U.S.] military, the same exact battles that my father went through in World War II [WWII], I would duplicate again in my military endeavors.  And so--
Speaker 1: So, you're, at the same time you have your case against the Maryland [State] Bar Association.
Speaker 2: The case--I'm trying to get him--times--connected.  I filed the case 'cause I see, I see, one Sunday morning I wake up and I see that a case has been brought very similar to my father's, because my father's case was just about dead, because they concluded, Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964] had not passed.  And so, the courts had concluded and Mrs. [Juanita Jackson] Mitchell through the courts, they had concluded that there was no remedy for persons discriminated by the federal government.  Even though he won his case, there was no remedy, because Title VII had not been passed to give you relief of back pay.  So it was like where you caught us, we discriminated against you, we treated you like a dog for eleven years, sorry.  Now go apply for the next available promotion and we might select you.  Well, that was totally inadequate.  So, I'm lying in bed one morning on a Sunday morning, and I wake my wife [Barbara Pettit] up and I said, look at this.  And I look at this case and this case is on my desk, in fact.  It's Tustin [ph.] vs United States, now.  In that case, a young lawyer by the name of Paul Tagliabue, who is now head of the National Football League [NFL], was bringing a case under the name of Covington Burling [Covington & Burling LLP], which is one of the biggest law firms in the nation, under their public service, and he was bringing this case in the United States Court of [Federal] Claims, arguing that there was jurisdiction based on direct, on executive orders for president, all the way back to the [President Harry S.] Truman administration to, in fact, award back pay.  So I jumped straight up in my bed, and I called my father.  I said, "Dad, get a copy of the [Washington] Post.  A case just like yours is going into the U.S. Court of Claims."  Well, my father said, "Right son."  (Laughter) I said, "Well, can I come home and get the boxes and the files?"  He said, "Dwight, the best lawyers in the world have looked at it.  You're a lawyer now, son.  So, if you want to come play with it, you can."  (Laughter) So, I go home and get the boxes and I call Mr. Tagliabue and he gives me an appointment.  I go down to see him, he sort of laughs about it.  He said, "Son, this is really complicated litigation, brand new lawyer."  He said, "But you're invited to work with me.  Come into our file rooms and I will copy you everything that we're doing."  Well, lo and behold, the U.S. Court of Claims jumps his case once I get in, and I'm working by day with the SBA [U.S. Small Business Administration], and at night in my office, they allowed me to work on my father's case.  I'm working by the SBA, working on my father's case, and then I got the [Maryland State] Bar [Association] case going because I filed that for discrimination and I take the [Nebraska State] Bar [Association] in Nebraska, because I can establish immediate residence in Nebraska, and I'm in the [U.S.] military too, so it looks like I'm gonna be called in to military duty, so I more or less opted Nebraska, 'cause I can go up there as a military officer, take the bar--I do, cutting through a lot, I'm admitted to the State of Nebraska.  So I come back, I'm juggling all of these things at the same time, and the U.S. Court of Claims skips over the Tagliabue case and decides to take Pettit [v. United States, 1973], and decides to hear Pettit en banc, meaning in full.
Story_ID: 220442
Speaker 1: Now, it's a gorgeous courthouse [U.S. Court of Federal Claims], right across from the White House [Washington, D.C.], seven judges, it's the second-highest court in the country, it's an appellate jurisdiction court next to the United States Supreme Court.  So, all of a sudden, Pettit [v. United States, 1973] is thrust forward, I'm still with the SBA [U.S. Small Business Administration], and I get a call from the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].  My mother [Mildred Miller Pettit] and father [George Pettit] are terrified.  The FBI calls me in and tells me, I'm sorry, how does this work, yeah, the FBI calls me and I'm back to Baltimore [Maryland], scared to death, come over here and they tell me they want me to be an FBI agent, and they tell me that the reason is they want me to, I can get both my [U.S.] military pay and my agent pay.  Now this is under [J. Edgar] Hoover!  Remember this now!  There are no black FBI agents!  (Laughter) So, they make me this offer to be an FBI agent, but they want me to stay on the [National] Mall [Washington, D.C.] and dress in jeans.  I don't ever have to put on a military uniform.  I'll be promoted to captain and I'll be an FBI agent at the same time.  So, I look up on the wall, and I said, "Well, otherwise H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] is on the wall, and all these other people.  (Laughter) I know exactly what you want to do.  I said, "Well, tell Mr. Hoover I appreciate it.  I'm honored, but I don't think so."  And so, I tell 'em no, the FBI, that's the end of that.  The next week or so, I get a call, and all this is happening simultaneously.  That's why it's confusing.  I get a call from the [U.S.] Air Force telling me I'm coming on active duty.
Speaker 2: Because your deferment's up?
Speaker 1: Well, just all of a sudden they want me on active duty. And so, I said well you've given me a deferment, and they said, "No."  I look at my orders and my orders are to report to an intelligence base; I forget where it was.  It was in Texas or something.  So, what the Air Force is going to do is do by the back door what the FBI couldn't do by the front door.  They're gonna order me into active duty, and put me into intelligence.  So, I go down to the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.], I put on my little lieutenant's uniform, I have a little pilot specs, I'm not a pilot, but I go ahead and knock on doors, and I knock on the door of this man by the name of Renda [ph.].  He's undersecretary for reserve affairs, and I tell him that when I went into the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], they told me if I was admitted to a [State] Bar [Association], I could go into JAG [Judge Advocate General's Corps].  But now, they're putting me into intelligence.  So, he calls down, secretary--not secretary of the Air Force, he calls down to the commandant, he calls down to commanding general of JAG, commanding general of the Air Force, and he says, "Well, why don't, I thought you wanted African Americans and how many African Americans do you have in the Air Force?"  He says, "Well, we had two applicants and we took the other one.  So--no," he said, "we took 50 percent."  He said, "Well, how many applicants did you have?"  He said, "Two."  (Laughter) So, he said, "Well, why did you take [HistoryMaker] Lieutenant [A. Dwight] Pettit?"  He said, "Well, Lieutenant Pettit was playing football.  So the other one that we took was also a Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] graduate.  He was the commander of ROTC.  Lieutenant Pettit was the group commander.  So, the secretary hits, I mean, he hits the walls.  He says, "Lieutenant, I'll take of it, don't worry about it."  I get back to the office at SBA, and I get a telegram saying that I'm being discharged for my medical problems from the United States Air Force.  I've got a bad heart, got everything.  All of a sudden, I was qualified, and they wanted me to be a pilot at first.  I was qualified for this, then I'm an athlete, now I'm running to doctors saying what's wrong with me?  The Air Force discharges me immediately.  So I'm standing there the next day, I go to the doctor and the doctor says, Dwight, you're fine.  This is just military BS evidently.  You've upset the apple cart.  Do you remember a person by the name of Admiral [Elmo R.] Zumwalt?  Admiral Zumwalt was the most popular, one of the most popular persons in military history in and around, this is now the '70s [1970s] and the reason he was because he had taken command of the [U.S.] Navy and his main thing, he was on the cover of Time magazine was to integrate the Navy, because the Navy had a history of being anti-African American, anti-black.  So, I walk in our office, I got this telegram for the Air Force, I've got these cases going and I get a call from Admiral Zumwalt's office and I get on the line and it's his commandant and he says, "Mr. Pettit, this is the office of Admiral Zumwalt, United States Navy.  We just heard about what happened to you in the United States Air Force.  We would like you to come on board as a commissioned officer.  We'll give you two ranks higher.  You'll be the second black in the United States Air Force."
Speaker 2: Navy.  United States Navy.
Speaker 1: I mean Navy.  We'll station your wife [Barbara Pettit] any place in the world by your choice, and Admiral Zumwalt wants to have a press conference you and meet you immediately upon acceptance.  I said, well Vietnam's [Vietnam War] going on.  Does that mean I'm discharged from the Air Force?  He says, "Yes."  I said, "I can't be drafted."  He says, "No."  I said, "If I don't accept Admiral Zumwalt's invitation, are there any bad feelings between the Navy and myself?"  (Laughter) He said, "No."  I said, "Well tell Admiral Zumwalt he's one of my favorite people, I love him, all the best to him," I said, "but I'm a civilian now, right?"  He says, "Yes."  I said, "Well, I'll maintain my civilian status," I thanked the Navy and I stayed with the Small Business Administration--
Story_ID: 220443
Speaker 1: So then, we come up and I argue my father's [George Pettit] case [Pettit v. United States, 1973]. And arguing my father's case, I am admitted to Maryland [State Bar Association] on the third time I take the examination.  So, I returned back to Maryland.  I just come home in my total naivete, put up a sign, open an office, get a ten thousand dollar loan from the SBA [U.S. Small Business Administration].  It's the [President Richard Milhous] Nixon administration.  I don't care what people say, but they had a different ideology in terms of it may not have been the civil rights thing in terms of what we know in terms of legislation, but it was about affirmative action money and business, so I will always regard Nixon as a great president, even though a lot of African Americans don't realize it.  And I come home, I open my office.  I'm starving to death--
Speaker 2: So what year is this?  This is '73 [1973]?
Speaker 1: This is '73 [1973].  And all of a sudden I get a call, I'm in court one day.  I was the public defender in the morning.  I'm practicing law in the afternoon.  My wife [Barbara Pettit] and I had a second baby on the way, and I get a call from the national media, that Pettit versus the United States  [Pettit v. United States, 1973] has just come down.  (Laughter) In a 4 to 3 decision, I had won Pettit versus the United States.  So, Jet magazine is there; I mean, it's just, the whole national press is back at the office.  I'm a new lawyer in town.  So, all of a sudden I'm getting all this press in Baltimore [Maryland] on Pettit versus the United States, and my father is ordered, he's given one hundred thousand dollars back pay, he's ordered to be promoted from a GS [General Schedule] 11 to a GS 14.  It was just--to be able to give back to him after he had given so much, it was just, again, you know, talk about those Godly times when God just reaches down and touches.  I mean, nothing in your life could be more perfect than to be sitting in a press conference with your daddy, who had made all these sacrifices for you, and with him being the man of the hour and, see, when I argued the case, my mother [Mildred Miller Pettit], my father, and all these walls that institute this whole magnificent institution of justice, my mother, my father, and my wife stood behind me while I argued against the United States in front of seven judges, and even one of the judges in the opinion of Pettit versus the United States gives me the highest compliment because they're able to trace the school thing, and of course, in their decision they write the whole thing up and they refer to me as learned counsel.  It was like them giving me a back-handed compliment from the school desegregation case.
Speaker 2: What does it mean for your father?  Did he ever say to you?
Speaker 1: Well, my father was this, I mean, it was funny as he watched the transition.  Your parents don't ever really believe you're real.  They always think you're a kid.  So, when I was taking the bar and all, it was, you know [HistoryMaker A.] Dwight [Pettit], you know, you're young.  Back off.  You know.  Why don't you go into the [U.S.] military and take your commission, this is before all this mess starts with the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].  Take your commission, go into the [U.S.] Air Force, and then come back and take the bar, you know, because the bar is rough and you're sort of immature, so all of a sudden during this process of litigation, he begins to find and begins to materialize with him that I'm a real lawyer, and not only am I a real lawyer, but I'm the real deal.  And so, I never forget when I argued in front of the U.S. Court of [Federal] Claims.  You come in and it's gorgeous, magnificent, just like the [U.S.] Supreme Court, "Oy-yee, Oy-yee, Oy-yee."  I mean, all the trappings of the--all seven judges come out.  It was en banc, in full.  And I mean, I got into it with two or three judges, justices and we went toe to toe for at least a half an hour, I mean, I was at the top of my game.  I thought I was so good, even the chief justice [Warren E. Burger] got on my side and began to tell them, "I told you to leave him alone!"  But I mean, it was just, it was one of my finest hours.  So, when we walked out of the courtroom, my mother and my father and my wife, my father was completely silent.  I mean, there was nothing.  You ever see a parent just standing back looking at you?  He's like, damn, this is my child!  (Laughter) I mean, it's like we got the car, we went to lunch, it was like--my wife was telling me how great I was, my mother was--you know, you were just--my father just sitting there looking up, so he went through a whole realization process, and justice was his to enjoy.  He lived for many years after that--not many years, but until he was seventy years old and in retirement he spoke all over the place, he was an icon in Harford County [Maryland], and nationally Pettit versus the United States became the lead decision for civil rights cases across the nation that established a "but for" test in terms of Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964], even when the Supreme Court says and testing, it would have struck it down had it come to the Supreme Court, because we settled at the U.S. Court of Claims.  But he still got the glory of being D. Pettit, and when I would walk into federal court years after that, the judges would say, the rules of evidence are governed by Pettit versus the United States.  Mr. Pettit, by any chance are you in any way related to anybody in Pettit versus the United States?  I would say, that's my father, and I was chief council.
Story_ID: 220444
Speaker 1: You opened your own practice and the timing is just perfect, because you, you know, just won this case [Pettit v. United States, 1973] and what kinds of cases are you starting to get in that kind of thing in the early years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, at that time, of course, floodgates of civil rights is wide open.  At that point in time, even though [President Richard Milhous] Nixon had been president, you still had very good judges.  Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964] was now law in terms of damages, so I just, my first year a few years, I just flashed in the United States District Court.
Speaker 1: So, in those early years, what, are there any particular ones that come to mind?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think, there were several that I just, I just had back-to-back victories, union cases, in fact, if you go to my website, I have all the major cases listed at that time.  I represented the organization of Baltimore cab drivers [Organization of Baltimore Cab Drivers, Inc. vs. Checker Cab Company, Inc., 1974] when they tried to raise the price of gasoline here.  I won one of the top cases in federal court and then argued in front of the court of appeals with Sutton Plaza [sic. James Scott v. Sutton Place, 1977], which was about the rights of tenants to be protected from dangers in terms of security and what-have-you, which is still good law in Maryland today, one of the major cases.  I, I just got one big high profile case after another.  I represented a little ol' lady that was covered by the Washington Post, a little Jewish lady out in Washington County [Maryland], I mean, in the bowels of racism, where they were trying to take her business to seize her property.  I represented her for over a year on that particular case.  I just, it was one right after another--
Story_ID: 220445
Speaker 1: Then, I ran into [President James Earl] "Jimmy" Carter [Jr.].  I met Jimmy Carter right here in Baltimore City [Maryland].  I just, I was just so consumed as to who was going to be the next president of the United States, I just picked out Jimmy Carter, I read about him, I saw him on the cover of Time, I saw that he hung up, hung out with [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s dad [Martin Luther King, Sr.], he put Martin Luther King's picture up, and something told me that this man was going to be president of the United States, and so one day I'm sitting in my office, and I'm on the board of directors of Johns Hopkins Hospital [Baltimore, Maryland] minority business something-or-other, I wasn't on the hospital itself, but I'm on this board and that's how I get the invitation, and I see that this man is coming from Georgia to speak, so I said, "Let me go over and hear him."  So, I go to Hopkins and I'm listening to him and somebody says, "He says he's going to be the next president of the United States."  And he starts getting heckled and then I notice his response is so positive and so on the money that he's going to be president, and so, I saw that nobody's around but maybe one aide, so I ease up to him afterwards and I said, "You know, Governor?  I think you could be president," and he's so acclimated by my warm response.  I said, "In fact, I'll tell you how much I think you're going to be president."  I said, "Can I give you a check, sir?"  So I wrote a check out on the spot for five hundred dollars to the Jimmy Carter campaign, and they invite me to come over to the campus where he's going to be speaking that evening.  There were only about forty people there, so I called my wife [Barbara Pettit] and I said, "Barbara, I don't care what you're doing.  You might think I've lost my mind but I have just met the next president of the United States, and nobody knows it but me."  (Laughter) So, she joined me and that's how the Carter years get started.
Speaker 2: And, tell us a little about your involvement with the Carter administration.
Speaker 1: Well, when Carter gets back to Georgia, to Plains, Georgia, and tells them what has happened, my call, my phone jumps off the hook. Ham [Hamilton] Jordan calls, who is the director of the campaign and will go on also to be chief of staff of the Jimmy Carter administration.  He calls and says, "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [A. Dwight] Pettit, Jimmy just told me what happened.  Everybody's so excited.  You're the first black person outside of the State of Georgia.  We understand you're a civil rights lawyer.  Can we fly in to Baltimore to meet you?"  I'm like, "Me?"  (Laughter) So, he says and if you could have some other black leaders, so I hook up the hotel, I have all reserved in and everything.  The whole national staff flies in and they, not only do I introduce them and all, but they ask me would I mind speaking for Carter at a moment's notice, and so they billed me.  I'm flying up and down the East Coast, they tell me what airport, which city, which union to go to, and so they're billing me as a civil rights lawyer who is a close friend of Jimmy Carter, cause you gotta remember now, at this point in time, this is a Georgia white male, running for president of the United States.  The black community is very apprehensive; in fact, Mrs. [Juanita Jackson] Mitchell, who had been my lawyer, came in my office and cursed me out, said I worked for you, got you in this doggone school [Aberdeen High School, Aberdeen, Maryland], and this is how you repay the black community?  You hook up with a racist peanut farmer from Georgia?  What's the matter Mrs. Mitchell?  How do you know he's racist?  Oh, she just lays me out.  So I'm out on a limb in the black community.  So, they start flying me around and I go speak, they introduce me as the civil rights lawyer, a very close friend of Jimmy Carter's.  And through that, we get closer and closer into the inside of the Jimmy Carter operation, but something happens that really develops the relationship.  He makes a mistake and, I don't know whether you remember it or not, but it's the famous gaff that he makes about ethnic purity.  He said something about ethnic purity, neighborhoods should maintain ethnic purity.  He didn't mean it like that, but the national media grabs it and in the throngs of his campaign it looks like we're gonna lose it, because all of a sudden the Georgia governor is a racist, cross the national news.  I sat down and I sent him, like a five-page telegram, which I understand he receives in the Midwest and reads it to a group of black ministers, and I tell him exactly, I lay out how he has to come out of this, this crisis.  I think they do most of the things that I suggest they implement.  So, the next day I get a call saying Governor Carter is gonna be at the Hilton Hotel for breakfast.  He would like you to join him for breakfast, and so I can't believe it, right?  So I go into the Hilton Hotel, and it's the chief of staff, it's Jimmy Carter, it was a big Catholic leader nationally, and a big Jewish leader nationally, and we all sit down for breakfast.  I'm actually sitting there.  Next, I mean the president gets up.  He's not president then.  When I walk into the room, he comes over and he hugs me and gives me a big hug and he says, "Thank you son, I'll never forget you as long as I live."  And he invites me to sit down bedside him.  And so that establishes the personal relationship that I had the small opportunity to enjoy with the president of the United States.  And so we followed that line, that closeness all through his years in the White House [Washington, D.C.].  I have automatic access, I have 24/7 access to the White House.

Speaker 1: Did it help your practice?
Speaker 2: My clientele changed.  (Laughter) It changed overnight.  All of a sudden, I'm representing Fallston [General] Hospital [Fallston, Maryland], a Republican-controlled hospital out of Maryland, I'm representing a big land deal out of New Mexico, representing, I had about four or five corporate clients.  So, all of a sudden I'm doing no rape, no robbery, no CDS [Criminal Defense Service].  All of a sudden it had been a matter of months and I had become a corporate lawyer.  But, see what he tried to do first, the first thing before that happened, he [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] tried to appoint me to the United States attorney for Maryland, which would have made me the first African American United States attorney in the nation for a state, but Senator [Paul] Sarbanes folk are the reasons it took place, yeah, did not make the nomination.  And so, as the Washington Post said, "[HistoryMaker A. Dwight] Pettit hangs in the wind."  I hung in the wind for about six months and finally the president at the White House [Washington, D.C.] was forced to back down and they brought somebody who was already in [the U.S. Department of] Justice.  They gave him a lateral transfer.  And so, that's when they asked me did I want to be deputy director of the Peace Corps, and I was never into travelling.  I told him, I said I just got my practice going.  If I'm going to do something, at least let it be in the area of law and near my home state, so I could see some advantages of it, when the administration is over.  But, I maintained a very good relationship with the administration.  He appointed me to the national Democratic compliance commission [Democratic National Committee compliance review commission], which means it was part of my responsibility to hold hearings or be involved in hearings for the upcoming 1980 convention, got to meet all the players, hung out at the White House, all the time.  It was just an amazing experience.  Went to Plains, Georgia, I got pictures up on the wall, sitting in Carter's den in Plains, Georgia, where we were discussing--I was at the [Prime Minister Menachem] Begin-[President Anwar el-]Sadat swing and then Begin-Sadat peace accords [Camp David Accords].  I was at the first state dinners, it was just a tremendous experience.
Story_ID: 220447
Speaker 1: Now let's move forward a little bit, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [A. Dwight] Pettit, to the '80s [1980s] and tell us a little bit about your involvement with [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson and his campaign for president, 1984 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, after getting political indoctrination, I ran for state's attorney's in 1978; after I wasn't appointed U.S. attorney, I tried to run for state's attorney, a very narrow vote, which I like to blame on the weather, of course, because it poured down raining on Election Day until the polls closed.  I think I lost it by something, citywide election five to seven thousand [votes], and so then in 19- I think it was '84 [1984], it was, I think Jesse's first run.
Speaker 1: But did you run for--
Speaker 2: I ran for [U.S.] Congress, but that was in, I think, congress was '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let's talk about Jesse Jackson in 1984.
Speaker 2: I think Jackson comes first, and I was asked to be his state, not state, I'm sorry, city chairman, and I had the opportunity to organize and I met Jesse during the [President James Earl "Jimmy"] Carter [Jr.] campaign, had the opportunity to organize here locally for Jesse, and play a prominent role in his campaign.  But I didn't, I didn't, I never was on an intimate basis with Jesse like I was President Carter.  I remember I was right on the inner circle.  Jesse, I more or less played a marginal local role.  I never moved to the national level.  But, I had known Jesse.  He didn't really know me, but I knew him through the Carter campaign as I indicated, and then from that I tried to spin off, because [HistoryMaker] Parren [J.] Mitchell [III], who was our great congressman here [Baltimore, Maryland], retired in '86 [1986] and I, it was a big field of about seven of eight of us, including his nephew, [HistoryMaker] Senator [Clarence] Mitchell III, and so it was a big runoff for his position, of which I, again, was leading in the polls, just like I was at the state's attorney's office, I mean state's attorney.  But my difficulty in politics, I just, I guess I was considered too brash and too much of an activist in racial matters.  I never could attract white, political money, and so it seems as though every time I had a shot--
Speaker 1: But couldn't have been any more active than the Mitchells were.
Speaker 2: Well, but you've gotta remember, the Mitchells, well he didn't win congress either.
Story_ID: 220448
Speaker 1: But what I'm saying, [HistoryMaker Senator] Clarence Mitchell, III, had the same problem I had in terms of raising money.  (Laughter) He wasn't any more successful.  I think he got a few more votes than I did, but the big money moved to Kweisi Mfume, that not only African American money that was there, which I always believe is not that much of, but the major white contributors in terms of the big businesses moved behind Mfume.  See, you have to understand, and I'm not trying to be harsh on Kweisi, but Kweisi, and at the time I was campaigning, he was on the [Baltimore] City Council, and my point was other than South Africa, which everybody was a safe issue.  Everybody was against apartheid.  What had Kweisi really done in the city council or as an activist in the community.  He had a radio show, but he had not really been, he was a good talker and when we campaigned, I mean he could do [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson verbatim.  I mean, he could stand up, "And I am somebody" and "I can believe" that he would actually give Jesse's speech and be given credit for it.  But in terms of we had gone to the same high school, at some point, we didn't know each other, but I am the one that had done all the litigation.  I am the one who is the civil rights lawyer, I'm the one who had been knocking down the doors in the federal courthouses.  What had he done in terms of the community?  My answer to the community, he said he had done nothing.  But he talked a good game, and he is still president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] today, but when you really examined Kweisi's records, where has he really stood in terms of serious controversial issues.  I didn't believe that he did.
Speaker 2: But do you think that his story of personal triumph perhaps resonated a little bit more with poor people and with some other people?
Speaker 1: Well, maybe that's the case in terms of his constituency, in terms of having the children out of wedlock, in terms of his father had been under investigation for other matters, but I don't think it would resonate with the conservative middle class of Baltimore [Maryland]'s black men.  I'll tell you what really happened.  Even though I didn't have the money, I believed I was still neck and neck with him in the polls and I believe that I would've been elected, but I stepped on my own feet, on my own foot--
Story_ID: 220449
Speaker 1: What I did, I was approached by a very good friend of mine, who had been my biggest client when I was in the struggling years.  Remember I said I represented the Organization of Baltimore Cab Drivers?  Well, this man had been the president of the Organization of Baltimore Cab Drivers, and it was my biggest case after my father's case [Pettit v. United States, 1973], it was citywide, federal court, and all types of attention.  He had retained me.  I was very grateful for that.  In this instance, he came to me and asked me to be a character witness for him in a New York narcotics trial.  He had been charged in a narcotics trial, and he was going to trial.  I said, "No, a thousand times."  But, he let me know how much I owed him and what he had done for me and how he had helped jump start my career, and then I read in the paper our mayor, at the time he testified in the trial, I didn't realize, again, my father's [George Pettit] age-old rule, you cannot do what white folks do.  And because white folks and politics had testified for people who were having criminal problems, I couldn't do that.  But, I didn't recognize, I called myself, I said, the black community will understand loyalty.  So, I went to New York, I testified as a character witness during the congressional campaign, and lo and behold, he jumped bail.  He jumped bail before I got to New York, he had jumped bail and he was on the run and before I got back to Baltimore [Maryland].  I come back to Baltimore and headlines are "Congressional Candidate Testifies for Dope Dealer."  Not that he had been convicted, but by running he became overnight, a dope dealer.  So all of a sudden when I would walk into a place where I was the lead candidate and everybody was moving to New York, Kweisi [Mfume], by that time, we had distinguished ourselves as the last two battling it out.  Everybody had dropped to another level.  Now, I'd walk into a place, a public place, and everybody would scurry to get away from me and reporters were following me and I could just do this.  You must be involved, you must have some connection.  There's no, how would you sacrifice a congressional seat to testify for somebody in a narcotics trial three weeks or four weeks out from (unclear).  It was a dumb thing to do.  But, I was a young man and--
Speaker 2: And compelled by that loyalty.
Speaker 1: I felt that I was doing the right thing.  I thought the community would understand.  But I had no idea he would jump bail!
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, he convinced me that he was innocent, that he was gonna be acquitted, I owed him, and if I'd do this favor for him, you know, we'd call it even.
Story_ID: 220450
Speaker 1: And you took another stab at politics.
Speaker 2: Well, I tried to do a small thing and come back just to secure a position in politics.  I tried to come back and made a run for the [Baltimore] City Council.  Again, in the last hours I dropped off the board by a few hundred votes.  I lost that.  So, I said well that's it.  I don't know.  But then, when Kweisi [Mfume] moved up to NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the seat opened again and I tried it again in 1996.  Now 1996 was against Elijah Cummings, who had been my campaign manager in the state's attorney's campaign against Bill Swisher [William A. Swisher], my first campaign.  So, he, I'm running against, I guess he's my prodigy, I'm his mentor, and that was, again, I'm leading in the polls.  I went to, never forget I went to party one night, and we had a man here.  I think his name is John Paterakis.  He's a millionaire if not a billionaire, and he was at the party and he had a group of white guys who were sitting at the table and they called me over and he said, "[HistoryMaker A. Dwight] Pettit, you're doing quite well in these polls not to have any money."  I said, "Well, Mr. Paterakis, why don't you, you know, spread your money around?"  See, Elijah was speaker pro temp[ore] on the [Maryland] House of Delegates or something like that, so they--
Speaker 1: For the State of Maryland.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was in a no-lose situation, 'cause if he lost, he still had that powerful position in the state.  If he won, he was going to have influence.  So, he was picking up money and I was using my own money.  I was determined I couldn't raise money.  I was not a good fund raiser, so I was going to finance my own campaign.  So, I had bought like one hundred thousand dollars in commercials and I was the only one on television, but not realizing how it was gonna swing.  So, Mr. Paterakis, I said, "How about me, Mr. Paterakis, you know, why don't you--and he laughed and he said, "you know, Dwight,"  he said, "it seems as though you have matured and become sort of moderate and you have some good positions and you doing well in the polls" he says, "but I'm so scared that if I give you money, I'm gonna turn on TV next week and you're gonna be standing on the middle screen, screaming, 'Black Power!'" (Laughter) I said "No, sir." He said, "I just can't take the chance."  Well, it was a lot of humor that night in what was being said, but sure enough, the next, like in Baltimore [Maryland] politics, this is notorious, the money moved.  I mean, you know when the money moves, and when the money moves, all of a sudden trucks appear with big campaign posters and lawn signs appear and billboards appear, and Elijah, all of a sudden, when I was on television, maybe my little commercials came on four or five times a day.  He was coming on fifty to twenty times during prime time, so a lot of the vote is what I lost.  A lot of voters, "Mr. Pettit, I saw you on TV.  I voted for you."  I said, "No, I'm not Elijah Cummings.  I'm Dwight Pettit."  He just dwarfed me, and that last three weeks, that money moved and the TVs just lit up.  Every issue that I had he usurped and became known as the person for that issue, and just swooped through the community.
Speaker 1: And, did you all remain friends throughout the--
Speaker 2: It got a little tense during the campaign, but we both put in calls to each other afterwards, and I have supported him because we were good friends.  I mean, he came out of Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] too.  He was behind my wife [Barbara Pettit] and I, but he was a good family friend and one day I'll never forget, on the campaign bus my wife and I were arguing about which direction we were going to campaign, and so Elijah just told me, he said, well candidate we'll put you off the bus and take Barbara.  I said, "Well, I guess that could be a signal as to where my level of participation in this campaign.  The wife is more popular than the candidate (laughter)."
Story_ID: 220451
Speaker 1: Let's talk about like the '80s [1980s].  How has your practice changed, or was it the same as it was in the '70s [1970s], after the [President James Earl "Jimmy"] Carter [Jr.] administration and, you know, the change in clientele.
Speaker 2: Well, I remember when [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan won.  I remember saying to myself that night, back to robbery, murder, back to the basic street practice.  During that time, I had represented some folks at different communities, I had been involved in some very, very serious, I won't call it, I'll say that people that were alleged to have had contacts with organized crime.  I can't verify that or what have you, but I did have some big cases like that where I was called in by different big law firms, but after Carter, I went back to the basics of practice and at the time, I was doing a very, very general practice and I guess you might say in the '80s [1980s] I began to roll back into additional high profile cases.  It was in civil rights I began to shift as this fourth circuit is the federal circuit here, was no longer receptive to civil rights, and so my big cases then became big criminal, high profile criminal cases, high profile public interest cases, and as we moved into the '90s [1990s] and so forth, I began to come back to, you might say, one of the things that began to develop, which really changed the direction of my practice was police shootings.  I began to pick up national police excessive force cases, which, you know, was covered by national networks and some cases that I won, so I guess that's what we are doing now.  I guess we were doing, I probably had more police shootings those type of civil rights cases, still civil rights, but police shootings where police have killed people and what have you, and I think I probably have handled more than anybody else in the state; two of them, I've handled with [Johnnie] Cochran, one I'm handling now with Cochran.
Speaker 1: And how does Baltimore [Maryland] rank in terms of police shootings in the nation?  Is it high or is it average?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always argued that unfortunately we were right up there with New York PD [Police Department], LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department].  We don't get the publicity, but I've handled, I mean, it's unfortunate as it is, I know I've handled probably at least seven or eight death cases in the last ten years, not to mention all of the police brutality cases that we handle. As well as my regular criminal practice, as well as I don't do anything else like domestic,  I don't do, I do some business, but mostly criminal and personal injury and accidents, wrongful death.  And when I've done interviews people go back to civil rights, I was a civil rights attorney, but I'm still a civil rights attorney as it relates to some of these things, but the reason I always joke about that is because this, this jurisdiction that we're in, the Reagan appointments and [President George Herbert Walker] Bush I appointments, and interpretation of [U.S.] Congress in terms of civil rights acts and what-have-you, in my opinion, have basically shut down the courts as a friend to minorities, including women, and including African Americans and including disadvantaged and including poor people, have basically been shut down as terms of the receptivity that they enjoyed at one point in time in the federal courts, so I said, in my opinion, it's an exercise in futility.  The last civil rights case I handled [Angel Watkins v. Professional Service Bureau, Ltd., 1999] was under a sexual harassment, a woman had been raped on the job and down in the federal courts.  I won the case in front of a jury of six white women and two African American males, and the judge vacated my verdict while I was following a free petition.  He says nowhere in the world a jury could find what they found.  I took it to the fourth circuit.  The fourth circuit upheld and I filed motion for writ of certiorari United States Supreme Court.  They refused to hear it.  It was so devastating to me.  I said until times change, I just can't do that to myself, much less to my client.  I mean, this was a fabulous person, African American female that was brutalized on the job by her supervisor and a jury believed her and awarded her moneys and here a judge just forgets what the Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964] was about.  Amended under [President William Jefferson] "Bill" Clinton was to give the right to jury trials, and just gonna usurp yourself for--in terms of the wisdom of a jury, and just take her verdict away.  I think that thing hurt me worse than it did her.
Story_ID: 220452
Speaker 1: In terms of politics, you, some may say, may have gotten into a little bit of trouble in 2002, when you, with the black community when you supported Governor [Robert L.] Ehrlich [Jr.]'s campaign for governor, who is a Republican, is the current Republican governor of Maryland.  Why did you decide to support his campaign?
Speaker 2: Well, I had been very disenchanted by the [Parris] Glendening administration, which was Democratic.  I had worked hard for him in his first election.  I believe that the Democratic Party nationally as well as locally had taken the African American vote for granted.  And so, when Bob Ehrlich began to make noises on the scene, I was approached by friends of mine, who indicated to me that he was not radical, he was not [Speaker] Newt Gingrich, although he had been identified as being one of his boys, but that he was really a moderate that I might enjoy talking to, and so a meeting was arranged between he and I and during that meeting, he basically came out and said, you know, [HistoryMaker A.] Dwight [Pettit], I have no problems committing to an African American agenda.  I mean, if you want to talk about a local civil rights act, considering what I just said about the federal, you know, local civil rights act, if you want to talk about economic development, if you want to talk about housing, I'm willing to sit down and not only am I willing to sit down, but I'm willing to let you craft the agenda, and I'm willing to bind myself to it in terms of judge, judicial appointments and what-have-you, in terms of females, in terms--so we sit down and it was called the--it's not a platform for the African American but it's a document that we drew up, and other African American leaders that were in this campaign, Senator [Clarence M.] Mitchell [IV], not the third man, not the one that I ran against for [U.S.] Congress, but his son, so we call him "C4" affectionately. Senator Mitchell IV, although he did lose for what he did for Ehrlich--
Story_ID: 220453
Speaker 1: How much did Michael Steele being on the ticket influence your decision?
Speaker 2: Well, that was a major influence and I was going to say, too, Billy Murphy [William H. Murphy, Jr.] is a very well-known trial lawyer here. He was part of the [Robert L.] Ehrlich [Jr.] team, a businessman by the name of Frazier, Wayne [R.] Frazier [Sr.], so there was a few of us, but I'd like to believe that I was the first other than Senator [Clarence M.] Mitchell [IV].  Senator Mitchell IV was the first, and we met that with Ehrlich and we put this together, and then when we were enlightened about the fact, I'm not sure of the time sequence but the Steele factor became a major factor.
Speaker 1: And, for the record, just tell us who Michael Steele is.
Speaker 2: Michael Steele is now the lieutenant governor of Maryland, and the first African American governor for Maryland.
Speaker 1: Lieutenant governor.
Speaker 2: Lieutenant governor, and I think only one of two African American lieutenant governors for the nation.  I think there is another one.  I'm not sure about that.  But then, I'm, after I met Ehrlich, and we talked and talked and then I met Steele, then I said, "Yeah, I can do this.  I can do this in clear conscience and with a great deal of advocacy."
Story_ID: 220454
Speaker 1: And what kind of backlash did you get as a result of it?
Speaker 2: I didn't, I mean, I did a lot of radio shows.  I did commercials, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not talking about the old guard, but especially young African Americans.  Young African Americans, you'd be surprised at a lot of 'em that can subscribe to the hidden, let's put it this way, a quiet agenda with the Republican Party.  If the Republican Party would remove this element of racism, this perception of racism, which they called ultra-right wing conservatism, that [President George Walker] Bush II subscribes to and [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan subscribed to, you would be surprised at the African Americans that are enchanted by the possibilities that the Republican Party offers in terms of that same [President Richard Milhous] Nixon dialogue we had earlier in terms of economic opportunity and enrichment and sharing a piece of the pie, and being at the table and having the opportunity to make money, because that belief is that if you're able to do that then you will have racial parity because the almighty dollar, as they say, you won't have to worry about checking in and out of the hotel because you will own the hotel, and so I was pleasantly surprised at, as I moved through the community, the base of support that was already there, and then when I gave it credibility in terms of they billing me again as a civil rights lawyer, I didn't--
Speaker 1: And as a prominent African, you know, an African American who had a lot of, who has a lot of influence in the community too, so not just a civil rights attorney.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you.  I did have--done a lot of radio and have done, I guess the African American community said hey, you didn't sell us a bad bill of goods with [President James Earl "Jimmy"] Carter [Jr.], and Carter had a lot more questions about him from where he was from than Bob Ehrlich [Robert L. Ehrlich, Jr.] did, and so I felt the groundswell of support in terms of Ehrlich and I am, I did a statewide commercial that they ran on a continuous basis in the last three weeks and I really believe, and Ehrlich's father [Robert L. Ehrlich, Sr.] including Ehrlich and other people give us the credit, a lot of cases--and his father said, "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [A. Dwight] Pettit, if it wasn't for you, my son would not be governor today."  Because what we did, even though the Republican Party at this point in time is not going to take the majority of the black vote, but we humanized him and took him out of the category of being a racist or anything that would fire the African American community up to be hostile to him.  There was no hostility, so since there was no hostility, then instead of the regular four or five percent of the African American vote throughout the state, they were able to garnish somewhere maybe between fifteen and seventeen percent and that with his traditional base gave him the overwhelming victory that he enjoyed.
Speaker 1: And Michael Steele too.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Michael, look, Michael is an intricate part of what happened in my opinion.  If Michael had not been there, regardless of what they give the credit has been given to me is as a campaign operative.  What I understand is if Michael Steele had not been there, we would not have had that bill of sale that would get us into the African American community.  I could have talked about everything else.  If I hadn't had Michael Steele to present to them, or to go on radio shows with 'em or bring 'em into, 'cause --the Baltimore Sun' here, that's when we got into the first showdown, on the eve of the election, they ran this big editorial that Michael Steele, the only thing he offers to the community is the fact that he's African American.  Otherwise, he's not qualified.  Well, Michael came to me.  I was so honored.  Michael called a press conference, at least the staff did, and they said, "You know, Mr. Pettit, Michael is gonna speak, but we want you to take the offensive.  If you will open up and go on the counter attack and the introduce Michael," and I was so honored that they did that, it was a heavy weight that they put on me, I didn't really want to be it, I wasn't looking forward to fighting with our local newspapers for a lot of various reasons, because they had been very distant from me in the past, because of my so-called activist stands, but in the most recent years, they had given me front page coverage of some of my bigger cases and what-have-you, and big murder cases I handled a few years ago, which had national attention.  So, I've been getting good press, which is part of what pays the bills.  But, I said, "Michael, if you want me to do this, I'll do this."  So, Michael is, I mean, there just is no way in the world that you can separate Michael from victory.  When I'm given the credit, I'm given the credit as a political operative in the campaign.  Michael is the reason, but Bob Ehrlich was insightful enough to do that, 'cause they asked Katherine [sic.], I mean Kathleen [Kennedy Townsend] to do that--
Story_ID: 220455
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who was the Democrat running against him.
Speaker 2: She was the Democrat nominee, a Kennedy in a Democratic state, but she basically overlooked all of the qualified African Americans, and she chose somebody who I have become very fond of, Admiral [Charles R.] Larson, who was in the [United States] Naval Academy [Annapolis, Maryland], because I sit on the Board of Regents [University System of Maryland] with Admiral Larson now, who was a great candidate and a converted Republican to Democrat, but at the time, it just looks, it was such an oversight of the African American political community, and so Michael [Steele] was just tremendously important and [Robert L.] Ehrlich [Jr.] realized that.  Not only did he make the decision, which was a gamble in some ways in his base of support, but he gave Michael, as he still does, such high profile representation within the administration, that it wasn't like okay, I'll just name this African American to get the African American vote, he actually made him a partner in the campaign and administration, and one thing I would like to say, I've done a lot of radio and a lot of TV and a lot of this has come back up, and I've separated myself from the presidential campaign.  It's like I told Michael and Bob, I said, "I walk with you guys down the streets of Baltimore [Maryland] and anyplace more, but I can't walk with [President] George [Walker] Bush, I'm not taking George Bush down Pennsylvania Avenue."
Speaker 1: Just to make it clear, you, you did this as a Democrat.  You were, it was for Ehrlich.
Speaker 2: I was in the Democrats for Ehrlich.  I wasn't an officer, but I was a heavy participant.  As the presidential campaign came up, I made it very clear to Michael that I supported them and I didn't want to get involved.  I was still a Democrat and I was still looking for a more progressive president, so I said two things.  I said, "If Bush were to become more progressive, especially in terms of his judicial appointments and what-have-you, I may be more considerate," but as far as I was concerned, Bush was continuing to move to the right.  What he would do to the [U.S.] Supreme Court would be devastating.  What he had done to the court of appeals was, what he was trying to do is devastating, or what is trying to do, and even though we got two great federal appointments in Maryland on the federal bench because of Bob Ehrlich, who was the senior congressman in Maryland, who therefore nominated the appointees, so we've had great appointments, but throughout the administration, that wouldn't have been the case in terms of the national, but I say all that to say I've been on these radio shows and I said, I have no problem justifying and defining.  I don't want to get it mixed up with the presidential campaign, so I've said I'm gonna hold off so as not to confuse the black community, but I have no problem in defining what Bob Ehrlich has done and is doing for the African American community, which they will learn of after the presidential campaign, because I am tremendously proud of he and Michael Steele.

Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [A. Dwight] Pettit, when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess in terms of an individual, it would be my father [George Pettit].  There is no question that I consider him to be one of the greatest people that I've had the opportunity to be exposed to in terms of my career.  My mother [Mildred Miller Pettit] ranks right there in terms of being the strength of our family and in terms of one incident, I guess it's kinda hard to define that because the Lord has made me, or given me the opportunity to be so exposed in so many areas to various opportunities, but I guess the crowning achievement in terms of my profession, it's funny that my first big win would be my first case [Pettit v. United States, 1973], but I guess if you look back at it, my father's case is my first case and my father's case is the dearest to me because it was my family and it was my first major win that had national significance.  I've tried cases, you know, my last big criminal case was covered by press and civil cases I've had--I don't know if you remember I tried what do you call, the Stennett cases [State of Maryland v. Eric Stennett, 2001], kid that had run over a cop's vehicle at 100 mph [miles per hour].  The cop had tried to block him and he took his [Ford] Bronco over top of the police car and killed him.  Well, that was a big case here in Maryland, and I'll never forget it.  I had a couple kids riding shotgun with me and the courtroom was packed.  The cameras were packed in.  The reporters, you couldn't even get in the courtroom.  The police were packed in and I was going to do my closing statement and the lawyer said to me, he said, "Mr. Pettit, are you nervous?  Can you do this?"  I said, "Son, if you can't do this, you're in the wrong profession.  This is what it's all about (laughter)."  I mean, this is, to walk on stage with the whole nation watching, this is what it's all about.
Story_ID: 220457
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope there's a lot more things that I will do, which would make that question premature.  I would hope that I will do some other things.  I hope that I will get an opportunity in terms of law, or even politics.
Speaker 1: You gonna give politics, do you think you might give it another try?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't, it doesn't have to be elected politics, but I'll be fifty-nine years old next month, and I'm getting ready to publish my book ['Under Color of Law,' A. Dwight Pettit], and I hope that I have the opportunity to do things in terms of our community and when I talk about our community, I'm talking about the national community of where I will be able to have more influence, impact in terms of the direction of this nation, direction of our laws, and their application to the whole community, not just the African American community, but of course, the African American community particularly, but expanding that to the needs of Americans both black and white, in terms of the underprivileged and the have-nots of our society.  So, I look forward to that type of hopefully national impact at some point in time, where I can be looked upon to some degree how [HistroyMaker Reverend] Jesse [L. Jackson] is looked upon at his favorable base, that he's been a fighter for our nation for justice throughout his career.  We're not even gonna talk about [Reverend Dr. Martin] King [Luther King], of course, but I guess I look at it in terms of wearing that mantle and when my career is completed.
Story_ID: 220458
Speaker 1: That's a photograph of my graduating class at [William H.] Lemmel Junior High School [Baltimore, Maryland] in 1960, just before Aberdeen High School [Aberdeen, Maryland], and that's right at the top, that would be third from the right looking at it, directly in front, and I guess I would have been fourteen years old.
Speaker 2: And that's my mother [Mildred Miller Pettit] and father [George Pettit].
Speaker 1: Could you just tell us their names again?
Speaker 2: George David Pettit, Mildred, I call her Henry sometimes, but Mildred Henry Louise Miller Pettit, Miller was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: About what year was that?
Speaker 2: And I guess this was probably somewhere, I would suggest they were going to some type of formal dance and so it was probably in the '60s [1960s] or '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: That's my father, George David Pettit and I, celebrating the news, upon the receipt of the news of his victory in the U.S. Court of [Federal] Claims in Pettit versus the United States [Pettit v. United States, 1973] on a 4 to 3 decision.
Speaker 2: In 1973?
Speaker 1: In 1973.
Speaker 2: That's my wife and I, Barbara Pettit, with the Democratic nominee for president, Jimmy [Earl "Jimmy"] Carter [Jr.], in Plains, Georgia, where we flew down and brought in Ms. (unclear), who was head of the Afro[-American Company] (unclear), for the first interview of President Carter's, or to-be President Carter's, you wouldn't even say administration at that point in time.
Speaker 1: In what year?
Speaker 2: That would have been--he was elected in 1976.
Speaker 1: So was this in 1976?
Speaker 2: This was right after, just before the presidential, just before the election where Gerald [Rudolph] Ford [Jr.] starts.  He just received the nomination.
Speaker 1: And that is my great-grandfather on my father's side and I cannot, I picked that picture up this morning and I'd have to identify by name.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's fine.  What year do you think it was taken?
Speaker 1: I have no idea.  My son [Alvin Dwight Pettit, Jr.] brought that back from his travels in North Carolina.  (Simultaneous) Well, my dad was born in the 1920s, so early 1900s.
Speaker 2: And again, that's my dad upon receiving the news and we were waiting for the press and getting ready to go out and do a national press interview on his victory, Pettit versus the United States.
Speaker 1: In 1973?
Speaker 2: In 1973.
Speaker 1: That was the opening of my office in Baltimore City [Maryland] after returning from the [U.S.] Small Business Administration coming home and I opened my offices on Charles Street, which is considerably downtown Baltimore, so you can see my dad and family had joined me for that celebration.
Speaker 2: And what year was that?
Speaker 1: In 1973.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's my daughter to the left, Nahisha Tamara Pettit; my wife in the middle, Barbara Pettit; and my son, Alvin Dwight Pettit, Jr.; and, I guess the kids hanging in that picture looked to be about seven or eight years old, so I would assume, I think, that's somewhere in the mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Actually, look in the monitor there.  Which one is that?
Speaker 2: That's a very dear picture to me.  That's my mother and father walking down Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore City, with me in my father's arms, and that would have been somewhere.  In fact, we must, it must be when he came to Baltimore prior to coming here to live, because I guess I'm about, I must be no more than 2 1/2, 2 years old.
Speaker 1: So, that's probably 1941.
Speaker 2: See, I was born in '45 [1945] so that would be around '47 [1947] or 1948.  It was always when I was in politics and people at times said I wasn't a Baltimorean, and I said, "I may not have been born here, but I don't think I could be here any earlier."  (Laughter) Pennsylvania Avenue is a very famous street in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: That's my family and I again, my wife, Barbara Pettit, sitting on the back of my car at a picnic with our two kids, Alvin and my daughter, Nahisha, and they must have been at that time somewhere around five or four years of age, so that would have put us somewhere in the early 1970s.
Speaker 2: And that's my father, George David Pettit, and that would have been somewhere after his graduation, somewhere in the area of probably 1950, 1951.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is, I'm in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and in ROTC in your junior year, you go away to camp.  It's like an officers candidate school [U.S. Air Force Officer Training School], and in this particular case, we're up in, we're refueling a [Boeing] B-52, and so that's an [U.S.] Air Force tanker that we're in and the power that's taken us through the turns and getting us acclimated to high level flying.  I guess we're at about 40,000 feet.
Speaker 2: What year is that?
Speaker 1: That would have been, let's see, that would have been 1965, two years before graduation [from Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I think we're going in officers' training school somewhere in the summer, I think it is.  No, it's in the junior year, so that would have been '66 [1966].  I graduated in '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: This particular picture is very dear to me because this represents my speaking at Aberdeen High School, for the 1978 commencement, and it was such an honor to me that the school invited me back, I understand, through the impetus of the black student union, which would make me not only its first African American male graduate, but also its African American male, first African American male, or African American period, commencement speaker.
Speaker 1: And did you give the year?
Speaker 2: That would have been 1978.
Speaker 1: This was my freshman year.  It may not be my freshman year.  It could be my sophomore year at Howard University as a member of the Howard University football team, and that would have been 1964, then it was 1964, 'cause that's when we had one of the greatest teams in Howard's history, athletic history.
Speaker 2: That's my wife and I, Barbara Pettit, on a cruise in the Caribbean, and I guess that would have probably been about somewhere in the area of 1997 to 1998.  We had been married for thirty-seven years this past August, and had been together since we were freshmen in college, which would be, put us together for forty-one years.
Speaker 1: That's my wife, Barbara and I, during a New Year's Eve party that we gave in our home.  Well, that's Barbara Pettit.  Barbara, Nell is her middle name, N-E-L-L, Moore is her maiden name, Pettit, and that's a New Year's Eve celebration we gave in a Hilton Road, Baltimore, Maryland home, somewhere in the mid-'70s [1970s].  In fact, Oprah [Winfrey] was at her fortieth birthday party, 'cause Oprah and all of us were real good friends.
Speaker 2: Oprah stays in Baltimore?
Speaker 1: That's The Greatest, Muhammad Ali, with my son in the middle, Alvin Dwight Pettit, and that's probably 1976 or I would say '77 [1977], 'cause every time after the presidential election, every time the Muslims would have Muhammad Ali here, 'cause everybody always felt we looked so much alike, they'd always have me as, like his major escort to introduce him through the community and, in fact, the funny thing about it in 1977, while I was awaiting the nomination for U.S. attorney, the Muslims had asked me, called me and asked me to do three rounds with the Champ.  (Laughter) We were supposed to do the three rounds at the Baltimore Civic Center [Baltimore, Maryland], and I was so excited about it and I called the White House [Washington, D.C.], because I didn't want to give my opposition in the [U.S.] Senate any opportunity to squash my potential nomination, and I was concerned about the affiliation with the Muslims and the White House told me that maybe I should not do it, and that's one of the few things in my life that I'm disappointed that I didn't do (laughter) 'cause somebody else filled in for me and they had a great time at the civic center, and I was going to tell him, Champ, now don't be crazy, we're gonna get in here and we're gonna dance and play and don't lose it (laughter).
Speaker 2: You'll probably would have given him a run for his money (laughter).
Story_ID: 220459
Speaker 1: That's my graduation ceremonies at Plattsburgh, New York, in 1966, and it's the officers, sort of officers candidate school [U.S. Air Force Officer Training School] that ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] people are required to finish.  I'm on the end, first person, second person from the left, from the right, rather, standing next to my flight commander, and that was, as I said, Plattsburgh, New York, the graduation ceremonies after the summer, spending that summer in basic training.
Speaker 2: That is, I'm speaking there to the graduating class of Eastern High School in Baltimore, Maryland.  The reason that that's such a major event is because that's one of the cases that I took in terms of the community activism.  It was a school which had been very famous in Baltimore, an all girls' school, which had a very cross-racial student body and was slated for closing and the community leaders came to me and asked me would I litigate to keep it open, and I filed for an injunction.  The case was eventually decided in favor of the city and the school was closed, but there was such gratitude for my involvement that the community invited me to be commencement speaker.
Speaker 1: That was just taken, that's Michael Steele on the left, the lieutenant governor of Maryland, that's Governor Bob Ehrlich [Robert L. Ehrlich, Jr.] on the right, the governor of Maryland, that's me in the middle, and that photograph was just recently taken at the [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] Day parade, or Martin Luther King Boulevard.  The governor and lieutenant governor came in to walk the parade and I was invited to accompany them, and that was this year, well let's see, it was this winter, so this is 2004, Martin Luther King, yeah, it would be 2004.
Speaker 2: Now, which number are you?
Speaker 1: Number 82.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's, that is me playing football at Aberdeen High School [Aberdeen, Maryland].  The year would have been approximately 1963, probably my senior year, and the man at the bottom, is, I can't remember the assistant coach's name to the right.
Speaker 2: Hang on one second, Mr. Pettit.  So, you're number 82?
Speaker 1: Right, number 82.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, what year?
Speaker 1: That would have been 1967, I'm sorry, 1963, my senior year in high school.
Speaker 2: I don't remember the coach's name to the right.  He was an assistant, but the coach to the left is the very famous man that I talked about and I always called sort of like a, maybe not a second father 'cause I had a lot of strong uncles and all, but he was a very important man in my life.  He was the varsity head coach of Aberdeen High, and he was just a great man and, boy, he (unclear).  That's the man, Coach Jim Smith, James Smith, but he's very affectionately known as Jim Smith, and that's the one that put the varsity football team on their knees and said this kid is gonna play on this team, and if you don't like it, you can leave now, and that's a nice way of saying it (laughter).
Speaker 1: That is my 1964 defensive line, that's me if you can see me on the end, number 82, and that's a game at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  You know, I have a great one that I meant to bring this morning and I walked out and forgot it, with me catching a touchdown pass right in the middle of the picture, it's a photograph, it's great, and I forgot it.
Speaker 2: What year is this, Mr. Pettit?
Speaker 1: That would have been 1964.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's my wife, Barbara Pettit.  We are invited to the White House [Washington, D.C.].  It's a picnic that day that we were celebrating with the Carters [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr. and First Lady Rosalynn Carter] and others and staff, and that would have been probably 1977.
Speaker 1: That's me leaving the football field at Howard University after a game and that would have been 1967.
Speaker 2: That's some of my teammates, Zelly Dow [ph.] on the left, Mongo [ph.] in the middle holding the lady, myself holding the homecoming queen, who is the lady they were holding, and Bobby Manse [ph.], the other end on the football team.  That's homecoming, and that would have been, I know when that was.  That was 1967, my senior year, 'cause I was probably, yeah, it was my senior year and I can't think of the lady's, I can't think of the homecoming queen's name (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's my mother, Mildred [Miller] Pettit, Mildred Pettit, and myself at my residence outside my residence at 3500 Hilton Road [Baltimore, Maryland], and I would say that that was probably about ten years ago, so it was probably about 1994.
Speaker 2: That's my grandbaby, and the interesting thing about her name, she was named originally after my father.  My kids hold my father in such esteem, that her original name was George David Pettit.  Finally my daughter [Nahisha Tamara Pettit] was convinced to feminize it and she made it Georgia David Pettit, and that was this year so, I think it was last year's graduation they sent it to me, so it would have been 2003.
Speaker 1: That's the homecoming 1964 game of Howard University versus Hampton Institute [Hampton University] in Hampton [Virginia], and that was the interesting thing about that game.  I said when Howard had that great winning season with one of the greatest teams in this history, and we went 8 and 2, and we were invited to play everybody's homecoming, because Howard hadn't beat anybody in a couple of years, but that was their Renaissance of academics, athletics, and it also was a nationally acclaimed academic team also.
Speaker 2: That's my family that became the campaign picture for the 1986 congressional campaign.  That's of course, me at the top, my daughter, Nahisha Tamara Pettit, on her left hand side, my wife, Barbara, Barbara Nell Pettit in the middle, and my son, Alvin Dwight Pettit, Jr. to the right.
Speaker 1: Can you spell your daughter's name, Mr. Pettit?
Speaker 2: N-A-H-I-S-H-A.
