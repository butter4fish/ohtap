Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] Michel du Cille.  Michel is spelled M-I-C-H-E-L, last name is du Cille, D-U, space, capital C-I-L-L-E.
Speaker 1: Spelled with a small D, right?
Speaker 2: Spelled with a small D, yes, lowercase D-U, space, capital C-I-L-L-E.
Speaker 1: Now is there, there a story behind the meaning of the name?  I know it's French, but.
Speaker 2: I--I know it's French, and my family have--we have discussed it many times, but none of us have ever done a true deep history search.  It's very difficult in the--from being from Jamaica--very difficult to find records for--from, from times from the 17th to 18th century, when slavery was in full blown operation.  So we, we only surmise that some European landowner is the origin of the name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We've often thought that maybe the Henry Louis Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] should, should do, do a, a family history for us, for, for--what does he call his program ['Finding Your Roots']?  It's--gosh, I've forgotten his what--what, what he calls his program.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I can't remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --but I know--yeah, he does--he helps people, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --find their ancestry, out there.
Speaker 2: Find their family.
Speaker 1: Now it's--now in--well, your first name, Michel, but because you are an artist, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --you care to tell us the--
Speaker 2: Well, my, my first name--my true first name is Michelangelo.  My dad [Frank du Cille, Sr.] said that he named me after the artist, Michelangelo.  My mom [Lolita DeMont du Cille] said that she had a dream that involved the angel, Michael, close to when I was born.  So I think that the two of them just kind of put it together as Michelangelo.  Now, as a photojournalist and even when I was in school, it was very difficult to have this long Michelangelo name, 'cause the kids--it just gave the kids something to tease you about, so I've always kept it at Michel, but spelled it without the A.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay, January 24th, 1956.  In fact, my birthday was this past Friday.  I was born in Kingston, Jamaica, in--I even know the street name--Kingston, Jamaica, Newark Avenue in Kingston, Jamaica.  My, my aunt was a midwife, and she delivered all of my brothers and myself at 15 Newark Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I am--I am primarily a senior photojournalist.  I hold the title of associate editor at The Washington Post.  I've--I'm a former director of photography and former picture editor here at The Washington Post.  I've been here since April of 1988, so I've kind of--I hold a senior status--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --here at The Washington Post.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is January 27, 2014.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in the studio--the photography studio of The Washington Post on 1150 15th Street Northwest, Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 660366
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --lightweight questions that we ask as kind of a warm up--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, anything Jamaican (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Anything West Indian.  I love curries, curry--curry goat is probably my top favorite, but curry chicken, curry beef, curry rice (laughter), love it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Probably green.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Probably Christmastime.  My wife's [Nikki Kahn] birthday is on Christmas day, and we, we celebrate both her birthday and Christmas with family.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Again, Jamaica--all things Jamaica.  I--we rece- I've been down to Jamaica twice this past year, in 2013, and I just love being there--love it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I would say--I tell people a lot that I'm just a regular guy.
Story_ID: 660367
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask about your family history now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Frank du Cille, Sr.] side, but we'll start with your mother's first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your moth- mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Lolita DeMont du Cille, D-E-M-O-N-T, du Cille.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her maiden name was DeMont.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had--I had always spelled, spelled it DuMont, D-U.  Then I looked at her birth certificate just recently and saw that it was spelled D-E-M-O-N-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a capital M in that name or--
Speaker 2: I--in, in the birth certificate, they, they capitalized it, but the D was uppercase on the birth certificate.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what is your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I can only remember, and I would have to go back and again check her birth certificate, but I believe that her birthday is April 25th, 1925.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm not positive about the 25th.
Speaker 1: Okay, now where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Kingston, Jamaica as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now what can you tell us about the ancestor on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them?  And are there any stories about what they were doing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The furthest back that we've been able to trace is that my mother's mother was an India- Indian from India.  In the islands and in South America there is a number of In- East Indians, who came to this part of the hemisphere on indentured servitude.  And Jamaica has a very high population of Indians, and my mother was an Indian.  We, we heard, but we were never able to confirm that she was from--that her folks came from Calcutta [India], but we were never able to confirm that.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that's the family story (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's my mother's mother, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know what her surname was?
Speaker 2: Her, her surname was Iris Gopal.
Speaker 1: Gopal, okay.  That's G--
Speaker 2: And on her--on the birth certificate, it's spelled Iris, I-R-I-S, G-O-P-A-L.
Speaker 1: So is there a, a story about--it may not be, but is there a story about why or how her family came over?  Was there some kind of--
Speaker 2: No, we've--we never--we never really got those details.  My mother did not--was not raised by her mother.  Her mother was, as far as I understand it, that my mother was born out of wedlock and that my grandparents were never married.  So the details of growing up and having that close connection to my grand- my, my mother's parents was, was not something that I experienced.  In fact, I don't remember my grandfather at all.  I do remember my grandmother because I--because of my frequent trips back to Jamaica. After college [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], I went and found her.  And then I lost her again, and then I've recently--well, in the last five years or so heard that she's passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we were never able to keep close contact.
Speaker 1: Now what about your grandfather?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: My mother's--on my mother's side?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I just know that his last name was De--DeMont, but I don't remember his first name.  I would have to look it up on my--on my mother's birth certificate.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories about him?
Speaker 2: No--well, I, I, I do remember one story, a horrible story, that he was killed when my mom was a child, that he died before she--before she was a teenager.  I'm not sure what age she was when my father--and that he was killed in a fight.  He was, he was murdered in a--in a fight.  That's the only story I remember about my mother's father.
Story_ID: 660368
Speaker 1: Any of his relatives still around that you know of?
Speaker 2: No, we were never--we--he, he--my, my mom [Lolita DeMont du Cille] was raised by his two sisters.  My aunt, Ethel [Ethel DeMont (ph.)], and my aunt, Esther [Esther DeMont (ph.)]--Ethel and Esther, right--yes.  And they were, of course, his old--his older sisters, so they were much older than my mother's father.  But she--they raised my mother.  And of course, they were in Jamaica.  They were middle class--somewhat upper middle class, and so they raised her in kind of a Victorian way, very strict, very proper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and they kept her separated away from her mother [Iris Gopal] as much as they could, mainly because of that Victorian thing.  You know, they were very light skinned people.  They were--they were from--they were Middle Eastern, because my, my father--my grandfather on mother's side, again, I have not confirmed, was either Syrian or Lebanese.  We believe he was Syrian.  He was very light skinned.  The pictures that we've seen of him show him as being a very light skin man.  So, hence, my mother was about my complexion, and so my two aunts, when they raised her, they raised her to be separate from the Indian part of her birthright.
Speaker 1: So, did they raise her as a--as a Middle Easterner or Sy- Syrian or Leban--
Speaker 2: As, as Jamaican Syrian, which is, you know, a--the, the upper crust of Jamaica.
Speaker 1: I think you were telling me off camera that Edwin Seaga--
Speaker 2: Yes, Edward Seaga (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Edward.
Speaker 2: Yes, Edward Seaga, the former prime minister of Jamaica.  My grandfather look almost exactly like him.  I saw pictures of grandfather, and when I see him I think that he looks just like my grandfather.  And Edward Seaga is from--if I'm not incorrect, his lineage is Syrian or one of those Middle Eastern countries.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so Jamaica, you know, a lot of different--it's a more of a melting pot than--
Speaker 2: Yes, it's, it's--
Speaker 1: --people think of.
Speaker 2: --it's, it's very much a melting pot.  In fact, the coat of arm- the, the national motto of the country is: out of many one people.  When, when Jamaica became independent in 19--I believe it was 1962, one of the things that they held dear to as the new country formed was that we are very mixed out of many one people.  So, you know, I've got Syrian; I've got--I think Syrian--I've got Indian; I've got African blood in me, and so we're, we're very mixed in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: So the, the Syrian side was Christian I take it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Although, although, my mother was not raised as a super deep Christian.  My father [Frank du Cille, Sr.] was raised as a very deep Christian, and, and he, he himself became a minister, but we'll get to my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, now did--did your--so I take--'cause there are a lot of mysteries around your mother's family, but did, did she, she--well, did she just grow in a time you just didn't ask questions and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean yes, and, and she was young.  She was--she was not even quite a teenager when her father passed away.  But she had always been living with the aunts even before her father passed away.  And so she, she never really lived with, with, with the Indian mother, mainly because they kept her away from her, you know.  They have--they have their ways of doing those things back then, of keeping the child away from their real parent.
Story_ID: 660369
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Lolita DeMont du Cille] talk about what her aspirations were when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother--my mother was a fantastic seamstress.  In fact, she made wedding dresses.  She was--she was the person--wherever she moved to, she was the person that people came to to make these fabulous wedding dresses that she would design herself, so she was a seamstress.  Unfortunately, all of my mother's life she was ill.  My youngest brother [Houston du Cille]--well, there was--I, I--there was a child after my youngest brother, and he--so I have--I currently have four brothers.  There are five of us boys, and there was the one girl that came died at childbirth.  And that was kind of the beginning of when she got very, very sick.  And we found out only--she died at fifty years old in 1980.  We only found out very close to her death that she was suffering from lupus all those years.  She had been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis; she had been diagnosed with severe kidney problems and severe pancrea- pa- pa- pa- pancre- not--
Speaker 1: Pancreatic--
Speaker 2: Pancreatic--well, it wasn't pancreatic cancer, but it was--she, she had issues with her pancreas all those years, and no one ever really put it together that it was really lupus.  Because what lupus does is over a long period of time, fifteen, twenty years, every organ begins to go, and the--usually the last one--usually the last one to go is the heart, and she actually died of heart failure.  But it was too late.  I think now modern science is much more advanced, and they're able to control lupus better.  But she passed away at fifty years old of lupus, so she never got to launch, you know, a full blown career.  She was homemaker and a seamstress.
Story_ID: 660370
Speaker 1: Let me go--I'm gonna go to your father's [Frank du Cille, Sr.] side, and then we'll put (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --'em together.  Can, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's [sic.] full name is Daniel Maurice, and I think it's M-A-U-R-I-C-E, du Cille [Daniel du Cille].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I know his place of birth is Kingston, Jamaica.  I do not know my grandfather's date of birth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is something that I would have to research.  I know that he was--many, many years ago there was a train that ran from Montego Bay [Jamaica] to Kingston.  You know, the, they--those are the two largest cities on the island.  And they called it the diesel, because it was a train that ran by a diesel engine, so we, we grew up hearing that he was the diesel engineer on the train.  And so he would leave Kingston and travel through the day to Montego Bay, overnight in Montego Bay, and come back to Kingston.  Well, he had two separate families, one in Kingston, one in Montego Bay.  And many years--well, actually 1998, when my father passed away, I actually met one of my aunts who was one of the children from the opposite side of the island, from the Montego Bay side.  So the, the, the--my grandmother that he was married to was in Kingston, and the other family was in Montego Bay.
Speaker 1: So this is your, your grand--
Speaker 2: My grandfather.
Speaker 1: Your grandfather, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My grandfather.  He had two families.  And then I do remember a cousin that came to live with us when I was maybe fourteen--thirteen, fourteen.  He came; he was a lineage from the Montego Bay side, and we even keep in touch today.  He lives in Toronto, Canada.  But that was the stories that we heard growing up about my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Now what about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother--and I was wracking my brain trying to remember her first name [Florence Davy du Cille].  Her first name--I'm, I'm sorry; I have to look at the birth certificate.  I do not remember my grandmother's first name.
Speaker 1: Well--what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I--I'm sorry.  I have to look it up.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't remember my grandmother's maiden name or first name.
Speaker 1: Now, now was she born in Kingston as well?
Speaker 2: She was born in Kingston.  All of my family--all of my grandparents were born in, in Kingston.
Speaker 1: And are there any, any stories about her side of the family--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) through--
Speaker 2: I think, you know, growing up we heard a lot about my grandfather and his exploits on the train, but not about my grandfather [sic.].  The only memory I have of her is at a funeral when I was maybe about twelve or so.  I remember her being at a funeral, and I don't even remember whose funeral it was.  But I don't--you know, don't remember my grandmother.  We did not spend a lot of time with our grandparents.
Story_ID: 660371
Speaker 1: Did your father [Frank du Cille, Sr.] have a chance to go to school and?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father was an extremely educated man.  He began in Jamaica, you know, attending one of the best schools in Kingston [Jamaica], and I'm forgetting the, the name of it.  But it was a private school in Kingston--in high school that is.  But he became a writer--a reporter for the Jamaica Gleaner, G-L-E-A-N-E-R.  That's the, the big newspaper on the island.
Speaker 1: And it certain is, yeah.
Speaker 2: And he--I don't remember how long he was a writer for The Gleaner, but he was a writer.  He also did a lot of work with the trade unionists.  When Michael Manley was a young man, they--he was a contemporary of Michael Manley, and they ran in circles together.  Then he--then he turned to the ministry.  He, he kind of diverted away from politics and, and the trade unionist stuff and became a minister of the gospel.
Speaker 1: What denomination was he?
Speaker 2: The denom- the denomination that I remember him last being connected to was called New Testament Church of God--New Testament Church of God, and they're still--they're still very big in Jamaica, and I believe that they are somehow connected to the Church of God organization.  But one (laughter)--I'm kind of jumping ahead a little bit, because when we immigrated to the United States in--we immigrated to the United States in July of 1970.  And my dad, being a minster with the New Testament Church of God for over thirty some years, went to the local New Testament Church of God in Gainesville, Georgia, and said, "We're gonna come visit your church.  My family just moved from Jamaica."  And I remember my dad telling the story of--not really understanding why the man looked so puzzled, but he received the phone call after he arrived back home from the visit with the minister.  And the request was, "Please don't come.  It would upset our parishioners too much because in our church, we don't have--we don't worship with blacks."
Speaker 1: Now this is interesting because the--I had a discussion with somebody the other day about the history of the Methodist church--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, rooted in abolitionism.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And when it comes here, it splits between the southern and the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --northern Methodist.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --amazing, yeah.
Speaker 1: --here it becomes a segregated church.
Speaker 2: Yeah, same thing with--the same thing with the Presbyterians.  So, so what my dad did was we began to visit--first, first what he did was he said, okay, we'll just have our own church.  And so we would have a church--church service on Sunday morning right at home, and he--we would invite, you know, neighbors and friends and people that he knew, and we would have church right in the living room.  But, of course, you know, there was no church to make his livelihood, to feed the family, so my dad decided to, to--before--actually before we immigrated, he had contacted a lo- the local newspaper in Gainesville, Georgia, and--the Gainesville Times [The Times], and they hired him as a reporter because of his experience from years ago as a reporter.  And so that was the way that he was able to feed the family, by being a reporter.
Story_ID: 660372
Speaker 1: Now your father [Frank du Cille, Sr.] was educated in, in Jamaica right?
Speaker 2: In Jamaica, yes.  He went to c- he went to--I believe he went to Jamaica College [Kingston, Jamaica].  And so when he--when we immigrated here to the states, he wanted to continue in the ministry.  So while he was a reporter in Gain- in Georgia, he was going to school because his--they did not accept his Jamaica degree here.  So he pretty much started over and got a bachelor's degree right in Gainesville, Georgia.  I believe it was Brenau College [Brenau University] in Gainesville, Georgia.  And he then applied to Atlanta, Atlanta Seminary [ph.], which is a Presbyterian seminary, and became a Presbyterian minister.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a reason why he chose Gainesville, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was that--I think it was the opportunity that he got becor- because I need--I need to back up a little bit.  Before we immigrated, the paper hired him as a reporter, and they sponsored our family.  You know, when you're--when you're--become an immigrant, you have to be sponsored by someone, either another family member, or an organization, or a--an employer.  And so his employer sponsored this big family to move to Gainesville, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he got the job before (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So he got the job and then he brought the family over.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So that, that--that's why Gainesville, Georgia.  I think that he was passing through, he was visiting, and he said let me try and see.  And, and I remember he told the story that he showed up to apply for the job as a reporter, and he really didn't have a resume in hand.  And he--when they asked him for a resume, he said, "Well, could you let me have a typewriter, and I'll type one out right now?"  And they did, and he typed out his resume, and as the story is told by him, the publisher hired him on the spot.  I mean, I think this was a very forward thinking man.  In fact, I'm trying to remember his name, because when I--when I graduated from high school [Gainesville High School, Gainesville, Georgia], I remember he gave a, a gift as a photography book and signed it.  And I've since misplaced the book, but I don't remember his name.  But he was the publisher for--the owner--the, the people who owned the Gainesville Times [The Times] was called Southland Publishing [Southland Publishing Company] back then, and he was the pub- publisher and owner.
Speaker 1: Did your father have any link to them before he came to the United States?
Speaker 2: No.  He, he walked into the newspaper office and applied for work.  And they started talking, and they hit it off, and he became a reporter, and the next thing you know they agreed to sponsor his family to come here.  I can only (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now this is--
Speaker 2: --say that that's a miracle, because the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, this, this would have been in--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1970], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: So he--
Speaker 2: --so he got the job probably months before or a little about a year before.  And so, but I remember all of us arrived in Atlanta [Georgia].  Getting off the plane, there were--there were five boys.  And I have two sisters [Evelyn du Cille Lawson and Cislyn du Cille], which I forgot to put on the--on the printout.
Speaker 1: Okay, on the questionnaire (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  My two sisters are adopted.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm gonna ask you about them in a second.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 660373
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to when your parents [Lolita DeMont du Cille and Frank du Cille, Sr.] met.
Speaker 2: Yes.  When my parents met (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is, is there a story about how your parents met or how they got together?
Speaker 2: I only remember that he was pursuing--he was courting this young woman that was brought up as upper middle class, and the two aunts [Ethel DeMont (ph.) and Esther DeMont (ph.)] that raised her didn't like it.  And the only memory I have is of them talking about how it was difficult for them to court, because the two sisters refused to allow free access, you know, to, to meet each other.  And so they had to--they had to meet each other in other--at, at other--in other ways other than him coming to the house.
Speaker 1: Were their barriers due to custom, I mean in terms of--that separated the races in Jamaica or?
Speaker 2: It--it's, it's, it's class.
Speaker 1: Class more than race.
Speaker 2: It's--I think it's class more than race.  Because they were the so called upper crust, and for a black man--a darker skinned man to come and court their very light skinned relative was just not something that was ordinarily done back then.  And this would have been, you know, the, the '30s [1930s], right, the mid-'30s [1930s], so they, they kept them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, this would have been in the--
Speaker 2: --they kept them apart.
Speaker 1: --in the '40s [1940s], right?  This been--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) '40 [1940].
Speaker 1: --this would've been in the '40s [1940s], right?
Speaker 2: Well, okay they were born '25 [1925].  Yeah, so it would've been in the '40s [1940s], yeah.
Speaker 1: It was in the--
Speaker 2: Yes, 'cause if they were--he married--she was sixteen years old when they married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was very young.  And so if they were courting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this is during World War II [WWII] time, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: If they were courting from, you know, when she was fifteen or so, or even earlier then--it was that this boy was coming around and they didn't like it.
Speaker 1: So this is the--around the time of the war--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --World War II.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And now did your father serve in the war at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, my father did not serve in the military.
Speaker 1: Okay, but they meet and, and she gets married when she's--
Speaker 2: The--she, she was sixteen when they married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, that is early.  That's really very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's very early.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: But I think part of it was, you know, there was this--they were keeping (unclear), keeping them apart, and so I think, you know, they, they eloped and, and then went against the, the two--the two wishes.
Speaker 1: Now was this before your father finished his degree and everything?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know--I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I guess--
Speaker 2: --I ba- I ba--
Speaker 1: --it would have to be.  I'm thinking--
Speaker 2: I believe yeah, because he, he, he was born--she was born in 1925, and he was older than her.  He was maybe nineteen or twenty--probably eighteen, nineteen--so he would have been just finishing, you know, what, what, what, what in Jamaica we call secondary school.  Rather than high school, it's called secondary school.  So he would have been just going on to college [Jamaica College, Kingston, Jamaica] right around then.
Story_ID: 660374
Speaker 1: When you consider your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they walk, talk, what they look like even, who, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my father [Frank du Cille, Sr.]--you know, same body build, you know.  We've always been kind of large bodied people.  You know, characteristically, I think my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and did they--once they got married--well, they eloped, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Then was--were, were things--did the rift kind of heal after they eloped, or did it get wider?
Speaker 2: No, they went to live with my father's family.  They went to live with--you know, in this--there was this big house in, in--there was a part of--part of Kingston [Jamaica] that's called Saint Andrews [Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica] and, and beyond Saint Andrews is, is the Blue Mountains.  And so they had family all over that area.  And of course, he had tons of brothers and sisters that--you know, in Jamaica it's like when you have a house, ever-be--it's everybody else's house (laughter).  So he lived for--I think for a while he lived with his--with his parents [Florence Davy du Cille and Daniel du Cille], and then he probably lived with some of his siblings, and then he got his own place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so when he came to the U.S., he had his degree and he was--basically, he was--
Speaker 2: He was already educated and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --already was--had a career as a--as a minister and a writer.
Speaker 1: --and was really trying to establish the family in the United States.
Speaker 2: In the United States, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 660375
Speaker 1: Can you name your siblings from the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --oldest to the--
Speaker 2: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) youngest?
Speaker 2: I should say before we move on from my dad, he went on to receive his doctor of divinity degree from Louisville Seminary [Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he, he--in fact, he wrote--his dissertation was called indigenization and that's indigenization of the--of the Presbyterian church.  And his theory was that the, the black side of the Presbyterian church were basically--turned their back on the holy roller side of the Presbyterian church, meaning that they became charismatic and sang gospel songs and was much more lively than the frozen chosen that they call Presbyterians.  So anyway, that's a quick aside to my dad.  My siblings--my oldest brother's name is Frank [Frank du Cille, Jr.], 'cause, 'cause my dad's name was.  He--my dad's name was, by the way, Frank Olivier du Cille [Frank du Cille, Sr.], and my brother's name is Frank Olivier, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My second oldest brother's name is Donavan [Donavan du Cille], D-O-N-A-V-A-N, and my--I'm the third one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then my fourth brother is Oliver [Oliver du Cille], and my youngest brother is Houston [Houston du Cille], like the city.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so all, all brothers.
Speaker 2: All brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The two girls [Evelyn du Cille Lawson and Cislyn du Cille], like I said, were adopted.  And in Jamaica, you know, a lot of times if you have either a close relative or close family that always lived--these, these girls have always lived with us.  They were always with us.  For one thing, my mother [Lolita DeMont du Cille] was always sick, and my dad really liked having female help for my mom, 'cause she knew the boys are--ain't gonna do what they needed to do for my mom when she was sick.  So these girls from a very close family would stay with us, and so they just became family all of--just automatically became family.  So when we were immigrating, in order for them to be legal and, and to--for, for my dad to just bring them with us, they had to be adopted, so my dad formally adopted them.  But they were--they were also older.  You know, my, my, my, my older sister was almost the same age as my older brother, and they were sisters, so my other sister is a little bit older than me.  I think she's--I'm probably two or three years younger than she is.
Story_ID: 660376
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Pause) The--the earliest childhood memory I have, and it would have been around 1959--'60 [1960], so that would have made me about what maybe three years old (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Three, yeah.
Speaker 2: Three, three, four years old.  And the reason that I can pinpoint that it was 1960 is because you remember the Chevrolet that had the fin--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --on the back?  I remember a friend of my dad's driving one of those Chevrolets with the fins, and I love that car.  I always--I was always fascinated as a little boy by that car.  So I--my childhood memory of being in Saint Mary's, Jamaica [Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica], where my dad [Frank du Cille, Sr.] was actually teaching at a bible school, Bethel Bible school [Bethel Bible College; Bethel Bible College of the Caribbean - Jamaica], in, in Saint Mary's, Jamaica.  I remember that car.  I also remember that we didn't have a lot of toys so we made our own towns.  We made little buggies with wooded wheels, you know, where we'd pull each other with a rope.  We made these little sleds that we would make out of the bowel from, from a palm tree--from a coconut tree.  We'd put a hole in the front of it for the brakes and slide down the hill.  You know, we'd wet down the, the, the, the side of the hill and slide down.  We didn't have snow in Jamaica so we couldn't (laughter)--we couldn't slide down the hill with snow.  But those are some of my--and, and of course, the, the ocean.  The ocean was always--Jamaica's tiny, you know.  It's only a hundred and fifty miles wi--in width by fifty miles deep.  And so you can--you can get to the ocean even if you were in the--in the interior fur- fairly fast.  So we spent a considerable amount of time going to the beach and, and, and having family picnics, and I do remember those.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  In Jamaica was there a, a name for your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: The, the area where I was born there was this, this road called Waltham Park Road [Kingston, Jamaica] that Newark Avenue is off of.  And I remember there's a big church that my dad used to--he wasn't the pastor there, but he--it was like the--it was like the head church for his denomination.  So I remember it being like a few blocks from the house.  But that's the only part of the neighborhood that I remember.
Story_ID: 660377
Speaker 1: I know, we always ask this question: what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of, of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing up?  The ocean, Dunn's Rivers Fall--Dunn's River Falls, which is a big tourist attraction in Jamaica.  The, my--the church that my dad [Frank du Cille, Sr.] was from was--is very charismatic.  And you know, we're talking people who move in church.  There was dancing, and there was clapping, and there was lots of singing.  And I'd remember growing up in that environment where church was very lively.  And of course, food is always (laughter)--for my brothers and I, food was a big deal, 'cause we just loved growing up having Jamaican food, you know, the curry--the curried meats, and the rice, and peas, and dumplings.  Jamaican dumplings are called Johnny Cakes, you know, they're like round and fried.  And we ate a lot of salt fish, which is a very cheap form of food.  It's basically dried codfish that's cured by being heavily salted.  What else?  The fruit, oh my god, mangoes, every kind of banana you can imagine, plantains, star apple, genips, soursop, jackfruit.  Did I say mangoes already?  Lots of mangoes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember one Sunday, the day before we had--we were visiting some people out in the country, and we went through a mango grove.  And we ate--I must have eaten a dozen mangoes, can you imagine what would happen the next day?  So I went to church, and I remember this church lady.  'Cause I was little.  I must have been four.  I remember this lady.  She took me out of church, 'cause I'd messed all over myself, and washed me off, washed my pants, and put it out to dry.  And the sun dried it very fast--put me back in, sent me back to church, and the same thing happened right over again.  She was--she was just so upset that, you know--it was just a--an effort that was never ending for her.  I never forgot that, from eating, eating too many mangoes in the mango grove.
Speaker 1: Are man- mangoes better than the ones we buy in the stores?
Speaker 2: Here?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Even, even when I went down last year and tried mangoes, they taste completely different.  I, I don't know what it is, but the mangoes that come out in the country, in the woods, natural, without all the crap that they put in the fertilizers and so forth, it's very tasty mangoes.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 660378
Speaker 1: Now what about music?  You know, in this country, calypso in, around 1956, '57 [1957]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was very popular.
Speaker 2: Was a purp- very popular.  Calypso, ska--I grew up hearing it in the, the '60s [1960s] and you know, up to 1970, when we left, and heard an awful lot of reggae, you know, heard a lot of Bob Marley.  But we weren't supposed to.  We were preacher's children.  We weren't supposed to listen to the, the devil music.  You know, we weren't supposed to associate ourselves with, with the reggae music and--because that's the rasta man music, and the rasta--we saw Rastafarians all the time, you know, with the long dreadlocks and you know, their culture, and their way of life.  But that was something that was shunned by us on a religious side of Jamaica, so I kind of grew up being separated from that.  But you can imagine that when I got off to college [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] and, and discovered my roots and found out, you know, all about the Rastafarians, I was fascinated by them.  In fact, after college I was--got a grant from school, and I went back and traveled around Jamaica for four months before I started my full time job after college.  And I spent a lot of time with Rastafarians.  You know, I, I went up in the hills to learn about their culture.  You know the word Rastafarian comes from rasta, which is one word; the second word, tafari, well, rastafari two--the two words, is a part of the title of, of Haile Selassie, the emperor of Ethiopia.  His, his title is actually rastafari, which comes in front of his name as a--as--as a--you know, a, a, a monarch of, of, of Ethiopia.  And so the, the Rastafarians took on that title, and they actually--a crew of them actually went to Ethiopia and spent some time, and was kind of disillusioned because of a clash of cultures.  And then they came back to Jamaica, and really the--that's when the movement really started, because they came back and learned a lot of their history about, you know, being the descendant of, of, of, of David and, and, and the Ethiopian Jews and, and the, the Christian connection to Ethiopia.  And they came back to Jamaica, and it's all mixed up now into their different denominations.  'Cause there's a couple of different Ethiopian Orthodox Christian denominations, and some of them do embrace--one of them does embrace the Rastafarians.  And so that was one--the one Christian church that actually allowed the Rastafarians to, to be a part of their church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Jamaica, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 660379
Speaker 1: In music, I guess before you got over here, like Jimmy Cliff was big here.
Speaker 2: Jimmy Cliff was big with the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Johnny Nash.
Speaker 2: Yes, with the--Jimmy Cliff was big with his, his, his movie, 'The Harder They Come,' and the album that really launched his, his career.  But he was big before the movie.  He had a lot of hits before the movie.
Speaker 1: Yep.  I think we played Johnny Nash, but we had no idea that he was from Jamaica.
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, I'm not sure Johnny Nash was from Jamaica (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: I believe he--I believe he--
Speaker 1: Was singing a Jamaican song?
Speaker 2: He's singing a Jamaican song, but I believe he's from one of the other Caribbean islands.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I wanna say Nassau [sic.], but I'm sure.  Yes, I'm not sure Johnny Nash is, is Jamaican, but Jimmy Cliff is.  The Wailers--you know, Bunny Wailer is still around.
Speaker 1: Toots and the Maytals (laughter).
Speaker 2: Toots and the Maytals, yep--of course, Peter Tosh, you know.  Yes, it's just I just immersed myself into everything Jamaican after college [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], while I was in college, and after college.  Because, you know, growing up at home I was in Christian, you know, environment where we were not--we were--we were kind of kept away from, from the evils of Rastafarianism and ganja (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was, was--did [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte have big standing in Jamaica?
Speaker 2: Um.
Speaker 1: He was big here, but I--
Speaker 2: He was big--you know, I remember my parents [Lolita DeMont du Cille and Frank du Cille, Sr.] talking about him, but, again, it wasn't music that was played in the home.  But I, I do remember my--older people and my parents talking about Harry Belafonte and talking about Sidney Poitier.  His, his background is Bahamian.  In fact, I met some of his brothers and relatives down in Miami [Florida] a few years back.  But he's, he's Bahamian.
Story_ID: 660380
Speaker 1: Where did you s--well, you say you didn't remember the name of the school you started, but you started school in Jamaica?
Speaker 2: I started--you know, I did secondary.  I started--I started secondary school in Jamaica.  There was public school and it was in Saint James [Saint James Parish, Jamaica], near a next town called Cambridge, Jamaica.  And then I went to--probably around '68 [1968], '69 [1969] I went to school, which was a church school 'cause the Church of God had its own school.  So I went to school there at the New Testament Church of God school for a couple of years, before we moved the states.  So when we first moved, I think it was--it was July of 1970, and I would have been what, just fourteen or so?  Nine--'56 [1956] and na- 1970, so it'd been about fourteen.  So I was just finishing up junior high school and probably should've been heading on to being a sout- freshman in high, high school.  But, again, the, the grade structures in Jamaica and here were different, so they erred on the side of caution and put me back into, like--what, that would have been eighth grade?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I believe so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I did--I did a year of eighth grade in Gainesville [Georgia], then went to high school at Gainesville High School.
Story_ID: 660381
Speaker 1: So before you moved to Georgia, what were your interests as a child?  Wa- what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Just before we moved, I had a--my cousin's husband--'cause we were living in this big house.  Again, you know, we, we--Jamaican families just kind of share big houses.  So we're living in this big house with my aunt and her children, and this--one of 'em was married, and the guy was a photographer.  And I kind of hung out and tried to understand, you know, what, what, what he was doing, and I was just fascinated by the camera and that was around fourteen.
Speaker 1: Now, now let me--this is your cousin's husband, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was a photographer.  And everyone that goes to Ja- Jamaica takes pictures, and I just wonder about the accessibility of cameras for a young kid in Jamaica.
Speaker 2: Well, back then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So many ca- coming over there--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I'm sure they all don't leave, you know, so.
Speaker 2: Back then it wasn't very prevalent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, I proba- pa- part of the reason I was so fascinated by his equipment was that it wasn't something I saw very often.  You know, I know my dad [Frank du Cille, Sr.] probably had the little--back then there were--I, I, I--I'm not sure if they had Polaroids back in 1970.  I think they did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They did.  They did.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But cameras were not as ubiquitous as they are today.  No way were they that, you know, prevalent.  So it, it, it was fascinating to me because his business was to do weddings, and people would come to him to get passport picture done.  And people would come to him to get, you know, just portraits for, for, for, for, for, for personal memories.  And I'd watch him.  You know, he had--he didn't have a studio, but we had a big front porch that was covered.  And he had a backdrop similar to what we have here, and that's where he did his photography, right there on the--on the front porch.  Also, it was readymade lights, because he didn't have to spend any money on, on fancy lights.  So he, he shot pictures right there, you know, on the front porch, 'cause the light was, was diffused and at nights.  But I, I was fascinated by that.  Before, before I saw the camera, though, I was probably--you know, we just spent a lot of time in church school, you know, playing games and, and going to church and doing activities at the church.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but, but you began to notice his photography and to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --try to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did he teach you how to shoot?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I ran in--I, I, I, I met--I met him as an adult again, you know, a few years back.  And he, he looked at me and just started laughing about I kept hanging around with him.  And of course, he was a young man, and you know, he didn't want a little kid hanging around with him.  So, you know, he, he, he, he would never let me handle the cameras alone.  You know, he'd show me things or I'd ask him questions, but I was never allowed to pick up the camera or touch it or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Did, did he have a 35?
Speaker 2: No, no, he was using--he had a twin lens reflex, you know, the kind you look down in?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: About 2 1/4?
Speaker 2: Two and a quarter, yep.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: He had 2 1/4 and I don't think he ever had a, a 35mm.
Speaker 1: Was that the twin lens Yashica?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, yeah, I think his was a Mamiya.
Speaker 1: Mamiya.
Speaker 2: He had a Mamiya, which is--back then, for him, would have been very expensive.  Yeah, the Yashica was a little cheaper.
Speaker 1: Now did he--so he did mainly portrait, at the time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He did mostly portraiture--weddings, portraiture, passport pictures.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 660382
Speaker 1: Did he shoot anything for The Gleaner?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't, which, which was part--the part that I missed at that age.  I didn't really--so when my dad [Frank du Cille, Sr.] started working for the newspaper in Georgia [The Times], I, again, started to go into the photo department.  'Cause my dad would take me to the newspaper with him, and I would go and ask a lot of questions of the photographer for the staff, and ask him to let me come with him on assignments.  And he really did teach me a lot.  And, and to this day, I can't remember that guy's name, but he was a very patient man.  I remember him telling me one day, 'cause I--he was going to a shoot and he, he said that I could come with him, but I wasn't dressed properly.  And he, he took me home to change before we went to the assignment because he wanted me to look presentable (laughter).  But the photographer for the paper did teach me a lot of stuff.  And then I took--I took a photo course from the local recreation center, and it happened to be the same guy teaching the photo course that was my math teacher at the high school.  And he insisted that we learn not from 35mm or 2 1/4, but from 4x5.  First we have to build the pinhole camera, then we had to learn to use the large format 4x5 camera, which is a Speed Graphic.  He had--he had a Speed Graphic that he taught us to use--taught us to, to, to--he said he felt that composition--you have to learn composition with a large negative.  (Pause) And--but I--I--that was my first photo course.
Speaker 1: So this is at, at Gainesville (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Gainesville [Georgia]--
Speaker 1: --High School [Gainesville High School]?
Speaker 2: In Gainesville.  Yes.
Story_ID: 660383
Speaker 1: What was the racial makeup at school [Gainesville High School, Gainesville, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.  You know, 1970--if you go back and look at the--at the history of Gainesville education system, it was the first year the school system had integrated.  So here are these kids from Jamaica who know nothing about what had gone on the previous decade with civil rights; knew nothing about all the struggles of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  In fact, we had been on a visit.  The only--the only way we knew about Martin Luther King really in depth was because my, my dad [Frank du Cille, Sr.] had, had two years prior, in '68 [1968], brought us to the United States for a visit.  And we were staying with a family in Arkansas, West Helena, Arkansas, which is only about fif- ten or fifteen miles [sic.] from Memphis [Tennessee].  So, the, the night Martin Luther King was shot, we were fif- about fifteen miles from Memphis (laughter).  So--
Speaker 1: Well Helena's a(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) we, we, we, we learned about, about Martin Luther King then and, and of course we just didn't know about the experience of growing up in such a prejudice, almost apartheid type environment.  We had--I mean, it's not that Jamaica didn't have its own set of prejudices, but they were--they were--since, since their country's predominantly black, about 2 percent of the population is Indian, about 1 percent is Chinese; you know, then you've got smaller groups.  But it's a majority black country, so all the ministers, all the judges, all the school principals, all the, the, the, the Parliament.  They're all--I grew up--those, those role models were black, so I didn't grow up with the same kind of issues that a fourteen year old American black would deal with.  So being thrown right into school at 1970 was an amazing thing.  'Cause we--to us white people were very ordinary.  'Cause for one thing, a lot of church people would come.  My dad had many, many friends that would come to Jamaica.  And I swear every week or every couple of months there was somebody who came to live with us, and so we got to know people and took them for who they were.  So we, we had friends--we started making white friends and black friends--didn't distinguish.  And then, then we would have our black friends say, "What are you trying to do?  Are you an Uncle Tom, trying to be friends with the white kids?"  And then we would have our white friends, and our white friends would say, "You guys are Jamaicans.  What are you doing hanging out with those guys?"  It wa- it was a weird, weird, weird, weird learning experience, to be thrown right into an integrated school system.  And we might as well have been Martians because we did not understand either side, but we learned it.
Story_ID: 660384
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject matter in school?
Speaker 2: I liked English; I liked literature and I was never really good at writing.  I, I feel that some of my education there was a deficit 'cause we moved a lot, and we--I'm sure that there were some gaps in my--you know, in my education process.  So I always regretted not being a better writer.  My dad [Frank du Cille, Sr.] was a great writer and, and was great with languages.  You know, he, he spoke Spanish.  He, he tried to speak some French.  He learned because he was a studied theologian.  He studied Hebrew and Greek and Latin because that's what the scriptures were written in.  So he, he was very good at languages, but I did not inherit that, that gift of great language or great writing.
Story_ID: 660385
Speaker 1: Now you had--I guess--how many of you were--I'm, I'm wondering how many of you--were, were all the brothers in school at the same time or pretty much?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so my--like, for some reason they kept my older brother, the one that's just above me, Donavan [Donavan du Cille], they kept him back two grades.  I don't know why, because he was like the smartest one of all of us.  But he and I at one point were in the same class together, even though there was a almost two year gap in our age.  And then, of course, my younger brothers went to where we were going to, to elementary school, 'cause they were in the fifth and sixth grades when they came.  I, I believe that would have been the right grades that they'd be in.
Story_ID: 660386
Speaker 1: Now as you ha- started to shoot, did you admire any particular photographers?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Part of what launched me into wanting to be a photojournalist was--I believe it was my old math teacher, who was also my photography teacher, told me to go to the library and look up [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks.  (Background noise) I apologize.  That is a bell to say that they have the daily news meeting.  So I'll just repeat what I was gonna say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my high school math teacher, who was also my photography teacher, told me to go to the library and look up Gordon Parks, because Gordon Parks was already the most accomplished black photojournalist on the planet.  He was working for Life magazine for all those years, and he had already written--I don't remember what year 'The Learning Tree' came out.  Was that--
Speaker 1: It was in the--
Speaker 2: Was that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was in the--
Speaker 2: --before 19--
Speaker 1: --early '70s [1970s].  Yeah, it--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: --was in the early '70s [sic. 1969].
Speaker 2: --in the early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 1: It had to be like '73 [1973], '74 [1974] (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I must have read it after I was well into high school [Gainesville High School, Gainesville, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Well, well, the movie came out then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But--right.
Speaker 1: --but the book ['The Learning Tree,' Gordon Parks] was out before--
Speaker 2: Oh, the book was out before, right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, but all of his Life magazine stuff was there in the library to go look up, you know.  I also was fascinated by the photographs coming out of Vietnam.  And I remember looking at the work by Loury Bur- Larry Burrows, who was killed in Vietnam, and his work was just amazing and fascinating to me that he could go and capture those kinds of moments in war.  And also National Geographic was very, very influential in looking at the work of the, the National Geographic photographers.  I spent--I was--I was more--I was very bookish and went to the library a lot, but it was mostly not to read but to look at pictures (laughter).  I, I, I, I would find anything that had--was about photography and looked at the pictures and studied then.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now were you shoot- shooting any--I know National Geographic is famous for its Kodachromes and that sort of thing.  You, you were shooting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we were shooting just basic Tri-X black and white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I was also working for the paper [The Times].
Story_ID: 660387
Speaker 1: So come my junior year, the paper started giving me assignments while I was in high school [Gainesville High School, Gainesville, Georgia].  And my senior year I worked pretty much full time for the same paper my dad [Frank du Cille, Sr.] worked for, the Gainesville Times [The Times].  I worked my senior year after school; in fact, I would finish my classes by, I believe, noon, one o'clock and then go to work the rest of the day my senior year in high school.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, did you shoot any memorable pictures in high school?
Speaker 1: You know, I remember photographing Jimmy Carter [James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] when he was running for president.  I remember photographing festivals, you know, the mule festival in Dahlonega, Georgia.
Speaker 2: There's a mule festival?
Speaker 1: Yes, there's a mule festival (laughter).  And--but early on, before--and this probably was while--this was probably before I started to actually work regularly for the paper.  I remember something happened very--a tragic situation happened.  There was a fire, a house fire, and this little boy's parents was killed in the fire, or a parent was killed in the fire.  And I got to the scene and I took pictures of the burned out house.  But when I came back I was telling my editor about the--how sorry I felt for this little boy who was just standing there, and that somebody said that he--that the little boy lived in the house, and his mother was, you know--had--his, his relative had been killed in the house.  And the editor said, "Well, did you take any pictures of the little boy?"  And I said, "No.  Was I supposed to," (laughter)?  You know, so I mean, I was what, fifteen--didn't really--hadn't really grasped that part of it yet, and of course they taught--they took me under their wings at the paper and taught me that, you know, that's the kind of stuff that you would want to make sure you capture, if you ever come to a situation like that again.  I never did that again (laughter).  But, yeah, that, that was my early memory of being a professional photojournalist.

Speaker 1: How were your high school grades?
Speaker 2: Not great, because I think I spent more time fiddling around, shooting pictures, and hanging out, you know, but I would say I was like a C student in high school [Gainesville High School, Gainesville, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, and I, I do remember my per- my principal and I had a lot of issues because I grew a beard very early.  Before I graduated from high school, I was able to grow facial hair, and he had a rule at the school that we couldn't wear beards.  We couldn't have beards or mustaches, and so he kept telling me to shave, shave, shave, and I refused.  So, at one point, he called me into his office and say this--, "I've, I've warned you too many times now.  Why, why aren't you shaving?"  And I said, "I'm not gonna shave."  I said that's a--I think that--, "I think that having a beard is a personal--is a personal choice."  And of course, the hippie movement and you know, all of that stuff was full blown.  This is nineteen seventy--this would have been '72 [1972], '73 [1973].  And he said, "Okay then I'm suspending you; go home."  So my dad [Frank du Cille, Sr.] called a lawyer friend, and we went and sat down and met.  And our agreement was that I would--I would have a long sideburn, came all the way down to here.  And as long as--he said as long as you have two inches, you know, all the way down this way, I'll, I'll let you back in.  And that was the--that was the compromise.
Speaker 1: So you had like a mutton chop (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --type of sideburns then.
Speaker 2: Yes.  But, of course, a year or so later I graduated from high school and did what that guy wanted--
Speaker 1: Did you have a big Afro?
Speaker 2: I did have a big fro.  Back then we had the, the blowout kit.  You know, remember the blowout kit (makes sound)--yeah, and, and big bellbottoms with plaid bellbottoms, and, and shoes with the heels this, this tall.  I think you remember 'cause you and I are probably from the same generation, but these kids today do re- don't know about those big, tall, thick--that the sole of the shoe was this thick, and the heel was that thick (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, platform shoes.
Speaker 2: Platform shoes, yeah.
Speaker 1: You--yeah, you were in high school during the 'Super Fly' age--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, definitely.  'Cause, you know, back then it was--oh my god, I remember going to the movies and seeing, seeing Shaft--Shaft- 'Shaft's Big Score!'; 'Shaft in Africa'; and then 'Super Fly.'  Oh, Curtis Mayfield was, was--Curtis Mayfield and [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes, those, those were our musical heroes.
Story_ID: 660389
Speaker 1: 'Bout this time, as I recall, for the first time I think it became--black photographers became more widely known I know.  It's 'Drums of Passion' [sic. 'Drums of Life: A Photographic Essay on the Black Man in America,' Chester Higgins, Jr. and Orde Coombs], I think the book was published with fe- fe- featuring Chester Higgins' [HistoryMaker Chester Higgins, Jr.] photos, and Van Der Zee [James Van Der Zee] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --had been rediscovered.
Speaker 2: Yes, Van Der Zee was rediscovered.
Speaker 1: And people--[HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of course, as you mentioned before.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: People started like really talking about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --black photographers in art circles and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, of course, I was kind of oblivious to that because my first--when I graduated from high school [Gainesville High School, Gainesville, Georgia], I, I had a deep disappointment.  I wanted to go to the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] and study photography, 'cause they, at the time--the University of Georgia had a very good photography program, and it was out of the art school, not out of the journalism school.  But I remember going for an interview, and they wanted a portfolio, and they wanted to know that you already had some experience taking pictures before you got admitted to the school.  It's--back then you had to be admitted.  You know, you can't just walk up and start signing up for course.  You have to be admitted to the school.  So this guy--and I don't remember his name.  I remember being very nervous, and I remember cracking my knuckles a lot, and he kept telling me to stop.  This was whoever the dean was or associate dean was that did the interviews for allowing kids to, to enter that program.  And I always said I, I didn't get in because I cracked my knuckles, but the truth of the matter was they didn't have any black kids in that photograph program, not a one.
Speaker 1: This is the University of Georgia (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is was the University of Georgia.
Speaker 1: At--
Speaker 2: And, and back then, you know, they were in--you know, they'd, they'd be damned to allow a, a, a--this is even 1974--to allow a black kid to be in that photography program.  So I didn't get in.  And, and it was no other place I applied, so I--my dad [Frank du Cille, Sr.] was moving to South Georgia anyway.  He moved to, to Thomasville, Georgia, which is not very far from Valdosta [Georgia], so I went to Valdosta State [Valdosta State College; Valdosta State University, Valdosta, Georgia] for a year.  And it was--in my opinion, it was probably--if I look back at my life, it was the dead year.  You know, it was that year that I didn't do anything.  I, I, I remember going to--I took a lot of art classes, and I, I loved the art classes.  And I took sculpture, I took drawing, and I took art history, and then all the other courses were your basic math, you know, English, the, the basic courses, but I pent--spent more attention to the art courses.  But the whole time I was pretty much fuming.  I was--I was pretty disappointed that I didn't get into the University of Georgia.
Story_ID: 660390
Speaker 1: My dad [Frank du Cille, Sr.] moved.  While I was in school [at Valdosta State College; Valdosta State University, Valdosta, Georgia] my dad moved up to Louisville [Kentucky], and he became the pastor at Shawnee Presbyterian Church in Louisville.  So that summer--I went up that summer to spend with my parents and decided that I was not gonna go back to Valdosta.  So I enrolled at the community college.  At the time, you know, we lived--Kentucky and Indiana are separated by the Ohio River.  So we lived on the--on the other side of the river 'cause--even though my dad's church was in Louisville.  So that's how I went to sign up to be at the--in Indiana University Southeast campus [New Albany, Indiana].  So while I was going to school there, and I decided to take a journalism class.  The teacher said to me, "I'm taking some students up to the main campus in Bloomington [Indiana] for a, a day--a day just to see the journalism school.  Would you like to come?"  And I said, "Yes, I would love to come," and I went up there and discovered that there was this great photography program; I discovered that there was this great journalism school in Indiana; and I said, "This is where I've gotta go to school."  So I finished up my year at IU Southeast and then moved up to the campus in Bloomington and started the journalism program at Indiana University School of Journalism [Indiana University Media School, Bloomington, Indiana].  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So this, this is about 19--this is now what--
Speaker 1: This would be '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, the year that I spent at IU Southeast was '76 [1976], so in '77 [1977] I moved to IU Bloomington [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], and the rest is history.  That's where I really figured out how photojournalists should work and what kind of portfolio I needed, and I had great professors.
Speaker 2: Who, who--
Speaker 1: I had--
Speaker 2: --were some of the--yeah.
Speaker 1: My, my favorite professor--there were a couple of them--was Will Counts.  Will was a photographer who was at the Arkansas Democrat [Arkansas Democrat-Gazette] for a gabazillion years.  I forget how long he was there, but he, he retired from the Arkansas Democrat to come to IU to teach.  But he had covered the civil rights era.  And I don't know if you remember the photograph of Elizabeth Eckford being jeered by the, the, the white girl from Little Rock [Arkansas]--you know, the black, black girl with the glasses walk in and being jeered.  He took that picture.  He also took some fascinating pictures of these black journalists who were trying to cover the whole Little Rock school situation [at Central High School], and they were beaten and, and kicked by locals.  He took some fantastic pictures of that.  And so I had heard about his work and looked up his stuff, and he and I hit it off pretty well, you know.  When I went to him for an interview, he said, "I don't want you to take the basic class--the basic photo class--'cause I think you've already done that.  You need to take the higher level photo class," so he put me right into the higher level photo class.  And we just--we were just, you know, close.  I learned a lot from him.  And then I had another professor named John Ahlhauser.  He's still alive.  Will passed away back in 2004 I believe--no, 2002--probably 2002.  But John is still alive.  John Ahlhauser was, was another close professor of mine from Indiana.  But they, they, they--it was a total--it was total different experience than University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia].  You know, here were two guys who went we need to have black students in our program, and, and encouraged us, and took us under their wings to, to, to point us in the right direction.
Speaker 2: Now is this the era when the Isiah Thomas was king of the campus?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I--in (unclear)--in fact, Isiah--I actually preceded Isiah, because Isiah came in--Isiah came to IU in I believe either '79 [1979] or '80 [1980].
Story_ID: 660391
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're were talking about the Isiah Thomas era (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes. Isiah--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) in Indiana basketball.
Speaker 2: And I covered--you know, took, took pictures at the basketball games with Isiah Thomas.  I believe he started around '79 [1979]--might have been a little earlier than that, but he was--he was big, big man on campus in '79 [1979], '80 [1980].  'Cause they won the championship in '81 [1981], and, and I, I was there for that.  That was an amazing time.  Bobby Knight actually--there was a story about Bobby Knight.  Because a friend of mine--one of my colleagues is a photographer on, on campus.  He saw Bobby Knight walking downtown Bloomington [Indiana], and he said, "Well, I gotta get a picture of Bobby Knight.  You know, he's walking down- coming from lunch."  So he's standing on the sidewalk, taking a picture of Bobby Knight.  And as Bobby Knight walks by, he goes (makes sound).  And this kid was a really skinny, tiny guy.  He went flying in the bushes.  So, of course, it became a big deal 'cause we ran a photograph.  And the last picture he took was of Bobby's hand coming at him (laughter).  So we, we ran pictures and--but it turned out Bobby Knight ended up having to apologize because he really--he had a case.  He had assault--an assault case against Bobby Knight.  But that was our early foray into paparazzi.
Speaker 1: I just wondered now, you know, with so much--I mean, the Bobby Knight, Isiah Thomas connection there, the basketball team's success brought a lot of media to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Bloomington, and a lot of photographers that--I just wondered as a student, you know, do you pay attention to what these--what this--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  In fact, a lot of the professionals would come through, and they'd come to the journalism school [Indiana University School of Journalism; Indiana University Media School, Bloomington, Indiana] and visit and talk to us, 'cause my teachers would, you know, get 'em to come and talk to us.  And you know, I met quite a few of the big--the big time, you know, sports peop- people.  I think the Leifer [Neil Leifer] came through one time, Walter Iooss, you know.  But it was--it wa- a lot of the Sports Illustrated photographers all would--they would come through and just chat with us and hang out and have, you know--go for drinks and so forth.  But it was--it was just a great experience being at IU [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] during that time.  I got to IU just after the '76 [1976] champion- 'cause they won in '76 [1976], so I got there the semester after.  And then, you know, I was there for the '81 [1981] championship.  That was amazing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the, the team that Isiah was on was the first, I think, predominantly black team that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Bob- Bobby Knight had.  I think he had--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --Steve Alford, some other guys on that (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, he had a--he had a--a large contingent of black players.  You know, Indiana has always been good about having, having a strong team of African American players.
Story_ID: 660392
Speaker 1: So you--you're doing okay otherwise in your courses at Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.  I mean, I--you know, to--by then I figured out early on that the name of the game to get a job when I got out of school was to have a--at least a decent portfolio.  So, you know, I--and I didn't have a car, so I--and, and had very little money, but I assigned myself a lot of things--you know, basically, came up with my own story ideas that I could walk to and, and, and, and, and take picture--and of course, a lot of the sports things were readymade.  But a lot of the events on campus were things that I could just go to and shoot and develop a portfolio.
Speaker 1: Were you the only black photographer--student photographer--
Speaker 2: At, at the Indiana Daily Student, from '77 [1977] to '81 [1981], the years that I was there, I was the only male.  There was a--there, there were some ladies that were in the journalism school [Indiana University School of Journalism; Indiana University Media School, Bloomington, Indiana] that were black, but they were not in photo.  They were in, in, in editing or writing courses.  But I was the only black--I think there was one other guy that came through for a while but, but transferred to somewhere else.  He may have only been there like one semester or something like that.  But I was--like for that four year period I was the only one.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I was wondering if you developed like a bond with Isiah Thomas or those kind of--some, some of the players 'cause--
Speaker 2: No, because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --you know, back then those players--I mean those guys were stars.  They were superstars, you know, so I mean, we were able--we knew who they were, and we would hang out and take their pictures, you know, especially when they were doing anything on campus.  There was a favorite restaurant where, where all the basketball players went to eat, including Bobby Knight; you know, they went for breakfast.  And so we would go there to, to kind of rub elbows with those guys.  But, no, there was not--the build- building a relationship with those guys--Bobby Knight kept a real tight ship.  He was--he was a super, super, duper disciplinarian, 'cause he was not--his players were not allowed to, you know, hang out and party and do the long nights of drinking and the drugs.  And you know, and this whole thing about giving them all sports cars and you know, all that stuff, he, he, he, he put--he put a damper on all that.  So it was--it was hard for, for, for us, not being basketball players, to make friends with, with people like Isiah.
Story_ID: 660393
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduation, then what were your choices?  I mean, what were you--
Speaker 2: Well, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) projecting?
Speaker 2: --because I had a decent portfolio, and I also--I placed I think it was third place in the Hearst competition.  That's the college photography competition.  I also had earned an internship at the Louisville Courier-Journal in 1979.  So two years after I started at IU [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], I got the Courier-Journal internship, which is a big deal internship in the industry, in the newspaper world.  Back then the, the Courier-Journal was top of the wrung for, for photojournalism, you know.  In '76 [1976], they had just won the Pulitzer Prize as a staff for the work they did on, on busing.  You know, that was the year that integration and busing came to Louisville [Kentucky], and they won the Pulitzer Prize for that, that story in '76 [1976].  So, the Courier-Journal was a hot, hot place to get an internship, and I, I was one of the fortunate ones for '79 [1979]--for the summer of '79 [1979].  And in the summer of '80 [1980], I got an internship at the Miami Herald, and that was a fascinating internship.  Because I arrived in Miami [Florida] on May the 16th, and the Miami riots of 1980 began like on the 17th.  I don't know if you remember this motorcyclist named Arthur McDuffie.  He was, was stopped by a, a Miami police officer, and somehow he got shot in the head, you know.  And the, the police officer got off and Miami started to burn, and it was the day my internship started, you know.  So I was out there.  I was actually the only person from the Miami Herald staff that was injured from the riots.  'Cause I was--I was in the back seat.  I, I--earlier in the day, I had--in the ba- I was in the back seat with two white photographers in the front seat and I'm in the back seat.  And we turn down 62nd Avenue, and rocks and bottles started busting out every window of the car.  So we got out of there with, you know, an inch of life's spared.  And I then said you know what?  I've got my beat up old Chevy Malibu [Chevrolet Malibu] with the--with the--the vinyl is stripping off the top.  My car is gonna fit in the hood a lot better than hanging out with these two white photographers driving cars that look like a cop car.  So I went in by myself with my one little camera.  And these guys saw me and started asking me, "What are doing here?  Are you, you a cop," and blah, blah, blah.  And they came after me, and I got in the car.  And as I was driving off, one of them through a rock and hit me right on the elbow.  And it, it just caused a lot of blood.  And so I went into the office with blood all over me.  And oh my god, I'll never forget the look on the, the face of the executive editor, 'cause he was like oh my god! (Laughter) He says, "He could have been killed, and he hasn't even signed his internship papers yet."  So that was a fascinating summer.  And then that was the same summer that the Mariel boatlift was, was going strong and the Hai- there were Hai- Haitians who were on boats coming in.  And Mount St. Helens--remember, shortly after the riot started, like the 18th, Mount St. Helens blew.  So that was--that was an incredible summer.
Speaker 1: Now that's out in Washington.  Did you go out there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No we didn't go out there, but I'm just saying that for, for--
Speaker 1: A lot of--
Speaker 2: --for such big events to happen that summer, you know, that, that was a ba- a ba- a big, big deal that happened that summer is the Mount St. Helens blowing and the Miami riots.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've got--we've got new president of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the United States, then Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yep.
Story_ID: 660394
Speaker 1: What were you shooting with?  Ha- ha- how did your shooting evolve, 'cause you were taught on the Speed Graphic, and--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, by the time I got--by the time I got to IU [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], I had earned money doing summer jobs to buy--actually, when (laughter)--when I arrived at IU in '77 [1977], my dad [Frank du Cille, Sr.] thought that he was helping me, and he went out and bought me a Yashica GN [Yashica Electro 35 GSN].  And back then the Yashicas, they were halfway automatic.  You could change the f-stop, but you couldn't change the speed, and the speed was either the little flash thing or the sundial icon, though we only had two things to set.  So if you were outside shooting, you'd turn it to the sundial.  If you were shooting with the flash, then you'd turn it to the flash symbol.  And those are the only two settings for the speed.  So that obviously was not an adequate camera, but I actually took my first course at IU with it.  My, my professor understood.  And also they loaned me cameras, and I was able to, to make my way through that first semester.  But subsequently, I had to do odd jobs and summer jobs to, to buy myself a camera.  So I did a camera, but I only had a camera and a lens.  So when I got to, to, to my Courier [Courier-Journal] journalist assignment, I had to borrow equipment from the paper.  And then when I got to Miami [Florida], I had to borrow equipment from the paper [Miami Herald], but I hadn't even had a chance to check anything out 'cause I had just arrived and the riots started.  So I was still (unclear) shooting with my one camera.
Speaker 1: Did, did you have an idea of what you wanted to get if you, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I would have--I would--I would have needed, you know, a, a, a Nikon F with a motor drive.  And I think back then the F--either the F2 [Nikon F2] or F3 [Nikon F3] had just come out, but I didn't have a motor drive.  You know, I didn't have a big fancy long glass or anything.  I had one--I had a 50mm lens, but I really needed a wide angle, and I really needed at least a 180 [180mm lens] and you know, preferably, if I had ultimate money, I would have had a 300 [300mm lens] or something like that.  But I only had one camera and one lens, but just cobbled it together and borrowed and did my thing.
Story_ID: 660395
Speaker 1: So you were intern at the Miami Herald the summer of '81 [1981]?
Speaker 2: Of '80 [1980]. Eighty [1980] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Eighty [1980], okay.
Speaker 2: Of '80 [1980].  So then I went back to, to school [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] to finish up in eighty--in, in the fall of '80 [1980].  And come October, I got a phone call from the Miami Herald asking me if I wanted to work full time.  And so I said yes, but I would like to not, not start working until September because I have fellowship, because I had won this fellowship to go to Jamaica from June to--from June to August of, of '81 [1981].  So I left school in '81 [1981].  And I actually had a surprise academic issue, because I thought that I had finished all of my required courses, but I had three credit hours to go to, to get my graduation certificate.  So I, I left.  I, I already had a job, so I went ahead.  But I finished--I took a--I took a course at the local community college in Miami [Florida] and transferred it up, and, and they, they then allowed me to graduate using, using those three credit hours.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I didn't really get my degree until '85 [1985], but I left school in '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what was it like at the Miami Herald?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a--it was a crazy time because, again, I was--I was not the first black photographer that was hired at Miami Herald.  But the black photographer that was hired at the Miami Herald was--he was hired the same time that I got the internship.  So, both of us started at the Miami Herald pretty much around the same time, me as an intern and him as a full time photographer.  And imagine, it's 1980 and it's the first time they're having a black photographer at one of America's largest newspapers.  So, it was a strange--a strange situation, to say the least, that, that, that they had not come that far where they had any African American photographers before myself and this other guy, that 1980.  So, you know, I just worked my way up, kept my head low, and was sometimes outspoken, you know, was sometimes outspoken.
Story_ID: 660396
Speaker 1: What did you speak out about (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember going to an intern luncheon, and the--you know, there were--there were three or four other African American like writers and one, one of 'em was an editor; the other--the other two were writers.  And you know, so among the interns we were there, and so of course the discussion was about the riots and about covering the community.  And I remember speaking up and saying that I thought that the Miami Herald was not balanced in its coverage of the community and that, that, that, they, they were one sided and spent a lot of time talking about the looting and, and the burning and all that that's going on, but, but very little on the side of here and what the community leaders had to say about this man [Arthur McDuffie] being--this unarmed motorcyclist being shot by a policeman and you know, the, the, the--you know, he had a gun, I thought he had a gun, once again, I thought he had a gun--and so I, I was very outspoken in saying I, "I think that our coverage is one sided and that you are not saying--you're not telling enough about what the community is, is saying and why the community's angry and what's, what's, what's the cause of the riot?"  And there I was, you know, this intern, kind of like challenging the executive editor.  And I remember him being, you know, very defensive and--, "Well, what would--what would you cover?  What would you do?"  And I just ran it down about things that I think.  I think you ought to--I think you ought to be listening to what more of the community is saying; I think you ought to go and send people into the community and hear their voices and hear their anger and understand why they--the, the community, feels like, you know, they haven't been given their due.  But I remember afterwards some of my colleagues saying that, "Wow, did you realize that you were just in there challenging the, the executive editor of the Miami Herald?"  I said, "(Makes sound) I was just saying my piece," you know.  Just--
Speaker 1: Now this is what--you, you raised an interesting point here 'cause the, the--if, if I'm not wrong, the City of Miami [Florida] erupted at least three more times.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, and I was there for all of 'em.  I mean, the next one was another very similar situation, where a police officer [Luis Alvarez] said that this guy [Nevell Johnson, Jr.] had a gun and he shot him to death, and he--the guy was unarmed.  And that was the riots of--I guess this would have been '83 [1983], '84 [1984], you know.  So no (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this is interesting because the, the--most cities in this country--most of the urban areas had their last big riot had been in 1968--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: --'cause Rodney King was--
Speaker 2: --the '68 [1968] and '69 [1969] ma- you know Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] death--
Speaker 1: --here comes the Miami riots.
Speaker 2: --and so forth, yeah.
Speaker 1: About three of four of 'em.
Speaker 2: Well, Miami had always been a very southern city and very behind.  I mean, in the City of Miami, you're not very far from the, the city hall.  I mean, less than a mile from city hall they still--in 1980, they still had, you know, those, those shotgun houses and the, the, the, the wooded, you know, kind of--kind of rural looking clap trap houses that were just cinder boxes pretty much.  I mean, in fact, I photographed some of 'em, 'cause we did a project shortly after I came back on, on, you know, how--Overtown [Miami, Florida]--you remember Overtown?  Overtown was something out of, you know, like a decade behind.  You would see this beautiful city building up in Miami.  You know, you saw the skyscrapers going up.  And then less than a mile away you've got Overtown, which was the worst, you know, dilapidated circumstance that you could, could imagine.  So Miami had been behind on the times let's say.

Speaker 1: I guess the black organization or organizations in Miami [Florida] that were, you know, trying to get social reform?
Speaker 2: Well, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was very active.  There was a--there was a contingent of ministers that were very active.  I forget what they call themselves.  (Background noise) (Pause) That's, that's our D.C. [Washington, D.C.] alarms (laughter).  Yeah, so they--they were some ministers that were very active but not very strong.  I mean, I don't think--I don't think the black community had a voice in Miami in 1980.  And it took them quite a number of years to really have the, the, the, the, the black political power becomes strong in Miami.  And it's always kind of teetered between La- Lat- Latinos, you know, Cubans, and, and, and you know, I, I don't think Miami--Dade County [Miami-Dade County, Florida] I think at one point had a black mayor, but ever since--I think maybe he did not last very long and then ever since then it was, you know, a Cuban or, or a Latino mayors and high politicians.  But Miami did not have a very strong black political power, not that there weren't people trying, but--

Speaker 1: In '82 [1982], when you're in Miami [Florida], John White [John H. White] from Chicago [Illinois] wins a Pulitzer Prize.
Speaker 2: Oh my god, that was a big deal.  I mean, I remember hearing about it and seeing John's work.  And then I think I subsequently went to some courses--you know, those seminars where John spoke.  And boy, was--you know that was just a proud super, super proud moment.  Now John was not the first black photographer that won a Pulitzer.  Moneta Sleet won the first Pulitzer for the work--you know, for the Coretta Scott King in the church [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And actually he was working for Ebony magazine, and Pulitzer Prizes are geared toward newspapers and wire services not magazines.  You know, that was directly ordered by the Pulitzer family.  So the reason that John--that, that Moneta Sleet won a Pulitzer was because his photo from the church of Mrs. King in the church went over the wires because it was pool.  And that's how he came to win the Pulitzer Prize.
Speaker 1: Right, that, that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --photo of Mrs. King--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at the funeral.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 2: Yep, and then I forget what year [HistoryMaker] Ovie Carter won in Chicago.  Was that '83 [1983] or '84 [1984]?
Speaker 1: I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Maybe eighty--
Speaker 1: --have a note for Ovie, but I think--but I think you're right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Ovie Carter
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ovie, Ovie Carter won for a picture that he shot in Africa.  I wa- I wa- in, in 1987, a good friend of mine, Chuck Scott, who was a professor at Ohio University [Athens, Ohio], he brought all the black Pulitzer Prize winners together.  I believe that as '87 [1987]--like fall of '87 [1987].  And it was John White, Moneta Sleet, Ovie Carter, [HistoryMaker] Ozier Muhammad, and myself.  And those were the five living black photographers that--so for me to be counted among those guys, you know.  And I look at John White, oh my god, you know, John is a legend.  And not only that, but when you get to know him, he is this incredible human being.  He's just humble and giving and, and, and smart and has a philosophy about life and a philosophy about photojournalism that, that I--through my--you know, through my formidable [sic.] years at the Miami Herald I was listening to him and admiring him and, and learning from his, his way.
Story_ID: 660399
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your, your Pulitzer Prize [Pulitzer Prize in Spot News Photography].  Now you, you won in '86 [1986] covering the eruption of Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) volcano.
Speaker 2: Volcano, yeah.  I, I was one of the--you know, when I was hired in Miami [Florida], I was hired as what's called a neighbor's photographer, which means that I was kind of a junior photographer because I was assigned to one of the bureaus.  We had--at the time we had about thirty or thirty-two photographers at the Miami Herald.  And we had these sections called neighbors, which were tabloids that would go to specific neighborhoods of, of Miami, and I was assigned to the Miami Beach [Florida] neighbors.  So--but my office or my darkroom that I worked out of was in the downtown office not, not out in the bureau.  So I was able to learn a lot and get connected with the newsroom a la- a little bit more so than some of the other photographers that were out in the neighbors because, you know, you're closer to the center of everything.  So I kind of watched how things worked and realized that I needed to be very proactive about, you know, stuff that I wanted to do if I wanted to move up through the next level.  And so when I, I woke up very early one morning and heard on the radio that this volcano had erupted and, man, I decided that was my assignment.  I was going.  I got dressed, I got packed, I got, got my gear ready, and called in and said, "I'm ready to go.  This is for me.  This is my--it's my turn to go."
Story_ID: 660400
Speaker 1: So you were talking off camera maybe about the pictures and the photos and that you shot of the volcano [Nevado del Ruiz]--I mean eruption--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, I, I called into the office to say that I really wanted to go to this assignment.  It was my turn to go.  I felt that I was ready to go.  And I could tell that my boss wasn't 100 percent, you know, in tune with that.  But then they came up with the idea of let's send Michel [HistoryMaker Michel du Cille] and Carol [Carol Guzy].  Let's send the two of those together because they would work well together.  They knew that we had a good friendship and that we would, you know, work well together.  And so, so Carol and I actually went--we, we, along with two other news organizations, chartered a, a, a jet to fly from Miami [Florida] to Colombia.  And we, we didn't land in Bogota [Colombia].  We landed in--at the airstrip that was only like, you know, maybe about eight or nine, ten kilometers from the eruption.  So what we did was we kept the jet on the runway and told the guys to stay there so that we could come back and bring film to them so that they could fly back with the film.  I mean, back then the only other option would have been to use the AP [Associated Press] to send on the drum, you know.  And back then I think color was just beginning for the--to be going over the wire, but it wasn't great.  So we really wanted that color film to get back.  And we were shooting--we were--we were photographing with slides.  We were use--shooting Ektachrome and Fujichrome, so it had to be, you know processed special process.  So it was a brilliant move for us to keep the jet on the runway, and, and say, "Okay you're, you're bring it back to Miami."  And that's how we were able to get good, brilliant color pictures in the paper [Miami Herald].  You know, and of course they ran the young girl underwater on the front page.  And I think later on, you know, that the helicopter picture--I can show them to you on my--on my laptop.  But, you know, Carol and I worked very well together, and so to our surprise, our story won the Pulitzer Prize [Pulitzer Prize in Spot News Photography] in 1986 from work that was done in November of '85 [1985].
Story_ID: 660401
Speaker 1: You won again in '88 [1988].
Speaker 2: Yes, so two years later I--again my outspokenness kind of reared its ugly head again.  Because crack [crack cocaine] was becoming a big, big deal in Miami [Florida] and had been for a couple of years.  So this is '87 [1987] now.  You know, fast forward to 1987.  And I was upset that my newspaper's predominant way of covering the crack story was to show the drug dealers being arrested.  And I remember one picture that was actually shot by a colleague of mine, and it showed a young black man.  He was wearing one of those reflective Ray Ban sunglasses, you know, the, the, the--that, that, that, that looks like a mirror.  And there he was kind of mimicking, you know, and jeering at the photographers, and he had--he had these drugs in his hands.  And that was the face of crack.  And so I felt like my paper [Miami Herald] and the media pretty much projected the crack issue as a--as a black issue, that, that crack was--wa- wa- was only--it was only something that was going on in the black community.  And I set out to say to them that I think that we really have need--first of all, we need to have a more in depth report--photographic essay on crack in Miami.  And second of all, I believe that we need to also be balanced about it.  We need to not just show that it's black faces.  Because the truth of the matter was that there were an awful lot of whites and Hispanics that were crack addicts and crack dealers.  So we--so I set out to, to show that.  And they said yes, okay, go do your project, so they let me work on it for quite a few months.  And when I got to a point where I actually found a place to hone in on, to focus on, they assigned a writer to it, and her name was Lynne Duke.  And you know, god bless her soul.  She passed away last year.  She also was a colleague of mine here at The Washington Post.  She, she covered South Africa and Mandela [Nelson Mandela] coming out of prison and everything.  But she and I worked together in Miami on that story.  And the--you know, the story won the Pulitzer Prize [Pulitzer Prize in Feature Photography] in 1988 because it, it became kind of the definitive deep, deep dive, long form storytelling about crack--crack in the society from Miami's perspec- perspective.
Speaker 1: Was it difficult to get photos of crack users?
Speaker 2: It was.  It took me quite a long time.  There were time that weeks and days went by that I didn't take a single picture.  Because I would show up at the crack houses and then at, at the, the--this housing project was called the graveyard.  The residents and the city people called it the graveyard; even the cops called it the graveyard because it was, you know, so overwhelmingly crack--crack dealers and addicts had taken over the whole place.
Story_ID: 660402
Speaker 1: What typifies a crack [crack cocaine] addict?  I mean, I, I don't know if people really have a sense or will have a sense of it when the--by the time they hear your, your story, you know.
Speaker 2: The drug is cheap.  In some ways it was probably cheaper than, than--you know, it's cheaper than an ounce of marijuana to buy a, a couple rocks for five dollars or ten dollars; and it's incredibly addictive.  As you can see in a couple of photographs that you have there're a couple of different ways that people would smoke crack.  The easiest way was with a Coke [Coca-Cola] can.  Put a hole in the top of the Coke can; use a piece of aluminum foil and bore holes in the foil--you know, pinholes in the foil--and that becomes the pipe to put the rock in.  And so you're, you're sucking the pipe through the part of the Coke can that you drink out of, right.  So that's--that becomes the pipe.  Or, in that other photographs that, that you have there, it's a small liquor bottle.  The little plastic liquor bottles that you get on airplanes put a hole in the top; put foil over the hole; and use the spout of the bottle to be a pipe.  And so it's--even, even--not, not wa- not just the drug was cheap, but there were cheap ways to smoke it.  You didn't have to have any fancy kind of apparatus to--you know, like a needle.  You didn't have to go find a needle to shoot up, or you didn't have to find something expensive to, to, to do the drug.  It was an easy to, to do the drug.
Speaker 1: Could do it yourself.
Speaker 2: You do it yourself, yeah.  And so a lot of the drug addicts--a lot of the crack addicts were women, which, which was pretty, pretty awful, because the way that they got money to, to feed their high was to prostitute themselves.  And so they would go out and prostitute themselves for five, ten dollars and come back and buy a five, ten dollar rock.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How long does a typical ad- addict stay high from that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: The high is fleeting.  Back then, you know, depending on how strong the drug was, I mean, they'd come down within an hour, you know, less, less even.  It's a--it's a--it's a--it's a euphoric high that just comes on and, and it goes very quickly but incredibly addictive.  You just wanna do more and more and more to stay high and partially because it didn't last that long.  And you know, you, you know about the chemistry of mixing cocaine and, and, and so forth to make crack.  It's, it's, it's a cheap, you know, mixture of chemicals.
Speaker 1: So it's a--but I, I take it it's a faster path to the graveyard than some other dru- drugs?
Speaker 2: Yes and mainly because, you know, it just--it, it, it just--the women that I photographed and documented they, they were--they were going down fast, you know.  I didn't experience anyone dying from crack but, you know, just, just to, to, to be there, to be nothing but wanting that high, and your, your entire hygiene and food and just normal living goes right out the door.  And as you can see in the photographs, you know, there was one lady that was a mother of five kids that, that was a crack addict.  And, and, and she just--she neglected the children and, and, and was living with this worthless guy who, who abused her and, and the children.  So it, it was just a really bad situation to--to experience.
Story_ID: 660403
Speaker 1: The same year in '88 [1988]--now you're only thirty-two years old.
Speaker 2: Back in '88 [1988] I was only thirty-two.
Speaker 1: You got two Pul- Pulitzer Prizes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I, I--the funny thing is that my, my--one of the photo editors in Miami [Florida] became the director of photography here at The Washington Post.  He actually became the assistant managing editor photography at The Washington Post.  So he recruited me to come up.  This was around February, March of '88 [1988].  So then the Pulitzer gets announced at the end of April.  And, oh my god, the Miami Herald starts this long recruiting to try to get me to stay in Miami, but I really felt like it was time to move on.  I also was offered the opportunity to be picture editor.  So at thirty-two I became a very young manager at The Washington Post.  And I, I wanted to contribute by, by being a part of a team--a management team.  So I, I, I took the job here and that was twenty-seven years ago.  This April will be twenty-seven years.
Speaker 1: Now Carol Guzy also came, came up with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Carol--Joe [Joseph Elbert] recruited Carol to come very shortly after.  I think she came maybe that summer, a couple of months after I did.  But, yes, Carol--and, and, and it became kind of an odd thing, because as number two in the photo department, I became Carol's supervisor, which even she will admit is a very difficult task.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause she, yes, she's--Carol has, has--is a--one of America's greatest photojournalists.  And she knows what she wants, when she wants it, and she, she is--she, she goes deep into a story.  She dives very deep and wants to do an essay that will be long term over a long period of time so that she can capture all the moments.  Imagine if you're doing a movie, and you wanna make sure all the scenes are right.  That's the way she works.  She's gotta have it.  She sits down and scripts it out in her head that this is what the story is about, and these are the kinds of pictures that I need.  And if I don't have the, then the story is not finished.  So, so most of the time she and I were battling it out about how much time it took for her to spend on each story.  And many of the times I must say she was right, because the story was strong for it, you know.  But on the other hand, we're a newspaper.  You know, we're used to the daily.  You know, we gotta get it out--gotta get it out every day.  You gotta put the paper out every day.  And so it's hard to peel somebody away for months on end to do, you know, a story.
Story_ID: 660404
Speaker 1: Now you were recognized by your colleagues in '89 [1989] as journalist of the year.  This is the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Black journalists, yes.
Speaker 1: Once again, you're thirty-three years old.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was pretty amazing because I think that they were colleagues of mine that felt that a photojournalist that had kind of gotten to where I am should be recognized.  And that was--that was really fantastic--really fantastic.  I fact, I got--the, the, the prize is a head of Frederick Douglass.  And, and unfortunately it's been damaged, and I need to--I need to get it redone.  But it's a--it's a bust of Frederick Douglass, which is really, really nice to have.
Story_ID: 660405
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you really like what, what was at risk when you shot the pictures of the--of the crack house [in Miami, Florida] and, and even in the, the, the volcano [Nevado del Ruiz] pi- pictures.  You go into a situation--I, I guess a photojournalist--some of the recognition is for the--I guess the--for the courage to go places (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, courage--
Speaker 1: --where this--
Speaker 2: --courage, bravery, you know, just, just, just having the presence of mind to, to, to not be overcome by the stress of being in the--in that tough an environment.  Yeah, it was--it was chancy, but you know, for some reason I did--I felt safe.  I felt that I'd spent enough time doing due jitta- diligence, letting people know who I was.  In fact, at one point, I knew who the big time dealer was in the graveyard, and 'cause he'd come driving in, in his big blue Mercedes-Benz.  And he got out of the car, and I went running up to him to try to shake his hand and introduce myself, you know, and saying, "Hey, I wanna talk to you.  I'm with the Miami Herald, and I'm a photographer, and I wanna--I'm documenting the graveyard, and I wanna talk to you about it."  And he never answered me.  He just kept walking, but he kept looking back at me, you know, with that look like, he's crazy; yeah, he's really crazy.  He wants to interview me about crack [crack cocaine] in the graveyard.  Yeah, he's crazy.  But he never said a word.  He just--his eyes said it all (laughter).  But I--you know, it was when you believe in a story, and like I said, I had gotten to know almost all the people there.  And they, they were not--you know, they, they, they knew who I was so I felt safe.
Speaker 1: But the volcano story, it's, it's hard to appease a volcano.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it, it erupts, but that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 1: --that's--
Speaker 2: --I mean, your--
Speaker 1: --it's not gone--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're capturing a disaster there.  You're, you're, you're capturing aftermath there.  And actually for me it was--health wise--it was hard because I'm--I don't do well in altitude--high altitude.  In Colombia--parts of Colombia is very high above sea level, and so I had a lot of problems hiking through the woods--through the bushes of Colombia to get to the site of the, the volcano eruption.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: People called it the mudslide.  And the reason they called it the mudslide is because when the volcano erupted, the icecaps melted and water, debris, snow, sand, rocks flooded down into this valley where the city [Armero, Colombia] was.  And it just enveloped the whole city, and twenty-five thousand people were killed.  So, you know, basically, yeah, the volcano was a tough physical thing to do.  But, but, no, there wasn't anybody that would shoot at me or anything.
Story_ID: 660406
Speaker 1: I guess from eight--from the--now what did you do in the--well, in the early '90s [1990s] at some point you went back to school to earn a degree from Ohio--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) University [Ohio University, Athens, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Well, before that in 1990, one of my colleagues was scheduled to go to South Africa with Lynne Duke, my--the co- colleague of mine [at the Miami Herald] that wrote the crack [crack cocaine] story.  She--by, by that time she was here at The Post [The Washington Post].  And I got the opportunity to go to South Africa because my other colleague couldn't go, and I, I was able to document South Africa before Mandela was released.  So it was shortly after that that I got serious about finishing my master's degree.  I had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wa- well, let me--well, well--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --let me--(unclear), you gotta go back and talk about (unclear).  Now, now this is--and you go pre the release of Nelson Mandela.
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I, I, wa- and, and I was the boss.  I was the, the, the, the supervisor in photo, but my, my direct boss and I decided that I, I was the best person to go on this trip and to document South Africa but prior to Mandela's release.
Speaker 1: Now that, that had to be really baffling to the South (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was--
Speaker 1: --African 'cause--
Speaker 2: --amazing--it was an amazing situation.
Speaker 1: --you're, you're--
Speaker 2: --yes.
Speaker 1: --ba- a black man.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Many people in that country look just like you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And yet you're the boss of a crew of white people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that are over there shooting pictures--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --about a country making a transition from--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --apartheid to--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: --so--
Speaker 2: --surreal.  At one point, Lynne Duke and I went into a restaurant.  It was a little hole in the wall kind of restaurant too.  It was not a big fancy place, but it was a white restaurant.  And the owner said, "I'm very sorry, but we can't serve you.  We, we don't treat--we don't serve Coloureds here."  And of course, both Lynne and I are light skin, you know.  We both look like you.  So we would be called Coloureds; we're not, not black.  So she said, "I'm sorry; we don't serve Coloureds here."  And I remember her daughter, who was working as a waitress in the restaurant, came and said, "Mom, mom, you're so behind on the times.  What is wrong with you?  The--and, and, and on top of it, these are Americans visiting us.  You've have--you have to let them eat here."  And, and mom gave in.  And would you believe the whole kitchen staff--we had so many glasses of water because the whole kitchen staff wanted to come and see for the first--'cause it was the first time they had seen anybody of color eat, eat in their--in that restaurant.  So the kit--
Speaker 1: Was, was, was the staff black?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the staff was all black.  Yeah, the staff the, the--there were all the cooks, and you know, dishwashers and people, and they came out.  And at one point, one of 'em came by and leaned over--she brought us a glass of water.  We didn't ask for it--and said, "You're the first person of color to eat in this restaurant."  So it was a--it was kind of a, a triumphant feeling that, my god, here we are Americans, Mandela is about to release, it's 1990 for goodness sakes, and we still have this issue that you can't come in here and eat, you know.  So we felt very proud of ourselves.  We felt that we, we, we came to South Africa and made a difference to that one little spot, that one little restaurant.  (Unclear) sure--it sure made the day of thi- the kitchen staff 'cause they were--they were elated.  They were very elated to see us come in there and eat.  But it was a great experience to cover South Africa.
Story_ID: 660407
Speaker 1: Unfortunately, though, you know, during that time, if you remember--I don't know if you saw the move recently.  It really didn't become clear in, in the movie 'Mandela' ['Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom'] about how much inter-fighting there was between the, the, the Zulus--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and--and the, the other Africans in South Africa (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the an--ANC [African National Congress] and the--
Speaker 1: The ANC versus--
Speaker 2: --(unclear)--
Speaker 1: --the Inkatha [Inkatha Freedom Party], you know.  And the Inkatha people were taking a lot of support from the government because they took concessions from the government and--but the government was allowing this inter-fighting to--this internecine fighting to occur between blacks in South Africa.  And, and a lot of people died from--you know, even though Mandela [Nelson Mandela] was about to re- be released and such a happy moment was about to happen, there was all this fighting that was going on between the black--blacks in, in South Africa.  So I covered some of that but also covered the, the basic--well our story was on how basic life was for the ordinary South African black.  You know, what, what was gonna change for them?  What, what, what exactly would, would change, you know, standards of living, you know, jobs.  You know, what, what, what was life gonna be like in this new South Africa?
Speaker 2: Did you get a chance to cover Mandela's release (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, I didn't because by that time I came back.  And my, my boss (laughter)--my boss always said, "You know, every time I let you go on one of these--one of your little adventures, you know, things, things go to hell back here at the office, so--," I, I didn't go to Mandela's release.  So the guy that was supposed to go on that first trip he went, and we sent another photographer as well.  We sent two people: Dudley Brooks and Michael Williamson.  In fact, Dudley is now director of photography at Ebony magazine.  He, he left The Washington Post to go to Ebony magazine as DOP.
Story_ID: 660408
Speaker 1: So when you got back--now is this when you decided go to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, I had decided to go back to school early on in '88 [1988]; in fact, I had en- enrolled at Ohio University [Athens, Ohio] in '88 [1988] because I spoke to the, the, the, the chairman of the VisCom department [Ohio University School of Visual Communication].  His name is Chuck Scott.  He felt like there were a lot of professionals who really want to get their degree, but they can't pull up roots and move to Athens [Ohio] and, and to, to spend two years working on their degree.  So he was trying to figure out a way where we could get--I could get my degree by--you know, by doing short term courses, doing independent study courses, and transferring some credit hours.  And it was really a big experiment that the school did not like; and, in fact, they, they let me do it, but I think I was the last one that they let do it.  So I transferred courses from the University of Maryland; I took independent study courses.  Na- na- and remember when I was telling you about this--those--the essay I wrote on Marcus Garvey?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was funneled for one of my independent study courses.  And I, I did spend some short--you know, those short summer credit hours on campus.  So I go the degree--finished up and I got to be--got, got the actual paper in '94 [1994].  But it took me from what, what enrolled in late '88 [1988].  So it took me, you know--
Speaker 1: Six years.
Speaker 2: --six years to finish.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Ohio University is one of the prestigious journalism schools (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Matt Lauer--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Clarence Page--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and many others came out--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of Ohio--
Speaker 2: In--
Speaker 1: --University.
Speaker 2: In fact, my, my degree is from the journalism school [E.W. Scripps School of Journalism, Athens, Ohio] not from the visual communications school, because it's--I wrote a thesis.  And my thesis was about what was reviewing the history of the front page of The Washington Post.
Story_ID: 660409
Speaker 1: Were there any individuals involved in the Ohio, the Ohio--University [Ohio University, Athens, Ohio] program that you remember as being important for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, Chuck Scott.  He had been in, in the instructor business for many years and then, then he went into education.  He had been at the Milwaukee Journal [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel] back in, you know, the '50s [1950s], '60s [1960s].  He--the Milwaukee Journal is very progressive for photojournalism.  In fact, my old professor from Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], John Ahlhauser, was also a Milwaukee Journal photographer and a contemporary of Chuck Scott.  So, yes, he was very instrumental in, in helping me to, to push to get my master's degree.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, so when you came back with your master's degree in '94 [1994] did you--oh, I'm sorry; I, I didn't talk about your thesis--history of The Washington Post front pages.
Speaker 2: Yes, well, it was more of a review of The Washington Post front pages.  And you know, prior to myself and my colleague, Joe Elbert [Joseph Elbert], coming to The Washington Post, the front page of The Post was not--let's just say it was not a--a great place for photojournalism.  I mean, I think that the photographs were there almost, almost as a second thought.  And my theory was that photographs are true journalism, and that people respond to pictures first, and people will gather a lot of information from pictures, sometimes from, from just the picture in the caption rather than the story, and so that we should pay a lot more attention to the selection process for the front page.  And so I basically kind of did a study of the front page of what it was over the years and where, where we were to- to- today back then in '93 [1993], '94 [1994].  So that's--that, that, that became the--my thesis is to study the front page and what, what recommendations and changes that I saw that were needed to bring The Washington Post up to a more modern front page.
Story_ID: 660410
Speaker 1: How did the front page morph over the years, and, and what were your recommendations?
Speaker 2: It morphed into us accepting strong storytelling photojournalism.  One example that I cited was that one year early on when we first really started paying attention, everything the president did was front page picture.  I mean, Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was on the front page.  I forget the total number that I said in my theses.  Maybe out of 360, Ronald Reagan was on the front page more than 190 times, which is an awful lot of headshots of the president of the United States.  And so my, my thought process was that we need to, to change that and to, to be much more storytelling with our photographs, that we can use photojournalism to dig deeper into the lives of our subjects and make photographs that say more, mean more, have more of an emotional impact on our readers.  And those, you know, were my recommendations, that we, we needed to move away from just running headshots of the president ja- just because we didn't have anything that day.  And (unclear) that we had to have a staff that was really working very closely with the reporters--working very closely with the editors to have photographs with our important stories.  You know, if there was a photograph of Jimmy, 'Jimmy's World' would never have happened.  Remember when The Washington Post was accused of fic- fictionalizing a boy that was a heroin addict?
Speaker 1: Right, that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) By the Janet Cooke (unclear) story.  Well--
Speaker 1: --in 1981 [sic. 1980]--
Speaker 2: Yes, part of my theory was that if someone had photographed Jimmy, or at least if someone had insisted on photographing Jimmy, it would never have happened because you would have photographic proof that, that, that there was a Jimmy.  So it, it was that kind of recommendation, that we really needed strong photojournalism to drive the design and the look of the front page of The Washington Post.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I gave copies to my executive editor, and, and my managing editor, and some of the other editors in the newsroom.  And they just smiled and thanked me.  I don't think it really had any immediate impact other than, you know, to some extent preaching to the choir, because by then--especially the executive editor, Len Downie [Leonard Downie, Jr.], already got it and already understood that we needed to change the way our front page looked and, and had taken steps and recommendations that we made daily to, to make the front page look different, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, okay.  And have, have you seen improvement over the years?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.  I think--I think The Washington Post uses pictures well and understands the power of photojournalism, and I think it's in their tradition that--I can proudly say that it began to change under my watch and, and, and has remained strong today.
Story_ID: 660411
Speaker 1: So you continue to picture--as a picture editor of The Post [The Washington Post] from '88 [1988] until--
Speaker 2: Two thousand five [2005].
Speaker 1: Two thousand five [2005].  That's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's when you became associate editor and senior photojournalist, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I insisted that I--it was time to just--for me to get back and to be back in the field.  And I, I did so for quite a while--well, a couple of years anyway.  And while I was back in the field, the Walter Reed project [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Washington, D.C.] fell in my hands.  Dana Priest and Anne Hull were investing the treatment of veterans, and my editors asked me to work with them on the project.  And at first, you know, I didn't think a whole lot of it.  It was--you know, one of the first things we did was to photograph a soldier showing us the mold on his wall in the building that the--that the Walter Reed folks had an overflow for the wounded veterans.  And they basically put people up in a dilapidated old hotel.
Speaker 1: Is that the Motel 6 across the street?
Speaker 2: It wasn't--it's not the Motel 6.  It's called Building 18.  It's next door--it's, it's close to the Motel 6, but it wasn't that's--it wasn't the Motel 6.  It's Building 18 down the--maybe a few buildings down from the Motel 6.  I know which one you're talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, things kind of started off that slow.  And then as, as I kept working with them, it got deeper and deeper into the treatment of, of veterans, and we really took a deep, deep dive into their lives and their--and, and to see the veterans who fought a war come home to, to not the best treatment.  And when I say treatment, I don't mean medical treatment.  I mean bureaucratic treatment.  Like, the veterans' services were not in place for people.  People who needed counseling for PTSD [posttraumatic stress disorder]--PTSD was a big deal that the government did not recognize.  And indeed, like we just said, you know, yes, they--Walter Reed was, was overflowing and, and they needed more room for--to house veterans who were wound.  But to put them up in an old dilapidated, you know, motel, you know, it, it was not the right--was not the right answer, so.
Speaker 1: Right (unclear).  I remember a report by Keith Ob- Ob- Olbermann [Keith Olbermann] about it.  He, he, he had photos of--I mean, he had like some footage on his show ['Countdown with Keith Olbermann'] of roaches in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Walter Reed--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --mold growing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no it was--it was bad, but we, we broke the story.  And, and the, the, the story--I won the, the gold medal Prize for--the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service and that was 2008.  So, so in 2007, though--the end of 2007, my boss had decided to retire.  And my, my editors convinced me that I should throw my name into the hat and, and, and, and, and become the director of--I'm sorry--become the assistant managing editor for photography.  And I went ahead and did that, and so from 2007 to 2012 I was director.
Speaker 1: Now in 2009 the newsroom was reorganized, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, the newsroom--actually, the newsroom was reorganized and I became director.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my title was first assistant managing editor, and then it changed to director because the, the newsroom was reorganized.
Speaker 1: The (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But essentially the same job.
Story_ID: 660412
Speaker 1: In 2009--now, now tell me if I'm going too fast here.  I don't know if I'm moving too fast, but in 2009 you get married.  Now is this--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) is this your first time or--
Speaker 2: No, it was second marriage.  My kids [Leighton du Cille and Lesley Anne du Cille] are grown.  I had lived in Virginia for the past, you know, seventeen, eighteen years.  And, and I, I met my current wife [Nikki Kahn] here at The Post [The Washington Post].  She was also working here, and we built a relationship and got married in 2009.  She--it, it--it's, it's, it's kind of a--a harder way to go to--be married to someone that works in the same department as you, but there are some real pluses to it, and there are some--you know, I'd say we have to work, work hard to not allow work to become the only thing that's the conversation at home (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It takes work.
Story_ID: 660413
Speaker 1: I guess the state of photojournalism in the--in the news world today?
Speaker 2: In, in The Washington Post or in the wider world (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, in The Washington Post, first, first of all.
Speaker 2: Well, I think that we're--I think we're strong.  We are smaller.  We're a smaller staff.  With, with buyouts and incentives for people to retire, we were--at one point, we were up to thirty-two photographers, and now we're up to around fifteen or so.  I, I think we're--we've got a strong crew of, of staff photographers and freelancers.  And thank goodness we have some editors who are holding--you know, hold their fort quite strong.  You know, the changes in the news business has been dramatic, and, and so basically, we're managing change.  And you know, I think that the, the photo editors of today, whether they're at The Washington Post or elsewhere, a good--a good part of their work is managing change.  You know, I--as a photojournalist I'm not just a picture taker.  I am not only taking still photographs, so the world that we now live in is--has tranditioned--transitioned into a multimedia world.  So when I go after a story, I may be asked to shoot video, to collect audio, and to put still pictures, audio, video together as a multimedia presentation.  So to me it's exciting because I, I like the challenge.  It, it has come slow to some places.  We at The Washington Post, we've always had a--you know, we were one of the first big papers to have a website, and we've always had since--I would say since the mid to late '90s [1990s] and definitely into 2000, we had a video staff--a separate video staff, separate from the still staff.  And at one point, the still--the still and video staff was together.  In an intra- interim period of time I managed both video and stills.  And now they're separated again because the sti- the video is not just doing documentary video.  It's managing incoming third party video.  It's having what's called having programs and shows where--you know, it's about politics and--but it's all on the web [World Wide Web].  It's called PostTV.  And so I think it's a very promising future.  I can't say whether or not it's gonna be the same in ten years, that things aren't gonna evolve again, but right now we're in the game.  And we are doing this--we're, we're working strong.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is that what we mean by convergence, the--all this media together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I mean--I, I think--I think transitions probably somewhere in there along with convergence because we're--a lot of our readers are now gonna be responding to tablet and, and, and, and PDAs [personal digital assistant], as well as laptops and desktops.  But I think that the printed page will be around for a while too.  I don't think The Washington Post printed page is gonna go away tomorrow.  I think that there's still a part of our readership that responds to the printed page and will, will, will, will pay for a printed page.  But we have to do all of the above.  We can't--we can't close our eyes to--to the web and say, "Well, we're, we're a print product and let's just work on the print product."  So we, we have to do all of the above.
Story_ID: 660414
Speaker 1: How do you feel about--I've heard it said that some editors would just as soon have the reporter, you know, take, take a snapshot (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I just--you know, as, as a photojournalist, I, I, I think that that is a--I, I, I thinks that's sloppy thinking.  Because if you wanna put out an excellent product--if you want readers to respond to deep, strong journalism--a reporter who hasn't been trained is only going to take a quick snapshot and, and scratch the surface.  So imagine flipping it the other way.  If the visual world became, you know, where okay, so we're gonna--let's say we're gonna get rid of five reporters and then tell the photographers that they have to write the story and take the pictures, you know, and do the video and do the multimedia all by themselves.  That is really exactly what we're talking about is that you, you--you're handing a big job over to someone that's not--it's not their area of expertise.  And so I, I--I'm not saying that occasionally we should not use a reporter's photographs.  The other day, only about a month ago, maybe three weeks ago, Bart Gellman [Barton Gellman] went to Moscow [Russia] to interview Snowden [Edward Snowden].  And of course, he was the only person allowed because they had some real secret way.  He didn't even know where to meet him until--I think like within the hour of meeting him that he didn't even know where he was gonna meet him.  So there's no chance there where a photojournalist could show up with, with Bart Gellman, you know, to go oh, I brought--I brought along a photographer, you know.  If I was Snowden I'd go no.  So Bart took the photographs, and I think he did a pretty good job.  I think he did a very good job, and I've know Bart for years.  He's, he's always liked photography and understood how it works, and, and, and taught himself how to do decent pictures.  So in a case like that I say absolutely.  You, you need a writer to be able to do an important photograph.  But for an organization to simply say, "Okay, we're gonna release all of the photojournalists, and we'll keep all the writers.  And we'll tell the writers to use their iPhones to take photos."  That sounds dodgy to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Plain and simple.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what are you shooting with to--today?
Speaker 2: I use Nikons.  But you know, to me it's not the equipment it's the knowledge that you bring to the--to the--to the table.  But our staff uses Nikons only because of a nic- for, for economics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you know, Canon is a fine camera.  Between my wife [du Cille's second wife, Nikki Kahn] and I we own a Leica, so, I mean we, we, we use whatever is needed.
Story_ID: 660415
Speaker 1: Today do you have a project that you're--I mean a big project in mind that you really wanna complete?
Speaker 2: I'm still interested in the crack situation.  I think that, that, that there's, there's an epilogue somewhere related to crack, especially in, in regards to the mandatory minimum sentences.  So I'm researching, but I have other daily or semi daily type assignments that, that I'm working on.
Speaker 1: Okay, would you--are, are you thinking of, of a book or anything like that?
Speaker 2: I don't--I, I wouldn't go that far yet.  Yeah, It'd be nice, but you know, I, I think photo books are very difficult.  They, they have to be some kind of a subject matter that will sell.  And often they're just not, you know, sellable to the general public.  So you could--you could put a lot of money into 'em and lose, lose your shirt doing--trying to do a photo book.  But you know, yes, I would love to do a project that, that be--that's a popular book.  You know 'I Dream a World,' ['I Dream a World: Portraits of Black Women Who Changed America'] the book about African American women that did extremely well, extremely well.  I worked on a book with Dudley Brooks.  He and Michael Cheers [D. Michael Cheers] and Eric Easter came up with the idea to have--do a book about African Americans, and they called it 'Songs of My People' ['Songs of My People: African Americans, A Self-Portrait'].
Speaker 1: I've read that.
Speaker 2: That came out in the mid-'90s [1990s].  I was one of the photo editors on that book.  You know, that sold very well.  But a book on crack cocaine is not something people are gonna go well, I wanna see that on my coffee table (laughter), you know, so.  I, I, I don't know.
Speaker 1: But, but, but you think that peop- people need to see--
Speaker 2: I think--I think that people need to hear the, the, the, the second part of--you know, back--the answer to all the crack epidemic legally was to put people away for life, to put these crack dealers away for life.  So the mandatory minimum sentences put an awful lot of people in jail for life for, for dealing drugs.  I mean, they didn't kill anyone; they weren't a part of any kind of violent act or anything, yet--and I'm not saying that dealing is, is a simple thing, but to put someone un- away for the rest of their life for dealing crack and then regular cocaine people were getting off, walk- walking out the door and not even spend any much their--jail time for the same--essentially the same drug.  There's a disparity there, and I don't think that we've told that story completely yet, so.
Story_ID: 660416
Speaker 1: Now you're currently a board member of the National Press Photographers Foundation, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, the, the photographers foundation is a partner, partner foundation with the National Press Photographers Association.  In fact, I'm a former board member of the National Press Photographers Association.  And basically, the press photographers association we do all things photojournalism.  But the foundation primarily--it's function is to raise funds for scholarships and to give out scholarships for visual, visual journalism--I'm sorry, give out scholarships for photography and video to the newspaper and television or wire services photographers who want to go to school and get a scholarship.  Or, some, some of it is for professionals who have lost jobs and wanna go back to school for advanced degrees and so forth.  So we give out scholarships.
Story_ID: 660417
Speaker 1: What's the field of press photography like today for emerging African American photographers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's, that's the sets- that's the sixty-four thousand dollar question, and some might say that's that the million dollar question.  You know, I think that it is evolving.  I don't discourage kids from going into photojournalism, but I do say to students--in fact, I was at Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] just earlier, earlier--I'm sorry--late last week.  I and--I used to tell students be prepared; be prepared for everything.  Be, be a, a photojournalist that can tell a story with multimedia or can stell--tell a story with still pictures.  I still believe that organizations--more than a third of what you see is--are pictures.  Even the big networks now how their websites--pictures.  Newspapers, their websites have become stronger.  Magazines are evolving to have strong web presence.  So I, I think that as long as students are being prepared and kind of find a different niche that are out there for telling a story visually.  So it's promising for the future, in my opinion, but daunting for, for a student who's going, "Newspapers are dying."  You know, they hear this--they hear this bombarded messages, "Newspapers are dying and you know, you've got to, you know--it's gonna be blogs, and it's gonna be BuzzFeed, and it's gonna be," you know, this and that and this and that.  I say if students learn the basics of journalism, the basics of storytelling, you start there and make sure you understand how to tell a story well with a still camera, or with a video camera, with audio, and how to put it together, editing it yourself.  You walk out of school with those skills, and you, you should be able to, to at, at least have somebody hear you out, because I think those are where the jobs are gonna be is--are students that have a well rounded er- education.
Story_ID: 660418
Speaker 1: --Me ask you about your--the way you shoot, and do you have a philosophy of shooting, in terms of how you appr- approach a story?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Becoming a fly on the wall is almost too simplistic, but it gets you in the direction of where my philosophy is.  I wanna walk into a situation and not become the center of attention, but I want to meld in the background of the scene or the event so that I can capture the reality of what is unfolding in front of me.  I often will spend a lot of time getting to know the subject and getting the subject to know me and feel comfortable with me so that I am--I don't become the center of attention, you know.  When you get somewhere and you start taking a lot of pictures, people are fascinated by being photographed, or sometimes not fascinated and don't wanna be photographed.  And you have to spend time kind of either talking them through the process or working in a way where they forget you're there.  So I, I like the moment based photojournalism, and one of my goals is to attempt to do that for video.  It's very difficult to do that for video because first of all I'm constantly being reminded that I have to put the camera on a tripod for video.  The camera has to be steady because then it become cinema verite.  And then, you know, you have to add sound, you know.  Wa- where, where is the mic gonna go so that you can get really good audio?  So those things kind of interrupt the process of capturing actual moments, but I don't think it's impossible.  I just think that it's a time constraint if you're not able to spend the time to let the subject get, get used to more tools than just a still camera, you know, to get used to the camera get used to the tripod and where you have your sound, if you're g- if you're gonna clip a, a microphone on the person for them to forget that it's there, or if you're gonna use a mic that will capture, you know, the sound that you really need without the, the microphone being intruded into the photograph.  So it's really just incorporating the tenets of capturing video and sound with still pictures.  That's how I see it in my head anyway.
Story_ID: 660419
Speaker 1: Do you have a, a favorite photographer other than yourself (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, I think an awful lot of Carol Guzy.  She is kind of one of those heroes of photojournalism today that is unknown.  She's known to the photojournalism world, but if you walked on the street and asked people about Annie Leibovitz, they're more likely to know who Annie Leibovitz is than Carol Guzy.  And I, in my opinion, think Carol Guzy is a far more fascinating and far more interesting photojournalist and photographer than Annie Leibovitz.  Annie Leibovitz to me is a celebrity photographer who gets the job to take, you know, well designed set portraits of celebrities.  And she's got a crew of people with equipment around her to make a fantastic image, when Carol Guzy works along and melds herself into the story to capture the reality of the story.  So, you know, my, my, my--one of my photographic heroes is Carol Guzy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there're many others too that I admire, and one of my first was [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks.  And when you look at Gordon's early work for Life magazine, he was the moment based photojournalist.  You know, if you look at his work from, from Harlem [New York, New York] and his work from the favelas in, in Brazil, you know, he has been--he's done it both ways.  He's done the set portraits.  He's got this incredible portrait of, oh, what is her name, Grace Kelly.  You know, so he's done the celebrity type portraits, but he's also done fantastic moment based photojournalism.  And that's who I first started to emulate.
Story_ID: 660420
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, as a storyteller, I tend to look at things from--and perhaps it's part of my journalistic background is to, to be a little bit on the side of being a pessimist.  But I, I don't--I, I, I think that the African American community still, still lives with deep, deep issues of race and, and of, of the scars of life in America that was not very positive for, for African Americans.  Just because we have a black president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] doesn't mean everything is great and wonderful.  There are still really deep needs of poverty and of, of, of education that's needed in the African American community.  The fact that there are--someone keeps saying that there are more than a million black men--more than--I've, I've even heard people say there's more than 2 million black men in prisons.  That's not a good number.  And so I don't mean to be pessimistic about the African American of the future, but I, I sure think that some things need to, to change.  And it seems to me that one of the best ways to uplift the African American community is through education.  And I, I, I wish that there were better avenues and that, that our school systems figurative--fig- figure out a way to, to, to get education to be much more a part of the, the, the African American community.  I was reading an article a few months ago about that same subject of African American males that are in prison.  And one, one of the writers, his thesis was basically that having a relative or a friend who has been in jail is such a regular thing in the African American community now.  It's not a big deal anymore.  Indeed he talked about these coming home parties that occur when somebody gets out of jail, and it's the whole community gets together for a big party for whoever comes home from jail.  And I don't begrudge that, but I think it's telling.  You know, I, I, I think that far too many of our young men are still not getting--not getting their, their due.  They're not getting the education that, that, that--I, I think the only thing that's gonna overcome poverty is ed- education.  But I also think that the government still has its responsibilities, and, and, and, and I'm not one of those people, you know, that agree with the different political parties that--you know, that say that the government doesn't have a responsibility to, to help disadvantaged people.  I think they do.  I think they most certainly do, and that's just my opinion.  But I do think that African Americans have come an awful long way, and, and there's a lot of hope and there's promise in, in, in our world.  But I guess because I'm a journalist, I get to see--I get to see and experience the bad stuff more than the ordinary individual on the street, which is probably why it bears on my mind more than most.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 660421
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently or do over again if you could?
Speaker 2: No, I think I've had a pretty darn good life.  I mean, I'm extremely fortunate.  You know, some, some, some fairy dust got sprinkled on me, and I've been extremely fortunate.  I don't think that--if, if there is any one thing that I would look back from, from a family point of view, I wish that I had spent more time with my kids when they were growing up, you know.  They took me out for a birthday dinner last night.  And my son [Leighton du Cille] is thirty and my daughter [Lesley Anne du Cille] is twenty-seven, you know, and I missed a lot of those growing up years.  If there's any one thing I would do differently is I would wanna have spent more time with my, my son and daughter, but other than that, I think that I've had a pretty nice life.
Story_ID: 660422
Speaker 1: Tell us about what your son and daughter are doing now.
Speaker 2: Well, my son [Leighton du Cille] works for an orga- organization called K12 [K12 Inc.].  He's, he's is working in their, their sales operation.  And my daughter [Lesley Anne du Cille] is a teacher's assistant for challenged kids, and she's--she's also a musician, so she plays the violin and you know, plays, she plays on the Manassas Symphony [Manassas Symphony Orchestra].  So they're, they're doing okay.  They're doing okay.
Story_ID: 660423
Speaker 1: Once again, if you look back on everything you've done to this point in life, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, you know, the work that my--the, the, the changes that my crack [crack cocaine] story caused, because after the story ran, it wasn't the Pulitzer Prize that made that story special.  It was the fact that when the story was published in the newspaper [Miami Herald], the city came in--the county came in and did what they were supposed to do all along and keep drug dealers out of the graveyard--out of the, the housing project called the graveyard.  And so they drove every--all of 'em out, and so decent poor people who lived in public housing projects could live free of drug dealers and crack heads coming in to take over their home environment.  And that I felt good about because my work made a change in something.  The Walter Reed project [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Washington, D.C.] that I worked with Dana Priest and Anne Hull on, on the treatment of veterans, it also changed something.  Because when that story came out, it opened the eyes of, of the American public to say hey, we got this war going on.  And everybody thinks that these guys are heroes, and they keep saying to them thank you for your service, but when they come home they're being housed in mold infested, dilapidated, old motels.  And, and so when that story broke it changed something.  It also really spirited the government to do something about PTSD [posttraumatic stress disorder].  Before that story ran in 2007, PTSD was not recognized as a condition by the [U.S.] military.  You know, of course, since you were a child you probably heard of shell shock and that kind of thing.  But it was still not recognized by the military as a condition that can be treated and should be treated.  And so after that story came out I believed that our story made that become more to the front--forefront of the government, and change moved faster to change PTSD to, to be a recognized condition like it is now.  And so to me the legacy that I feel is that my work has caused a change in society.  And, and I am extremely honored and proud that something I did made some contribution to the changes in society.  So, you know, I, I think that, that, that--that's--those are the--that's the main legacy is change that my work brought to society.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything that we haven't discussed that is essential before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I think we've covered it.  I can't think of anything right now.
Speaker 1: There always is something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'm sure there's something (laughter).
Speaker 1: At any rate, with the time we have.  The last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As, as a regular guy who didn't get puffed up about having Pulitzer Prizes, and, and, and I'd like to remembered as just a humble photojournalist who wanted to capture the human condition with a camera.  And, and as long as that happens I'm, I'm happy.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm glad that you could do this interview with us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
