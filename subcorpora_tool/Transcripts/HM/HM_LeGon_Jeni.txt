Speaker 1: --name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewing for the HistoryMakers today.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns, observing is your husband Frank, what's your last--
Speaker 2: Clavin.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Frank Glavin.
Speaker 2: No Clavin.
Speaker 1: C-L-A-V-I-N.
Speaker 2: C-L-A-V-I-N.
Speaker 1: Okay. Clavin.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And ma'am, could you, give us your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My name is Dr. Jeni, J-E-N-I LeGon, L-E-capital-G-O-N.  Dr. Jeni LeGon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you prefer the spelling Jeni with two N's and an I-E, or just one N and an I?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Wonderful. No, I love it this way. It was changed from J-E double--in fact, I'm writing a book and I--one of the things I think I'm going to say under when I say the title of it, then I'm going to say written by Dr. Jeni LeGon from J-E-double-N-I-E to J-E-N-I.  So I like J-E-N-I best.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right. Now do you have a middle name?
Speaker 2: I had them, but I dropped them.  (Laughter) I didn't use them anymore at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any nicknames?
Speaker 2: I was called Tiny when I was a baby, because I was a wee baby and they called me Tiny until I was about six or so, and then I guess I grew enough to not be called Tiny anymore.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay. Now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Let me tell you how I got the spelling of the J-E-N-I.  May I?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was fortunate to do the first movie that I did was called 'Hooray For Love' and Louella Parsons--it starred Gene Raymond and Ann Sothern, and Louella Parsons was the--as you all know, was this wonderful columnist in the papers in Los Angeles and she wrote an article about my having this--we got this position to be in the dance group, Bill Robinson, Bill Bojangles Robinson, and [Thomas] Fats Waller and the sequence for this movie 'Hooray for Love.'  And the day she wrote it, she didn't have enough room to write J-E-double-N-I-E, so she wrote J-E-N-I, and we had it legalized and that's how I became--spelled Jeni that way.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now LeGon, your last name has changed too, hasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, when I got the--the family--my family name is L-I-G-O-N, Ligon, and we pronounce it that way, and then a lot of people say Ligon, but we don't care about that. Just so they spell it right, and it's L-I or L-Y-G-O-N. And--I--when I got the J-E-N-I, I liked the way it sounded because we do have French blood in us and I figured that if I made it L-E-capital-G-O-N, it would sound rather Frenchy.  And so in those days, you wanted to make your name sound nice and it looked good on the marquee.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's how I got it that way.  Right.
Speaker 1: All right. Well, can you give us your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was born August 14, 1916, Chicago, Illinois. Chicago, Illinois.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: I'm here again.
Speaker 1: Oh.  And--ma'am, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: What is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well I'm mainly a dancer.  I was a tap dancer in my youth, and I still dance some.  I teach dancing.  I've taught all the forms. I've taught ballet, jazz, and Katherine Dunham's wonderful stuff and I teach how to act, I teach singing, I'm a wonderful coach in bringing out what people need to know how to make a--become a performer, and I also am a percussionist, I play the conga drums, I play timbales, and I play steel drum.  And so I consider myself--and I act.  I'm an actress and I'm also a writer.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay?
Speaker 1: All right, well, what do--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I know one thing about her I know that her birth date is December 7th, because we were aware of what happened on December the 7th and we were celebrating her birthday.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well could you tell us what you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, let me think. I think I know quite a bit about my mother's family.  They're--my grandmother was born as a slave, and she lived in a plantation down in a place called Goose Pond, Georgia, and it's part of Oglethorpe County, I understand, and many of the other slave owners on this compound--I guess you can call it that--and my grandmother, my great-grandmother was named Harriet Davenport, and she was part mostly Indian and black and she married--she was Ms. Davenport and she married Mr.--no, she was Ms. Ebehart and she married Davenport, because my grandmother was Jennie Davenport.  And then my grandmother married a Bell and his names was James Bell. And they have eleven children, but she raised nine. Two of them died when they were kids.  And she came to--moved to--she sent her oldest two daughters to Atlanta, Georgia and then they all migrated to Chicago and they sent for the rest of the family to come to Chicago, and I think they came here in '14, 1914, just when the war started.

Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, his name was Hector, H-E-C-T-O-R, L-I-G-O-N.  My mother's--now that was my grandmother we were talking about first.
Speaker 1: Right. Right.
Speaker 2: Now this is my mom and me you want to know about. It was my grandmother, I was giving you her history.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now my mother, my father is--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Is Hector Ligon and he met my mother [Harriet Bell Ligon] when the family moved to Atlanta, and as far as I know, he's what we call Geechees the people down in South Carolina with their crazy mixture like New Orleans people, and he was--his--their parents were at one time slaves in the Barbados Islands and there was a slave rising and they--the slave owners petitioned the States to let them come up here and they gave them the Gulf Islands and portions of the Gulf Islands and that's when my dad was born, either in--on the South Carolina side in Carolina or on one of the Gulf Islands. That I don't know, because I don't know too much about my father.  He died when I was five and I don't know an awful lot about him other than he is a descendant from an earl that was sent to the Barbados during the time that they would put you in jail if you had run up bills and couldn't pay them, and it was called the debtor's prison in England and of course it always had these two families and we're descendants from that.  His name was Earl of Beauchamp and in England it's called Beacham, and there's a wonderful place there that we saw--I saw it when I was a kid in London in 1936, and it was on a travel--a TV travel thing the other day.  It's Lygon, L-Y-G-O-N Square, and it's a gated place. And I've seen it twice now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's not too far from the Palace, Buckingham Palace.
Speaker 1: This--the Earl of Beauchamp owns something called Brideshead or owns (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No, no, no. He owns a wonderful--they--his estate is part of the estate that it's in Wister, W-I-S-T-E-R England. I can't remember what other place it is, but the wonderful movie called 'Brideshead Revisited' was used as the setting for the story.
Speaker 1: Oh, Wister was used as a setting for that story?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So 'Brideshead Revisited.'  And it was originally one of the heirs of Brideshead that the story's about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they don't call it Brideshead. They call it you know another name, I can't--I don't remember what it was.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay?
Speaker 1: All right.  So did you know when your father was born?
Speaker 2: No.  I have no idea (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you suppose it was about the turn of the century?
Speaker 2: I guess so. Around there, yeah.
Story_ID: 18443
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother [Harriet Bell Ligon]. What kind of person was she, and what did she do--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: My mother?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, my mama's a doll. She was--she was very, very conscious. She raised all five of us early in Atlanta before they moved to Chicago, her middle son was playing--they had these places that the kids could open up grates and stuff you know on the stoves, and he was playing with a string one time and threw it in and pulled it out and he had on a flannel nightie and caught fire and died you know.  And--but she raised the five of us, and my sister [Mary Belle Ligon McLendon] was actually more my mom than my mom was because of the three boys between me and my sister was the oldest. And so when she found out my mom was pregnant, she asked the Lord to send her a girl.  (Laughter).  It turned out to be me and I understand that when my mother had her baby, she had it at home, and she called up my sister after I was out and presentable and put me in her arms, and she--I don't know what happened. I thought that was my mom. She raised me really, my sister, because my dad [Hector Ligon] died when I was five and my mom didn't take it too well, and she had just got married, and she took me and had me come.  And her mother-in-law came to keep house so that she could take care of me because my sister and her husband both worked.  And so my mother--my sister really was my mom in a sense, you know what I mean?  More than my mom, because I used to put--I used to butt their heads together.  I'd go and ask my sister if I could do something and she'd say yes, and I'd go to ask my mother and I'd start out by saying--my sister's name is Belle, B-E-double L-E--and I'd start out by saying Belle said that (laughter) I could do this and mom was--I'd say she was so sweet and easy, she never wanted no arguments and stuff. So she said well if Belle said so, yeah, I guess so, you know, like that.  She was just a sweetheart. She was beautiful. I have pictures of my mom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right. Now, did your mother--she went to school I guess in Georgia--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No.  Uh-uh. She could only write her name very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. She was in that period then. She learned to write her name and whenever she did, she knew that and she could write her telephone number. And she could read a book, but she wasn't fluent at all.  No.  But all my brothers and sisters were. They were well educated, yeah.
Story_ID: 18444
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents--your grandmother (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: My grandmother [Jennie Davenport Bell]--oh, I mentioned her earlier, grandma was the, called the matriarch of our family.  And she used to hold court on Sundays, and all the kids that had migrated from the South and all the branches of the Davenports, Ebeharts, and Huffs and all the different names would come. Somebody out of each section of that lineage would come and pay homage to Grandma and none of her daughters ever made any decisions unless they came to see Grandma (laughter). So she was beautiful and I was one of her favorite grandchildren.  I was named for my grandmother Jennie, and she and I were very close friends and I loved her dearly. She was wonderful. Just grand.  I don't know anything about my grandfather [James Bell].  He died before they moved North, yeah.  But I'll tell you what he looked like, he looked like what's his name--Kentucky Colonel--(laughter).
Speaker 1: Colonel Sanders?
Speaker 2: Colonel Sanders, with the pointed beard, because I have a picture of--we had in the family a beautiful picture of my great grandmother--my great grandmother Harriet [Ebehart Davenport] and my grandmother Jennie, and each of their husbands, and it's in one of those old ones where all these high collars and that sort of business and the two old guys are standing with their high hats turned upside down, putting their hands on their wives' shoulders, you know, and they're both stewed.  (Laughter). And my grandmother is sitting--she's trying to smile, but she's mad, you see, because she wasn't supposed to do that before they took those pictures. It was beautiful and they each had their own kind of beautiful gowns and I think both of my grands had on some sort of beautiful satin color hats--satin material hats and beautiful necklaces and stuff you know, pins and a lot of things they used to wear on their--and the guys are in tails and all that sort of business. I think we lost it because I was asking my cousins recently about them and somebody in the family is--you know, they don't need this stuff--how terrible.  But I grew up with this particular picture, yeah.
Story_ID: 18445
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father [Hector Ligon]. What was he like and what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well my father, as I said, I only remembered him for a short time. He died when I was five. But he was a doll and we had a picture of me in his arms when I was about four and we had it for a long, long time, and then it just--it got lost in the, moving around a bit. But I'll tell you what my father was good at. He was a wonderful storyteller, and I think he played the saw, and I think we got our musical--my sister [Mary Belle Ligon] sang and both my brothers sang.  My oldest brother [Hector Ligon Jr.] played piano by rote.  I mean he could listen to something and just sit down and play it.  But I think our talent came from my dad, because he was a wonderful storyteller and I remember as a youngster, we lived on 45th and Washington--I mean 45th and Wabash here in the city [Chicago], and we had a back porch and in the summertime, my dad would collect the kids that we played with and tell ghost stories. And they would be so vivid, his way he laughed at the roles and did the things and the kids would be scared to go home after it.  (Laughter)  He's telling these tales because they knew the bumpies and the gopies and whatever in the heck he was talking about were going to get 'em. But I do remember Daddy, he was very--and he would break into Geechee talking, and none of the kids were taught--my brothers and sister and my mom [Harriet Bell Ligon] didn't understand, and I remember that when he would go and talk this Geechee he would get mad and he'd go to this Geechee and all the kids would run, you know.  (Laughter)  They'd hide under the bed because nobody knew what he was saying but himself, you see. He was--my dad was chef. He worked--I think he worked down here at the Congress [Plaza Hotel] or the Hilton--the Conrad Hilton or something like that.  When it was you know, in its heyday, '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], yeah. Right before he died, I should say the '20s before he died, yeah. And the brothers were on the railroads for a  long time in the beginning of the railroad business, yeah. In fact my--Alfred [Melvin Ligon] that--we lived together in Los Angeles, was made a maitre d' on the Santa Fe line in time, and my oldest brother, Hector, was a maitre d' on the Cunard line, and I have an autographed copy of the Duke--it's the Duke of--what was he--King Edward, after he (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: The Duke of Wellington?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And he--I have an autograph signed by him and Mrs. what's his name, Wallis?
Speaker 1: Wallis Simpson.
Speaker 2: To my brother, to Hector Ligon and so and so.
Speaker 1: That's Edward the VI, and Wallis--
Speaker 2: Edward Simpson, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The Cunard Line, that's a steamship, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was a big English boatline, Cunard, C-U-N-A-R-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think it's worth a little money, but I didn't ask yet.  (Laughter). I didn't sell it really.  I mean I would keep it as long as I possibly could.  I think on my deathbed I might give it away (laughter) to some of my nieces and nephews, but I--we were at a party a few weeks ago and I mentioned to this lady.  I didn't know she was an antique dealer and when I mentioned it, she flipped. She says oh my God, you should know how much it's worth, blah, blah, blah. And I said I don't know.  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 18446
Speaker 1: Tell me about growing up.  What's your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest memories?
Speaker 1: Memory. That's what--one. For right now.
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you what.  Because of the interest in music and everything in my house, when I was a youngster, we used to do shows and we used to do them here on the streets of Chicago, and you know the houses like--the ones that have the staircases to the first floor?  We used that section for our patrons to sit on and we used the sidewalks to perform. And we had these little gangs that had their own little show business gang, you know, and we'd take the kids who can sing well and dance, and if they had some music, had some training or something like that, we'd put them in. But they had to audition for us in our group. If we didn't like them, we'd send them a couple of blocks down and tell them--because we thought we were the best, which we were.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's not your earliest memory, is it?  Your first memory?
Speaker 2: I was going to say that this was a part of my doing show business. The understanding about show business, but my parents--not mine particularly, but my brothers and sisters and my aunts and uncles would have a show once a month at our house. And we lived at this house on Wabash that I said, and it had the sliding doors between the living room and dining room. So we'd sit the people in the dining room and had--the stage was the living room, and we'd perform and my aunt--I had one aunt who was--did the Mae West sort of stuff. She would sing oh, come on and see me sometime (laughter). And she was just--she'd be beautiful.  My brother sang and one of my uncles in the family sang and we'd do these shows and I think they charged 10 cents to come in.  And that was--and I used to recite a lot of the, Paul Laurence Dunbar's poems, both his English ones and the ones in the dialect and I used to get beat up in school, when I was in school here because I'd do a dialect program and all the black youngsters in the school would be the stew out of me (laughter) when I'd come out. So the next weekend, I had to do one and I used to do shows with my parents, with my brothers and sisters. And that's when I learned how to entertain and sing and do these poems.
Speaker 1: And what I haven't done is--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And I was about five years old.
Story_ID: 18447
Speaker 1: What I haven't done is have you list all your brothers and sisters in order.  Can you list your brothers and sisters in order and give us their names?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My sister, her name was Mary Belle Ligon, and when she was married it was McLendon, M-C-L-E-N-D-O-N.  So she was Mary Belle Ligon McLendon. She was the oldest. And then my brother, first brother was named Hector James Ligon. And the other brother was named Alfred Melvin Ligon. And my sister was the oldest, and the two boys were under her.
Speaker 1: Okay. So this is four of you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There were four of us.  As I said, there were five, but one died when he was a baby, well, he was a little boy.
Speaker 1: And Alfred Ligon was the founder of the Aquarian Book Store in Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: My brother Alfred, yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Famous black book store.
Speaker 2: The famous black book store, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he became quite well known and lots and lots of young artists--Maya Angelou would sign books there and [Alex] Haley did and Itabari Njeri did. And I found Pacy, I just left from Philadelphia.  He had a book and one of his books was first sold there in my brother's book store.
Speaker 1: Who's that, Raymond Pace or--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, P-A-C-Y, yeah, from Philadelphia.  You know who I'm talking about, yeah.
Story_ID: 18448
Speaker 1: Tell me about your neighborhood. What were some of the sites and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In my neighborhood?  Well, I'll tell you one half--I left out something about when I was a youngster, when I was living at the Wabash address, I lived there I think until I was about six or seven. But when I was three, Mrs. Nance, Raymond, Ray Nance's mother, had a nursery school diagonally across from us, and she had--was one of the first nursery schools that took in children you know, for the pastor work, and I think because when what had happened was that she was such a wonderful teacher, and I'm sure that we used to do plays, like Cinderella and Oz, and all those oldies, you know? And we had one time we did a Tom Thumb wedding.  You know what they were--when the kids dressed like grownups and they did this wedding. And Ray Nance was the preacher, I was the bride, and a set of brothers were the groom and the best man.  And they were almost twins. They looked and acted alike. And when we were rehearsing, they would say--he'd say well, do you take this woman to be your bride, and he'd say--one of them would say yes, and the other would say yes.  And they'd try to keep the two of them from doing this, and so it just didn't happen.  They just automatically did it, so they left it in. And after the performance--it was in the winter time, and every--we had little party afterwards, and my sister [Mary Belle Ligon McLendon] happened to look up and she saw me between the two boys, and they had found my coat and put it on me and they were taking me out.  And she says my goodness, what's--they were following their dad and mother out, and the boys said well, she's our bride, ain't she (laughter). They were about six years old and I was only three at the time.  Going to take me home. I was married. (Laughter). And when we grew up, we used to talk about it.  We'd see one another oh, the Spencer kids, they really--grew together, you know.  And--so when I saw--when I'd begin to watch Ray perform with Duke [Ellington] you know, and he'd jump over the people and yell what a salesman he was. He was just wonderful, you know.  I'd said I believe, I'm sure that his mother was one of the people that taught us--the group of kids that I was in--because he's had many since, but the group that I was I was in--I'm sure that that's when we had learned how to act and perform too. Because we did these plays as kids you know? She's wonderful.
Story_ID: 18449
Speaker 1: You really started performing with your family?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And when you were very, very small.
Speaker 2: Very small, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  And then the neighborhood--
Speaker 2: As I said before, these gangs of kids, they're dancing show gangs, that's what we called ourselves show gangs, and we had a model of the city you know at that time, and with competition, you just performed, you know, and if you had good shows on your sidewalk and knew the people, you said--I don't know if we called ourselves something, I don't remember. But--and they were going to do a show Saturday afternoon, and they had got in our neighborhood--people from different neighborhoods would come because they like what we--we were good. We had a good show.  They had trombone, the ones that used to beat the drums on the big tin can--big washtub, for like the bass player and all the paper on the cones were--and the kazoos, you know, they used to have and that was our music.
Speaker 1: You say a lot of the homemade instruments.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You said your father [Hector Ligon] played the saw--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How did he play a saw, for those who are listening or viewing.
Speaker 2: They're pretty good. They have a real nice sound.  It's odd.  It's a kind of boo sound--buzz.  But if they make notes--you could make notes on it.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did you have to bend it or something?
Speaker 2: You'd have to--you know--do like this when you were playing.  You could play with a bow, like a--with a bow for a big fiddle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Bass pedal, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so you had a pretty good--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: You had a decent band.  You said someone in the family played the piano too, right?
Speaker 2: My brother.
Speaker 1: Your brother?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My oldest brother [Hector James Ligon].  He was a comedian.  He played the same, kind of [Thomas] Fats Waller, like these, yeah.  He was a natural.
Speaker 1: Now did you all have a--rent parties and those kind of events?
Speaker 2: Well it was--I guess you could call it a rent party.  I mean it was not--we didn't sell liquor or anything like that, but we just had an admission to come it, and it was all entertainment. We were singing, we were dancing. You know, that sort of thing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Prohibition was going on then, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, when you were little.
Speaker 2: In the '30s [1930s], yeah.
Speaker 1: So nobody could--they couldn't sell liquor and--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No, un-un.  Lots of people did (laughter).  And a couple of songs that Fats has done where he's playing a--playing one of them and everybody comes and he says don't tell them your name (laughter). The cops comes in on him and he says don't tell them your name (laughter).  And these rings out through the playing of the piano, you know.  It's wonderful.  He was wonderful, really (laughter).
Story_ID: 18450
Speaker 1: Who were some of the kids in the neighborhood that you knew in those days that--I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well I think Ray Nance. We grew up together, yeah. We were together. Another thing that used to happen when I was preteen and into my teens, most of the kids that--I can't remember anybody's name other than Ray's at the moment, that was in the nursery school when I was in the nursery school, but we all stuck together. We all grew up together, and one of the other parents of these kids used to have--on Friday nights, she'd had a double parlor like--they used to have the back parlor they would call it and a front parlor in these big houses, you see, and she would throw parties for us and we would dance to records. And that was when jitterbugging came in and all that sort of business and the Charleston and all those dances. And this other lady, I can't remember what her name is, but she was the mother of some of the kids that I've known since kindergarten in the nursery school. And we had these wonderful things on Fridays and you could only stay until 11 and get home by 11:30 because we all lived in the same neighborhood.

Speaker 1: Now you went to [James R.] Doolittle [Primary] School.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started--I went to Doolittle first at 30th--between Michigan and the next street over going east.  I can't remember what it was. Anyway--Wabash, I think it was.  Yes.  No, no.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Indiana, I guess.  Indiana, yeah.
Speaker 2: Indiana.  Yeah, that's right. And my grandmother [Jennie Davenport Bell] said--she said, "Do little?" and I was coming home and I wasn't doing--and she'd ask me questions about what I did and blah blah blah, and she said yes, they do little there (laughter). So we moved and that's when my career as a grammar school student was all through because of the migration of us during that period, you know.  I went from there to [John] Farren School which was at 47th and Calumet, or 48th or something, and then I went to the one on Michigan--oh God, I can't think of it. And 53rd across Washington Park. And then I graduated from A. L. Sexton [School] at 60th across--and I'm not sure what street that is.
Speaker 1: Right.  Langley I think.
Speaker 2: Champlain or something.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Langley or something like that.
Speaker 2: Right.  And the reason why is because unfortunately, during that time, the schools, the blacks were moving south and the schools would change and there were a lot of really prejudiced teachers and they didn't do well you know--didn't treat the kids too well and it was--and so you moved out of the neighborhood because you became--the black kids weren't being taught as well as they should have been. And that's why my folks--my sister [Mary Belle Ligon McLendon] and my folks kept moving, because every time a change--because at that time, we had 48 kids in classes, six rows with eight kids each. And sometimes I would be the only black youngster or maybe there'd be three or four of us in our classes and this happened because my parents wanted me to get a good education and I did get one. Later on, it's heard--having this good education showed me very, very well what I wanted on the contract at the studio. So it was good I--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved school.  Yeah.  I was--I learned to read when I was very young I understand, and I used to read constantly. I never was without a book.  In fact, when I was about nine or ten, I used to listen to Cab Calloway or Duke Ellington coming out of the main Cotton Club up on Harlem, and I'd do my homework to them, listening to them.  No one would be thinking that I'd meet either one of them and would be a part of their lives at all. And I used to listen to their music and do my homework. And like on the weekend, we usually had for dinner either roast beef or something good and always a cake.  You know, that--the one that's--pancake. What's it called?
Speaker 1: Pound cake?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Pound cake?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I had pound cake and a piece of the meat and a banana, and I sat and did my homework and listened to the band.  Yeah.  (Laugher).
Speaker 1: Okay. What was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: In school?  Math and history. Loved history and math, yeah.
Story_ID: 18452
Speaker 1: When you moved, every time you moved, did you find a group of youngsters to perform with?
Speaker 2: Oh no, I stopped it.  I wasn't doing it then, no. I was just dancing. I was learning to dance by myself then.  So I didn't bother.  What I--I actually made up my mind to be in theater when I was eleven.  I was ill, and I had what they used to call eczema, and it was here on my arms and under my legs. And a friend of my sister's had--was married to a young man who was a chauffeur for a wealthy family up here in Evanston. And they went south every year--I mean in the winter, I'm trying to say, and she was from Savannah, Georgia. And so my doctors told my mom that I should go and lie in the sun as much as possible. So she offered--she was going down and she offered to take me, and she took me--we drove down to Savannah, and I stayed with her oldest sister, with her two younger sisters who were in school in Savannah, Georgia, in a Catholic school. And I laid out in the sun and sure enough, I'd say about a month, and the skin began to heal. And the kids there--the East Side kids and the West Side kids. And they used to have--at the end of the semester, they had had this--they were all interested in show business. And they had this contest for the East--the East Side and West Side kids and I was living on the West--and when they found out I could dance, I had met kids on both sides, and they said we want you to dance for us.  Well, I was living on the West Side and I decided to represent them. I won the contest, and later--I had been dancing but I had never could believe I could do that well, so when that happened, I came back to Chicago and started ditching school (laughter), going to the Oriental Theater where they had all those wonderful--like Cab [Calloway] would come or Fletcher Henderson and Duke [Ellington] and all those, and they always had the dances, and that's how I really learned. I watched the dancers and I'd see the movie, watch the dancers, go over and practice what I saw, come back and see the next show to see if it had--I was doing the step correctly.  And usually I would sort of change them because I didn't want to make--show that I was copying point blank.  Just exactly what they were doing.  And I had to be home at 6:00. And I caught the State and Lake--it was right there.  Just go around the corner and catch the el train and I lived on 59th--59th--no 5815 at the Englewood station, going west--going east--going west yeah, at State Street. And that's where I lived and I could get out there. I'd get out there by 6:00 and get my foot in the door so I didn't get a spanking (laughter).
Story_ID: 18453
Speaker 1: One of my brothers Alfred [Melvin Ligon], that we were just talking about was married at the time, and he was married to a  young lady who was passing--you know what that means--she was passing for white.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And she worked in the restaurant down here someplace in one of the big restaurants downtown somewhere, and when she'd come home--she worked at night, and when she'd come home early in the morning, she'd take all of her money, her tips, and put them on the dresser. They had their own room. We moved in one of the apartments that had been moved out, you know.  And we had this servant's room in the back and we had three bedrooms to ourselves in the front.  So we--they were a young married couple, so they had the back room, a bath and all that sort of business.  And she'd take the money out of her pocket and count it, and lay it on the counter. And she had a tendency to talk in her sleep (laughter).  My girlfriend and I would go in in the morning--her name was Mildred and I'd say Mildred, and she'd say, "Uh-huh"--and I'd say do you love Alfred? And she'd say "Huhhhh." And of course we would just fall out laughing because we had no idea what marriage was about, you know what I mean (laughter). We'd stand there and snicker and put our hands over our mouth you know, and I'd say Mildred, and she'd say huh, and I'd say can I have a quarter, and she'd say um-hum. And I'd take the quarter, and I'd say can I have two, and she said um-hum. And I'd take these quarters and I had--it was about five or six of us that ran together. So we all had a nickel apiece you'd see, to spend for candy and pop or whatever. We never did use it but--and I never told her about it. Oh, and when I came home from school, when she's up about 3:00 in the afternoon, 3:30 you know. And she said--she'd be in the kitchen talking to Nana and my sister [Mary Belle Ligon McLendon] sometimes and she'd say you know I thought I had 10 dollars and 40 cents last night when I went to bed. She said oh, I guess I was too sleepy to count it right.  But she (laughter) in taking this money (laughter). And I didn't tell her about it until I was grown up and she was living in New York and I came to see her and I told her and she says you naughty little girl (laughter).  You know that you're a naughty little girl.  And she said, I should bat you now. That is wonderful. She hugged and kissed me and I told her--because I was the one that had been married then and I told her you was crazy about Alfred. She--uh-huh (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's something. Did they stay married a long time?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No they didn't.
Speaker 1: Unfortunately.  Didn't have any kids either unfortunately. He married again and he's got--my grandnieces--I have grandnieces and grandnephews by his second marriage, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, and--out in California.
Speaker 1: And Alfred--that's Alfred. But Hector [James Ligon] didn't have any children.  He and his wife.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she did the same thing. She was passing.
Speaker 2: Did Hector live here in Chicago?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And then he moved to New York and he came back here and they lived out on Lake Shore Drive during the late '70s [1970s], early '70s, and he died here.  So did she.
Story_ID: 18454
Speaker 1: When you were going to the movies and practicing the dance steps.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At the movies.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: That was what, 1928, 29?
Speaker 2: Actually.  1930, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And when you--from what I read, when you were twelve years old, you got a big break with Count Basie's band.
Speaker 2: No, I was a year older than that.
Speaker 1: A year older?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  What happened is Sammy Dyer, who was the dance teacher here, you know, and he was asked to put together a chorus line for the Count Basie show--band I should say.  Count Basie's band who was coming because John Hammond was presenting him and he was taking him to New York and they wanted to make a tryout here before they went to New York. And so they were going and [Barney and Abe] Balaban and [Morris] Katz were the owners of all the Uptown--the West Side Tivoli [Theater] and they built another one. The Regal [Theater] for the blacks you know at the time. So what happened was that they had this show put together with Count Basie's band and I had heard them and people had told me who--the other dancers that I had met had told me about Josephine Baker. And she worked in the--and shuffled along. She used to dance on the left side on the second line--on your right if you're sitting on the stage. If you're sitting in the audience. And she would clown a bit. She was dancing the dances that the girls did, but then she didn't--what we called mugging and doing eyes and carrying on you know. And so I could do it. I had learned to do it. So they let me do it in the Count Basie band. And so it led to other things, and that's how I really got started. But my first--that was my first really professional job. I had been dancing here. They used to have it here, you know.  Shows at Christmastime and shows at Halloween and all that business. And the theater--one of the neighborhood theaters. And we used to have wonderful amateur contests. Every Friday night, there was an amateur contest. And I used to dance at the Willard Theater down here on 49th, off of Michigan. I'm sure it's gone now, but anyway, that was where I was living--on 53rd and Vincennes. That's where, yeah, Vincennes, I think it's Prairie. Anyway, I'd go there and every time I won, so they banned me from coming because they thought it was a put-up job (laughter) and I used to go to these other theaters and win also. And so what happened was that when I heard about the Basie's having--yeah, the Basie's big go-around and they said they wanted chorus girls, I went.  And I was selected. And so I did--they let me do the nonsense I'm talking about like she did. And then I went from there to the Whitman sisters and that's when I really got trained by the Whitmans, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, back up a little bit.  What did your act consist of? What kind of routines did you do?
Speaker 2: Well I--see well I used to copy the boys so much that I danced more or less like the boys in a sense and I went one time to do a show for Christmas, and my brother Alfred [Melvin Ligon] was an emcee and a vocalist, and he was going to be an emcee on this show and I think it was down on 47th Street someplace, at a Christmas show. And they were going to have eight girls and I went down and we all danced and they liked us and the producer told us to go in the back and try on the costumes that he had for this--for they--they were to wear. We were to wear. And at that time, I hadn't developed at all. I hadn't any boobies or bum bums, or (laughter).  I still had my little boy's figure and oh, when we came back on the stage and that the costumes fit the other girls and they posed and did their hips and did their shoulders and my costume was hanging all off of me and he said--the producer said my heavens, what am I going to do with you? And I've always been a blabbermouth as you can see (laughter), yeah, I said well I don't dance in dresses and things like this.  I dance in pants.  And he says can you sing?  And I said sure I can sing. He said then you don't have to dance in the line.  He says you can be the soubrette.  And I didn't--was lying. I didn't (laughter) but my cousin was going to get a brand new suit for Christmas. And so he had this old black one and my mom [Harriet Bell Ligon] asked her sister if she would let me have his pants. And my sister had a friend who was a seamstress and my brothers were waiters at the time.  They had the little white jackets. They cut down one of their jackets, fitted me. I had a black tie, a black cummerbund and my cousin's shoes and my dancing shoes and I started dancing by myself in front of that line. And that's how I started.
Story_ID: 18455
Speaker 1: Then I went to the Whitman sisters [Alice and Mabel Whitman] and was accepted there. And--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Now who were the Whitman sisters?
Speaker 1: The Whitman sisters?
Speaker 2: A lot of people don't know who they are now.
Speaker 1: Oh golly, I have a book out. It's called 'The Royalty of Negro Vaudeville.'  About the Whitman sisters. And the lady that wrote it is called Nadine George Graves. And it is a gem, please believe me. If you want to know about any--in the very beginning of the book, she wrote--the Whitmans would take in kids, you know and teach them and they had taken Bill [Bojangles] Robinson when he was twelve years old and he stayed with him for a long, long time.  And in the book it states that they were the people who groomed Bill Robinson, Jeni LeGon, Pops and Louie, Ethel Waters, Count Basie and Mary Lou Williams. And in this book, there are about a hundred people who passed through the Whitman sisters' hands. And they had a regular show that had been out every year in March and traveled to the south and came sometimes as far as California, but most of the time, they just went to St. Louis and maybe Denver, that far west, and they traveled this whole circuit. And do you know that during that period in the late '30s [1930s]--late '20s [1920s] and '30s, there were 500 all-black theaters down South, and the TOBA [Theater Owners Booking Association], you've heard about them, haven't you--there was a booking agent called TOBA.
Speaker 2: I've been told--right, yes. Right.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and it had a naughty name--naughty word in there.  It was "Tough On [Black Asses]" (laughter). But they were wonderful and they were their own bookers and they passed what at one time because they were very fair. They're from Atlanta, Georgia. Their father was a pastor, and they sang gospel tunes in the church first and then they went on the stage and sang for many--they developed their own, they--and Alice Whitman of the Whitman sisters was considered at that time the best tap dancer of us all.  And there's an article in the Smithsonian--from a Smithsonian paper that lists Alice in there, Ann Miller, Ruby Keeler, me, and I think that's all. I've got that among my stuff too. That's right. But she was just wonderful--and Pops was her son. And he was a baby tapper when he was a little baby boy, and when he went to Louie, when the team became Pops and Louie was the year that I was with them, and we picked Louie up in New Orleans, Louisiana. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Wow.  So you began with the Whitman sisters.  Now you were in Englewood High School [Chicago] for awhile.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I stopped.
Speaker 2: You just--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Then I had a--you see, before I went to Savannah, I thought I was going to be a gym teacher, because I was in all the sports.  I did baseball, everything but hockey.  I couldn't get on the legs with hockey (laughter) and dropped it that second and went on the field again.  But other things I was pretty good--I used to be the in runner for the 400.  I did the 100 by myself.  I did the--other things too. And the 50 yard dash was my favorite. I always ran on that one. So I wanted to be a gym teacher. And then when I went South and I told you I won this contest, and I started going to theaters, going to the theaters and watching the dancers, then I was convinced that no, I wanted to be on the stage, you see. And so--the developing me came from these people that I had a chance to dance with because they accepted me and they thought I was very good you know. And they thought I was willing to learn.  And I used to stand in the--on the sides and back stage and watch Alice because she was just a dreamboat and I'm telling you, she was woo--and I don't think that her stuff was--at that time we didn't have anything other than the movies, you know, to make copies of stuff.  But she was considered the best woman tap dancer in our time, right.
Speaker 2: You said they never made a movie of her that you knew, right?
Speaker 1: Pardon?
Speaker 2: They never made a movie of her that you knew, right?
Speaker 1: I'm saying I don't think so. Because her house burned down about six years ago and they lived out here on 48th--48th between Martin Luther [King Drive] and whatever the next street is going east.  And we had a permanent--in the, when the Regal was built, that building, that whole section of theater and all that, they had a permanent rehearsal hall that they kept there and you--all year around, it was their business office and everything. Because they did their own booking and everything.
Speaker 2: It was like 48th and Vernon?
Speaker 1: Pardon?
Speaker 2: Would that be 48th and Vernon?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Calumet?
Speaker 1: Oh--yeah.
Speaker 2: I think that was a street over (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: South part and then east which is.
Speaker 2: I'm truing to think of which one that is.
Speaker 1: Calumet?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: No. Vernon, I think.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Vernon.  Yeah. And then the water.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That's where they lived.  In the house. And I guess all those wonderful treasures. And I brought something with me in my pictures of--there was a wonderful--they had a midget, her name was Princess Wee Wee and she was--she used to dance with--Willie Bryant's band, and she used to dance with Willie Bryant in the sister--in these Whitman sisters' shows. And he's very tall, and she's only three feet tall. And she used to--they were doing jitterbugging at the time and she'd jitter when him and he would put her through his legs and all that sort of business. And she would--they had--the Whitmans took her many, many years ago when she was young because somebody discarded her.  And that's what they did. And in this book, you buy this book and you read about all these wonderful children, Butterbean and Susie and all those wonderful--the 'Door Richard' guy, 'Open the Door, Richard'--they were so popular--all those young people you see in the book. There was about six pages. There are at least thirty names of all the people that the Whitman sisters had a chance to--had amongst their times and teached them how to perform.  And you just say oh gosh, no.  I don't believe it so much--and most of them I have seen in my lifetime. All these wonderful performers, you know.
Speaker 2: Now how did your sister [Mary Belle Ligon McLendon] and mother [Harriet Bell Ligon] feel about you going on the road with the Whitman sisters?
Speaker 1: They liked it.  They though it was good because I had made up my mind then that I was going to dance, and they didn't object. But my grandmother [Jennie Davenport Bell] did. She said that people in show business were hussies and pimps and all that sort of business (laughter). But when I went with the Whitman sisters, they paid us $12.50 a week and we had to go and have a conference--you had to take your mother with them to--for her to tell you of the distance and she kept and--you didn't ride with the boys in the band, and you didn't sleep with the boys in the band (laughter) and none of these things were--and if you did any of these things, you were put out of the show. You had to go home.  And they--she told their mothers--they all met and she had this conference and talked to them about what she allowed the girls to do, and she said and I will send you, your moms, all of the mothers $5.00 a week out of the girls' salary, they'd give them $7.50 per week to play around with. And when my grandmother heard this, she decided that she'd better change her mind (laughter).  So she let me go with them, but she was against it at first and my mother and sister did not object, yeah.
Speaker 2: Those are the days when $5.00 was $5.00.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, it really went a long way.  It was at the Depression time, so you know, they could use it. Even five bucks. Because we all lived together to make ends meet and two or three were working so for the rest of us, we had to pay rent and all these kind of things, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, what was life like on the road?  Again from Chicago, yeah--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: With the Whitmans?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: It was wonderful.  Only thing about it was that we had lived here and we hadn't been too much--there were certain places that we couldn't go, and we never saw these signs that they had down there about you know, you can't come in and white--but all that stuff. And that was shocking to us because none of us had seen that.  And--and of course, the Whitmans had rooming houses and private places where they boarded us, boarded all the cast, and there was at least twenty in there or twenty-five people in our shows, yeah. We had an eight-piece band, and there were eight dancers, that's sixteen, a kid comedian, and a skate man, sixteen--or eighteen, three kid dancers, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, Alice--twenty-two, twenty-three.  About twenty-five people all total. Not counting the couple that Alice who was the boss and her husband who was the money person and--oh, and the other sister was a costume maker. So yeah, I'd say about twenty-five casts. And they had their own bus you see.  Yeah.  It was wonderful. Just grand. Because we were all--teenagers, you know, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen year olds and to be out from under our parentage (laughter), the dos and don'ts, it was just wonderful. So I had a grand time.
Story_ID: 18456
Speaker 1: So you were with them [the Whitman Sisters, Mabel and Alice] about a year, right?
Speaker 2: About a year.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And what happened? Why did you stop traveling with the Whitmans?
Speaker 2: Oh I had--well they were there through the season. They didn't do anything I think after they came back to Chicago, I think we did a show either at the Regal [Theater] or the theater across the street from us which I think it was called the Washington. It was a movie house. And one time, she had made arrangements for the Regal and to play and--then she started to go in, he wanted to change his offer that he had made, the money. So she told him to forget it and she went across the street to the Washington, built a stage and did the show there (laughter). She was something, Sister Mae. She was wonderful, just grand.  Yeah. And she looked like--it looked like she was Jewish. And so she could buffalo everybody in the--they didn't know what she was, you see (laughter).  So she could do it. The minute she would do her blackie stuff if she wanted to and then she could be very much a lady of culture and a white lady of culture, you know what I mean? So she had--as they say, an ace in the hole. She was wonderful. Really.
Speaker 1: So it was Mae and Alice?
Speaker 2: There was--Sister Mae was the oldest one, and then Sister Mae, Sister--(unclear). Anyway, Alberta is the third one, and Alice was the baby. She's the tap dancer.  And then Alice and Alberta--she'd use the name Bert because she used to wear pants and stuff and just--the two of them danced together. And they danced separately. And--it starts with an E. She would--they all sang when they first started out, but she went into the costume making business, the second sister. But Sister Mae is the business woman and she was a costumer and Bert was part of the--putting things together and Alice was mainly for the dancers and she trained the chorus and all that stuff when you came with her she'd--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she had this wonderful son who started dancing when he was about three. His father was a dancer. His name was Aaron Palmer and he made--he was taken on the shows as a kid. And when he grew up, him and Alice married.  They didn't stay together too long. She kept the boy and he was Whitman instead of his last name which was Palmer. And--yeah. Pops.  And his name was Aaron, I think was Aaron Jr., but they called him Pops because he was such a little--little man. So they called him Pops, you see. And he used to dance and he's wearing these wonderful suits and everything. And he was the star of our show, next to her and--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just wonderful. We--three--I got three of my girlfriends on the show and we had been dancing together a lot down there. So when we got on, the snake hips were at the height of popularity at the time, and the three of us did the snake hips.  And we used to shock the ship quite often because our costumes were so cute, and we were such young cute little girls, and we had--when we were doing the snake hips, we had to turn our backs to the audience.  And we had these big--like big Cuban blouses, you know, the big sleeve things, and shake it. We had fringe on the back of us and we'd shake and of course everybody would of course scream (laughter).  So we had a great time. And in this book that I'm telling you about, she mentions it to me and she mentions me three times. And she mentions that I danced with Alice in the snake hips and I finally talked to her and I told her she's wrong.  Because nobody danced with Alice. Alice was a soloist and she was single. She never danced with--and Louis Armstrong's wife was with them at one time, and she danced with them, but we were not on at the same time.  His wife was one of the chorines at one time, yeah. Before she went into the Cotton Club, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you left--why did you leave the Whitman sisters?
Speaker 2: What happened was when we finished our tour, there was work around. As I said, I think we did a show here and then that was the end of the season. And since they wouldn't be doing anything until next March--so we all had to do stuff.
Story_ID: 18457
Speaker 1: And I had a foster sister whose name was Willa Mae Lane, and she and I put together a sister--what they called a sister act.  And we'd do an opening together. I was dancing in the pants and she danced wearing a dress and I would--we'd do an opening together where the two would be on stage together. Then she'd leave--then I'd leave and she'd do her own solo stuff and then I--she would leave and I'd do my own solo stuff. And then we'd come and close together. And we had a chance to go to Detroit and work in the theater there that Leonard Reed--I don't know if you've ever heard of him, but anyway, he's one of the Whitman sisters' protégés.  And he also did stuff at the Cotton Club.  And he--and Willie Bryant used to work together with the Whitman sisters [Alice and Mabel]. And so he had--all the theaters as I said at that time had vaudeville shows, you know. So we went up there and we had a job there, and we got a call. And we were living in a hotel where we worked downstairs and then we separated. We did our own acts. We weren't sisters anymore. We did our separate acts. And I was in emcee for downstairs in the hotel. And so one day we got a phone call from Chicago. I don't remember--one of our friends called and said look, we're just going to go to Los Angeles, to Hollywood. And the producer of the show has heard about you guys. They would like you to join us. And we said oh, I don't know because we had two jobs, you see. We were regular--about twenty-five or thirty dollars a week and that was good at that time because we were getting $12.50 for one and probably the same thing for the other you see. So we just said oh, I don't know. And so we got another phone call. We didn't answer right away. So we got--anyway, they bugged us to come. So we decided to go. We came back here, and this man had a bus and he took eighteen of us, including 'Some of These Days'--what was his name?
Speaker 2: Shelton Brooks.
Speaker 1: Shelton Brooks who wrote 'Some of These Days.'  And three dancing boys called the High Hatters.  A comedian, and a straight man, a lady vocalist, I can't remember her name at the moment and my sister [Willa Mae Lane] and I came out to Hollywood.  Out to Los Angeles. And we were supposed--he told us that he had a job for us and we were going to be booked into--the was a Cotton Club in Hollywood--in Culver City called [Frank] Sebastian's Cotton Club. And it was in this little city of Culver City, which was in the little center of ballet (laughter). And when we got there, the job had been done for years by a pianist, an orchestra leader named Les Hite, H-I-T-E. Lionel Hampton was a part of that band at that time. And so we were stranded.  All of us.  And fortunately at that time, there was lots of open coat cafes and clubs and things, and especially there in Los Angeles. A whole street called Central Avenue was full of clubs. And we heard about a man named Earl Dancer who was having an audition to present a show--put a show together to play at the Fox Studio for the head of Fox whose name is William [sic, Winfield] Sheehan, and for Will Rogers.  And both of us went--we did our thing together, but he said that he liked us separately. He thought he'd like us--and it turned out that Earl Dancer had been Ethel Waters' promoter and manager. And so when we went to this--and he had a band and a chorus groups and he had the three boy dancers that we went out with, and my sister, and myself, and we presented this show at--on the Fox lot at the Café de Paris, which was their café and they had a private big private room where all the big shots were. And they liked, Mr. Sheehan who was then president and this was during the time when 20th Century under [Darryl F.] Zanuck and Fox were negotiating to merge. So what happened was that Mr. Sheehan gave Earl a tentative contract for me to dance--they had just signed Bill Bojangles [Robinson] to dance for Shirley [Temple] and they gave him a tentative contract that when I finished the thing--oh. And the results were that when this happened at the show out there, and we did the show there and also did our show at the Wilshire Ebell Theater which in those days on Sundays, if you--all the talent scouts could show off their talent that they had in their offices.  And we did this show, and the people from RKO [Radio-Keith-Orpheum Studios] who have just signed Fats [Waller] and Bill to do this 'Hooray for Love' saw me, and I was added to that cast. And so Mr. Sheehan gave Earl a tentative contract for this--after this contract went out, that he would take me over. The day that they merged, it became Zanuck, Darryl Zanuck, 20th Century Fox. And Mr. Sheehan was no longer president of his part of the company which had became a merge company. So Mr. Zanuck was the top dog then. And Earl had been smart enough to be going to MGM [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios] and talking to them about me. And they put me under contract that same day that he lost it from Mr. Sheehan. He was there by 2:00 at MGM and signed my first long term contract, which I've got things about it. And that's how I really got started in the movies, under his thing--under his leadership.  I should say management--under his management.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So it's Earl Dancer.
Speaker 1: Pardon?
Speaker 2: Earl Dancer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Earl Dancer.  He'd been Ethel Waters' manager.  He brought her to the fore. In fact, he discovered her as a dancer and heard her sing and told her don't dance, sing.  And she didn't want to, because she was a darn good dancer. And so he convinced her that that was what she should be.  If she was going to stay in show business, that she should be a singer and you know what happened to her. She became a big, big star.
Speaker 2: A singer and an actress.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Actress too.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  She did that all.  Yeah.  Now, she was my favorite. Really.
Speaker 2: And did he have a story about how they broke up (laughter)?
Speaker 1: They just--parting of the ways.  I think she--I think she--what happened was that he took her as far as he could take her and I think she got some offers for some--on the other side from somebody who had more clout than he did.  And he was back in New York and he had done some shows with her on Broadway at the time. So when he came back to Los Angeles where he was from originally, he got into the studios and he used to supply black talent for all the studios. And that's how he knew--Mr. Sheehan was a friend of his and this person that--at MGM or somebody that he knew and at MGM--at Fox, he had a spot in the office of Mr. Sheehan and she had called him and told him that the merger had gone through and that that was going to be the talk. And that's how he was able to get down to MGM and go through and sign the contract for me at MGM.
Speaker 2: Now, the first movie you did was 'Hooray for Love' (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: 'Hooray for Love.'  Yeah at RKO.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we were in a time--it was a time that--
Speaker 2: And so this is--I'm sorry. Let me just--so this is not an MGM movie.
Speaker 1: No, no, no.
Speaker 2: The first movie was not MGM.
Speaker 1: No. It was, it was RKO.
Speaker 2: So did you do that movie before you got the contract with MGM?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. All right.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And at the time, we had dressing rooms and all of us--Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers--we were all in the same building, and they had their own private rehearsal hall. And we had our own rehearsal hall ourselves. And Bill knew Astaire from New York and we used to stop by and watch them and they talked dance talk, traded steps and did things together. And they'd come and watch us rehearse and like that.
Speaker 2: Now was--now who all was in the movie? Was Fred Astaire in 'Hooray for Love'?
Speaker 1: No.  No, no, no.
Speaker 2: I didn't think so.
Speaker 1: It was Ann Sothern.
Speaker 2: Ann Sothern.
Speaker 1: And Gene Raymond who were the stars, and a whole bunch of other people who sat and worked, you know, how do you call it--supporting roles. But they were the stars of this.  They were the lovers and all that sort of business in this story. And then I got the contract for MGM.
Story_ID: 18458
Speaker 1: There was a wonderful big show on Broadway called 'At Home Abroad.' And Ethel Waters, [Beatrice] Bea Lillie, and Eleanor Powell were stars in it.  It was playing on Broadway. And MGM [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios], after I was signed with this contract at MGM, the MGM Studios hosted a big banquet for all the major mayors of the cities here in this country--in America, and they had been--had been flirting with Eleanor to sign. And the night they signed--the night--and all the people--which I have a program, I'll show you who's really in it--we were all signed to do the picture called 'Broadway Melody' which was repeated after that from '36 [1936] to whenever they stopped.
Speaker 2: It was the first in Broadway from 1936.
Speaker 1: The first Broadway Melody was done in 1936. And all the contractees at the studio got to do it. Like Buddy Ebsen and his sister, Vilma.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a dancer in some kind of way.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Everybody knows him as Jed Clampett.
Speaker 1: He was a tap dancer and he did what we called eccentric. And he and his sister danced together. Okay, so what happened was they signed--they did not sign Eleanor to be in the show. She's going to be the star of the show.
Speaker 2: Eleanor Powell?
Speaker 1: Eleanor Powell. And so they had her come from New York to appear at this big function that they had given for these mayors. And I had the horrible tactic of stopping darn shows and I went on before her and stopped the show and she couldn't get on until--they let her on. Because they kept applauding and I'm bowing, bowing, bowing.  So the next day, they called Earl [Dancer] down, Mr. [Winfield] Sheehan and Mr. [Rufus] LeMaire who was the casting director at the time, and told him that unfortunately they could not use--they didn't see themselves using two tappers.  And me with my brown face was let out. But they said we've got something for you.  We're bound to your contract, but we've got C.B. Cochran from London who was the big producer like [Florenz] Ziegfeld was at the time, had brought the rights to 'At Home Abroad'.  And he had seen my work and heard about my work. So he made me a part of--I did Ethel Waters' number and also Eleanor Powell's numbers, and that was the first time I went abroad, because they sent me there in a sense. MGM let me out of my contract, but they had something for me to do. So I went over there. But the reason why is because I had stopped the show from Eleanor and before Eleanor came on. So they said we couldn't use two tappers.  Yeah.  Me and my brown face were let out. But I went to London--a big success over there and everything. Yeah. So that's how it happened.
Speaker 2: So what year was this now when you went to London?
Speaker 1: 1936.
Speaker 2: 1936? Same--okay.
Speaker 1: I signed the contract on July 5, 1935 for me to be on the show. And I was there from July to October of 1936. Because I was under age. I was only 17 at the time, and I had to do--I had to go to school. And we had--they had a school on the lot, a one-room school, you know.  And different ages.  Freddie Bartholomew was under contract at that time, and Judy Garland signed right after I got mine and during that period, Mickey Rooney was there and I have some pictures who--all the people who were to be in the first 'Broadway Melody.' George, what's his name.  I got out of it. I don't need to fiddle around with it.
Speaker 2: George Raft?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Not George Raft?
Speaker 1: Pardon?
Speaker 2: Not George Raft?
Speaker 1: No, no, no. The other George something [George Murphy]. I got the thing that has his name on it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I went to London and I did the show over there.  I did two movies. I did one called 'This Will Make You Whistle' and one called 'Dishonor Bright.' I did two movies in London.  I played a café over there also. And there was war rumors then, so we had to come home.
Speaker 2: Okay. This was 1937.
Speaker 1: I would have stayed.
Speaker 2: Was this '37?
Speaker 1: 1936.  Yeah, we came home the latter part. We came home in 1937. Because we were there to--the show ran a year. I think we came the last of '37 or the first of '38, one or the other.
Story_ID: 18459
Speaker 1: What happened when you got back [from performing in London, England]?  Did you come back to Los Angeles or to Chicago?
Speaker 2: I came back and did a movie.
Speaker 1: So you went back to Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, we came back. I stayed in New York for awhile, and then I came home and I did Fools for Scandal and I did 'Ali Baba Goes to Town.'
Speaker 1: Now what is that about? 'Ali Baba Goes to Town'?
Speaker 2: With Eddie Cantor, the comedian you know, black-face comedian.  And--I've got it on tape and you can buy it in the movies now. It's a long movie, and it was a very wonderful show. We did something special.  The shoes that I danced in that show are in the Smithsonian now. They've been inducted into the Smithsonian.  Yeah. And I did movies and I traveled because I--after I did 'Hooray for Love,' and it was very popular, and so I came back east and did the Apollo [Theater] and the Howard [Theater] down--with Fats Waller.
Speaker 1: In D.C.?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: The Howard Theater in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Washington, D.C. And then went back home and did a couple of movies. I made twenty-four movies all total.  And I did four all-black ones, from--black season was about in the late '70s [1970s], early '70s, something like that.  I did 'Hi De Ho', with Cab Calloway, and called Minnie the Moocher. In 'Ali Baba Goes to Town,' the song that we did was called 'Swing is Here to Sway,' and there was a whole bunch of boy singers on it and myself, and three young girls named the Peters sisters, really fat girls who were very wonderful vocalists, and Eddie Cantor. And one part of the thing, the words to the song, and Eddie sings it.  He says "There's going to be a Harlem, there's going to be a hi-de-ho day, up, something, praise day with Minnie the Moocher kicking the gong around," and I come down the steps. And he introduces me and I dance.  I do my own dancing, yeah. And this first time that I had wore a dress because I was doing--so I don't do exactly the things that I did as a dancer when I wore the pants because I had to change my (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: You were like acrobatic, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm saying. I had to change my routine. But I made a good--and it's a good routine. I did toe spins and all that sort of business in my tap shoes.
Speaker 1: Now what were some of the things you were doing?  You were the--I think (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: That I danced in pants?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well I did little steps like this that the Nicholas Brothers [Fayard and Harold] and the various did.  I did spins and drop on my knees and push-ups and things called over-the-tops and I did little kicks which was one of the steps that you hit on your hands and make your feet go over your back and you end up on them like this, you know.
Speaker 1: You kick up on your feet?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. And I also did lots of spins and knee--what they called the boy's splits, not doing the girl splits because you had both legs out, but your head--whichever way you did, like if you were a lefty, you put your left foot down. But I--most of us are right foot dancers so we put our right foot down. You put your leg back like this, and you break the fall sometimes with your hands, which the Nicholas's never do.  They did--they hit it and come right up. And so I learned how to do that. And then this wonderful step that Fayard does when he looks like he's going to do what we call the Chinese splits--he opens his legs real fast and slides forward.  I did those too.  Mostly all the boy steps.  I tapped too. I mean I had real good footwork, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's something.
Speaker 2: And as I said, I made twenty-four. See, I had--I made--in 'Fools for Scandal' I danced, and my best part was taken out because the leading lady didn't like it. I sang a song there, and I did a show with--what's the funny guy's name?  Gertrude Niesen and--oh, a big comedy star. Anyway the same thing happened there.  I did the show--I danced in a parlor car on the train. And they took it out because she didn't like it.  She didn't--yeah. So I had my dancing in 'Double Deal.'  I had my dancing in 'Fools for Scandal,' and not dancing. There is a dance part in there and I'm still trying to find it.  Because I've seen it.
Speaker 1: And so they cut it out of the movie but it was--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, they cut it out. And I did--I didn't sing or dance either in 'Hi De Ho,' I just did an actress part.  But in 'Double Deal' they danced.  And--what else. I think that's the list of the ones that I danced.  The rest of the stuff I've done was acting.  I did 'Sundown.' I did one called 'Sundown,' I did one called 'Arabian Nights' with Sabu.
Speaker 1: Sabu? Yeah, he used to be--.
Speaker 2: --the Jungle Boy, you know.  I had a straight acting part.  I tell people when I do my speeches, when I do things for my show, I say that I've been an actress in all the black cultures because I've been an East Indian, West Indian, Arabian, (laughter) American. It's there for them to see.
Speaker 1: I know what people did that.  I think--I remember Juanita Moore.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: She was in 'Flower Drum Song' as a Chinese woman, she was in 'South Pacific,' she was--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah. She's a good friend of mine. Oh, was she a performer.  Top, top, top. Really grand. She's something else.  I have her doing her song in--from 'Flower Drum' I had her do that and also the other one--the other show that she did.
Speaker 1: 'South Pacific'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Both of those were her--on tape, I mean.  Yeah, yeah. She was wonderful.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I think most of the American public didn't realize she was black.
Speaker 2: No.  Un-un.  She wasn't--skin black.  And I'll tell you something else. You want to know about pictures and things--at the present time, as you will see when I show you this publicity and I told you that I was--and I was the first black woman to sign a long term contract with MGM [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer] Studios.  And then ten years later--let's say eleven years later because it was in '46 [1946]--Lena [Horne] signed to MGM. And she had the same producer that I had.
Story_ID: 18460
Speaker 1: We're talking about Bill Robinson--
Speaker 2: Bill Bojangles, yes.
Speaker 1: Asking you about this reputation that he--that you sometimes get in books and when people talk about him being a mean person.
Speaker 2: Well I contradict it because I felt like at the time that Bill was at his height, he was getting to be a little bit older.  I'd say he was in his fifties.  I think he made 'Stormy Weather' he was fifty-five or something like that.  So there were so many young people at the time that took tap dances in his period that they were behind him. And they're always wanting to outdo Bill and couldn't.  And so they were always putting out these tales about him being dis--all he did was just defending himself.  Because when I worked with him, I had never worked with any other people, professional people before, and to be able to work with him was the highlight of my life because he was the king of all of us, you know? And there's no--how would you say, any conflict at all. All I had to do was sit there--stand there and watch him show me something and do it like he wanted it and that was wonderful.  No, I didn't have that kind of feeling about him at all.  No, I think that he was a nice, nice gentleman. Me and him became close friends and he finally moved to California. And he and his wife and my brother [Alfred Melvin Ligon] and all of us--we were associated with him. But no, I loved him.  I really did. He was really a nice man.
Story_ID: 18461
Speaker 1: Tell us about [Thomas] Fats Waller.
Speaker 2: Fats was a doll.  Mad as everything, but a doll. And me--I worked with him at the Apollo [Theater] and (laughter)--and he had me come to his home and taught me how to deliver a couple of numbers that he had--one number he had for me, and told me how to deliver them, and then when he and I danced together, I would do my stuff and then I'd say to him come down and dance with me and he would say oh, girl, I can't dance. And I said oh yes you can. And I'd--we'd have a couple of little comments between us and I was dancing.  I did steps and he would do it on the piano.  And he would say I bet you can't do this and he'd play something nice and I'd say oh sure I can.  I could make the same sound on my feet that he'd just done on the piano. And so then I'd call him down and say come on down and dance with me.  And he said no, you know I can't dance. And I said yes you can. And so for the finale of my act, I would finally coax him down, and we did this step that's called stash, and it was just a walk up and you'd turn here and you'd turn there and you have to push yourself off like that. And he could do it. And when we'd get to the curtain, we'd do that old thing about going around one another.  If I'm in the front then I'd go up like this, and he'd go around me and do that, and the last time he would go around me and he would grab the curtain and shake it (laughter) and of course you know what happened. The house would just scream and yell. So we had a wonderful time together.  I enjoyed it more. And after I met him through the movie and we did the things during the show, he was writing the music to a--a stage show that was going to be open on Broadway in '43 [1943]. And we came to Los Angeles with his band and they called me. They had forgot about me and they called me to appear with him at the Paramount Theater in Los Angeles. And when I got there, they said oh my goodness--his manager, I keep forgetting his name, but anyway he said oh he says, you know Fats is writing the music to this play that's called 'Early to Bed.' And he's going to work in it. And you--we've been looking for a girl and you're the one that we need to have.  Have you done any pictures?  I said well I--and they said well, have you got any music, and I says no.  They said okay, when you leave here today, you can take some pictures.  I did, they sent them down and by Friday of the next week I had the job in 'Early to Bed.' And so when I went back to New York to start rehearsing for the show, Fats was doing auditions for the producer, the producer of auditions, so he did the songs that we were doing. One was called 'I'll Be Happy When the Nylons Bloom Again,' and 'Hi-De-Ho Harlem.'  That was the two numbers that we were going to do in the show. And so Fats had just reorganized his eighteen-piece band, and he felt he had all these wonderful contracts to play. So he felt that it would be better for him not to do the movie--I mean not to do the show on Broadway, but to keep his band together. So he went to Boston and he had to make some corrections and he previewed up there. And then he took his band back out to the coast again. And when we came down from Broadway for our opening, he was coming home too, because that's his home, you see.  He was coming home to see the opening of 'Early to Bed' and that's when he passed on the train you know, and he never--so he never saw the completed thing. I did the preview of that in Boston. And the person that took over his job was known by [Robert] Bob Howard, and he was fat like Fats and did a sort of an imitation of Fats, not exactly, but he played piano and sang.  He was a comedian.  And he and I did the show and I--we sang these two songs. And he got wonderful reports and wonderful raves and reviews, all the big newspapers in New York for the show, because it was a very good show.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is about 19--.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: When did you do this one? This was about 19--what date was this show?
Speaker 2: Oh, in '43.
Speaker 1: In 1943, right.  Okay.  It was on--
Speaker 2: On for a year. For '44.
Story_ID: 18462
Speaker 1: In '45 [1945], you did 'Stormy Weather,' was that right?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.  I think it was in May of '45.  I just had two bits of that. It was from doing--yeah. I'm the girl that chorus girls--when the angel brings the candy box, the big hard candy box, and he says, I've got something for you, and we say, I've got something for you too, and he walks to the door and I hit him over the head with the candy box. That's me. And when we first introduce them about having an angel, and the girl upstairs says something about--oh no. What happens is when the comedian is--they're told that they're going to save the show, and this comedian's name is Angel, and he comes in and he wears all these fancy clothes and everything and three of us are standing there and one of them says oh, it looks like an angel. And I say yeah, he's got the name too. And another one says something else. And that--I mean that's the scene, and I'm wearing like a sailor hat, you know. And then this woman--before we're talking about--we're standing around talking about a moment ago.  And I say oh, I think you've taken a fancy to this angel. And then one of the comedians passes by and he says oh, that ain't no angel.  He's a shoeshine boy in Harlem, and that's when we get mad and go back and do this thing to him when he comes in. Because he's cussing you know to get the thing and he comes back and brings him this--I paid three dollars for this big box of candy and I hit him over the head with that, yeah.  And I did--I think that was in '45.  In '46 [1946], I did one of the--the one that Dorothy [Dandridge] and [Harry] Belafonte did that was called 'Dishonor Bright'--'Dishonor Bright.'  Right.
Speaker 1: About the kids?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I play one of the teachers in that.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay. There's no dancing in--
Speaker 1: No.  Uh-uh.  Just a little part, just a little part.
Story_ID: 18463
Speaker 1: When I came back from London, we stayed in New York for a while because we were going to do some work there. And I met a bunch of Cuban and Puerto Rican kids and they used to go dancing every Sunday down at a place on 110th Street.  It was a ballroom down there and Latin music you know, and I had never heard real Latin music, like a big Latin band.  I'd heard [Xavier] Cugat and things like that, but I didn't know. So these kids used to go there, and they had this wonderful--they started at 2:00 on Sunday afternoon and they went to 2:00 on Monday morning. And the music never stopped.  And the band--like I said they would say that the Pedro Fernandez Band is going to be the attraction this week.  He had an eight-piece or something.  He would start--he did the show the first time. And he'd leave and he gave--some people would come up from the stage and there'd be four conga players and a timbale and a horn. And then they'd change it again and all these different instruments playing in the music there. One conga, the piano player and all the rhythms. And I--we--there's a balcony in this place and the audience--you're the band.  And they had a balcony, in this U-shape. We used to sit here and I used to look down on the kids dancing down there.  I've never seen them. I've never seen the cha-cha or what's it's name.  The rumba and all those dances. And the kids used to tease me. They'd say you're supposed to be a dancer, can't you--and the boys--the kids that I was with would set up the champion dancers in this stuff. And the boys would come and say come on, let's go down to the floor.  I couldn't do it.  I'd say no, no. And they'd tease me. They'd say you're supposed to be a dancer. And I'd say I know, I know.  So what I did, I would put my chin on the railing of that balcony and I sat like this for about three weeks and I learned everything those kids were doing down on the floor. The next time Freshie asked me to dance, I said sure.  And we went down and unfortunately what did we do? All the kids spread out and we did the darn--stopped the show (laughter).  And I was so taken about this music and I named it "the spic" first.  I called it "the spic." And then I said oh God, I can't use that you know (laughter). So I named it the sping, S-P-I-N-G which means Spanish and swing. And when I went home, I was married to Phil Moore who wrote 'Shoo-Shoo Baby' from the Second World War. You know, it was a big hit at the time and I wrote these lyrics and we went home and we did it later--made the song. So when I got home, they had signed Lena [Horne] for the contract at MGM [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios] and they had an article in the 'Variety' and the '[Hollywood] Reporter' which is the daily papers out there in Hollywood.  That they were looking for material for her to do. And so since I had been under contact to Mr. [Arthur] Freed, I had the nerve to call and said I've got something I think that maybe you could use. And he had always liked me and he said well, what you got? And I said well, can I come?  He says come tomorrow.  And I went out and I showed him--did the song for him and told him how I thought it should be done. And the first words of the verse of it is, "Below the borderline of old Harlem Town, down to 110th. There's a dance that they do of a true Spanish brew.  It's a twirly-whirly  dance called the Sping.  From the West Indies it came with its wild Spanish strain to be mixed with an indigo blue, dance to a rhythmic swing, giving that Harlem swing, it's a rhythmic dance called the Sping."  (Clapping).  And I put it in and he said it's in there. And he put the Berry Brothers [Coles and Atkins] with it.  And if you see 'Panama Hattie,' you will see that number.  And I wrote the words and Alfred [Ligon], my brother, helped me do some changes and he gets credit for it too, and Phil [Moore] wrote the music. And none of us were given that credit when the movie first came out, and so in 1996, Lena did a thing called 'Singing MGM,' and they wanted two pictures that she made, and they included it and they gave us credit, so I've got the credit now. And I've the--and she made a CD of 'Singing MGM.' And I've got it now. And unfortunately at this time, someone is dong something about her.  I think they're doing either writing a play or something for her in New York, and they put it in that she was the first black woman to sign up at MGM and it's not true, and I'm telling everybody that asks me.  If they don't get it straight, I'll sue them.  (Laughter). Because it's not. I'll show it to you.  The story about my signing and the date it was signed.  And I don't think it's right.  I really don't.  And I didn't think she has ever done the song other than in the movie.  And I feel hurt about that because it's a damn good song, it's wonderful. The music is good.  Phil Moore wrote the music. I mean they wrote 'Shoo Shoo Baby' and a whole bunch of other things.
Speaker 2: 'Shoo Shoo Baby.'  I was just humming that in my head.  That's a song from the--
Speaker 1: He wrote a whole bunch of stuff. So it ain't crap, at all.
Speaker 2: Tell me something about Phil--now Phil Moore is an important (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: We met one another on 'Double Deal,' this all-black movie that I did. And he had heard about me and he sort of liked me a little bit. Anyway, we liked one another and so when I went back to--I went back to do 'Early To Bed,' he had a chance to come back also and it was his time--oh, and I'd like to say one other thing.  That my having--our having done 'The Sping' for MGM was--he did the arrangements for it.  The sequence.  All of it.  Made him get a job at Paramount, with [Bing] Crosby and what's his name, uh--you know.
Speaker 2: Bob Hope?
Speaker 1: Bob Hope.  He did some arranging there.  He did some arranging--he was the first black man to do arranging on the major studios and they've got this thing out now about '70 years at the Apollo Theater' and they're doing--uh--the (unclear) who they say now is the first black man to do stuff.
Speaker 2: Um, Jones?
Speaker 1: Jones, yeah.  What's his first name?
Speaker 2: Quincy.
Speaker 1: Quincy, yeah. And that's not true, because he used to film out of 'The Sping,' he got these jobs because they liked the way he did it. And then he had this opportunity to go--when I went to New York, he came back from New York and the CBC--I mean CBS hired him to do music for--what was it, it was a classical orchestra, and he had some stuff and one called 'Ode to a Trombone' which is simply out of this world. And I had gone to see him direct.  He had--to see him, watch the people play his stuff for this little group there.
Story_ID: 18464
Speaker 1: And he [ex-husband, Phil Moore] worked with Mildred Bailey, the wonderful vocalist, you know.  I met her through him and we were very close and I met and knew Red Norvo, her husband, you know.
Speaker 2: Did you know Will Marion Cook or--
Speaker 1: No, no.  Oh, those are before my time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I know of them.
Speaker 2: William Grant Still.  I think he was--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: All of them.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: He was writing for the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was writing too.  It was wonderful.
Speaker 2: Stuff for television in the '60s [1960s].  His stuff was coming out in the '60s, but--
Speaker 1: I had a very fortunate thing because I met so many of the ones that were just fading out.  Like this [Ulysses] 'Slow Kid' Thompson, who was married to Florence Mills.  He was a dancer and he was in 'Shuffle Along' and he was a wonderful strut man and stuff, dancer.
Speaker 2: They called him Slow Kid Thompson?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: They called him Slow Kid Thompson, yeah.
Speaker 1: Slow Kid Thompson.  Yeah. And then I met--I should do this right. Anyway all the ladies--Adelaide Hall, and the ones in her era, I met them just before they--and I met Ethel [Waters] of course. And I met Mildred Bailey. Oh, it was so many of us. Wonderful people at that time that were doing things.  Just marvelous.
Speaker 2: We were talking about Juanita Moore before the tape change.
Speaker 1: Yes, uh-huh. And uh, there was lady up there called Princess or something or another.  She used to do lots of movies, especially the voodoo ones. She was wonderful. I can't think of her name now.  See, I've got to get all of this stuff together.  I'm missing stuff.
Speaker 2: Why were you in New York?  It was 1943 right?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: You took classes with Katherine Dunham too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I took some classes from her and I also took up one of her students who was from here and we danced together as kids around here.  His name--I have his number.  I forgot to write it down, but he's a very--from here.  He taught--yeah.  And I used to go see their show.  Our show was on 46th Street at a theater called the Broadhurst [Theater].  And their show, the Katherine Dunham show was around the corner at another theater, and all the stage directors of the theaters in New York have access to any theater--tickets to any theater they want.  So when I found this out, I asked my stage manager if I could get to see 'Life with Father,' with the man who was a big star back, The Katherine Show and 'On The Town'. And their studio would get tickets for us.  And most of the theaters did matinees on Wednesdays. And the Dunham Show did a matinee on Sundays. So all of us could come and see her and I was there practically every Sunday.  Because her show-- I'm telling you, it's just simply beautiful.  Just glorious.
Speaker 2: Is she--was she breaking new ground in terms of black dance--
Speaker 1: Yes. She combined the Caribbean stuff and African stuff that she had studied. And now you call it Afro, her, a term we use for her stuff, you see.  And then when I had my studio in Los Angeles, her first male partner who's name is Archie Savage was a teacher at Afro with my kids. And then I had a Russian ballet teacher from St. Petersburg who had been in a classical ballet company there. And then I taught--I saw dancing and tapping and jazz, into all the dance fields other than the ballet because I helped the kids learn ballet at the time, and then I taught how to perform and stuff like that, you know, performing acts. And we had a wonderful--and Alvin Ailey was there at the time and the person that he was working with, the young man who owned the studio that they worked in. And he passed, and he gave the studio to Alvin and de Lavallade?
Speaker 2: Carmen de Lavallade, yeah.
Speaker 1: And when they would want dancers, black dancers in the studio I'm speaking of, they would call and I'd send him a couple of mine, and he comes out and always either one for him, two for me, two for me, one for him. Every time. I had kids in--oh what was the name of that damn show? The wonderful--about the gangs.
Speaker 2: West Side Story?
Speaker 1: Dance gangs that were in--it was biracial first and then they put it on tape.
Speaker 2: Not West Side Story?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: I'm talking about West Side Story.
Speaker 1: West Side Story.  They had kids in that. And one of my boys that was taught at my school went to Paris. His name was Victor Upshaw, and he became the head choreographer at the Lido [de Paris]. And taught the Bluebell Girls and the French dancers and they had Le Lido in [Las] Vegas at the time in the late '70s [1970s], early '70s, and he had gone over before then, and he would teach the kids different--the stuff in Paris, and then they'd come to Le Lido and they'd repeat his stuff. They did the circle and then the new set would come and they would go down.  And he was there and he did the--he did a couple of movies then and they got him in a movie called 'The Hoodlum,' it was a French movie by one of their big French directors and all. And we went to--Frank [Clavin] and I went to London in 1985 and we went to Paris to see him, and in September, everything closes in September, so we didn't get a chance to see him work because he had left Lido by then. But we were invited to the Lido and we saw a wonderful show and we were seated right down dead center, enough to see the stage. But we had these real choice seats, and when we got there, this was a Sunday night performance, we got there, and the people were coming out of the theater, and we were saying oh God, look at all these people.  Well I gave my name, and they said oh yes, we were expecting you. And they passed us out--when we were ready to go in, they passed through all these people and took us to these choice seats in the theater on account of my boy, Victor.  He was a--very loved. And he threw a party, and so many people came and they just--and I was to meet Ms. Bluebell and something happened back stage and she couldn't come out to the table with us. But she called me the next day and told me how much--how beloved Victor was and how much they had enjoyed his work and she said you certainly did do a good job with him. And that of course made my day, you know.  And so--I've had so many nice things like that happen to me.
Speaker 2: I want to go back a little bit maybe through --
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We talked about some of the movies, but I want to ask you about some of the other black entertainers and what it was like being a black entertainer in Hollywood, you know before desegregation and all that.  What about the Nicholas Brothers [Fayard and Harold]?  You can do a lot of the Nicholas Brothers' moves.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And yet you are a girl.  How did they feel about that?
Speaker 1: Well they didn't object.  No--I mean it was an honor, really, do be able to do that.  I didn't do those well, but I did them well enough to get by.  No, they never called about that.  And I had a thing with--we did a show together in 1989 in Oakland, California.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we did a thing on the radio--TV rather, and where Fayard and I did a show together and we didn't rehearse it.  He comes up and said I've written this thing about our show and I said dance and accompaniment?  And he said yes and I clapped and he says this poem about we're at the Richmond place and he talks it and I clap and then he drops the paper and he go into the shim because all of us know it. And I watched it.  They did wonderful shots of our feet.  And I was laughing when I saw it and I said I should have been the brother (laughter) the other brother because it's really good, isn't it, Frankie?  It's really fun. No, they're my beloveds.  I loved them. And see I met them in New York when they were kids I think, and working at the Cotton Club. And it--Harold was nine at the time.  And then they came home and they had a big party and the Cotton had moved downtown then. And so they had this wonderful party with the Nicholas Brothers and I went to it and they went with me, he and I and the Duke [Ellington], and Ivy Anderson and the Nicholas Brothers' mother in a picture when we were celebrating this movie at the Cotton Club downtown, yeah.  So I've been--it's hardly anybody that you can mention that I didn't meet in my time (laughs).
Story_ID: 18465
Speaker 1: What was it like being in Hollywood in those days?
Speaker 2: Well Hollywood--see, but you didn't, you didn't fraternize in Hollywood.  You worked, and that was the end of it. And some of them spoke to you on the set and some of them didn't. And on the set, you never asked--you never lunched with anybody because you couldn't--we weren't allowed in the cafes, so we couldn't. I mean if you were Joe Jones and you were starting a show and you take us in, you maybe get by, but basically you didn't do it because ten years before that when I was under contract, one day Earl [Dancer] and I went to go into the restaurant, and we got to the door and the maitre d' says, "I'm terribly sorry, if you want to eat, you can go across to the cafeteria but you can't come in here."  And then ten years later--eleven years later when Lena [Horne] was in, that was--we had a Cuban boy and the three Berrys. Me and Phil [Moore].  It was six of us and we went to our first day of rehearsal to those cafeteria and we were told we could not come in. And somebody out of Mr. [Louis B.] Mayer's office heard this and the Mayers have their own private lunchroom and everything, so he went in and Mr. Mayer invited all six of us to have dinner--had our lunch there that day.  The next day--
Speaker 1: It was Louis B. Mayer, right?
Speaker 2: The next day we went, we were told that it was table for us.  But it was way back there and a whole lot of mountain greenery was up to (laughter), so it didn't matter a damn. But that was ten years later, it was 1946, you see.  So you didn't socialize.
Story_ID: 18466
Speaker 1: Of all the people that I worked with on the set, the only people that invited us to their home was one of my co-workers in the show that I did called 'Arabian Nights' and Ruby Keeler and her husband Al Jolsen. And for that, Al Jolsen and Earl [Dancer] were pushing one another.  He was pushing Ethel [Waters], and Al Jolsen was pushing himself many years before this when Ethel was being pushed, and you know most times, you topped the bill, that's what you wanted to do. But you start at the bottom and come up. So they--Al Jolsen was topped one time and Ethel was bottom, and vice versa. So they became Jolsen and Earl became close friends. And he invited--they invited Ruby, his wife, Ruby Keeler invited Earl and I to their home to have dinner. And they were the only people of all the people that I worked with who invited me to socialize with them at all.
Story_ID: 18467
Speaker 1: We got into a discussion off camera before we started to tape about Amos 'n Andy Show. And you were talking about the professionalism of that cast and how professional they were, always on time, always on the mark, knew their lines, you know.
Speaker 2: Couldn't have asked for anything more. Everybody came to work. That was their job. And they're used to working.  Kingfish, George Stevens's name is, he had been in vaudeville when he was--I mean in carnival times, when he started in as a carnival kid doing some I don't know what, singing, dancing, I think dancing and all that, and then he graduated some--and of course the one that played Andy was a polished actor.  He did other roles you see, did some black things, and he was on the stage--
Speaker 1: He directed some movies.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Spencer Williams. That was Spencer Williams.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then [Tim] Moore was Kingfish.
Speaker 2: No, no.  Something Moore his name I think was, wasn't it?
Speaker 1: Well, well Kingfish was Moore.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Kingfish, yeah.  No Kingfish was George Ste--no, no, that's his name in there, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't think of his first name though now.
Speaker 2: I've got it written down, I can--but no, they were all perfect. They were all perfect for the roles they played. And the one that played the lawyer. What's his name?
Speaker 1: [Algonquin J.] Calhoun.
Speaker 2: Calhoun, Calhoun.  He [Johnny Lee] was a you know, comedian from the past.  I think he went through the Whitmans [Alice and Mabel] too, if I'm not mistaken.  And uh--yeah.  No, no, they're just gems.
Story_ID: 18468
Speaker 1: You were talking about the generosity of Al Jolsen, as you know, being able to--he and his wife [Ruby Keeler] bringing you in the home, you know, which was something unusual in those days.  You also mentioned that Eddie Cantor had--was a regular kind of a guy too. Both--
Speaker 2: Yeah. They both were.
Speaker 1: Both Jewish comedians that used to do--perform, they used to do black-face at one time, but they're a lot more regular--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, in 'Ali Baba [Goes to Town]' he does it.  He does other things before, and when he does, he puts it on and he sings and he puts on the black-face.  But it isn't--you know, it isn't offending at all, you think.  I don't think so.
Speaker 1: But it raises--.
Speaker 2: Because the number is so--so different and so up to date and we had these beautiful kids singing, these pretty brown girls singing with these gorgeous voices, they're singing the whole chorus, "Swing is here to sway, don't alibi it, it's sweet"--
Speaker 1: I just raises a question in my mind about American entertainment and you know, much has been written about the fact that a lot of American popular entertainment is derived from the minstrel shows and so forth--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, white people are actually imitating black people.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And so they're singing and--
Speaker 2: Everything yeah.
Speaker 1: They're inspired about what black folks is doing and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, just like that jazz.
Speaker 1: Later black folks come in and imitate--white people imitating them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they get the money.
Story_ID: 18469
Speaker 1: You take somebody like Sammy Davis [Jr.].  Thoroughly complete. Ain't nothing missing from that young man.  He could act, he could sing, he could dance, he could tell jokes.  And he is excellent in each of those things.  You don't find too many people who are that darn good. And I think--I don't know whether I mentioned it, but last--when I came east this time to New York, we have a thing now called the Flo-Bert Awards.  I don't know if you've heard about them.  It's an honor of Florence Mills and Bert Williams. And the organization there in New York, it's called the Flo-Bert committee, and they're honoring those of us who they feel deserve a little bit of recognition.  I received it in 2000, I think it was, and this year, I was the presenter to Arthur Duncan who was on the Lawrence Welk Show and so--
Speaker 2: He was a tap dancer--
Speaker 1: He was a tap dancer, yeah, yeah.  And he was on the show.
Speaker 2: He was the only black person on the show.
Speaker 1: On that show, yes.  And on this award, it said that he had appeared occasionally on TV.  And I remember, I was--this is what I have to read to the audience about his--you know, it's says on his--in this award.  And I objected.  And I said--I went to him and I said Arthur, I said how many years did you work on this show, and he said seventeen. I said seven--I went out and told the audience, I said now I want to tell you that this plaque is wrong. He worked seventeen years on that show. And I don't know nobody that's kept a job that long.
Speaker 2: It was well known in the black community that he was the only black person on the Lawrence Welk Show, and he was on every week.  He was the only one.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And he out danced--he had to dance at our thing, you see, and they--Slyde, you know Jimmy Slyde?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well he's the next best--right now, he's our king. We all bow down when he comes in (laughter).  Because he's so wonderful.  He is just perfect.  And Arthur came on after him, and--came on after him and he was--he stopped the show. He was that good.  He stopped the show.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Good, smooth, you know. Sharp with gray hair and his gray suit, and his--top coat and dark pants.  And he was just wonderful.  And no pushing and no--you know, forcing, nothing like that.  He just--just danced. And his feet did all the work. But he was looking out there at the audience, telling them you watch my feet, you know.  I'm doing these for you, you know. Of course we were taught--that's how I was taught to perform.  Now, the only thing that I objected to that the kids do nowadays is they do not present themselves to the audience.  They don't perform for the audience.  Most of the tappers including Savion [Glover] cross the stage like this with their heads down and you're seeing their profile because the back of what they see--they're looking down at their feet. And once in awhile, they'll tell them to do something. But basically, that's how they go across the stage. And I had a friend in Philly who came up and saw our show in New York, and she says, I don't choke the way they do.  (Laughter).  He can't see his feet, his pants are hanging all down over his shoes. He can't see his feet.  And you know all the boys, [Charles] Honi Coles and Charlie Atkins and all them, and the Step Brothers--oh, could they dress!  Oh gosh.  And the kids with all this mad hair that they have nowadays, you know.  It's all right if they're not doing something, but I don't get it.  I'm sorry, I don't get it.  I think that we should take some of the old stuff and bring it back to life (laughter).
Speaker 2: You mentioned the Step Brothers, and Honi Coles and did you know Peg Leg Bates?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.  I used to go watch him all the time when he was--he traveled with both Duke [Ellington] and Cab [Calloway]. And when we received our doctorates here last year, year before last now, his daughter presented to the Oklahoma College one of his seats and also he used to have a pad laid for him--his leg was cut off and they made a pad to put in his crutch, and they presented that and also one of his hats because he always wore a hat you know.  He was as dapper as he could be.  And you see, I'd go to see the Duke show, and they'd open up the mornings with a regular light colored street--regular clothes. And then the second show, they'd come in, with tuxes. And the third show, they'd come in with tails.  If they came in, they'd do two straight things, and then they'd have their tuxes at night, you know, and always immaculate. And the boys--anybody--Honi Coles or whoever, was dancing, and they did the same thing. They all changed their clothes. And Peg too.  He'd dress exactly like the band dressed, and cut out on the same--but he'd always wear a hat. And it was just so gorgeous.  You'd sit there and say oh man, look at those guys go, you know?  It's wonderful. Really wonderful.  They were neat though, and they would all conk their hair, you know, it was.  Then the Afros came in, but they didn't over-exaggerate when the Afros came in, they didn't over.  But now the kids who are wearing all this funny kind of hair.  I should shut my mouth (laughter).
Speaker 2: It's a different time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: It's a different time.
Speaker 1: It's a different world out there.  You know, you have to bend with it--but you have to go as--but you see, tap has come back which is very wonderful for us, all of us, you see, because of--so long, we've been off the beaten track.  But now they have all these wonderful festivals, and Europe has them too.  Yeah.  I've been invited to come to Finland next year.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: They have tap dances in Finland?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 18470
Speaker 1: I think the last--I read that the last U.S. movie you did when you--you did a lot of movies, was 'Bright Road,' with Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then there wasn't one for a long time, you know?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Not a U.S. movie.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: For a long, long time until I think 2001 or something, you were in a movie with Snoop Dogg.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't--I think they made a couple, but I haven't seen any really with any story value or stuff like that.  But I understand that what's her name, Oprah Winfrey is doing one of Zora Neal Hurston, the author, one of her shows called 'Their Eyes Were Seeking God' [sic, 'Their Eyes Were Watching God'].
Speaker 1: Right. 'Their Eyes Were Watching--
Speaker 2: And I heard that she was doing that. And I think the young lady who won the Tony [Award] last year--I mean the actor's thing, you know. What's her name, a beautiful young girl. We got on--
Speaker 1: Halle Berry.
Speaker 2: Halle Berry, yes.  She's going to do that.  See, I've been trying to get on Oprah every since my television thing came out. Because do you know what happened?  You know Shirley Horn--you know how beautifully and wonderfully she works.  My 'Living in a Great Big Way' was presented to--in the Pittsburg to the consortium, American Black Consortium, I've got it written down.  I can't remember.  So--as a running prize, you know. We beat out Shirley Horn.  And I almost died when I heard that, because she's so wonderful, I couldn't see how in the world, me, living in the past, and coming up now, could beat her out. But we got first prize.  I've got it written down. It says winner!  And my producer who's name is Selwyn [Jacob], he went to Pittsburg and received the award and I've got the award itself because they asked him, somebody from our show--he went as our representative. But he got--they paid him $1,000.00, but they gave me the award, so I've got it at home. And it's over her, but every time I look at it, I don't believe it.
Speaker 1: Well, as Fats Waller would say, one never knows, does one?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No. That was him, wasn't it?  Isn't it wonderful?  One never knows, do one?  (Laughter).  Oh, that darn Fats.  Good Lord.  How wonderful. Yes, yes, yes. And Bill [Bojangles Robinson] taught me how to eat ice cream. That's the reason why vanilla's mine because he is an ice cream man, you know.  And I learned to eat ice cream from him.
Story_ID: 18471
Speaker 1: In the '50s [1950s] the movies stopped for awhile, and what did--you went to Europe, I hear in the '50s.
Speaker 2: No, no, no. I'd been to Europe early in the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't go again until 1985 to the World Festival they had there. And I went with a company in Toronto, and I taught them two numbers, and they did them, performed them there. And they had wonderful reviews.  They had them on the BBC, you know?  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I hear that--tell me if this is true that in the '50s, I know you were on Amos 'n Andy?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you also were on the Mickey Mouse Club too?
Speaker 2: No, one of my kids was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  One of my kids got on. And we opened, my dance company opened the Disney there in the--the one that's out of Hollywood there, what's his name?  They opened it in the late '50s.
Speaker 1: Disneyland, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah. They did a parade--there was a big parade and my kids did it and it was so funny, I think it was in the summer.  I know it was in the summertime, but I can't remember now what month it was, the kids did an Afro number, and the cobblestones in the streets in the thing was hot, and the kids were barefoot. And we had, my friend and I who were taking care of them, had to run back to the wardrobe place and get ballet slippers to put on the kids because they were doing African steps. But they weren't getting it, they were jumping high, the feet above the floor (laughter).  Yes, it was something else. They had a--and I'd been trying to get that because I want to put it in my--you know, among my souvenirs.  I said this time, when I go, I'm going out to Disney's and demand it, because I know they've got the opening, you know?  As long as it was.  I'd been trying to get it, but I hadn't been able to.  Yeah.  My kids all--this is before the main one that I was telling you about, Victor [Upshaw] and all them, they were doing this African thing with spears and all that sort of business, yeah. It was really nice.  It was about a three hour parade that they had that day.  To open Disneyland.
Speaker 1: I guess it was--it wasn't until the late '50s that people started taking--they seemed to be like a popular acceptance of African and Caribbean culture.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And Harry Belafonte was really big--
Speaker 2: Well see I--what happened with me was that I had this dancing school and as I think I mentioned earlier, I had all three of the wonderful arts and we had the--the ballet teacher had the--the ballet teacher had the African--Katherine Dunham style.  I call it the Katherine Dunham style because that's the only person that had been doing this at the time.  Whole bunch jumped up after her, but she was the one that introduced us to this particular kind of thing, and I just loved it.  So I developed a group and I called them Ballet Teens, and I had twenty-six kids in the group.  I had twelve girls on point, and I had twelve boys dancing, and we did a show, and people came to see it and they thought it was very, very good.  It consisted of, we had a ballet number where the boys in--this Russian man came over here, could jump, do what we call grande jete and they do the splits in the air, three feet.  (Laughter).  Bah, bullshit, my kids were doing them five feet up in the air before.  Anyway, so we had a ballet number, we did a jazz number to an old poem of Paul Laurence Dunbar called 'Jump Back Honey, Jump Back' and we did an Afro number at the end based on--what's her name's style and based on Place Congo in New Orleans. And those were the three high points in our show.
Speaker 1: Congo Square.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Congo Square.
Speaker 2: Yes, Congo.  So anyway, these were the three kinds of things that we had in our school. And these people who saw the show, they came back and told me they said oh, we think your show is wonderful.  I want you to get in touch with Ms. [Dorothy Buffum] Chandler who is the head of the Chandler family at the Times, the Los Angeles Times.  They give scholarships for blah, blah, blah, stuff and stuff. So I contacted her and in our studio at the time, there had been a boys' school, and we had a little theater in it. And so I invited them to come to see the--these three numbers. That was these three highlights. So we did them, and when we got through, Ms. Chandler said oh, she says, it's a simply wonderful show.  Just wonderful.  She says but you know I don't think the Times are ready for black girls on point.  Four years, four days a week working with these poor little babies and they were so--you know, we just broke up after that and the kids began to drift away, so I let them go.  This was from the Cuban style before the Belafonte step became very popular. So I organized a group called Jazz Carib, so we can do the jazz as well as the Caribbean stuff.  I had a youngster that could go under the pole on old Coke bottles.  Remember they were about six inches from the floor? He could go under the pole and he was the pole dancer and he did an African thing.  I've got pictures of--you can see him jumping this high off the floor.  And I had--I had heard about the steels, never seen them though. I went to a party one night, and the steels were--there was a steel band there and I was enamored of the steel band so I talked to them and I said hey, I'm going to do this show, and I'd love to have a group.  He says how many people you got, and I said I've got four musicians and myself. He says well, we'll make them for you and we'll show you how to play them and he did. And we had a five piece steel band and we played at the Army post two or three different times, all around here and we played those things.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is this the time period where you learned how to play the congas too?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: Is this the time period that you learned how to play the conga drums too?
Speaker 2: Oh, well I was playing those first.  I learned them from the man who played in 'The Sping'.  His name was (unclear).  He was from down South, a South American.  He taught me. That's why I learned to play the congas.  I played congas with the band, and then I played--we did steel band stuff and we played that, and we had this show.  I had a ten-piece.  I had five pieces including myself as the band, and three girl dancers and two boy dancers. And we played at all the clubs and the--all the Army stuff, the Navy and the Marines and everything. All across country. We did it for about five years, back and forth, uh-huh.  And I've got wonderful citations from different posts that we played, citing that they would recommend us for any other person, good show and all that.  I've got it in my book.  (Laughter).  Yeah.  So I was taught a wide variety which I appreciate because I did know something, and sometimes when I hear somebody talking about some of this stuff and they're making silly--I have to say I'm afraid you're wrong about it and so and so and so on.  They hear it, but they didn't know.
Story_ID: 18472
Speaker 1: What do you think was the biggest misconception about that time period that you heard?
Speaker 2: Well one of the big conceptions was about--this came from a person I love very dearly about what I mentioned, the thing about her saying the kids Ms. [Dorothy Buffum] Chandler, about the girls on point, and I said that in this town, one of the reasons why people were not interested in black girls on point was because of their insteps. Their insteps weren't as flexible as the white kids were. And my cousin came up and said oh no, no, no.  She said the reason why was that their butts were too big.  I says what? And she says yes, the tutus didn't fit and I says you've got to be kidding. I said, what's that got to do with their feet? And I have a picture of two of my kids on point, and one is perfectly what you want and one is just a little bit off, you know, just enough to make the point here instead of here. And that's what the argument was about. That they said that's true because I couldn't be--I wanted to be a toe dancer one time. But I did not have that instinct.  My own stuff was not that flexible, and a lot of us didn't. But then those of us that could did. And I said on a stretch of any kind of imagination--how could you say something like that? That sounds so ignorant that their fannies had something to do with how they got up on their toes and--a mile away from their toes.  And now-- (laughter) every time I think about it, I get mad.  (Laughter). I think this was--and she's--I won't tell you who it is, but anyway she's really knowledgeable and just knocked the stew out of me.  I couldn't believe it. But I'm telling you--that's what I'm talking about, you know, these lies that people come up with. They don't know a darn thing about what they're saying. But that was at the time, that was one of the reasons why they kept saying the kids couldn't do it.  But they had been on their toes forever because the dancers like Dianne Walker, she was seven years old and she was on point.  Perfect.
Story_ID: 18473
Speaker 1: Who are some of your favorite dancers of all time?
Speaker 2: Oh, my favorite dancers now? Oh, Diane Walker is--they called her Lady Di, and she's the queen and I bow down to her because she definitely impressed me. And she is one of the most beautiful dancers you'd ever want to see. And she's a heavy girl, and you wouldn't think that she could move so gracefully.  Oh no, she's tops.  Now there were a couple of young ladies, one's called Casella and the other one has got a double name. She's on this program that we're going to be doing here. And they're wonderful too, really good. But I hadn't been around enough to see all the kids.  I haven't seen them, I'm just now coming into this particular thing where I get a chance to meet them and see them. And I know there's a young boy named--well the one that's doing the Los Angeles one, I've seen him dance. He's very good.  His name's Jason something.  His last name. He's Debbie Allen's nephew, and he's a very good nephew. But he looks like Savion [Glover] and I mixed them up one time (laughter), but  he's very good and there's a young man here that I met that's exceptionally good.  He has a school of his own, I can't think--he's one of the teachers here. He's very, very good. And--oh, a young man that's head of the tap organization here, Lane Alexander.  He's an excellent dancer. Beautiful dancer.  He's wonderful. He's taken over the first man who used to do the classical step and tap and he does it.  And he's very, very good.  He's charming--wonderful personality to be on the stage and all. And there are a whole bunch of them that are just excellent.  I don't know all their names because I haven't met them yet.  But--it's just come back with a bang and I'm so happy. Because you know years and years ago, all the vaudeville shows used tappers.  Yeah.  Until 'Oklahoma' came along (laughter).  And Agnes DeMille put in the ballet stuff and then they were all mad about that for awhile.  But now you know 42nd Street has been traveling, there's been tap dancing shows, you see. So that's helped this stuff too, you see?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So now. We've got some future dancers, really.  We've got some real good future dancers, really. Excellent.  And I want them to learn how to perform. Most of them I've seen do not perform to.  They dance beautifully, but they dance within themselves and they dance across the stage and in a sense that--and we were taught to entertain.  Do the feet, but at the same time sell it and get it out there so the people know what you're talking about.

Speaker 1: You settled in Vancouver
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: British Columbia.  1969?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you were doing this show Jazz Caribe, I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was on the road with Jazz Caribe, and I reorganized it here and then Jimmy Payne--you know Jimmy Payne?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jimmy Payne was a volunteer here at DuSable [Museum of African American History] and--
Speaker 2: When I came here, he got me the job of doing--I did some of the colleges here and a whole bunch of high--junior high and high schools here in the city, and he had a job for us to go to Canada and I had accepted it.  I had been offered jobs before living in L.A.  So I said I'm not going to go to Canada.  It's nothing up there but them Eskimos and cold snow and ice and I didn't want to go, especially in L.A., you know.  So when I did this thing for Jimmy and he said I've got a job in Calgary and--what's the other city--Calgary and--well, anyway, in Canada.  I said I'll take it. And so we came up and we played there and then we didn't have anything else to do, so I said I'm just going to go back home through Vancouver back down to L.A. and perform. And when I got to Vancouver, there were three people there that I'd known before. One was an emcee at one of the clubs, and two of them, my ex-kids from school were there.  And they convinced me to stay and that's how it happened.
Story_ID: 18475
Speaker 1: And we'd sit back there and they said oh, so and so and so. They said oh, Americans are funny.  (Laughter). And the next thing you knew, somebody's doing one of these things. And when they see our two brown faces.  And they sit there and look at us, and we pay no attention, oh Americans, I don't know. They're don't have very good manners, you know.  And we'd go into Tiffany's and carry on in the same way and say, I wonder how much it is in pounds. (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So we got on a--
Speaker 1: So we'd do this. And the clerks would--one clerk would--he's at his station, she's at hers.  Next thing you know, I'm talking to you and they're discussing well, you have to ask how many pounds and you know, Amerian dollars of course is not as much as a British pound, and they did this--you did this, and there were clerks from here and there and come and look.  (Laughter). And we'd say well, I don't think I'd like to buy anything today. I said no, my pounds are running out.  (Laughter). And we'd do all this foolishness and we'd go out the door and we'd say oh, Americans are funny.  (Laughter).  It was so much fun.  We got all these wonderful reactions from the people you know. We, with our brown faces speaking very, very good English, you know.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: We got on a tangent here, but that's funny.  You know.  Do you do the other accents? Do you have a Latin accent?
Speaker 1: I can pick them up.  I can imitate somebody, i hear them and can do them, you know. I have pretty good flair for them.
Speaker 2: Have you always been able to do that?
Speaker 1: I think so. And I learned--I was in school when I was--when I was in junior high school, I was in a French class, and I had the best accent of reading French and all, and in those times you know, you had these--what you call them--helped to tell you what you wanted to set your program for school. And so my person came and took me out of the French class and the French teacher, the next semester I wasn't there and she wanted to know why and I told her--she told her I couldn't take it. And she went to her and she said now you bring her back in the class because she's the only one in the class that's getting French and has a halfway decent accent you know and had been reading well.  So I guess you know it's just the blood line coming through.  I had no idea of course that I had this French blood in me you know, but I love French. When I found out, I said oh God, I love it, I love it.  But I never really went into it, I learned to speak it kind of, but not too well, yeah.
Story_ID: 18476
Speaker 1: Well we were talking about when you got to Vancouver --
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You worked with a youth theater group for awhile.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I formed one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I formed a youth tap school, dance school.  I taught everything like I did in L.A. [Los Angeles].  We taught ballet and jazz and everything. And I taught the Afro of course because I knew it well.  And I organized a group there of twenty-six kids and I called them Troupe One, and we had about half and half, eighteen and--they had about sixteen girls and eight boys, something like that. And I taught them some routines, and we became a performing unit. And I had took them to the hospitals and to the senior homes and like that, and we did a wonderful concert of our own, and had really nice write-up about that. And then I had classes during the summer and during of my summertime classes, a young lady who was born and raised in Vancouver was living in Toronto.  I had moved to Toronto and she took one of my Afro classes and she said oh, I like it. She says I'm opening--I have a group that I'm starting in Toronto in February. Would you be--could you come and teach one, and I said oh sure, you know, thinking that you know, you see people and then you never see them again.  I don't know if they're lying or what.  So I had just renewed my contract to teach at the place that was called Kid's House, it was a neighborhood house. And so she calls me around the latter part--or the middle of December. She said oh, I got my grant for my company and I'm going to call it the Pelican Players, and we want you to come and teach. She said can you come in February?  And as I said, I had just signed this contract to stay where I was, you see.  So I said oh, I don't know, but anyway I was lucky enough because one of [Katherine] Dunham's dancers was back in Toronto. So I called him and talked to him and asked him if he could teach one and I asked Mr. Duncan, who was the head of the Kid's House if I could go for a month. And he said oh sure.  And so we cancelled my classes until I came back, and I remember I did two things for them. And then the next year, she called me. Her name is Robin Endres and she called me and she said oh, she says, the Pelicans have been invited back to England to do the festival, acting and dancing. So, she said we would like for you to come and choreograph for us.  And that's how I got to England the second time.  And I went over there and we did very well. We got beautiful reviews.  They got top reviews there too. And then when I came home, I had--at that particular time, I still had my kids.  I hadn't formed them then.  Then I started then and I formed Troupe One.  And we did all these wonderful things. And then something came up out of--what happened?  Oh, we didn't get as much work and I didn't want to keep the kids. They were pre-teeners, most of them, when they first started, and I had them for about three and a half years, and they were pre-teeners, and they were beginning to kind of you know, how teenagers are. So I decided I wouldn't push them anymore. And I let them go, and that's when I formed, we had a band together, Frank [Clavin] and I, and we called it Jazz Caribe. We called it Jazz Cinq Band, Jazz Five Band. So we did that. We did some nice things. We played at the big hotels there, and we did two of the jazz concerts that we had every year. And then we decided that we--I decided that I wasn't going to teach anymore, and at that time, this festival, tap festival started coming in, and so for the last about four years now, I've been doing that.  And that's how my life changed. But when I got to Vancouver in '69 [1969], these two kids were working at this club where this young--other friend of mine was the emcee at the club. And they convinced me, they said oh, we don't have anybody here that has as many techniques as you do, and we'd like to start your classes. So this was like on a Monday and Thursday, I had a place for them to come. I had twenty students. And I stayed there ever since, yes.
Story_ID: 18477
Speaker 1: And they--living there is very different from here.  Very different.
Speaker 2: In what way is it different?
Speaker 1: Well, for instance, there are not a lot of black people there. And we do not have any black areas there.  No concentrated--only blacks in some area, we live wherever we want to.  I live in the heart of town. I live in what's called the West End.  And my building has thirty-seven apartments, and I'm the only black person in the building, and I never have to worry about anybody saying anything nasty, use the n-word, that kind of crap going on. And they greet me, the ones that move in, they find out who I am, and they say hello, and I get all this--I can walk in and everybody hugs me and kisses me (laughter). It's just life, you know.  It's just life, like it should be led, that's all.  So this is what I say about it.  I'm very happy there.  I think I have to have an awful lot of money to move back here, other than the fact that I have seen one of these senior homes that I'd die for (laughter).  And they take you in and keep you and they let you die and they send you on your way, you know.  And it's down in Philadelphia, my cousin, Reverend [Robert L.] Polk, is there. And it is just something--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: You mean Reverend Polk who was assistant pastor at Riverside?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He's retired.
Speaker 2: Riverside Church.
Speaker 1: Yes, Riverside.  He's retired and he's down there.  It's called [Torrey M.] Cathedral Village. And it's simply wonderful.  They have every--they have their own library, they have a place to make you know, putty stuff.  You know what I mean.  Making ceramics. They have a TV room--computer room. They have two different dining rooms, one that's formal. The man has to wear a tie, one that's informal. They serve three meals a day. They get two days of cleaning and they have croquet and golf practice if you want to.  I'm telling you, and it's--the setting is out in the country but it's just gorgeous trees all around it.  If you're sick, and you have to go to the hospital, they have a car to take you and bring you back.  It is lush.  I don't know what it costs.  I haven't found out yet.  It's worth whatever penny it is. And there's a lady there now who's--105, isn't she? She's one of us and she's been there for some years. And she's fabulous.
Story_ID: 18478
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well I'll tell you.  I'm telling you I've been in a state of confusion since I've been back this time because I didn't go to Harlem this time, I just stayed down.  I stayed with my cousin whose name is Micki Grant and she wrote the wonderful show, 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,' and also 'Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,' and she lives down in the heart of Manhattan on 94th Street. So I didn't go to Harlem. We did a couple of things near there, but not in Harlem this time. But when I went to Philadelphia, the lady who I stayed with in Philadelphia lived in a black neighborhood.  And then we went to another black neighborhood that was so broken down and so horrible, it just made me sick. And I can't understand why it hasn't--something hasn't been some kind of change.  I've been away for fifty years, and it's like when I left here, I didn't know--now I've got to see Chicago again.  I haven't seen it yet, but I want to go and see. The last time I was here, all the places on Lake Shore Drive were boarded up and everything near there. And that was heartbreaking.  And so I really don't understand why in all these years that we haven't been able to live together truthfully. Because it doesn't hurt.  I'll give you a perfect example of it, living in Canada, and all my friends are like me.  We celebrate Black History month and we have--there's all kinds of black organizations up there, you choose what you want to do. A lot of West Indians are there too. But as I said before, this--none of this--this just slaps you in the face.  I've never been insulted at any or have I had to worry about anybody saying you can't go in here, you can't eat here.  I've slept in the best hotels up there in the '60s [1960s] when I first went up there. When things were not straight here yet. So I don't know.  I'm just hoping that one of these presidents that comes in and puts his foot down and says now look.  This is where this has got to go and this is what we're going to do. We're not going to make it out as a nation, and that's how I feel.  I really do feel about it. That's exactly how I feel. That if we don't make these changes, we ain't for nothing.  It ain't going to make it. And it can be done, you know?  Like I see--now, I see a lot on the TV that I don't see at home. And I see the black men touching the white women and all of that business and it shocks me, because I was raised under the impression, that's a no-no.  No, no, no, no, no. And they've got all these wonderful things now. And that's progress of course, but it's odd that all this happens on the screen. And it can't happen out in the city, all that sort of business, you know?  So I'm telling you, I'm living in confusion right now.  I have to get myself back home and get straightened out.  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 18479
Speaker 1: When you look back on all the things you've done, would you do anything differently?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  I would not.  All the mistakes that I've made, and I've been stranded a couple or three times with working and everything, no, I would not change a thing.  I am just fortunate. I think I've had one of the best--you couldn't ask for anything more. Look at me.  Seventeen-year old dancer with Bill Bojangles Robinson, king of the world in tap dancing.  I had a chance to make all these movies.  I worked with the best people in the world. All of the white movies that I've done were top stars.  I did one or two B pictures but all the rest of them were A pictures.  And--
Speaker 1: I think it was one about some zombies or something, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  It's become a cult film and it's shown every year somewhere and they all dress up in the voodoo stuff and carry on (laughter).  So I mean no, no, no, I would not change one thing.  I'm just fortunate that I'm living this long to see it. This is what's helped me get along is my being able to be in good health, you know and stayed like I am.  Yeah.  I wouldn't change nothing.  Nothing.
Story_ID: 18480
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Harriet Bell Ligon] and your sister [Mary Belle Ligon McLendon] think about your success, you know, in show business?
Speaker 2: See, my mother was overwhelmed by it because when I got on my feet, I sent them--I rented a beautiful little home in Los Angeles, and sent for them, and she walked in the door, my foster sister [Willa Mae Lane] and I, we both--after we were hurt in Los Angeles, we both got work and we started working. And she did a wonderful thing. She became one of the strippers in one of the big burlesque shows and she became the star of that particular vein, and I did the other one, so we both had a little bit of money. So we sent for my mom, we rented a home, and we furnished it before we sent for her, and when she walked into that house that time, she walked into a nice, wonderful cozy place. And she couldn't believe it. She came in the wintertime and she had her fur coat on. And my sister and I met her in white shorts, white blouses, white tennis shoes and white socks. And our legs were out of course, you see. And my mother couldn't get over---she'd just left the snow and ice here.  (Laughter). And she couldn't get over how we lived.  When anybody came after that, visiting, her sisters and everything. And you know the girls met me and so and so and so and so, and I had on my fur coat collar, (laughter), white collar with fur on and they just had on summertime clothes. And she just adored it and it was really nice and it was comfortable and she had her own room and we had a maid--I had a maid.  So--yeah.  It's pretty good, I'll tell you. Couldn't be better.
Story_ID: 18481
Speaker 1: When you look back on all the things you've done, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My what?
Speaker 1: Legacy.
Speaker 2: Oh. Well I haven't thought about it until recently when I've been getting all this accolades from the tap societies. And I didn't know I was this well known amongst them, and they all think I'm kind of nice and this is wonderful.  Just wonderful.  That's all I can say.
Speaker 1: So it's good to get some recognition after all these years I guess.  Yeah.  And the last question is similar to the legacy but different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  Oh boy.  I don't know.  Just remembered I guess. And like the way I'm getting now, all the love from all the people that I've been meeting.
