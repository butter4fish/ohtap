Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we're gonna start with your mother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So if we could introduce this portion by you telling me and spelling your mother's name and telling us where she was born?
Speaker 2: Sure, my mother, her name was because she just recently died in 2005 is Russaloin Cutting [Russaloin Merritt Cutting], and it's R-U-S-S-A-L-O-I-N, last name Cutting, C-U-T-T-I-N-G and she was born in North Carolina in Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1929.
Speaker 1: Is that where she grew up?
Speaker 2: That's where she grew up until she was five years old then she came to New York [New York].
Speaker 1: And what do you know about your mother's background and about her growing up?  Did she tell you any stories about her (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah I have, have tons of stories yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us some?
Speaker 2: You know she lived in--of course when she came to Harlem [New York, New York] she, she came--her mother [Grace Merritt] sent her without her coming up here.  She stayed with relatives in, in New York because my grandmother was in the South and she worked as a maid in the South in Chapel Hill and then she came to New York about seven years after she sent my mother and my mother was with relatives here and she had a lot of fun growing up in Harlem.  She went to schools in Harlem; she played outside at--in Harlem.  You know the family was always just very close knit, we still are today and then we still have a lot of people in North Carolina that we--I go back and visit occasionally, but when she grew up and she always wanted to make it better for her family.  She became a nurse at the age of nineteen.  She married my father [Clement Cutting] when she was nineteen years old.  She had my brother [Richard Cutting] when she was twenty years old, my sister [Diane Cutting] a couple of years later and then there was a big gap between my sister and I before I was born, and they lived in Harlem all those years but then my mother wanted a better life so she bought a brownstone in Brooklyn [New York] in 1953, 1950--no, I'm sorry 1955 she bought the brownstone where I still live today.  You know my brother and sisters don't live there any longer, but it's just me and my family and I'm keeping the tradition, 'cause she always wanted to keep it in the family, and we live in Prospect Heights [Brooklyn, New York] where the area now is just like going up in real estate value so I really wanna say thank you, mom.  She really helped to make sure that there's a legacy that's established in the family, in the family.  So you know we still live in Brooklyn, she was really always caring.  She wanted a better life for her kids, she took me to a lot of museums, especially the Brooklyn Museum [New York, New York] which is like four blocks from where we lived and I always use to go to the Costume Institute [sic.] there and just keep looking at all the costumes and decide you know well maybe I can do something with this one day. And then she had a lot of fashion magazines and at the house and I would look at them magazines and try to copy, so I taught myself how to sketch at the age of six and I just kept looking at books and buying sketch books, you know having her buy me sketchbooks and telling her when she use to come to you know school, "Hey mom, why don't you just put a little lipstick on like, like some of the other mommies 'cause I want you to look pretty like what I see in the book."  So.
Speaker 1: Well that's my next question what was your mother's fashion style or fashion sense like?
Speaker 2: She was not--she knew what was going on in fashion, but she was not very savvy I guess from buying clothes horse to buy a lot of clothing.  You know she just knew how to look good, she looked great, she always in shape, she looked good, but she didn't--was rather just put the money into education or just trying to work to make sure that we can do different things.  So by the time I went to sixth grade, she and my father decided that it was good for me to expand myself and the school had an opportunity for me to go to Italy and with that in mind she really said, "Okay, you're going to Italy." And she convinced my father to let me go to Italy and my sister was saying, "Why? Why him? Why is he gonna go to Italy?"  You know, "It's too far away, you know he should be home."  And my mom said, "No he has to go."  And that was really my first introduction to the world of fashion.
Story_ID: 628939
Speaker 1: Your mother [Russaloin Merritt Cutting], did you spend any time with your mother's parents?
Speaker 2: My grandmother lived with us (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you know them?
Speaker 2: You know my grandfather died when I was just born in 1961, he died in December of that year.  I was born in June, he died in December of '61 [1961] and my grandmother lived with us in our house and my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: What were their names?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Grace Merritt, and it's G-R-A-C-E, M-E-R-R-I-T-T, and then my great-grandmother her name was Anna Biggs, A-N-N-A, B-I-G-G-S.  Grace, she died in 2000.
Speaker 1: And since she lived with you--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --do you have a sense of--can you tell us where your grandmother grew up, and do you have any anecdotes or any sense of what it was like when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, she grew up also in Chapel Hill in, in North Carolina and during that time she really didn't know who her grandmother was, who her mother was at all because her mother died when she was two days old, and she was an orphan from two days old and she was just passed from family member to family member and at that time they really didn't do any birth certificate so there was really no record of her birth.  She didn't know how old she was, she just kind of guessed and she met my grandfather when she thought she was about fifteen years old, and that's when she had my mother when she was about fifteen.
Speaker 1: So the great-grandmother who lived with you in Prospect Heights [Brooklyn, New York]--
Speaker 2: Was not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) was not her mother?
Speaker 2: Was not really her mother, it was a woman who really raised her and she, she was born in 1886, so and she died in 1981, so she was really my, my sole--because my grandmother and mother was always out working and then--my nana, we use to call her.  Nana really stayed with me, she taught me how to cook, she taught me how to make little--put my button on my, my shirt if it fell off, you know just to really tell me old stories about her growing up you know, and she grew up in Fredericksburg, Virginia and, and it was in a time when slavery was just over and she had restaurants all--she  grew up and she was a good cook, so she had restaurants in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and then she closed the restaurant in Philadelphia and then she was working on the train.  I think it's, it's--I, I'm not sure exactly what she did on the train, I forgot.  She told me but it was really that--I think she was a cleaner on the train and then she use to travel around and tell me stories about how it was you know back in those days for black people. You know how black people had to always be segregated from whites and her experiences dealing in the South and how they went down south and how they had to change over in being in the black section only car and it was just really interesting to hear those stories.
Speaker 1: So how did your mother--no, how did your nana gain custody of your mother?
Speaker 2: You know what it was no official.
Speaker 1: Yeah I know it wasn't official, I just.
Speaker 2: It wasn't official, she just--they just became--they bonded and you know and they just stayed together and that was it.  They--and we just lived together as one big family.  You know at the time when my, when my grandmother came to New York [New York], you know my, my nana was still in Philadelphia but then she also came to New York years later.  I can't tell you the exact date but I know that they just, it was in the '30s [1930s] or the beginning of the '40s [1940s] and then Nana had her own apartment and her husband had died and then my grandmother said, "Well come live with me."  So that time they stayed together for a short time and then my mother when she bought the house and moved to Brooklyn [New York] then she said, "You know what I want the two of you to come live with my family."
Speaker 1: So was everyone living in Harlem [New York, New York] first and then--
Speaker 2: Everyone lived in Harlem (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) eventually moved to Brooklyn?
Speaker 2: They had a great apartment; I mean it was on Central Park--
Speaker 1: Where was that located?
Speaker 2: Central Park West and it was 106th Street and it was a nice--at that time it was like a, a big apartment.  You know now it's all cut up, you know it, it was about--they had seven bedrooms in the apartment.  It was right across from the park [Central Park, New York, New York], can you believe it?  I wish that we still had that apartment now.
Speaker 1: How many apartments is that--?
Speaker 2: Cut up to now?
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think like four, at least four apartments. Signs of the time.
Story_ID: 628940
Speaker 1: So you said that your mother [Russaloin Merritt Cutting] and your grandmother [Grace Merritt] worked outside of the home.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did they do, were they working in Brooklyn [New York]?
Speaker 2: Well when my, when my grandmother came to New York [New York] she came as a domestic.  She still was a maid and working in--for a lot of the wealthy socialites of New York and who use to help give clothing to the family for my mom and you know just give little perks 'cause that was during Depression [Great Depression] time and so you know fortunately my mother--my grandmother was a great cook, so she would always cook and then serve a lot of people.
Speaker 1: Now you said that your family lived on 106th [Street] and Central Park [West].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where were--your grandmother was a domestic, where was she working within the city?
Speaker 2: She, she--
Speaker 1: On the--
Speaker 2: --worked.
Speaker 1: East Side [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: East Side. East Side it was right on Sutton Place [New York, New York], that's it you know I remember this one woman who, who she worked with who I--when I was growing up I use to go to her house and--her name was Ms. Bernard [ph.] who was on Sutton Place and she had a son I believe that close to my age and a daughter that close to sister's [Diane Cutting] age, so she would give the clothing to us to wear and some of the older toys we would have.  But my grandmother was a domestic all that time until--really she took care of kids in, at our house in the late '70s [1970s] and early '80s [1980s] that's when she really worked at home, but my great-grandmother [Anna Biggs] she--after she stopped working with her restaurants she didn't do any domestic work.  She worked for the railroad and you know she worked for the railroad until she retired, and she retired in like the early '60s [1960s], and then she was home, she was taking care of us at home so you know we had always had family help, and the good thing about that is that when my grandmother and grand- great-grandmother died and then my mother stopped working as a nurse 'cause she was a nurse all these years from when she was nineteen until she retired in 1993 at sixty-five.  She took care of my kids, so she just passed the baton you know just to really keep that legacy in, in the family.  And, and you know what the good thing about it is that with the kids, my kids they're able to--she was able to share all the old stories of her grandmother and my--her mother so that the kids have a base and they were always there in the house so the kids are grounded. That's a good thing.
Story_ID: 628941
Speaker 1: So let's take it back just a little bit again.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Do you know how your mother and father [Clement Cutting] met?
Speaker 2: They were playmates on the street.  They--it was like, I think 113th Street they lived and there was a lot of kids always out in the street and my father was a hustler.  You know he's one of these fast kind of guys who you know it wasn't--smooth talking gentlemen, and my mom was just a nice little girl you know with the other side that can cut you, 'cause they was a little rough out--in those days back you know on 113th Street, but my dad you know he always liked my mom and he always had a fast life.  He, he liked running numbers and being a little street side, a little--he had a street edge to him and my mother didn't want that lifestyle so you know they, they met.  They had a great time but then he was always out dating some other girl but then he always would come back to his Ruthie.  That's what he called her.  Instead of Russaloin [Russaloin Merritt Cutting], he called her Ruthie.
Speaker 1: Was he much older than she was?
Speaker 2: No, he was only like about a year older, about a year older than she is, or two years older than she was, and you know she--he was a good looking tall guy and you know and she was the cute small woman 'cause she was about 5'2" and my dad was about 6'1" and they just had a good time together and you know she wanted to stop that fast life and that's why she wanted--she left Harlem [New York, New York] without him.  That's something I didn't mention before, she left Harlem without him and she bought the house on her own, at the age of twenty-five in Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: And this was after they have children?
Speaker 2: After they had my brother [Richard Cutting] and sister [Diane Cutting].
Speaker 1: And did they marry during that period or before they started having children?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were married; they were married during that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They married when my mom was nineteen, so they, you know they've been married and then they split up but then they got back together and then I was born. So that was the big gap between my brother, sister and I.  There's a nine year gap between my sister and myself and fourteen years between my brother.
Story_ID: 628942
Speaker 1: What was your father's name and where was he from?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Clement Cutting, C-L-E-M-E-N-T, C-U-T-T-I-N-G, and he was from New York [New York], but his family, my grandmother [Ethelyn Cutting], his mother was from Cuba and then my--and she had some Indian origin you know from (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Native American?
Speaker 2: No, no from East India you know, I think they brought--she was from the South of India and they brought her over to Cuba and that's, that's all.
Story_ID: 628943
Speaker 1: Did your father [Clement Cutting] tell you any stories about his growing up in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: No, he, he really didn't have a chance, he was not very talkative you know he just went: "Hey boy, get up, do this, be a man" you know, but he, he really--he instilled a lot of, a lot of love in the family.  We use to spend a lot of time together especially go to movies.  That use to be our big thing, go to movies on Sundays and you know this one fond memory I have of him being about six years old and walking down the street and holding his hand and looking up and saying, "Hey, daddy," and you know my kids I do the same thing.  I make sure I hold their hand and I tell them this is something that I loved when I was a kid so I want you to have this experience and then right now my--to this day my nine year old, he'll hold my hand, you know he has no, no qualms about being nine years old.  He just likes that feeling from the stories I'm able to tell him about my father.
Story_ID: 628944
Speaker 1: Now, did you know your father's [Clement Cutting] parents, did you spend any time--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah I spent time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) with his mother?
Speaker 2: I spent time with his mother--my father's father he died so I really didn't know him, but I had a step-grandfather who I knew very well.  He's from Antigua and my, my grandmother I knew her very well.  You know we use to go to her house growing up all the time.
Speaker 1: Did you go to her house in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: She lived in Harlem on, on 105th Street.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Ethelyn [Ethelyn Cutting]--you know don't ask me how to spell that, I forgot how to--E-T-H-L-E-T-O-N [sic.], I forgot Ethelyn how she spelled it but she was my nana.  So I always call her nana and her last name was Cadogn, C-A-D-O-G-N.
Speaker 1: And did you ever visit Cuba with her or her family?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: And did you know anything about your grandmother's childhood or teenage or young adult years?
Speaker 2: No, you know we--unfortunately we didn't really discuss it, you know I, I really don't know too much about my father's side of the family other than the two sisters [Carmen Cutting and Olive Cutting] that he had and you know I'm very close with my one of my sisters--one of his sisters' kids now and you know we just talk about the family being in Barbados because there's some origin from my grandfather--the, the actual, the real--my dad's father that he was from Barbados so you know they're the Cuttings from Barbados and I have a lot of family there that I don't even know.  So you know my, my father's side my cousins tell me some stories.  Everyone is much older than I am so we tried to really, to really bond as much as possible and talk about the family so we could pass it on.
Story_ID: 628945
Speaker 1: So, first I'm gonna ask about your mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting] and then your father [Clement Cutting], but could you describe your mother you know, what was she like?
Speaker 2: My mom was a go getter, energetic person who loved people, she really took time to help a lot of people and her favorite slogan is, bye now, you know which is something that I, I understand becomes my trademark when I'm actually speaking to people on the phone or something is just always, bye now. You know that has stuck with me but always was working as a nurse, or you know just giving her last penny.  Same as my grandmother, she'll give it to anybody who needed help which has rubbed off on me.
Speaker 1: Was your mother at Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: No she was in Brooklyn Hospital when she retired, you know once we, we lived there, but my father on the other hand was really, he was just a, he was a very cool guy you know he was the, the smart dresser you know the, the upright kind of guy who you know even though they--after I was born they split up again, you know my, my mother and father, but we spent time together and you know I always regretted not spending enough time with him to really, to, to really get to know him, but you know I had those, those movies we use to go and some you know talks that we use to do and I use to go to his house every weekend, and spend some time with him but yet it was not enough so I can't--all I know is that he was, he was cool, he died when I was fourteen years old, fourteen turning fifteen. He had--he died of cancer and I, I missed him a lot, but you know the good thing about it even though he wasn't really in my life, the good thing about it is that I have those memories of him and it's helped me to be a better father with my kids, so you know I, I embrace him in saying thank you dad.  You know even though you weren't there for me you helped me to be a better dad for my kids.
Story_ID: 628946
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Of my dad [Clement Cutting] or--
Speaker 1: Of your life (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) of my life?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The earliest memory, I, I you know there, there's so many of them, but the one that I really like is being together in my house as a family for Christmas and I, I--my--one memory was I was about three years old and my sister [Diane Cutting] was like excited.  She's ran down the steps you know; we see all the, all the presents out and, and she saw her Barbie doll that she wanted to get and my brother [Richard Cutting] was excited 'cause he got the ten speed that he really wanted and me I had a little train set you know that I, I couldn't wait--it was a little battery operated train set that I couldn't wait to play with.  So they put it up for me and I remember that, and my dad was there and my grandmother [Grace Merritt], my mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting], we all--and my [maternal] great-grandmother [Anna Biggs], so we all were together and my grandmother made the best rolls on Christmas morning.  She always made these Christmas rolls so you know that's my--the smells and, and just seeing the happiness on everyone's face you know I can just still taste it.
Speaker 1: And is that configuration what holidays were generally like in your home?
Speaker 2: Always.
Story_ID: 628947
Speaker 1: Can we talk a little more about the menu?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we can talk, we can (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What else, what else was prepared besides those homemade rolls?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, oh, we had, we had some, we had some good slamming breakfasts back then you know.  We always had bacon of course, and we, we had grits and we had pancakes and we--eggs, you couldn't forget the eggs there you know and we had--besides these rolls that she [Cutting's maternal grandmother, Grace Merritt] made 'cause on Christmas she made the rolls with raisins and cinnamon and they were just homemade rolls that just melt in your mouth when you put them in.  You know what?  It's ironic but now when I go to India, they have these croissants that reminds me so much of my, my grandmother's rolls from back then.  It was great!
Speaker 1: Well just an aside, is your wife [Asha Shetty Cutting] from East India--
Speaker 2: My wife--
Speaker 1: --'cause based upon your grandmother's life it sounds like it kind of come full circle?
Speaker 2: You know what, it's, it has come full circle.  My wife is from East India, she's from, she's from--actually from the city that was formerly known as Bombay.  It's called Mumbai [India], so she's from there but her family's from another city called Mangalore [India], which is a little further south than Bombay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, we'll talk about that later (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Keeping with our organization (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 628948
Speaker 1: All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let's go back to your house.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: So you said you enjoyed Christmas the most, I'm, I'm gonna state that perhaps Christmas was your favorite holiday when you were a youth, and if you could talk about that a little bit and then maybe what the other important holidays were for the, for the year in your home?
Speaker 1: Well, Christmas was, and still is a very important holiday for me, but it--the reason why it was important 'cause it was a time of bonding you know.  We always had a live tree, we would all spend time to go out and get the live tree and then bring it home and decorate the tree and you know it was just a lot of excitement about that.  What kind of tree are we gonna get this year?  Is it gonna be a big one?  Is it gonna be a small one?  What, what is it gonna be?  But then when I was about six years old my mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting] decided, you know what, I'm tired of the live tree.  The needles all over the floor, I, you know I, I can't deal with it, watering it and everything.  So what she said, "Let's go to Korvettes [E.J. Korvette]--," which was right here in Manhattan [New York]--, "and let's go buy an artificial tree."  So I went with her.  I'm like, "Okay mommy I'll help you," and you know I actually went with her.  We selected the tree and I helped her carry the box and put it into the car and we bought some new ornaments for the, the fake tree but you know that was just, it was a lot of fun.  It's always been great the connection of family and the holiday.  The next holiday that's really was important for me was really Easter.  In my, my family we grew up as Catholics so you know Easter was a time of getting new clothes, you know dressing up and, and eating again, important you know eating good Sunday Easter dinner was important.  You know everyone use to make those typical soul food, like I told you that's my favorite, like potato salad and fried chicken and ham and you know we had the turkey and we had the rolls that grandma [Grace Merritt] used to make.  So we always had this every, every big holiday we would have this kind of southern cooking in our home.
Story_ID: 628949
Speaker 1: Can you tell me the names of your siblings and birth order and give us their names?
Speaker 2: Sure, my brother's the oldest, his name is Richard Cutting and it's R-I-C-H-A-R-D and then it's my sister after that, her name is Diane Cutting and it's D-I-A-N-E.  Richard is about sixty now and Diane is about fifty-five.
Speaker 1: So can you describe a typical day with you and your siblings and your folks [Russaloin Merritt Cutting and Clement Cutting] at home?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, let me--you know, I must tell you there's a ten year gap between my sister and, and myself.  Nine to ten years and then my brother is fourteen years.  So really my brother, you know I was so young.  I just remember when we were home we were all together and you know they use to take me out and play with their friends and take me to the library and the museums and you know out in the street riding bikes and all that.  You know it was fun, but I don't really remember too much because they were so much older and then they left.  My brother went to Vietnam you know, nine--when he was eighteen he went right to Vietnam.  He signed up 'cause he wanted to go you know be a part to help the America fight the war [Vietnam War].  So he went there and fortunately he's still alive and came back and then my sister she, at the age of nineteen when I was ten years old got married.  So she left the house you know I just remember her being the, the teenager the rebellious teenager and my mom saying, "No you can't go out," you can't do this, you can't do that, and you know them having those kind of battles back and forth.  They always would seem to work it out, but it was just always fun, the house--we never had a problem in the house.  There was no abuse, you know I'm, I can't sit here and start crying and start saying you know what my father hit me and my mom hit me and did this and that, no there was freedom and what was important was that there was freedom to learn, learn about people.  We discussed everything about people, black, white issues, gay, straight, didn't make a difference in my house you know it was just a house of love.  So we really, I have no problems about the past.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Has your brother talked at all about his experience in Vietnam?
Speaker 1: No, not really he's very, he's very quiet about that and you know he went to Iraq as well.  He was part of the--his National Guard, he was a unit leader and we really don't know too much about what my brother did overseas and I just know that he retired thankfully so about two years ago and you know he came home from Iraq and you know 'cause he was a little bit old to be over there but you know God was with him.
Speaker 2: Now you said your sister got married, who did she marry and how did that (unclear)--?
Speaker 1: My sister was married twice and the first--she met--it was a boy from the neighborhood who was a friend of my brother's and she always liked him, he was a little bit older.  He was the smooth guy in the neighborhood and they have a son as a result of that union.  They didn't stay married very long you know but then she met another man afterwards and then she was married to him for a couple of years, but he's very ill so they separated.

Speaker 1: When you were coming up you said you lived across from--no, that's your mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting] on 106th [Street].  Now you're in Brooklyn [New York].  Can you describe the house that you have in Brooklyn that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have the only beautiful brownstone.  We are the third owners, my wife [Asha Shetty Cutting] and I.  My mother was the second and there was a woman who lived there for the first I think sixty years and then my mom lived there for about forty years as the owner you know and then it's my wife and I.  So we've been there now as a owners of the brownstone for about ten years and it's, it has all the original marble, fireplace is in it, you know we have the original parquet floors, the original wood shutters we brought back out because when I was growing up they were painted over and you know just closed, closed up in the window and we made the house back to the original beauty that it was you know brought back a lot of the wood features in the house, just made it fresh.
Speaker 1: What's the block that the brownstone is located on?  What was that like when you were a child?
Speaker 2: Growing up it was a lot of trees and then all of a sudden somebody got the idea, I don't know who did it they cut down all the trees on the block but it's pretty much some of the same neighbors that I had growing up who still live on the block.  You know there's--it was more--when my mom moved there in 1952 she was the second black owner on the block.  It was predominately a white area and then throughout the '70s [1970s] it started changing and it went downhill and then it just came back up in, in the '80s [1980s] and into the '90s [1990s] and then now it's just a mixed neighborhood.
Story_ID: 628951
Speaker 1: So what sights and smells and sounds--you talked about this a little bit earlier--remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: The smells that--anytime I, I walk into a kitchen and I, I smell some rolls I think of Grandma [Cutting's maternal grandmother, Grace Merritt] right away.  I don't care if it's here or overseas or anywhere in my travels.  You know, I, I think of her.  One thing that my grandmother made that was really good was blintzes, Jewish blintzes then 'cause she use to work with a lot of people who were Jewish and they taught her how to make the blintzes.  She threw down on the blintzes it was great.  So I, every time I see that and then you know sometimes I go and I'm saying this is not good 'cause my grandmother's was better.  So you know the smells of bakery, you know cooking you know things like that remind me of my childhood, but the sights that really remind me of the childhood was anything that you know I see--like my mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting] and I or my dad [Clement Cutting] and I, we were walking down the street and I see other parents with their kids doing the same thing, you know I, it just reminds me of my youth 'cause it was--it's not that it was ideal but it was just that it was fun.  So I still remember that and you know fortunately within me I still have this youthful you know energy from the past, from my parents.  They always told me to stay fresh, no matter how old you are stay fresh and then you'll enjoy life.  My mom when she died she was seventy-seven years old, but she looked like she was in her like late fifties, early sixties.  You know my father he died when he was forty-nine, but he looked like he was in his thirties you know and so everyone had that youthful appearance to life so that's something that reminds me of the past.
Story_ID: 628952
Speaker 1: So you were talking about your mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting] some more I'm thinking about the--your trips to the museum.  What was the greater community of Brooklyn [New York] like?  Do you have a sense of what that was like?  You could just describe what you remember?
Speaker 2: What do you mean by the--
Speaker 1: What do you remember?  You were traveling to the museum so was there a lot of art in Brooklyn?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well you know.
Speaker 1: You know what was the racial atmosphere like, just sort of a (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I don't remember so much about the racial atmosphere growing up 'cause you know I was blind to it you know.  It didn't matter in my home what color you were and you know there was never any kind of like stereotypes like oh that, that white person I'm not going talk to them because they're white.  It was nothing like that, it was just more like, just learn to love yourself first and then you can respect others.  So we went to the museum and we went to the museum every Sunday or there was a different art exhibit or something, the American Indians [Native American], my mom wanted to share and say this is what's going on in the American Indians, you need to know about this and go see this exhibit, she would just take me--mostly to the Brooklyn Museum [New York, New York] because the Brooklyn Museum was where we lived but we also went to the other, like the Museum of Natural History [American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York] 'cause I was a dinosaur freak.  You know I wanted to always learn about the dinosaurs or you know see the different exhibits that they had there at the Museum of Natural History or the MET [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York], we would go and look at different artists as I got older, but younger it was really the Brooklyn Museum.
Story_ID: 628953
Speaker 1: And once your brother [Richard Cutting] and sister [Diane Cutting] left the house, did you feel like you were an only child?
Speaker 2: Nah.
Speaker 1: Or did you have a--?
Speaker 2: You know what I didn't even know what an only child was you know 'cause I always had family around.  It was always somebody there and I always had friends.  On--in the neighborhood growing up there was always kids on the block.  You know in those days we didn't have the video games, we didn't have all the--Nintendo to keep us occupied.  We had to go out and create our fun.  So for me it was going outside playing stickball.  You know playing skully with the, the guys in the street, going to the park and attempting to play basketball 'cause I was not good enough.  I was this little short fat kid who you know who wasn't that great with the other guys, but I still used to go play.  Ride my bike outside to go to the park you know.  I just had to be home before sundown.  Go outside and play.  You know during the summer there was camp but yet when there wasn't any camp I was outside playing with my friends.
Story_ID: 628954
Speaker 1: Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to, originally I went to school around the corner from my house which was called St. Teresa's of Avila [sic. St. Teresa of Avila School, Brooklyn, New York] which is pra- it was a Catholic school, private school then and I went from first grade to fifth grade, and then at fifth grade my teachers said, "Well you know I think you're a little smart you know so we're gonna send you to another school."  So I went to this other school called Robert F. Kennedy Incentive Program [Brooklyn, New York] which was a boy, a school for gifted boys and I went there from sixth grade to eighth grade and that's when I, I really got a sense of travel because every year we went to a different European country or Mexico.  So I had a chance to really explore and, and learn about different things but that was in Ridgewood, Queens [sic. Lindenwood, Brooklyn, New York], this program and--.
Speaker 1: Were you--so you were traveling from home how would you get to school?
Speaker 2: No, no, no I use to take the bus. I had to take two buses to get there from my house and going through all the different neighborhoods and you know seeing all the other kids and just had my head in my book and study and you know just have fun at the same time.
Speaker 1: Now at either of those schools your first elementary school or the school for gifted boys, did you have any teachers who particularly influenced you that you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In elementary school, yeah I remember there was this one teacher her name was Sister Alice [ph.], you know she was a big nun.  You know carried that big stick you know very disciplined, but she wrote something in my book saying that you know, he needs attention. And when she said that I was like, what do you mean I need attention?  My mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting] went there and said, "What do you mean he needs attention?"  What she was really trying to say is that she wanted to push me in my writing skills to make sure that I could be better and she was pushing me and helping me.  She explained it to my mom because she was the one who got me into the school for gifted boys.  She was really the impetus for it and then in RFK from sixth grade to eighth grade there was a brother who was a teacher.  His name was Brother Adrian [ph.] and Brother Adrian really he was a strict man who was like didn't take any, anything from any of the boys and he really helped to instill more discipline in me for my study skills you know, learning skills, we were--it was a school for independent learning and I wasn't used to that, so I had to learn how to be independent, so Brother Adrian really helped.
Speaker 1: And so what kind of student were you initially and what kind of--in elementary school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The one that just wanted to help everybody and talk and this is in, this is in sixth grade.  Just the talking one you know just wanted to be all over the place, but you know I learned how to be more disciplined.
Speaker 1: After Brother Adrian?
Speaker 2: Oh, Brother Adrian got on me, he was saying you know you gotta make sure that you do your work and then I would get these reports and say that you know, he needs to like focus, and I didn't like that 'cause it becomes, well this other guy next to me is doing pretty well how come I'm not doing well.  So it was just good, it was just good values and good discipline for me in that school to be there, and in elementary school I mean from first grade to fifth grade I really can't remember too much about that.  It was a little, little long time ago but really the sixth grade was when I really learned I have to be mature, I have to be focused and you know it was an environment where if you weren't, you were gonna get kicked out of the program.  And I didn't want to have--be kicked out of the program.
Speaker 1: So you were well behaved I take it?
Speaker 2: I was well behaved.  Yeah, I was very well behaved but at the same time you know I was still a young kid you know I, I didn't have the focus that a lot of the other students had in the program.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: Spanish, you know I didn't like math, you know I did well in math, I did well in English, every program you know that they offered but Spanish was my, was my forte I guess, and I guess one of my family roots 'cause at that time I could I speak to my [paternal] grandmother [Ethelyn Cutting] who spoke Spanish so that was, that was good for me to learn that and then years later I was able to switch to Italian very easy.
Story_ID: 628955
Speaker 1: And you said that at the Riverside--am I calling RFK [Robert F. Kennedy Incentive Program, Brooklyn, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, Robert F. Kennedy.
Speaker 1: Robert F. Kennedy school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That you did some travel is that where you went to Italy initially?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah well when I was in sixth grade it was the first time that RFK was doing any kind of overseas program, so I brought the paper home.  I never will forget it, the cost to go there and you know to stay for ten days, plus travel to Rome [Italy], Naples [Italy] and Florence [Italy] was five hundred bucks which was you know it was a lot of money back then, five hundred dollars plus I needed spending money.  So, my, my mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting] said to my dad [Clement Cutting], "You know what he needs to go."  And my dad said, "Yeah, he needs to go and I'm gonna send him, no problem," and everything was okay so.
Speaker 1: You're okay?
Speaker 2: I'm okay, yeah. Okay, so you know, "He needs to go." So I went but what was really good was that I had a chance to really go to Rome, and to really see exactly all the Vati- see the Vatican [Vatican City], see the Sistine Chapel [Apostolic Palace, Vatican City], go there understand what Michelangelo--at the age of twelve which was like phenomenal, and of course you know there was a lot of jet lag and you know we would take a lot of bus tours and the bus tours were you know I mean I was a typical twelve year old yawning all the time.  You know it was great to go see everything in that country and learn the language and my Spanish helped 'cause I was able to understand a little bit of the Italian and then see the stores and see the Valentino shops.  You know I always had this desire to understand fashion at an early age and you know to actually see some of the big designer shops there and I will never forget.  I liked shoes at that, at that age, I bought my first pair of Italian penny loafers and that like the world for me.  I, I spent like maybe like sixty bucks on these shoes.  I had them from sixth grade until I was sixteen years old 'cause you know I loved those shoes.  My first buy being there in, in Italy, but that was in sixth grade.  Then in seventh grade there was another opportunity to go to Europe so we went to England, Amsterdam [the Netherlands] and Paris [France].  So there was three, three countries there.  I couldn't pass that opportunity, my mom and dad said, "You gotta go, you had a good time the first year you know you spent your money well you didn't come back with--broke and you know bought us souvenirs, you thought about us--you can go again."  So it was great for me to go back there and just to see those three countries and experience that, and I was a little bit older and it was like I felt, yeah, chest pumped out, you know it was like I, I knew exactly you know what to expect in being in Europe and just the smells of the buses being different, the people working at different hours, the time change you know all of that at a young age was overwhelming you know.  Then the next year when I was in eighth grade--this time we decided not to go Europe.  So Brother Adrian [ph.] decided, okay we're gonna go to Mexico. And we went to Mexico City [Mexico] and some of the outlying cities within that area and that was great 'cause I got a chance to really use my Spanish that I learned so it was, it was good, it was a good time.  And that was the first time I had a chance to travel so frequently at such a young age that I decided that this is gonna be my life.
Story_ID: 628956
Speaker 1: So I was gonna ask about you about your dreams and aspirations at that time.  They involved travel, fashion and did you have any other or--
Speaker 2: I'm gonna go back.
Speaker 1: --did you wanna talk a little bit about those?
Speaker 2: Yeah I wanna go back to when I was six years old my grandmother [Grace Merritt] used to work in Washington, D.C., and it was for a black couple who lived--he was a lawyer and, and she was a lawyer and she use to live there as their, their maid and take care of their boys, and then she took me there one year for the summer and we took Greyhound bus.  I'll never forget this and you know we, we took the bus from New York [New York] and I was sitting on the window and I pretended it was an airplane and I said you know what, to myself, when you grow up you are gonna be traveling on airplane all the time. So I just kept you know made the sound, (makes sound) and never been on an airplane before that time but I just wanted to just imagine I was on the airplane, so that was my first time you know imaging that and traveling but then when I was ten years old my mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting] took me to St. Thomas [U.S. Virgin Islands] and that was the first time on an airplane and then at twelve you know having this opportunity to go to Italy, and then you know so on and so on, I just knew that, that was gonna be a part of life you know.  I just wanted to make sure that when I grew up it was definitely gonna be a part of me.  So now you know I'm just constantly on a plane, you know sometimes more than I would like but you know it's necessary for business.
Story_ID: 628957
Speaker 1: Where did you attend church when you were in--when you were a youth?
Speaker 2: My youth I was at St. Teresa's of Avila [sic. St. Teresa of Avila Church, Brooklyn, New York] which was right around the corner from where I live.  It was a Roman Catholic church--I went--at the time when I grew up you had to go to church on Sundays and they would take attendance, but then they stopped when I was about in second grade.  You didn't have to do that any longer, but you know I use to go to church occasionally but you know when I was in sixth grade we use to--I used to go sometimes to church, eighth grade.  High school I went to a Catholic high school, Christ the King High School [Christ the King Regional High School] in Queens, Middle Village, Queens [New York], and you know I would go to church occasionally and then there was a number of years where I was kind of separated and then when I--once I got married and had children I decided well you know I--since I was introduced to that world I think it's important for me--(cough) excuse me--to make sure that I stay in church, but I got bored.  So then I found a church because of some friends of mine in Brooklyn [New York] called Emmanuel Baptist Church and I'm an active member in the church now, I've been there for about four years and the family's very happy being there and you know we've reconnected so I'm, I'm now Catholic Bath- Baptist.
Story_ID: 628958
Speaker 1: What about junior high, did you consider the sixth to eighth grade the junior high period?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So we should move to high school now?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell us about your high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) High school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: High school for me was at a time when I first went there to the school it was a big campus.  It was--the school is called Middle Village, Christ the, Christ the King [Christ the King Regional High School]. Christ the King's the name of the school but it's in Middle Village, Queens [New York] and it's like a big college campus, it's huge.  There's a lot students who, who go there but in RFK [Robert F. Kennedy Incentive Program, Brooklyn, New York] it was only about thirty of us who graduated, if that many.  I think it was a little bit less, but then I was introduced to this big school where you know where there's much bigger people than I was and you know every year had about five hundred people in it and it was huge.  It was huge to me so it was a little bit overwhelming at first, and then there was--at the time they had a strike with the teachers there and they were gonna close the school so then I'm, I'm thrown into this situation, I wanna go to this school so badly, it looks beautiful, I'm just adjusting.  They're gonna close the school, where am I gonna go?  Fortunately they worked it out, I stayed at R- Christ the King and I became class president my sophomore year, freshman year it was still feeling out people and getting to know a lot of people but then I became the social man.  The school was predominately white but there was a huge black and Spanish students who went there, but mostly it was white and I, you know I just learned how to deal with people.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you have teachers who you remember--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) as influencing you particularly?
Speaker 2: I can, I can tell you there's a lot of teachers who really were helpful.  One teacher was Ms. Lawson, L-A-W-S-O-N and she was like really helpful because she was the Spanish teacher.  Again, you know Spanish and you know I had to take Spanish again and she was in charge of the National Honor Society.  So I became involved with the National Honor Society and we also use to travel again together.  My freshman year I went again to London [England] and Amsterdam [the Netherlands], and then the following year we went to Spain and then the next year we went to Paris [France] I believe, and then the following year we didn't go away because it was my senior year, as I didn't go with them but I went to St. Thomas [U.S. Virgin Islands] as my senior trip.  So it was still traveling involved in there and just doing things with the National Honor Society going to different places giving little speeches now and then about what the society did and you know what we were achieving so that was great for me and then another person who was good was Mr. Mulligan, M-U-L-L-I-G-A-N, and Mr. Mulligan was the cool--the cool teacher.  You know he was the guy who was the, the John Travolta of the time, you know Saturday Night, Night Fever ['Saturday Night Fever'], you know the guy with the, the cool hair and the, the big platform shoes.  Well Mr. Mulligan was really in charge of student government and he helped me get involved with student government because I ran for class president, my sophomore year--won.  My junior year, won and then for senior year I was running against a guy for school president.  I lost by five votes, five votes you know, but then I became class president.  So I was always involved in politics in school.
Story_ID: 628959
Speaker 1: And when you were in high school [Christ the King Regional High School, Queens, New York] did you start to realize that fashion was gonna be your future?
Speaker 2: It wasn't until my senior year and I had taken all my requirements and I took an art course, 'cause as I told you earlier, at the age of six I was always looking at fashion books and really trying to decide you know what I'm gonna do and looking at these books and try to copy everything and buying sketchbooks and keeping records of it even then.  I still have those records now you know.  I took an art course and when I took that art course in my senior year--I must tell you another person in my life was Ms. Scanlon, S-C-A-N-L-O-N I believe that's her name, Ms. Scanlon.  She was the art teacher at the time and you know I only applied to FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York], because I wanted to be a designer and Ms. Scanlon said to me, "You'll never be a designer, you'll never make it.  You can maybe be an illustrator."  Because by that time I had gotten the skills together to sketch pretty well you know do things like that.  "You may become an illustrator, but you'll never be a designer."  I said, "Hm, okay, thank you."  So you know she--, "Thank you Ms. Scanlon" helped me to really become a designer.
Speaker 1: When did you become aware of FIT?
Speaker 2: My senior year, you know that was it.  When you do the college tours and you really decide you know--you had to take the SAT scores and so, here's, here's the deal with the SAT.  So, here's, here's the deal with the SAT.  I did well on the SAT and Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] approached me to give me a scholarship to go to Princeton and you know which was a nice Ivy League school, and--.
Speaker 1: And you had not applied there?
Speaker 2: I didn't apply there, no.  But, however, you know when my, my family found out about it they were like, you're going to Princeton. And then I said "I'm going to FIT."  So you know my mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting] supported me, you know there was some little talk back there you know about people like why you wanna to FIT, you know, it's not--it's only a fashion school, you're not gonna make any money in there, blah, blah.  Anyway the bottom line I went to FIT.  The best thing I did was stick to my dream and just become involved in FIT.
Story_ID: 628960
Speaker 1: So what is the fashion world that you're--what's the fashion world like what's moving you in that bigger world of fashion when you're arriving at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York], who are you favorite designers?  Sort of what do you think you're gonna do once you get there?
Speaker 2: I didn't know what to really expect when I went to FIT.  I just knew that I knew how to sketch.  I went to my cousin's house, because you had to be interviewed before you were accepted in Fashion Institute of Technology, so I had to make a garment.  I had never sewed before in my life you know.  I was this typical teenager just like all thumbs and you know just all not together, but she taught me how to make this one simple black dress that I had sketched and that she helped cut out and showed he me how to put it together so when I got to FIT I wasn't aware that you had to do--really do draping, you had to do sewing you know, I thought I was just gonna be a designer to sketch you know become fabulous, you know just, just make all this money without knowing all these things.  I was a straight D student in sewing my first semester until the final project.
Story_ID: 628961
Speaker 1: So if we continue talking about FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York], you were talking about what you had to learn and I had just asked you about what was the cost of attending FIT like?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the cost to attend FIT was minimal because I was a New York State resident and you know fortunately I didn't have to pay those out-of-state fees for dormitory, and you know extra things that other people have to pay since I was a New York resident.  And I lived at home so that was a big saving for me to be there at FIT.  My costs were very minimal and I was fortunate, I did get some financial aid to go to FIT and be a part of their student, student aid program and you know I had a chance to get some money to, to work in the bursar's office or the different FIT fashion design office, so at, you know, a couple of days a week.
Story_ID: 628962
Speaker 1: And before you get back to talking to expanding your knowledge about designing, were there any black designers who either attended FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] or who did not who influenced you while you were there?
Speaker 2: This time you know when I went to FIT it was in 1979 right out of high school [Christ the King Regional High School, Queens, New York], and there was a lot of major designers there who influenced me.  At the time it was, it was Willi Smith who was really the pioneer.  There was Scott Banks [ph.], there was Scott Barrie, there were Kevin [Kevin Stewart] and Robert [Robert A. Miller] a little bit later on who was really instrumental and there was just a, just a whole--James Daugherty who was from the past who was really influential in my life, but the one designer, you know he wasn't black who really influenced me during that was Claude Montana, and Claude Montana was a leather designer, and in 1977 while I was in high school there was a whole resurgence of the new look I guess you can say 'cause Claude came out and he had the big shoulder pads and he would do a lot of thematic-type designs and that was interesting for me to look as not being a part of the fashion industry so I always wanted to grow up and be in the industry and, and again I would go back to my senior year in high school being the only place where I decided to take the art class and really apply to FIT, it was really because of that time of just really being--Claude Montana being really the focus of the industry at that time and he was getting a lot of press and I wanted to be like him.  I wanted to be like that designer you know--there was and I wanted to be like Scott Barrie and you know I wanted to be like--there's a, a furrier called [HistoryMaker] James McQuay.
Speaker 1: James McQuay?
Speaker 2: McQuay, McQuay, James McQuay who was really--these were people that were, were doing things in the industry, so.
Speaker 1: And McQuay had a fur--did you ever go to his fur shop in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I never, ever went there.
Speaker 1: Furs by James [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Never, ever went there but you know what now you know I, I'm involved as a result of Claude Montana doing a lot of leather and as a result of James McQuay doing fur.  You know so they, they really, the two of them really helped me.  They kind of f- they kind of like molded me to really be--you know to work in the industry now doing what I'm doing.
Story_ID: 628963
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that you had to prepare a garment in order to start your studies at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York], and that it really informed you about the many facets of designing that you would need to master, can you talk a little bit more about that?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you, I had no--not a clue what it was like to put together a whole you know construction of a garment.  I didn't realize how you had to cut it; how you had to get the fabric in one direction to make sure that it hung properly.  I didn't know that you had to lay it out a certain way so that if it's a texture fabric that it has to be lined up properly so you can get everything in the same nap or the same direction, I didn't kn- realize that.  I didn't know that there was fit involved that it had to be fitting somebody.  All I knew was that you had take an idea that you have in your mind, put the pen to paper and here.  So FIT was really helpful for that, for me to really understand about draping was like--my class where I had this one instructor who is still teaching at FIT now who is a good friend of mine.  Her name is Eva Nambath [Eva Bernard Nambath], N-A-M-B-A, B-A-T-H I believe or B-E-T-H, but Eva Nambath, A-T-H was--she was just always on it for fashion.  She taught--one phrase that she had and that stays with me forever is that, you should observe somebody from at least fifty feet away and know exactly what they have on their feet to their head and by the time they pass you, when you're walking down the street, you can--should be able to describe exactly what that person has on.  That was like, that was very important for me to know.  Then there was a black instructor that I had in FIT my second semester being there.  His name is Harvey Boyd [Harvey T. Boyd], B-O-Y-D and Harvey was an excellent illustrator, you know his work was featured in many museums.  He's, he was, he was just phenomenal and one thing that he said that will always stick with me 'cause, 'cause he was saying you know as a designer and it was you know as a black designer all you could think about from the church is you gotta have your matching hat, your matching shoes, your matching bag.  Think outta the box, put something different into the garment, so he was instrumental in helping me become a designer.
Story_ID: 628964
Speaker 1: And I skipped a question that I had--
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) earlier which was--you said you, you know Claude Montana, Scott Banks [ph.] and Scott Barrie were really influential for you, you said you wanted to be like them.  How were they?
Speaker 2: They were people who were very successful, they had their own company, they did their runway shows, they, they knew how to put together the collections to have some kind of theme to them.  They knew who their customer you know were.  Their profiles were really visible in the media.  People knew who they were.  I always wanted to be that type of person, working in fashion really to understand you know what it was to know how to put the collection together, how to make money, how to be a businessman you know.  I learned early on you just can't be a sketcher and just you know, just sit back and not know how to get the fabric, how to get the buttons.  Who's your customer?  All those things are very important for you in order to be in business and to remain in business so you know they, they did it at that time and Willi Smith you know he, he did it and he was one of the first few designers to go to India and produce garments from India and you know have it happen.
Story_ID: 628965
Speaker 1: So I always wanted to go to India because of Willi Smith, and I did have a chance, the opportunity to meet him, and lot of other black influential designers when I was at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] because I was involved in this program, the Harveys Bristol Cream award where you know that was like a, a--that was the highlight of my time being in FIT when I was nineteen years old I won this award, but as a result of being involved in school which took me back--I was involved in high school [Christ the King Regional High School, Queens, New York] in student government so I decided in FIT you know what?  I gotta do something and get to know as many people and network.  So there was a woman who's in charge of the Soul Club who was also a part of the fashion design department who's a black woman.  Her name is Clara Branch and B-R-A-N-C-H, she helped me.
Speaker 2: So just to clarify at FIT.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You joined the Soul Club?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And the Soul Club was the organization of students of color?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And is the Soul Club sort of the impetus for your entry into the Harveys Bristol Cream tribute award?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because and at that time they were--it was, it was a big show, Harveys Bristol Cream was saluting the black designer and there were about ten prominent black designers who were in the show.  I can't remember all their names but one that I remember was Kevin [Kevin Stewart] and Robert [Robert A. Miller] and they were--they became friends of mine.  They both are deceased now but they became friends of mine and they were sportswear designers and they were well known back then, like 1981 when they had this Harveys Bristol Cream award and there was also Scott Barrie who did the show and you know there was a lot of designers in the show and they had prominent models in there and [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll was one of the emcees of the show along with Gregory Hines, so and I had a chance to meet all of them and they there--they had some famous models in the show like at the time Mario Van Peebles the actor was a model, he was in the show and of course the, the person who wore my garment was Billie Blair, and Billie Blair was the fashion model along with Pat Cleveland who was also in the show who wore a friend of mine's outfit.  So they had, they about five of us as student designers who was involved in this show and when I entered the show I had no idea that it was a contest.
Speaker 2: Well can you just tell us a little about the show itself?
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm gonna tell you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You're saying that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna tell you.  The show itself it was, it was a show to salute the black designer.  Each designer who was well known in the industry showed their collection, okay. And they had the most--not the entire collection, a few pieces and then had the, the most famous black models, male and female at the time who did the show, and then you had Diahann Carroll who sang a couple of songs and she was involved in emceeing the show and Gregory Hines was there at the show and of course you had my--the best celebrity for me when my mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting] was there you know, she, she was there to see the show and just to--and you have my--me there with my other fellow students 'cause they had a--to, to--Harveys Bristol Cream was gonna select the most promising future designer.
Story_ID: 628966
Speaker 1: You said you didn't know that it was a contest (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't know, you know Ms. Branch [Clara Branch] said you know, "There's a show that you know is coming up at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York], Audrey Smaltz [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz] of The Ground Crew," who's still around now, "is involved. Do you wanna do it?"  I said, "Yeah, okay."  And she said, you know, "They will give you some money to buy fabric and it's up to you to create your own design, you know there's an evening wear theme to it."   "All right, all right, no problem."  I just did it you know it was just having fun but I knew I wanted to make it a little bit different.  Everybody else was making evening gowns and they knew how to really sew very well and for me I went and had a friend of mine who I--at the time I was working at Macy's [R.H. Macy and Co.; Macy's, Inc.] and her name was Ms. Trudy [ph.].  She was also you know she was a seamstress in the fashion industry but I didn't know where she--she was just my friend Trudy and she helped me make my hat.  I designed--decided to do a hat, a jacket and a pair of pants, evening pants and I did like a Moroccan theme to it and we had--we met on the eighth floor in the president's office of FIT.  At the time they had the student models who were involved from the Soul Club model the outfits.  There was a judge there, Audrey Smaltz was there, and a couple of other people were there and they selected my outfit as the one--as the most promising black designer for the time and I was shocked, I hadn't--no clue.  I just wanted to design it and make it hot, make it fresh you know and the night of the show Billie Blair wore my outfit.  So I was like on an eighth--nowadays it would be as if you know Tyra Banks or, or Naomi Campbell wore the outfit or Alek Wek you know wore the outfit for a student, but Billie Blair was phenomenal 'cause she was a swan walking down the runway, and she wore my outfit and we became friends after that and I gave her the outfit you know 'cause that as my Billie Blair you know who wore it and Pat Cleveland was in the show and she wore the outfit for a good friend of mine, his name was Alex [ph.] and she--you know it was just fun, it was, it was awesome.  It was great.
Story_ID: 628967
Speaker 1: Was this our first time meeting Audrey Smaltz [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz]?
Speaker 2: It was my first time meeting Audrey Smaltz.  Now prior to the night of the show or the judging of this, we had to meet Audrey to discuss about the idea of what the show was about and everybody who's involved and you know all these points.  So Audrey Smaltz was really Audrey Smaltz.  She was like bigger than life 'cause at the time she was you know involved with so many things in fashion and working with Ebony Fashion Fair and she was always the Audrey Smaltz. And one thing you know I, I--she always told us to call her, and I called her one day and she put me on hold and then I hung up and she called me back, and that was the best thing, she called me back and I felt like I was, wow, Audrey Smaltz calls me back!  And we, we've been friends ever since you know that.  She's always there to, to help me.  She doesn't realize that she's--that calling back helped me to be who I am now.  So, you know the night of the event it was, it was awesome because it was a lot of press that was there and I had a chance to make a speech and when I--you know I, I said, "Look out 7th Avenue, 'cause I'm coming." And that made the press and the made The New York Times. Look out 7th Avenue, he's coming.  A big shot of myself with Billie Blair and a proud mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting] is smiling you know, we all made the press there and then it was on radio.  I was on television doing certain interviews at the time and you know I was a nineteen year old kid you know just won an award and just made one statement and everybody was expecting me to do something but I wanted to finish school first, but what was interesting about that there was somebody who was there in the audience and he was--his name was Larry Platt [ph.], P-L-A-T--T, and Larry Platt had a personnel agency which really was a headhunter who placed a lot of people in the industry in different jobs and he remembered me from that because he approached me a couple of years later and asked me you know was I ready, once I was finished with school he would help me find a job and there was a job in Italy that I took as a result of Larry Platt, but there was other jobs in between that you know before I went to Italy as a--you know after leaving FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] but I'll tell you a little bit about that.
Story_ID: 628968
Speaker 1: So when you were at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] and your graduation is upon you, what is your plan, you know your rough plan for what it is you're gonna do once you've graduated?
Speaker 2: After FIT I traveled to Europe.  I went with a friend of mine and she and I went and we traveled around Europe and we to about sixteen countries and the money became very low, very low and then we had our Europass which allowed us to take the train and go to different parts, different counties you know at the drop of--second and we were young and got a lot of student discounts and hotels and so on, and then the money became low and we were--we stopped in Italy.  She had five snapshots of herself and she went around to all the top agencies--they hired her.  And I'm like, "Hey, you know I'm not gonna let you stay here without me," so I had five sheets of paper.  I learned how to say in Italian, "I'm a designer from New York [New York], I wanna show you my book," and if they didn't wanna interview me or for whatever reason, I asked, "Can I have two tickets to the show?"  So I had a chance to go see the fashion shows, but I got a job.
Speaker 1: Um which--just give us a smattering of the places you approached with your book?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah I went to--
Speaker 1: And some of the shows you went to?
Speaker 2: I went to, to show my book in Enrico Masei which I got hired as a designer.  I worked there for a while, I went to Krizia, I saw the show.  I went to Ferre, Gianfranco Ferre saw the show.  There's a company called Tommy [ph.] I saw the show, and Fiorucci, I saw the show and I don't think Fiorucci is around any longer but I went to the you know. I saw these shows you know and it was great to meet the people.  I didn't meet Ferre but I met his head assistant, and I oh, I went to see Versace and Gianni Versace was alive and he was there when it was time for my interview but he was gonna interview me but somebody else came in 'cause he had something else to do.
Speaker 1: So you went to work for Enrico Masei and can you tell us a little bit about that interview, did you tell them about your qualifications and they--?
Speaker 2: Well, you know let me tell you about that all right?  I went there and told Enrico Masei that I had worked on 7th Avenue before which was a little bit of a stretch, you know I was just at school and I did like an internship.  I didn't tell them I worked.
Speaker 1: FIT is on 7th Avenue.
Speaker 2: Yeah well FIT is on 7th Avenue but you know I, I worked for this designer on 7th Avenue at the time.  His name is Frank Masandrea and he was a dress designer.  It was fun working with him but you know I didn't work there, I just was there you know helping him file, maybe doing some sketching but it was, it was fun being there but--so she had me design her shoe collection and you know I just was sketching shoes like crazy, just designing, designing, designing.  She could tell I was fresh, but you know she kind of, she, she bared with it and she, she allowed me to be there, go and learn and there was four other design assistants who worked there as well and you know all of us were in one room and we were just--Enrico was the big diva that she still is, but you know it was a good learning experience for me to be there with her and the other four designers.  There was two from Japan and one who was from Italy and the one from Italy pretended to be my friend, but you know was the backstabber, so I learned early on you know what it is to work in the industry.  The two Japanese designers you know they were, they were good, they were nice.  You know one didn't like being there, the other one was there for a long time.  So I learned, it was a great learning experience, and then after that I went to another company in Italy as a result of Larry Platt [ph.] from when I was telling you before at the Harveys Bristol Cream award, you know I went there to a little town called Padua in Italy where I worked for Anna Scipioni and Anna Scipioni was a major design house for freelance where I had a chance to use all the skills I learned at FIT.  I did children's wear, I did knitwear, I did evening wear, menswear, you name it, I designed it and was great for me because I learned--there was a couple of other designers there from England from another school called Saint Martin's [Saint Martin's School of Art; Central Saint Martins, London, England] and they, they really are great there with their design skills so I learned how to, how to really open up my world and it goes back to what Harvey Boyd [Harvey T. Boyd] was telling me while I was in FIT, he said, you know, "You know you just can't have the, the matching hat, the shoes and the handbag.  You really have to know how to think outta the box."  So it was really what I learned making money.
Story_ID: 628969
Speaker 1: Who's influencing you at this time besides the people that you're working for?  You mentioned a couple of people who you admired when you were at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York].  Did you gain any designers that you were particularly fond of through your European travels?
Speaker 2: You mean like right now who is--who's influencing me or?
Speaker 1: No, I meant then?
Speaker 2: Oh, then.
Speaker 1: Like as you're expanding your skills?
Speaker 2: You know since I was there in, in Italy there was Gianfranco Ferre who I had an opportunity you know, if they would've hired me to work with Gianni Versace.  I had a chance to work with--they were really influencing because they were the major ones who were around and also Claude Montana.  He was back--I traveled from Italy to Paris [France] to try to get an interview to work with him, but it was really difficult to work then you know you're in Europe you needed special papers, and Italy was a little bit less--you know it was easier to work in Italy.
Story_ID: 628970
Speaker 1: So how long do you stay in Italy, and what do you do after--
Speaker 2: Well after working with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) your time there?
Speaker 2: --Anna Scipioni I was there--in Europe I was there for about two and--two years after FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] so it was like from 1983 to about 1985.  I was there in Italy, then I also went to Germany and worked in Germany in between, so for those two years, that's really where I you know I got good learning experience while being paid. And part of--I had a great apartment you know.  It was a small little apartment, it was a one bedroom you know nice kitchen, nice living room.  It was all furnished and it was, it was great because you know I, I had a chance to be on my own.
Speaker 1: And was it an inspiring town or just a region (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's a student, it was a student town and it's a lot of universities there so it was a lot of young energy there in the town and it was small enough yet big.  So I can really learn how to do things, it's right outside of Venice [Italy].  So you know on the weekends I use to go to Venice and you know Venice was like my backyard.  I knew exactly how to get around.  Once you get--take the train into the main station and go into St. Mark's Square [Piazza San Marco, Venice, Italy], I didn't take the water taxis and I knew how to take all the back streets and you know really go there and just have fun, in Venice, but then I use to go to Milan [Italy] a lot as well which is about three hours away by train and see all the, the major stores you know the boutiques, but Padua [Italy] was a small town where there was lot of fashion in the town, but it was just young energy, and I had my own apartment there and it was great, I was learning how to cook, you know how to do laundry.  You know meeting all the people and going to the florist, everything about a small town but didn't growing up. And the good thing I can tell you again is that you know my family, my mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting] came and visited me. Here she is in my life again you know she's always has been there 'cause she also wanted to travel, so she came and stayed with me for a short time.
Speaker 1: Well that was gonna be my next question actually was--did your family visit?  And what about your sister [Diane Cutting], has she made it to Europe?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my sister worked--she's been through Europe you know she actually worked for a hotel chain Loews Hotel chain [Loews Hotels] and they traveled, she--they sent her to, to France I believe, and a lot of the Caribbean and so she had a chance to go.  My brother [Richard Cutting], you know, he, he went to Europe but not the way that I went.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know only through war.  You know he's been to Germany and a couple of other places.
Speaker 1: Well I asked about your sister because I figured your brother had traveled here and also 'cause your sister was a little dismayed when you were twelve and you were getting an opportunity.
Speaker 2: Well you know it was not really dismayed, she just didn't like the fact that I was gonna be so far away from home.  That was really it, you know she was like, "Oh, he's going, that's a little far" (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He needs to come back.
Speaker 2: "And he's only twelve years old." You know so she was okay.
Story_ID: 628971
Speaker 1: How do you decide to come back to the United States once you've been in--
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: --and around Italy?
Speaker 2: Le- let's s put it this way, I was there Italy, it was great learning experience and I had a good apartment in Italy.  Then I went to Germany, I had a better apartment in Germany and this time at my job as an assistant designer for a company there, you know I had a car, a nice Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz], I was able to just travel you know--I was living the life, but you know what?  I wasn't getting paid, I wasn't making the money that I figured I could make being here in America.  So I, I figured you know once I was there in Europe and I went around and I showed some sketches and I could make a living then I needed to come back to America and try it.  So when I came back in 1985 I went to every single fashion building on 7th Avenue and Broadway [New York, New York], starting at the top, 'cause at those days you didn't have to like sign in the building.  It was not those restraints for terrorists and everything else.  I started at the top, I had, I had a portfolio of a few sketches that I--you know I put together from being away in Europe and I had my resume of where I worked you know and the school I attended and just went to every company and said, "Do you have work?"  "I'm a freelance designer," or "I'm looking for job" and gave them my resume.  Many times the, the person that they were--introduced me to would feel threatened, wouldn't hire me, didn't want me.  I guess I--you know either because I had European experience or I was a black male.  I didn't have time to find out and understand why they were questioning you know, why they didn't want to hire me but there were a few companies who liked my guerilla marketing technique and hired me and I worked as an assistant designer and it was great and one company hired me freelance called Philippe Monet and that was a leather company and that was in 1985 as a freelance designer.  For two years I really worked them freelance, but it was freelance full time and then they hired me full time and when they hired me full time I use to travel all the time to Europe, Asia, you name it, South America, all the factories.  I got all my experience for factories and you know just going overseas and shopping the market for new trends and you know I was a young guy and having a ball.
Story_ID: 628972
Speaker 1: So you've been talking about being with Philippe Monet.
Speaker 2: Philippe Monet?
Speaker 1: Philippe Monet.
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: And you did leather work there did you not?
Speaker 2: Lots of--it was really a leather company.
Speaker 1: Had you decided that leather was your niche at that point?
Speaker 2: No, let's put it this way, leather was something that I really liked, but I liked money and I wanted to eat.  So you know what?  It was a job and I really liked the fact of learning by going to all the tanneries in Korea, going to the tanneries in India and just re- and South America as well and I, I had a chance to really just learn something different.  So when I was in Europe, prior in Germany I worked with this designer, her name was Edith Sonanini, and Ms. Sonanini really showed in her collection leather.  So I got some experience about leather then so that took what I learned in Europe and I was able to come back and get the Philippe Monet job and then I just went from there and then the owners of Philippe Monet really--they taught me a lot about how skin is tanned and how you know you put together a leather collection.  It's similar to putting together a sportswear collection but I really just liked the leather because it was more of a niche market.
Speaker 1: And was this the impetus for your--jumping forward your business now?  Were you actually selling leather to some different companies?  Did you?
Speaker 2: Well you know.
Speaker 1: Gain your knowledge from this stage (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I gained my knowledge I mean since 1985 working in one industry primarily you know you learn a lot, so and I, I know that there are not many people in this part of the business that really do specialize in leather whereby in the women's market or the men's market everyone does sportswear or everyone does knitwear you know but or lingerie or something, but not many people are really into leather, and it's a real small amount of people--designers who work freelance and designers who really specialize in leather, so I really was happy that I was able to fall into it.  I kind of just fell into it and now with my business now you know being that I--it's been twenty-two years of working in leather, not the whole twenty-two years in, in just only leather but most of it.  It's, it's just natural you know, it's natural for me to really be able to sell leather, because it's part of my business now.  I'm fortunate to say that I'm able to sell leather to some of the better known leather makers for shoes, handbags and garments, and the leathers come from France and they come from Italy and, India and South America from all the contacts that I've met throughout the twenty-two years and I can even offer as a service now.  You know I can, I make garments for people as well.  So you know it's full circle, everything that I learned at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] you know from the beginning really understanding about the whole construction of garments to now you know, how to be a businessman, it's full circle.
Story_ID: 628973
Speaker 1: So let's talk--or would you please talk a little bit about establishing your own company, the Steven A. Cutting Incorporated [Steven Cutting, Inc.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Inc., sure.  After Philippe Monet, you know I was there for five years and the, the direction of the company it was going in a whole totally different direction.  The owner and I you know we were friends and we parted, and so I decided well at that time, you know what, I'm gonna start up my own company, Steven A. Cutting and just go for it, and so I went.  I, I just went back and started to design for a lot of people.  You know it's really--Steven A. Cutting was a design consultancy firm which really specialized in anything that was legal to make money in fashion.  So I mean I did shoes, working with some accounts like Reebok and Pony and doing sportswear for different accounts in active sportswear, outerwear, anything, knitwear.  I went back to my training for children's wear.  I just started working, working getting all these different accounts and building.  Then I met a partner, his name was Marlo McGriff [ph.], and Marlo McGriff he had a lot of contacts in the industry, and so with Marlo and I you know we just really set up an office on 6th Avenue, it's called The Vogue building [New York, New York] and we were there for a couple of years and we, we just really started servicing all these different accounts and hiring different designers to work with us on these different accounts.  I still maintained Steven A. Cutting, Inc. when I was in--with, with Marlo at the same time, so we just kind of joined our companies together.
Speaker 1: Could you just name a couple of the additional accounts, you mentioned Pony and Reebok, if you could just name some of those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kenneth Cole.
Speaker 1: --and then maybe name some of the designers that you hired?
Speaker 2: Okay, Kenneth Cole was like one of the major accounts that you know we started working with and I was actually the first designer to work with Kenneth.  I had the--I was fortunate to work with him to develop his outerwear collection for both men and women.
Speaker 1: And did you work with him personally?
Speaker 2: I worked directly with him and, and his right hand man.  His name was Paul Blum at the time so you know it was great.  I had to design the collection.  It was actually through a company that I worked for and the company was called Campaign Success was the name of the company and they had a line of leather garments called Collage [ph.] and Segments [ph.].  So I worked with them and they got the private label account to work with Kenneth.  So what that meant was that they, they were, they would approach Kenneth Cole and ask him you know can we use your name on our collection and sell it as Kenneth Cole, and as part of a private label--not private, part of a--what do you call it?
Speaker 1: Licensing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Licensing, yeah, licensing deal, so you know that's what happened, and that was, and then Kenneth had to set the tone, you know what he wanted, but yet I designed it and then  he'll approve it.  You know he was not hands on day-to-day.  It's really what I was designing and then showing him the collection, and him saying yes, no, or let's tweak it this kind of way, but it was great because I had a chance to really get to, to work and know Kenneth Cole.  So he was one of the major ones back then and then you had Pony and Reebok and Le Coq Sportif is another company that I was able to work with.  I can't think of any other names at the, at the moment but those were the highlight ones who really were out there.  But it was a lot of small little accounts as well.
Speaker 1: And did you have any--you mentioned that you hired some different designers.
Speaker 2: Yes, some of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Anybody worth mentioning?
Speaker 2: --one person that really worked with us that is phenomenal and she's a beautiful soul is Zia Amara [ph.], and Zia Amara was at the time was Donna Karan's right hand person.  She still works with Donna Karan now in some capacity and Zia Amara is--she worked with us on a freelance, and a couple of other accounts that we had doing some sports--some higher-end sportswear accounts.  So it was great to--she's the well noted designer that I'll hire--we hire, we hired a lot of people.  You know a lot of names escape me.  Brian Brown is another one who is a very good graphic artist who worked with us and a lot of people.
Story_ID: 628974
Speaker 1: So did you get rich and--
Speaker 2: No we ma- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) establish yourself financially with Steven A. Cutting Incorporated [Steven Cutting, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: What's rich, what's rich?  Rich is just a term you know.  We made money, yes but we had to pay everybody.  The bills you know were rising, you know the rent was rising, you know everything we made we put back into the company, we, we were doing well at one point you know we were really doing great, and then I had another partner who came in, who is an Indian guy and we started doing some things for Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.] and then at that time we really got stuck with Walmart 'cause we were involved in this embargo for these rayon skirts that came in and we lost a lot of profit and lost the company.
Speaker 1: No, we're at Walmart and you're involved in an embargo (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, Walmart okay.
Speaker 1: And so if you'd just tell us a little bit more about how that worked?
Speaker 2: Sure, you know what happened was that we, we had, we were fortunate enough to get this account, Walmart and we were doing these rayon skirts and we were producing them in India and then all of sudden, we got knocked out because what happened is that, at that time ray- rayon skirts were flammable.  They did some kind of testing on it and we didn't do the proper testing on our product 'cause we didn't, you know we just trusted the manufacturer so I learned--it was a great big learning experience and I had to close the company, lose a lot of money and start all over again and that's exactly what I did.
Story_ID: 628975
Speaker 1: But in the in-between time before I started Steve Cutting Inc. [Steven Cutting, Inc.] again I had the chance to really work as a designer for a company called Europe Craft [Europe Craft Imports, Inc.] and that was back in 1996 where I worked for Europe Craft and they had the license for Perry Ellis America.  So you know I was the guy that every time you saw Perry Ellis America, the jackets, anything that said Perry Ellis America, it was my design and I had a great designer who was my assistant.  His name was Cesar and Cesar--
Speaker 2: Will you spell that please?
Speaker 1: Sure, C-E-S-A-R.
Speaker 2: Cesar.
Speaker 1: Cesar, and it's--that, that was his name that he went by Cesar and he and I were--we were Perry Ellis America.  I mean we came up with all the graphic designs, we you know we had to always show it to the corporate office to get approval, but it was great to, to really be the designer for that with all the color blocking and the different size logos that we put on and to see everybody in America wearing Perry Ellis America and know it was your design, that was awesome, that was great.
Story_ID: 628976
Speaker 1: So I was there for a couple of years. And when the Europe Craft [Europe Craft Imports, Inc.] lost the licensing deal, then I had to leave.  So I left the company then and it was like what am I gonna do now?  So I decided to go back and do some freelance work and to really go and to sell myself as a freelance designer and I had gotten a couple of accounts and then I started Steven A. Cutting [Steven Cutting, Inc.] again, but at the same time I was looking for a job because in between I had gotten married.  I had my first kid [Taj Cutting] and, and I had my second kid [Rajan Cutting] and then I you know I had to make sure I--we gotta eat.  So I was fortunate enough to call a friend and I worked at First Manufacturing [First Manufacturing Co.]. And First Manufacturing was a leather company--again that was based out of Pakistan, so I was able to go and work with them for like a year or two.  It was really, it was very quick time before my friend, who was the president of the company, his name Paul Deutschman, and Paul he and I left the company and we went to Rothschild, S. Rothschild [S. Rothschild and Company, Inc.] and that was the best thing for me because I was able to develop menswear again to stay in the menswear market primarily, because prior at First Manufacturing I was doing both men and women and at Perry Ellis [Perry Ellis America] it was only men, but then I went back into the menswear market which was a good nic- niche for me because it was not that many people involved in it and I was doing coats, all outerwear and then one account that we had was Larry Levine, and Larry Levine is a major women's wear coat manufacturer but it's owned by S. Rothschild, so we did the menswear version of that and then we sold another label called Boston Outfitters, and that was all across the United States and it's still being sold now.  So I had a chance to do the two designer lines as well as do a lot of private label for a lot of stores, and, and again travel to Asia to put everything together.
Story_ID: 628977
Speaker 1: So while you're doing this traveling, in between do you meet your wife [Asha Shetty Cutting] during this period of time?
Speaker 2: Well, let--I met my wife.
Speaker 1: We need to hear that story.
Speaker 2: I met my wife when I had Steven A. Cutting [Steven Cutting, Inc.] the first time and I was--at the time I was really doing a lot of business in India, so I was there and this was back in the early '90s [1990s], 1992 to be precise, July 6.  I took a flight from New Delhi, India to New York [New York].  I didn't wanna take Delta Air Lines [Delta Air Lines, Inc.] 'cause my wife worked for Delta Air Lines, in fact she still works for Delta Air Lines.  I didn't want to take Delta Air Lines, I wanted to take Swissair but my flight was canceled so I had to take Swissair and I was very upset (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You had to take Delta.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry I had to take Delta and I was very upset because Delta had a small aircraft, and I wanted Swissair 'cause I wanted to take 747 and I wanted to Switzerland and see some friends, and bottom line I took Delta Air Lines, didn't want to take it.  I get on the plane, it's, it left at about 3:45 in the morning.  They all leave from India at that time you know to get in and the way it was scheduled you have to go to Europe and then from Europe to the states is a scheduling probl- scheduling, yeah, the way it is.  So 3:45 in the morning and the flight was empty pretty much because it was the first inaugural flights that Delta had taken over the Pam Am [Pan American World Airways] route, so I took this plane, get on the plane.  I have all these sample bags all over me and I ask, "Where's my seat?" You know and then I, I--the stewardess looks and--at that time the stewardess they're called flight attendants now.  The stewardess looked at it and she said to--, "It's the back with all the rest of the cattle."  "What, what's that?"  What's that about, in the back with all the rest of the cattle?  That's my wife being funny at 3:45 in the morning, didn't know it, it was all destiny that brought us together.  I took that flight, I sat in my seat, she showed me where my seat was.  I was drinking some champagne, a lot of it, and I was--told her my entire life history.  Who I was dating at the time, where I'd been traveling, what I was doing, everything 'cause I wanted to know this woman, something just said know, get to know this woman. And then I did the thing that most men would do, I lied to get her number because I told her that I would--I go to Bombay [India] all the time but she was actually from Bombay and the flight was coming from New Delhi.  So I said, "Oh I go to Bombay all the time."  Never had been before in my life, and I just wanted to get her number so I could can go see her again.  Well, the whole ten hours I told her my story.  She--you know it was not that many people where I was sitting so she--it was great and she--I had all her attention and after we, after the flight was getting ready to land she gave me the number, but she also gave me a letter to mail for her.  She opened the letter and showed me what it was in there and then sealed it right in front of me because it was to a friend of hers in New Orleans [Louisiana] and she wanted to make sure it got there.  If it--if I mailed it from New York it would get there much quicker than if she mailed it from India or from Germany where the flight was stopping where she had to get off, and so I mailed the letter.  I called her about two, three days after that and told her you know, "I mailed the letter, it was nice meeting you."  She had no clue who I was, and then, "This is Steven [HistoryMaker Steven A. Cutting] from New York," and she's like, "Oh, okay, okay."  Then we started calling each other, we started speaking to one another, you know a couple of weeks go by.  I have to go back to India, we meet and I say, "Let's go for a date."  I opened the door; you know she opened the door for you know to, to meet me we both had no idea what each other looked like.  We totally forgot. I forgot what she looked like, she forgot what I looked like.  So you know we went out on our date and then it was on that date that I told her, "You're gonna be my wife," and she said, "Yeah, um-hm, sure, sure, sure, sure."  So you know we, we went out we had dinner, we went to a disco, we you know we danced.  I liked her so much I was staying at the house of the people that I worked for, that--she was staying in the Holiday Inn.  I went and got a room at the Holiday Inn so just at the next morning I can meet and be with her so we can go out again.  So I did that, we had a great time.  It was wonderful, then about two weeks later we met in Delhi again, 'cause she had to travel to go to Germany and then she went back to Bombay, and then she went and came back to Delhi and then she went and came back to Delhi and then we stayed in Delhi for you know like a weekend, just having fun and then another month after that, we saw each other again, but this time she came to New York and she stayed with me, and we had a great time in New York, and then after that we saw each other--this is October, we saw each other in November, we met in California, 'cause I had an account I was working with in California.  So she flew to California to meet me.  Then we met in Germany, 'cause I had to go to Germany for a meeting, and then she came back to New York as--now it's Christmastime and we had a great time in New York again, and then I proposed right after New Year's, and then wait, the good thing about it is that we saw each other maybe once more after that in March when I introduced her to a friend of mine who was a wedding, wedding designer, we set the date.  She came she did the fitting, and then we got married in September.
Story_ID: 628978
Speaker 1: Now your wife [Asha Shetty Cutting] was from Bombay [India]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And does she come from a culture where marriages are arranged?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what did her family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She kept--
Speaker 1: --feel about your courtship?
Speaker 2: The bottom line is that she was waiting for me, that's what it is.  She was waiting for me and I was waiting for her.  No, in, in all honesty there they had set her up many times for these prearranged marriages but she kept saying no.  And so that was it, you know. I had to take that plane ride and just meet her and you know just go and--I didn't meet the family until the mother came--was the only representative from her family who came here in September 'cause we had two marries, one in New York [New York] and the other one in India.  So the one in New York was on me, and the one in India was on her.  So the one in New York, since I went to the Brooklyn Museum [New York, New York] as a kid so many times and I figured I'm marrying somebody from a different culture, I'm gonna approach the museum and have my wedding reception there.  I went there, I convinced them--they let me have my wedding reception.  We were the first ones to get married at the Brooklyn Museum, and that was great.
Speaker 1: So you got wed at the Brooklyn Museum?
Speaker 2: Well you know we had our reception there.  We got married in the Catholic church and my wife is Hindu so the Catholic church you know let us have the, the marriage in the church and her friends who were singers they sang the Hindu scripture in the church as part of the ceremony so we had the meeting of both cultures there which was great, and a lot of her friends flew in from India for the wedding and then my--only one from her family was my mother-in-law so I met my mother-in-law like two weeks before the wedding. She stayed with my family in my house and you know had a chance to really get to know that it's family living. And my, you know my family lifestyle is very much like the Indian lifestyle because I lived with my mom [Russaloin Merritt Cutting], my grandmother [Grace Merritt], my, my aunt at the time you know.  We all lived together you know even though I was always doing all this traveling and everything, it still was home base for me, so you know my wife in her society, you know her culture, that's what they do, the wife leaves her family home and go lives with the husband's family.  So it's the same kind of principle so it was just like she was leaving one family and moving to another family, so it was not really a big issue, as far as you know being Indian and me being black American.  It didn't matter--at first it did 'cause the only images that were on television were just rap artists with you know big gold grills, and you know big medallions at that time on TV.  MTV [Music Television; MTV] was on in India, you know they had and they just showed the videos. So they didn't know who to expect, they were like, "Uh-oh, my daughter's gonna marry this guy, uh-oh.  I don't know about that, we need to get a nice little Indian boy for him [sic. her]," but you know once they met me and they knew that I come from some good solid family values, it was okay.
Story_ID: 628979
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit more about your wedding which I understand was star studded and full of friends and important people in the fashion industry.  Can you talk a little bit about who graced you with their presence there?
Speaker 2: My buddies. Audrey Smaltz [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz] came to the wedding and it was other people who were there who you know, who were not so well known but they, they're influential in the fashion business.  Well a good friend of mine from Amsterdam [the Netherlands] flew in, his name is Arie, A-R-I-E- and is last name is?
Speaker 1: Arie Vervelde?
Speaker 2: And he's a noted illustrator there and a good friend of mine who's an actor, his name is Darren Johnson came, came to the wedding 'cause he was living in Europe at the time but he flew in, but he lives back and forth between New York [New York] and Europe.  So you know there were a lot of people who were there, but what was really important to me was that you know I had those who I wanted to come, came, and it was about 250 people and it was at Brooklyn Museum [New York, New York] in the Egyptian court [Beaux-Arts Court] and we were the first ones to, to have a wedding there and we were in this book called Vows, which you know highlighted our wedding as a result of The New York Times article that came out on the wedding which was great, because you know people are still talking about our wedding.  I want to tell you one thing that was really interesting was that my sister-in-law and my sister, my adopted sister who I have who I met while I was in FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York], Adrienne Jones, they made the wedding party dresses and I had my family involved in that and a good friend of mine who's an Indian designer, Suneet Varma, made the, the, the scarfs that went to the dresses and everybody was in pink and they'd all looked beautiful and it was great and then as they were coming into the church, there was a kid who was outside, said, "This looks like 'Coming to America'" so that, that was--the moving 'Coming to America,' so it, it was great, it was just it was just a lot of different people, different cultures.  People from Africa were there, people from Europe were there, people from India were there.  There were just people, all came together because we were--are citizens of the world.
Speaker 1: Can we talk a little bit about the menu?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: What did you serve at the wedding?
Speaker 2: We had, we had some Indian savories that were there like samosas (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Samosas?
Speaker 2: Samosas they were good, you know we had some chicken tikkas, we had American turkey, chicken, different salads.
Speaker 1: Did your mother-in-law do any of that fried chicken?   I assume you had it catered?
Speaker 2: No, we had it catered you know but you know I didn't know she was so good in frying chicken back then.  I didn't find that out until after a couple of other trips to her house afterwards, but we, we just had food that was just tasty.  You know food is very important in my life and my wife's [Asha Shetty Cutting] life because in her family, in India they had many restaurants okay and she comes from a community of restaurants.  Her last name is Shetty, S-H-E-T-T-Y, and the Shettys in India are known for their restaurants in the food industry.  So it, it's amazing, you know it is full circle that you know meeting her, liking food, having great cooks, having great food, It's all a part of one.
Story_ID: 628980
Speaker 1: So now you've had three children and why don't we talk now a little bit about your children?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us their names and talk maybe a little bit about their names?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I have three wonderful souls thank god for that because they, they have come into my life.  I don't know the real purpose yet, but I know that they're here for a purpose for something good, because each one is just great.  My daughter, her name is Taj, Taj Nicole [Taj Cutting].  We gave them first all Indian names 'cause we wanted to have culture and then we have the Western names, and so we combine the two together, so Taj which, which means something to be proud of as the Taj Mahal [Agra, India] and Nicole as your Western name and she's eleven years old, and then I have a son who's gonna be nine shortly, his name is Rajan Christopher [Rajan Cutting], and Rajan means kind and he has that, that domineering proud personality and then I have a younger son who's six years old and his name is Chetan Alec [Chetan Cutting], and Chetan means life and he's really full of life.  So each one has been given a symbolic meaning and they all live up to their standards, because Taj is really something to be proud of, she's a beautiful young lady, and Rajan is really king in his personality and everything that he does and Chetan is just wonderful 'cause he is full of life.
Speaker 1: Can I interrupt and just get you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: To spell those, it's T-A-J?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.  T-A-J is Taj, Rajan, R-A-J-A-N, and then Chetan is C-H-E-T-A-N.  Okay?
Speaker 1: Great, so returning to your career side you said that you reestablished--you return to Steven A. Cutting Incorporated [Steven Cutting, Inc.] and maybe we could start there--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and you can talk about on what you've been doing since?
Story_ID: 628981
Speaker 1: Before we talk about the reemergence of Steven A. Cutting Incorporated [Steven Cutting, Inc.], let's talk about your friend Kev- uh-oh.  I apologize.  Before we go back (laughter), let's talk about Steven A. Cutting Incorporated, the reemergence of that company; let's talk briefly about your friend Kevin Pinnock from FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] and your original company that you intended to establish called Pin and Cut?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Kevin Pinnock we met in FIT in college and Kevin was an excellent tailor, he was a menswear student, he did some women's wear and we wanted, we, we figured we have great names.  He's Kevin Pinnock, I'm Steven Cutting [HistoryMaker Steven A. Cutting] so we'll just do Pin and Cut.  We actually did a couple of fashion shows back then, we made money and it was good.  We wanted to develop it further but then Kevin and myself, before I graduated from FIT, we took a trip to Europe together with another friend of ours, her name was Gail Branch.  So the three of us went to Europe and this was in the summer of 1982 and you know before I went there and traveled with my other friend and stayed, the three of us went but Kevin stayed, so we never had a chance to really do Pin and Cut but he is still in Europe now and he has the only beautiful bed and breakfast in Majorca, Spain.  You know for about eight years and I really haven't been there--sorry Kevin.  I haven't been there yet, but it's beautiful and friends of mine have gone and other family members and you know they just said that it is a beautiful place, it has a nice pool and it's just the decor is nice and this old farmhouse that Kevin, you know he really put the special touch on everything.  It's all his skills from being a creative p- designer, you know he put it into his home and he's making money.  Congratulations!  That's my boy.  So Kevin Pinnock is doing very well and unfortunately we didn't have Pin and Cut, but you know he's doing something in fashion another way and I'm doing something in fashion this way.
Story_ID: 628982
Speaker 1: Which brings me back to Steve Cutting, Inc. [Steven Cutting, Inc.] and with Steve Cutting, Inc. you know reestablishing it after working at Rothschild [S. Rothschild and Company, Inc.] and working at Perry Ellis [Perry Ellis America] and you know a couple of other freelance gigs, you know now my company, Steven A. Cutting, Inc. is really devoted to working as a design consultant again.  One of my accounts is Jessica McClintock doing the suits for Jessica McClintock as a designer and then another one is to work with the Beyonce line which is House of Dereon and Dereon and I actually worked for that company as a design consultant for fur.  So anytime you see Beyonce in the fur, you see Steve Cutting [HistoryMaker Steven A. Cutting], which is awesome, 'cause you know I really like working with them 'cause it's fresh and it's innovative and, and it's--she's a beautiful person, but in addition to that I also am selling leather and I sell leather skins high quality and as well as budget quality for accessories, such as handbags, shoes and for garments and you know people I work with are like Andrew Marc, to name a few 'cause a lot of them don't want me to say who I'm working with but Andrew Marc is one them that's major and then shoes is for Nine West, and Bandolino lines, so that's pretty interesting for me to sell them some, some leather.  So you know it's been--that's been very successful, then in addition to that at Steve Cutting, Inc. I have the line Katalyst. And Katalyst is a leather line that's being sold primarily in the South which is--it, it hasn't been sold here in New York [New York] because I had reps in the South in Texas and also in Atlanta [Georgia] that cover those regions down there, and then I have another one who's here in New York but she really started late and she did get a chance to get a, a little bit of the product placed in Maryland.  So it's not really in this part of the country and I'm taking a little hiatus from that right now because I wanna reestablish the brand and make it more effective with styling and come out for a fall 2008. Then one more thing is that I have another line 'cause with handbags being so important and it's called Alan Cutting, by Steven [ph.]. And it's just a play on names and you know have Steve Cutting and it's another company which I'm developing now which is gonna be handbags and travel bags, to stores so that's really gonna be sold starting in, in January of next year.
Speaker 2: I just had a question about that southern market, you said you're in Texas and--
Speaker 1: Not only Texas (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) you said Georgia--some other states?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Where, where do you retail your leather?
Speaker 1: High end.
Speaker 2: Products there?
Speaker 1: High end stores yeah and specialty boutique.
Speaker 2: Like department stores?
Speaker 1: No, specialty boutiques you which is great so that they you know get a good value and a good price.
Speaker 2: And is there a different aesthetic for women and men who are shopping in the South for leather products (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well you know--
Speaker 2: --than perhaps in the Northeast?
Speaker 1: It is you know because the weather has a lot to play on it.  It has to be lighter weight leathers.  It has to be a lot of perforated treatments; laser type cut treatments to really sell down there because they need more ventilation than we have up here in New York.  So you know my, my style a lot of times is that it has to be light enough if it's not cut or anything because for women down, it's all in women's wear by the way, the woman down there has to have those great t-shirts (cough) to show, excuse me, and she wears the leather jacket over it.  You know she really wants to show her t-shirt, and jeans and so you know it's, it's primarily--I don't do any long coats for that market but up here in New York I have to do longer coats because we need it for the weather.
Story_ID: 628983
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about some of the things you do outside of your business like teaching and participating--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the Fashion Arts Exchange [Fashion and Arts Exchange].
Speaker 2: Can you talk to us about teaching at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: I can definitely talk to you about teaching at FIT because you know it's, it's a love of mine.  I went to FIT as a young student, didn't really know about fashion.  All I wanted to know is about how to be creative and you know just sketch all day but I learned about business there at FIT and I, I understood you know at that time there were many people who my instructors who worked in the industry.  So I wanted to--I never had the intention of going back to FIT to teach, but about eleven years ago at the opposite--the opportunity presented itself and I started teaching in the menswear department, just basic how to sketch and I liked that experience so much that you know I was transferred into the--another department the textile department and it was--and then from there I was teaching about leather, so everything that I learned by working out in the industry, I figure is a way of giving back to the students and then they had somebody who is current in the industry to really--they can just get first-hand experience you know, to know what it is to work in the industry, and then about maybe I think four years, five years ago I'm now in the fashion design department and in the fashion design department I'm teaching art and I'm teaching art for portfolio design, how to present yourself to the industry, how to get a job, you know how to--just how to be professional and through my years of just networking with so many different people and so many different companies, I'm able to place a lot of these students in work and I'm also able to take them to these companies for you know job inter- not on job interviews but just onsite, first-hand experience of what it is to work in the industry.  So you know they get an invaluable education.  I'm learning from them how to stay young and fresh all the time you know with my designs or just, just young and fresh energy around me all the time so it helps, and so it's a way of giving back, they give to me, you know I'm learning constantly.  I'm still staying fresh on top of all the computer skills that are out there in the market because when I started there was no computer, and you know now I know who to use all the computers, you know how to sketch on the computer.  You know later on I'm gonna show you some work of mine that you know being done on the computer and how to just be current 'cause the, the market is constantly evolving and as a designer either you're with it or you're out, and I intend to be here for a long time, so you know I wanna be up on all the new technology and all the new trends that are going on.
Speaker 2: Do you have any students that you might want to mention by name who you're--
Speaker 1: Yeah I got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) feeling especially--
Speaker 1: Lo- I got a lot of students who you know who are just special you know each one.  I gotta tell you even the ones that hate me because there's a couple that really don't like me you know for grades or you know they feel they didn't get what they got out of it.  They all were great okay, there's one, there's one student who worked with me.  Her name is Stephanie Oge, and you know she working in the industry now and you know I'm just proud of her and there's another one Karen Child [ph.] who works with you know a designer market now, and she's doing very well and there's Jasmine [ph.], I can go on and on and on and just name them.
Speaker 2: Will you spell Oge?
Speaker 1: O-G-E, and you know sh- there's just so many of them who were just so helpful and you know they work with me on a freelance basis.  You know sometimes I hire them to you know to handle special accounts and projects I can't really handle on my own I'll bring them in to help me, and then the new students I got, this semester I have--I'm teaching a basic class for people who are not in the fashion industry department, they're more in textiles or they're in fashion merchandising or pattern making.  So I'm teaching them how the design process works and how they have to put together the artwork and to how to really speak to people who are fashion designers and the technology and terminology involved.  And so I have three classes on one day and it's like seventy-five students on one day.  One class so you know I kind of forget what I say, but it's, it's fun and then another class I teach is portfolio design for, for one year students.  So that's a lot of fun too.
Story_ID: 628984
Speaker 1: So talk to me a little bit about the Fashion Arts Exchange [Fashion and Arts Exchange] and how you became involved in it?
Speaker 2: Yeah you know Fashion Arts Exchange was started by a woman, her name was Gwen Sargeant [Gwenveria Sargeant] and Gwen started this, this organization about fourteen years ago and it's really for people of color in the industry to network with one another whether you're a fashion design industry related with merchandising, stylists, fashion designer, except merchandise, doesn't make a difference or you're an artist and you are of color and so you--the two of us, the two industries would just meet and really network to help one another to get jobs, to know what's going on in the market, to salute people of color and recognize who we are.  There's really no organization like that, so we use to meet every week and then eventually Gwen decided that she was not--couldn't handle being the president.  It's not that she couldn't handle it, it's just that she wanted to do more things to make sure that she brought more money sponsorship into the organization.  So then I became president, and you know with being president of FAX we were--the first major event that we did was we highlighted, and we gave a fashion show for--and the proceeds, a portion of it went to the American Cancer Society for breast cancer, and that was just great as a way of us as an organization giving back.  Giving to people who need it 'cause it was a big production and we had the fashion show and we had some cancer survivors and it was at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] in the auditorium, we sold out.  You know the, the, the ticket fee was minimal 'cause it was our first event, but we were able to give after paying you know for the place and everything we were able to give about three thousand dollars which was great you know to the, to the--for breast cancer.  Then after that we did some events we, we started to highlight Naomi Sims, as being the first pioneer model, black model to be on the cover of Life and you know different magazines and, and then we, we honored [HistoryMaker] Geoffrey Holder, which was great.
Speaker 1: And you did that with HistoryMaker, Alfred Fornay [HistoryMaker Alfred Richard Fornay]?
Speaker 2: Yes we did, we did it with you know him and also [HistoryMaker] Leonard Davis.  Leonard Davis is a very good friend of mine (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He's also a HistoryMaker.
Speaker 2: Yes and he's a very good friend of mine and you know we work together even now on doing different events, in fact Leonard and I are doing this show in St. Kitts for fashion and that's gonna come up in October.  Okay, so we do a lot of--we did one last year, not Leonard but it was someone else involved and that was the first one and now this one is with Leonard and we're doing it for St. Kitts for the government.
Speaker 1: Well HistoryMaker Leonard Davis has been really instrumental in putting us in touch with yourself and a number of other people who are in the fashion, hair and makeup industry which has been fantastic.
Speaker 2: He's great.

Speaker 1: I don't know if we talked about Clara Branch who you indicated was one of your mentors at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] and instrumental in the Soul Club so I just wanted to talk about that now, and then.
Speaker 2: You know Ms. Branch, and you know even though Clara Branch you know she--I can call her Clara but Ms. Branch is--I have a lot of respect for her.  She has helped so many people in FIT who were of color, you to know to really understand what fabric is about.  She use to run the fabric department at FIT and she would give us a lot of fabric, she would--she knew everybody in the industry and you know she would, as coordinator for the Soul Club she'd put on this big fashion show every year usually during Black History Month in February we would have this big show, and it was just an outlet for us as students or people in the industry who--alumni from the school who would come back and do the show just for us to really understand what it takes to be involved in fashion and to put together a show and know how to do a collection and just really know how to--it all works.  Ms. Branch was just so helpful in just talking about how to put a button on, 'cause she also use to teach at FIT, sewing.  You know how to construct your garments so it, it hung correctly you know.  Also, she, she use to have his office there, it was a little bit messy and I use to say you know, "You gotta clean your office up Ms. Branch," you know but she was a lot of just fun and she was mother to everybody.  So her helping me back then has helped me now.  I still stay in touch with her although she's retired from FIT a long time now, but you know she was able to help me get into the Harveys Bristol Cream show, I won a couple of awards being involved in the fashion, the Soul fashion show [Soul Show].  It was just all motivation you know and just positive reinforcement.  So you know that's why Ms. Branch has, has played such an important role in my life and has helped Steve Cutting, Inc. [Steven Cutting, Inc.] develop 'cause I'm still constantly motivating.  I go back to school now, I remember one of the things that she used to say and I'm telling my students the same thing.  You know, stay in there, hang in there, you know you can do it.  There's room for you on 7th Avenue.

Speaker 1: Can you tell us about your involvement in the Gay Men's Health Crisis?
Speaker 2: My wife [Asha Shetty Cutting] actually got me involved in GMHC.  She works for Delta Air Lines [Delta Air Lines, Inc.] now still and she was one of the people to help put together Delta with--as a sponsorship to do the AIDS Walk [AIDS Walk New York].  So and then we have a friend of ours who was on the board at the time who I didn't know was on the board.  His name is Joe Steele [Joseph Steele], S-T-E-E-L-E and Joe--they had an opening for a board member of his and he's been telling me, "Please come aboard, please do it, do it, do it." So finally I met with people who are on the board and you know who are the development team for GMHC.  I was interviewed you know I had to go through the process of sending my resume in and just talking to them about why I wanted to be on the board, and the reason why I wanted to be on the board was because I think that the organization GMHC really helped so many people.  You know it, it helped so many people to live you know with this disease, HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] and AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome].  It helped so many people get over the stigma involved in having the disease or just about the disease in general and that's very important.  And as a person who, who's a human being, I feel I have a right--it's, it's my duty to really be involved, to help.  You know it's, is--this is life and death you know.  It's, it's choose life and I go there to the organization, the agency every week on Thursdays and I--they have a kitchen there and with the kitchen you know I go and I serve the clients, the food.  So I'm not proud, too proud you know to just go put an apron on and a hat, and some gloves and just help and say to someone, "Enjoy your meal."  That means so much for a person who really doesn't have a lot, who's ill, who you know if you can just smile at them and say, "Have a good day," that means a lot to them.  So I realized the value in it, as a human being and I just love what the agency is doing and I raise a lot of money and I help with other people to raise money for the agency.  It's a passion, it's something that you know it's important and I like giving back.  So that's my involvement with GMHC, you know we have a lot of events, we're doing out first fashion event in this year in November and it's gonna be great.  So it's called Fashion Forward and it's gonna be excellent.

Speaker 1: Can you just comment on--I mean you've told us about your career and would you comment on being black in the fashion industry?  Is it especially more difficult to become established?
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: Just your thoughts on such?
Speaker 2: I'm gonna just tell you this: I never thought that color would be a hindrance to me in, in this business because you know initially when I start, started in the business it was difficult to get in but I didn't let it be because I'm black you know.  I'm not gonna make it, I'm not gonna be involved you know and also I've always been a person that I'm gonna be out there in the front.  I'm gonna--I, you know I'm gonna learn how to play the game so I can be in the front.  I never wanted to be in the back room designing or just being in the backroom taking orders, you know I'm not that type of person so you know, has it helped being black?  To a certain degree because it helped me get into a lot of doors I couldn't get into if I was just another color or whatever, but has it stopped me from, from doing things because I'm black?  Yeah, it has but you know I never dwelled on it, so I, I, recognize it and I get over it, and you know there's certain jobs that I know it on the phone I'll sound like I'm white or you know something else and they hear the name Steve Cutting [HistoryMaker Steven A. Cutting] and then when I walk in, it's like, oh, hm. Yeah I could see the face just drop but you know what it's just, just like when I was in high school [Christ the King Regional High School, Queens, New York] and you know Ms. Scanlon said I would never, ever be a designer, I just kept going, kept rolling.
Story_ID: 628988
Speaker 1: As a fashion designer, do you think that there's a black aesthetic to fashion design?
Speaker 2: You know what there--you know as a, as a designer for me you know there's--I've worked here and I've worked in Europe and I see the difference between the, the European type way of putting clothing together and the American way of putting clothing together.  I won't say it's so much as a black and white issue, you know there--nowadays it's just a, a all across the board but when I first started you know there was definitely a European sense and the American sense and the American sense was just that it was just a little bit more basic compared to the European, but the way it is now everything is just, it's just everything.  You know you have all the richness here in America from all the young designers, whether they're black or white and then you have the European designers who are looking towards the American designers for influences and you look at the European designers look towards the black culture for and Latino culture for inspiration.  So you know I, I--not--I don't think there's more of a, a black and white issue for design, I just think it's more culture.
Speaker 1: I have a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Spice.
Speaker 1: --a little spice?
Speaker 2: A little spice, that's what I think.
Story_ID: 628989
Speaker 1: We always like to ask a legacy question at the end, and sometimes I hesitate to use the word legacy with our younger interviewees, but what would you like the mark that you leave to be here, when you do--when your career is over and you've completely settled down?
Speaker 2: One thing that I really would like the mark to be left is that he was a person who was able to give, always stayed fresh and understood that there was passion involved in the business of fashion.  That's so important.  You have to no matter what you do, whether it's in this industry or another industry you have to have passion for it to become successful.  I'm still achieving success.  You know each and every day I'm out there to work harder, to make sure that I just keep it moving, keep learning.  You know I don't think that I'll ever sit back and say I'm finished until the day comes.  So you know I, I don't intend to stop.  I just wanna keep going.

Speaker 1: So what's the difference between House of Dereon and Dereon?
Speaker 2: Dereon is more of a junior line and House is more of an upscale line.  So since I'm involved in furs, for the House of Dereon I would do like chinchilla and sable, whereby for Dereon I would use more of a rabbit that looked like a chinchilla or sable.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it's just a difference in price point and also in look and attitude.  You know of course with House of Dereon you have to be more grand, but, but and it's more funk is in the Dereon brand, so yeah I can also show you the difference in.
Speaker 1: So is this the board for Dereon?
Speaker 2: Yes, this is the Dereon type look here which is something that I was able to show Ms. Knowles, Tina Knowles, Beyonce's mom to get a sense of what the collections going to look like one grouping of it.  So this happened to be a London [England], Paris [France] 1960s kind of look.  Just to let, just to show a lot of the metal treatment, the charm bracelet, the type of chains that are over here, the cameos that they would like to keep it fresh and new type of button treatments or linings that we're gonna do with spirals inside there or any kind of these black and white feelings.  So this is just to give an overview for one look.
Speaker 1: You call this an inspiration board?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is an inspiration board.
Speaker 1: What else do you have to show us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, I have my bags, this is my--this is one of my bags for the new Alan Cutting, by Steven [ph.].
Speaker 1: By Steven.
Speaker 2: By Steven. By Steven, look it's made out of a skin from India.  It's a buffalo, it more of a pull-up type buffalo.  It's a beautiful bag and it's gonna be more wholesale in around $150 which is a good price point.  So I'm trying to work on it to make it even less or a little bit more.  I'm just doing some market research now to see where is it actually gonna be priced.  And then I just wanted to show you 'cause remember I was telling you about the technology involved in you know just learning to stay fresh.  You know this is something that was done for the Dereon brand and this is a--this is referred to as a tech-pack where I learned how to use the computer and then just put the technical part of the fur inside there and just to give it the whole idea of you know what the season is about, giving the style number and also different color ways for this design.  So this is something that you know is very current that most young students know how to do but you know in order to stay fresh in the industry a seasoned designer like myself, I'm not gonna say old--a seasoned designer needs to know how to do it to stay current, and then also I just wanna show you just my Katalyst brand a type of the leather that's involved--that's from India and it's, it's a type of look, it's a motorcycle type of look and it's a crinkle leather to have that worn look, but it was very popular so this is something that was able to sell in the South.
Speaker 1: And you--did you say this was Dereon?
Speaker 2: No, this Katalyst, this is mine.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Katalyst.
Speaker 2: This is Katalyst and his--the brand Katalyst.
Speaker 1: So this is Texas, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, down south.
Speaker 1: Southern states.
Speaker 2: Down south.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, that's it.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
