Speaker 1: Now, before we get started, I'm going to ask you what I call magazine type questions, like People magazine-ish type questions, okay?  Do you have a favorite food?  What do you like to eat?
Speaker 2: Seafood is my favorite, any dish that contains seafood is my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color, favorite color, I really never thought of it that way, but I guess brown would be my favorite color for me, and for ladies I lean very heavily toward pink.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: The--my favorite time of year is always the fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I like the leaves' color changes, I like the temperature, and the gentle blend and atmosphere of nature at that time.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, do you have a favorite place that you like to vacation?
Speaker 2: My favorite vacation would be anywhere near the gulf [Gulf of Mexico], down at Gulf Shores [Alabama], or anywhere where there is water and warm, sand and where I can be outdoors to enjoy the scenery and the temperature.
Story_ID: 466599
Speaker 1: Let's start with talking about your parents, okay.  We're going to start with your mother, if you would tell me her name and spell it for me?
Speaker 2: My mother's--her name was Willie Ann Sykes Carter.  She was born in Aberdeen, Mississippi, A-B-E-R-D-E-E-N, and came to Amory, Mississippi to live at a young age with her parents.  My father was George W. Carter [George Washington Carter, Sr.]; the W was for Washington.  He was born in either Tupelo [Mississippi] or Pontotoc, Mississippi, I'm not sure which, T-U-P-E-L-O and P-O-N-T-A-C-T [sic.].  My father was, I wouldn't say to what degree, but he had a lot of Indian [Native American] blood, and he, I understand, came to Amory to work at a young age and where he met my grandmother [sic.], Willie, and they married.  They had ten children, seven boys and three girls, and they married, as I understand, in 1910 there in Amory.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you father share any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: My father didn't talk much.  He was more or less the silent type, but he talked about how he came to be first a telephone linesman and later an electrical linesman, and that's what he did all of his life there in Amory.  He was with the city utilities people, and they took care of all of the electrical services and the electrical power services for the City of Amory.  A rather usual job of those years for a Negro, but he did work in that position all of his life until he retired.
Speaker 1: How much education did your father have?
Speaker 2: My father must have had somewhere less than high school education.  I never heard of him mentioning having finished high school.  My mother did finish high school because in Amory in those years when you finished ninth grade that was as high as public education was available, unless there happened to be a Rosenwald school, but in Mississippi there was a prep school at Holly Springs, Mississippi, called Rust College [Rust University; Rust College], and you could go to Rust College and finish twelfth grade, and my mother's parents sent her to Rust College and she finished twelfth grade there.
Story_ID: 466600
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your grandparents, your mother's [Willie Ann Sykes Carter] parents?  They were able to--did they have to pay for her to go to school there?
Speaker 2: Yes, they--the Rust College [Rust University; Rust College, Holly Springs, Mississippi] was a boarding school then you had to pay--I have no idea what the cost was.  But speaking of my grandparents, I was fortunate on my mother's side, I came to know my great-great-grandmother.  She was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was her name?
Speaker 2: --a hundred and four when she passed and she's buried there in Amory [Mississippi] at the only Indian [Native American] mound in that area.  She was of Indian ancestry.
Speaker 1: Do you know what tribe she was from?
Speaker 2: Choctaw.
Speaker 1: Choctaw.
Speaker 2: She was of the Choctaw tribe, and they said that my father's background was of the Choctaw tribe, and her mother, her, not mother, her daughter, Emma Dilworth, we all called her Granny Emma, and she was a midwife, and all ten of us she brought into this world.  And I lived to know her.  She lived there in Amory, and she was quite a person in her own being, quite known throughout the city because she was one of maybe two midwives in that county, and therefore everybody knew and talked about--everybody called her Aunt Emma, and when we started coming into this world, well, she was always there to make that delivery.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, do you remember, you said your great-great-grandmother, Emma's mother, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Margaret [Margaret Dilworth].
Speaker 1: Margaret.
Speaker 2: Yes, my great-great-grandmother's name was Margaret.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she was a Dilworth also?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you said she lived to be 101 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One hundred and four years old, she lived to be, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I didn't know on my father's [George Washington Carter, Sr.] side, I did not know much about his family, his mother or his father.  As I said, he didn't talk very much.
Story_ID: 466601
Speaker 1: I left home when I was fourteen years of age because I too had finished ninth grade and that was as far and as high as education went in Mississippi and those brothers, two of them [George Washington Carter, Jr. and Arthur Carter] before me had been sent from Amory [Mississippi] to Tuskegee, Alabama, to Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee Institute High School, Tuskegee, Alabama] to finish high school.  It was a prep school here in Alabama at Tuskegee Institute along with the college [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], and how my parents [Willie Ann Sykes Carter and George Washington Carter, Sr.] found out about it, how they had the whyfor to send us, I never have known, but every one of us did come to Tuskegee and finish high school.  Therefore, I did at age fourteen, I came to Tuskegee, ninth grade, and my three years of high school was spent at Tuskegee.  I lived in the dormitory and enjoyed all of the privileges and luxury that a student away from home at a boarding school would enjoy, but it also assured that when I was ready for college that Tuskegee accepted me as a freshman in college.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Before we get to high school, let's talk more about you as a younger--as a boy.  Talk to me about some of the things that you enjoyed doing as a young boy?
Speaker 1: As a young boy, vaguely I remember that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --my pleasures--I always liked baseball.  I played baseball, and other than that, up to the time that I got to Tuskegee I don't remember much of my life in Amory other than going to school and being at home with four or five other brothers and sisters until I was the senior one there and it was time for me to go--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to high school.
Speaker 2: Well tell me about where you lived in Amory?  Did you live in the city?  Did you live in the country?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Living in Amory, we lived in the city, did not live in the country, and when I say city, it was a small country Mississippi town, primarily a railroad town because the Frisco Railroad [St. Louis-San Francisco Railway] had a repair facility and a large depot there.  It was halfway between Memphis, Tennessee and Birmingham, Alabama, and Amory was known as a railroad town.  But as a young man growing up in Amory, things are real, real vague (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --as to what I was doing for those first--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --fourteen years.
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: Now, it sort of all starts with me in memory wise when I arrived here at Tuskegee in Alabama.
Story_ID: 466602
Speaker 1: Let me ask you more about your mother [Willie Ann Sykes Carter].  Tell me the type of mother she was, was she nurturing, was she the disciplinarian of the household?
Speaker 2: My mother was a darling of a lady; busy, busy, busy with all of those children.  She was a homemaker in a sense of the word.  She had all types of ingenuities and manners in which she could make things happen and stretch a dollar and do clothes, sewing and that type of thing.  I remember that vaguely in terms of the three sisters.  We boys didn't require much of that.  And she was also a religious person.  She played the piano for the church choir, and she was very active in the community for those things that at that time were of a community nature; tending and looking after the elderly people, the sick, the shut-in, and being very interested in the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] and the school and the activities there.  And sort of an all-around community type person that seemed to have been proud of whatever her status and position was in that little town.
Speaker 1: What church did you attend?
Speaker 2: We all grew up, grew up in the Methodist Episcopal church there in Amory [Mississippi], from Sunday school on through baptism and what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember your elementary school at all?
Speaker 2: I vaguely--elementary school, I vaguely remember my elementary teacher, a Mrs. Hammond [ph.], I remember the name, but details of life back in the first, second, fifth, sixth, seventh grade was, is very vague to me.
Speaker 1: Was the school in a church or was it a school building?
Speaker 2: It, school was a school building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a school building there in Amory, separate and segregated from the white school of course, but, and it had three or four teachers, as to some of the schools that would have maybe one or two, but it had three or four teachers as I remember, and it was only after--I left there in 1934 and I think after 1940 or so that they finally built a Rosenwald high school, and it went to twelfth grade because my last three, two sisters and a brother finished high school there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Who were your neighbors where you grew up?  What were their professions, the people around you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My neighbors, when I grew up the neighbors around me, they were all railroad people.  One family that lived across the street, that husband was a, what they called a fireman for the trains.  He rode with the train engineer and he kept the boiler, kept the steam pressures right because he would put in the coal, and he was the fireman for the train.  One neighbor near was a Pullman porter, and he worked on--with the passenger trains and he would go from Amory to Memphis [Tennessee] and Memphis to Amory, that was what they called his run.  And several Pullman porters, as I said, it was a railroad town and you either were a Pullman porter or a brakeman, a fireman, you worked as a section hand.  Now, those were the common laborers.  They were the people who maintained the tracks from Amory to Memphis and from Amory to Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were section hands.  They were out all day, every day in these section gangs putting down new track, repairing track, doing whatever it was necessary to keep it safe and operational.
Story_ID: 466603
Speaker 1: Pastimes for your family, you had a large family.  Tell me some of the things that you and your siblings used to do?  Did you listen to the radio?  Did you go to the movies at all?
Speaker 2: There was no movie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What we did for entertainment and what have you at home, we listened to the radio, we played games from jumping rope to hopscotch to whatever the games were of those days and times, I don't remember now.  But it was enough of us that we could keep each other entertained, even down to basketball.  None of us were any outstanding, but it was enough of us that you could have a basketball game with three or four on each side, and we did these types of things between each other and keeping entertainment up.
Speaker 1: What did you listen to on the radio?
Speaker 2: Oh boy!
Speaker 1: Do you remember?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: The radio, we listened to whatever was popular for those years.  I remember the Lucky Strike 'Hit Parade' ['Your Hit Parade'] was a popular program where every week, they would play the top ten most popular songs.  That was the 'Hit Parade,' and then they would have various artists like Cab Calloway and some of those other people who were famous in those years, Ella Fitzgerald, and those who would, had famous records, and they would play those and that's what you would listen to.
Speaker 1: What about soap operas, did they have any?
Speaker 2: No, I never (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Never listened to?
Speaker 2: --I never listened to those.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said your mother [Willie Ann Sykes Carter] played the piano.  Was anyone else in your family musical?
Speaker 2: She--all of the girls in my family, my mother taught them the basic fundamentals of piano.  None of them ever became a noted musician or anything, but they could play hymnals and songs out of a hymnal, that type of music, but just playing basic (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --things of music.
Speaker 1: What were holidays like at your house?
Speaker 2: Holidays at my house, what were they like?  Christmas was--early on we were aware of the fact--our parents didn't play games about Santa Claus and that type of thing, you--I knew early on there was no such thing as a Santa Claus and therefore I didn't expect any miracles for Christmas.  There was always some fruit and these types of things, but no big presents, that type of thing in my family.  This was just typical of my father [George Washington Carter, Sr.], he was a very practical, real down-to-earth person, and he didn't play games about life and living.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me one thing that you think that you learned from--one from your mother and one from your father?  Do you have a characteristic from either one of them?
Speaker 2: I think I have a characteristic from my parents.  From my mother I think I brought into my personality and life the real true value of honesty and truthfulness and good work habit, and I had the same with my father.  It was the same good work habit, and hard to describe, but you always felt a sense of things that were unmanly, and that's a hard thing to describe, but it, you carried it subconsciously with you at all times; that's not manly and I picked--got that from my father.  He was very masculine, and he believed in manhood and if you're a man you just didn't do certain things that were wrong, and I carried that with me in my life.
Story_ID: 466604
Speaker 1: So now at fourteen you head off to Tuskegee [Tuskegee High School, Tuskegee, Alabama], so tell me what it was like?  Was this the first time you are away from home?
Speaker 2: It was--when I came to Tuskegee at fourteen that was the first time I had been out of Amory, Mississippi, Macon County [Alabama] and away from home, and it was quite a shock.  I never will forget as I got on that train, tears running down both cheeks on leaving home, didn't want to go, and how, when I got to Tuskegee of course, I had two older brothers [George Washington Carter, Jr. and Arthur Carter] already here, therefore it wasn't as lonely as I thought it would be because they sort of put forth some effort to make me feel a part of life and a part of the community when I got here to Tuskegee, and quickly oriented me into what campus life was about and what it was like on a college campus as opposed to a regular community.  Things were more organized.  There was culturally more things for you to be exposed to, and you had an environment that offered so much more aesthetically, culturally and what have you that I had not been accustomed to.  So, it was a real, real adjustment for me.  It took several, several months to come to adjust to just a new type of life and living.
Speaker 1: Now this was in the beginning of--the Depression [Great Depression] started in '29 [1929], this is around '33 [1933].
Story_ID: 466605
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talking of--about the fact that this was during the height of the Depression [Great Depression].  Talk to me about how you felt about the Depression era in your, you know, during your time?
Speaker 2: It's always--the Depression was always sort of a mystery to me.  I would hear people talking about how hard and bad times were and all of those casualties of unemployment and what have you, but I was really unconscious of it in terms of personal experiences.  I never had a lack of food.  I never had a lack of clothing.  I never heard my family complaining about any particular hardships one-way or the other.  My mother [Willie Ann Sykes Carter] and father [George Washington Carter, Sr.], they were always very cautious of and sensitive to income and outgoing of money and anything else.  They were not spendthrifts and they managed well.  I'm sure this was the only way they were able to send all of us away to school, was that they managed their little income well, and so I didn't have the discomforts or the problems that so many people in America had during those supposedly Depression years.  And being away in a college certainly, you had three meals a day, you had comfortable sleeping, and you were in school all day and I just didn't have that discomfort of the Depression that so many people had.
Story_ID: 466606
Speaker 1: Now, you said it took you a couple of months to adjust to college life.  What was the hardest thing for you to get accustomed to?
Speaker 2: When I got to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute High School, Tuskegee, Alabama], it was a completely new culture, a new environment.  Amory [Mississippi] was nothing like this little oasis here in Tuskegee.  Academically it was so far above what I was accustomed to in life.  When they would have people like Marian Anderson and other celebrities coming to the campus to perform, when they would have other events for the entertainment and education of the students, it was just a completely new world for me that subconsciously I knew was out there, but I never thought that I would be so intimately involved and exposed to it as I was here at Tuskegee, and it just required some serious adjusting to be comfortable with many of the things that was suddenly available to me in a new lifestyle.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it took you a couple of months to get used to that new lifestyle.  Tell me some of the things that were new to you that you began to do, or that were open to you?
Speaker 2: Well I just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Besides the culture, I mean, did you belong to any organizations?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I didn't belong to--Tuskegee didn't have fraternities or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Well I know that this was high school.
Speaker 2: This was high school, but for example, here was a campus that had a completely equipped gym, and you could take swimming at an indoor pool.  I'd never, never seen one before.  They had gymnastics.  I had no idea what gymnastics was about.  You could play tennis.  I never had a tennis racket in my hand before.  You could go to chapel and they would have guest speakers and people like Roland Hayes and Marian Anderson, that to me were magical to the point that I'd read about them, but those people lived in New York, Chicago [Illinois] and places that I never dreamed I would even get to and suddenly here they are right here and I'm in their midst and, and this--that's why I say that Tuskegee is a little oasis.  It was a most unusual--here in the South in the heart of Jim Crow, and you had all of the cultural advantages that you could have anywhere in America.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your teachers?
Speaker 2: My teachers in high school?  Oh yes, I remember here at Tuskegee, I remember the high school principal, Neal Hereford [ph.].  I remember my English teacher, Willie Kind Davis [ph.].  I remember my biology teacher, history teacher.  I remember my high school track and football coach and those people just as if it was just yesterday, yes.
Speaker 1: Was there any one teacher that might have encouraged you?
Speaker 2: I don't point out any one teacher (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) One, okay.
Speaker 2: --it was a community effect.  Everyone impressed me with high standards of thought, expectations and examples of--by themselves.  And it was just something that coming from a small community, certainly less educated academically, it was just another different level of living and thinking and being.
Story_ID: 466607
Speaker 1: Had you decided what you would like to do in life while you were in high school [Tuskegee Institute High School, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: In high school I had not thought that far in advance in terms of what I wanted to be in life, but as I reached graduation, having been in this setting, I knew that I wanted to be a veterinarian, therefore, when I entered college I didn't procrastinate and waver.  I registered as a student in agriculture and I knew I was going to major in animal science and get my degree, and then I was hoping that my potential would be of such that when I applied to the school of veterinary medicine that I would be accepted.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduate--what year, 1941, from high school?
Speaker 2: High school, 1941.
Speaker 1: Okay and tell me what happens after graduation?
Speaker 2: After graduation, I went in September I started my college studies here at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] as a freshman.
Speaker 1: All right, and in 1942?
Speaker 2: I'm still a student (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Still?  Okay.
Speaker 2: --but in--now they have brought to the campus the opportunity that you could learn to fly as an extracurricular activity, and my interest again, was that would be good, I'll get my private pilot's license and as a veterinarian when I'm in practice in my profession in Texas or somewhere, I can fly from ranch to ranch and tend these animals.  And really enjoy both the experience of flying, and it would help me professionally and still I would be able to practice my profession as a veterinarian and be able to cover much more territory than I would be sitting somewhere in an office.  So I volunteered with that in mind for the Civilian Pilot Training Program to get my private pilot's license.
Story_ID: 466608
Speaker 1: And something else happens in 1942 also.  Tell me how you met your wife [Mildred Hemmons Carter]?
Speaker 2: Well, this same Civilian Pilot Training Program, and she was, my wife, now of sixty-four years, she was a freshman at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and she was quite active as I was in campus activities.  She sang with the choir.  She was a majorette with the band and just visible on the campus.  And we were attracted to each other and sort of, not in a serious tone, but in a rather social sense, such activities as dances and whatever was going on on the campus.  Periodically I would be able to invite her to attend with me and she would accept, and we did that all during our college life until her senior year, when she decided that she too wanted to go in the Civilian Pilot Training Program and earn her private pilot's license.  And I didn't give it much of a thought, it was just sort of a natural thing, and she as I expected, was successful in earning her license, so we're both now pilots.
Story_ID: 466609
Speaker 1: In the meantime, the draft board is saying to me, "We're going to induct you into the [U.S.] Army," and I did not see myself going into the Army as a private.  I felt that I had much more capability and much more to offer to my country than serving as a private in the rear ranks.  I felt that I needed and should serve in the [U.S.] military as an officer, and a second thought was, since I already had my private pilot's license, why not be a pilot?  So I volunteered for the Army Aviation Cadet Program [Aviation Cadet Pilot Training Program] in 1941.  This was my second year in college [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], and in December of '41 [1941], I got a letter saying that I was accepted, and I went into the cadet corps in January of '41 [sic. 1942].  Five months later I'm a second lieutenant with silver wings.
Speaker 2: Wow!  And tell me how you accomplished that?
Speaker 1: Well, because of my previous flight training as a civilian, I didn't have to take the pre-flight or the primary, which exempted me from about three or four months of training, and I went directly into what was called basic training, and then advanced and I got my commission.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So tell me what happens after you get your commission?
Speaker 1: After my commission I was assigned to the 99th Pursuit Squadron, and that was the first all-black flight unit in the Army, and of course this was July 1942, and we all thought that we'd be in combat by Thanksgiving because we had filled all the squares and finished all the tactical training, but we were not.  Christmas, we were still in Alabama and the problem was that no commander, white, wanted this all black fighter squadron.  They said they would create problems in their units, that the black officers socially would want to be equal to the white officers, and they were convinced that no white enlisted man would take an order from a black officer, so from Burma to England nobody wanted the 99th.  And it was Easter Sunday morning 1943, some ten months after we had been activated, that we arrived at Casablanca [Morocco], North Africa and was assigned to the desert air force and started our orientation and training for close tactical ground support there in North Africa.
Story_ID: 466610
Speaker 1: You had so many missions over the--from '43 [1943] for the next year and a half or so.  Tell me about some of those missions?
Speaker 2: Well, we--as I said, we started out combat operations in North Africa in April of 1943 and I, in the next fourteen months, I flew seventy-seven combat missions, 125 combat hours.  Normally, pilots were rotated back to the states after fifty missions, but in the 99th [99th Pursuit Squadron] our replacements were so slow that you didn't come home when you had fifty missions, you stayed until you got total replacement, and that's why I had to fly seventy-seven missions instead of fifty and stayed there fourteen months instead of about, normally about ten months.  And I flew the P-40 [Curtiss P-40 Warhawk] pursuit aircraft in close tactical ground support of the armies.  Our mission was to locate on the ground fuel dumps, ammunition dumps, motor transports on the highways, locomotives on the railways and any other targets on the ground that was supporting the German and the Italian armies.  And this we did in North Africa, Sicily and Italy up until January of 1944, when the Americans decided to reinvade Italy, some twenty miles below Rome [Italy] at a place called Anzio [Italy], and they changed the mission of the 99th from close tactical support to protecting the invasion fleet there at Anzio.  And in the last week of January, and the first two weeks of February, the 99th shot down seventeen aircraft.  This put to rest the myth that the black man could not fly and fight.
Story_ID: 466611
Speaker 1: Up to now the myth was that the black man didn't have the agility, the dexterity, physiological or psychological ability to operate something as complicated as an aircraft due to his birth heritage and his cultural background.  But these men there over in Anzio [Italy] including myself, demonstrated that race, creed or color has nothing to do with one's ability, if they are properly trained and given an opportunity to demonstrate their training, and this we did.  And as a result of that we now have three more squadrons that have been trained in America and they were sent to Italy, so we have the 99th [99th Pursuit Squadron], the 100th [100th Fighter Squadron], the 301st [301st Fighter Squadron] and the 302nd [302nd Fighter Squadron], and which made up the 332nd Fighter Group [332nd Expeditionary Operations Group].  Not only that, but we get a new airplane, the P-47 [Republic P-47 Thunderbolt], and we get a new mission, which was escorting long range bombers which were coming out of North Africa and southern Italy going into southern Europe, bombing logistical targets, oil refineries, manufacturing plants.  One mission was 1600 miles from Burma to Italy, Italy to Berlin [Germany], and back, to escort bombers who were going to bomb the Daimler-Benz tank factory there in Berlin.  And by now we're flying P-51s [North American Aviation P-51 Mustang], that's the Mustang that everybody fell in love with because it was a top-notch fighter.  And in escorting those bombers, the men were so good at protecting them that the bombers started referring to them as the Red-Tail Angels, and that was because for identification we had decided to paint the tails of all fifty-two--all seventy-two of those P-51s red and we were--our symbol was the Red Tails so the bomber pilots called us the Red-Tail Angels.  And by war's end, we had destroyed some four hundred German aircraft, 150 or so in the air, another 250 on the ground.  We had lost sixty-six men, another thirty-three had been shot down but taken prisoners of war, but we got them back after the war [World War II, WWII] was over.  The men had earned some 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, nearly seven hundred and something air medals and all other such type medals for their performance and proficiency in combat, and Colonel Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.], by now, had been promoted to a full colonel.
Story_ID: 466612
Speaker 1: When the war was over, the [U.S.] Army Air Corps, in 1947, became the U.S. Air Force, and in 1948, President Harry Truman [President Harry S. Truman] signed Executive Order 9981 that said, no more, no longer in the [U.S.] military will there be segregated units.  Segregation, he said, was ineffective, inefficient, dehumanizing and degrading and it was not to be a part of the military.  Therefore, the legacy of this group of men is that the antidote to racism is excellence in performance because it was that performance that influenced this decision by President Truman.  Therefore, by the time Korea [Korean War] started, we had an integrated Air Force.  And by Vietnam [Vietnam War], the [U.S.] Army and the [U.S.] Navy had pretty well integrated.  Today, we have in the military, the most diversified operational group of people that we have compared to the corporate world and to other businesses.  So, I spent twenty-seven years in the military; I did not get out at the end of World War II [WWII], I stayed in up until 1969, and I went into the jet era, and I therefore flew everything in the Air Force inventory from the J-3 Cub [Piper J-3 Cub] at ninety miles an hour, to the F-106 [Convair F-106 Delta Dart], that was the last aircraft in the inventory when I separated, and it was a Mach-2, 1400 mile an hour fighter inceptor.  And those twenty-seven years were wonderful.  Married after I got my commission in August of 1942 and I'm looking at sixty-four years now; that same Mildred [Mildred Hemmons Carter] that got her private pilot's license has been right there as my wingman and she flew up until she was eighty--seventy-nine years old when she had a stroke and couldn't pass the physical anymore; and always regretted that she came along too soon.  Because had she come along now, she could have gone into the Air Force just as I did, as a fighter pilot.  And she tells everybody that she would have been a better fighter pilot than I am, but we have three children, one girl and two boys.  None of them chose the military as a career.  My daughter is a teacher in Missouri near the Lake of the Ozarks, and I have a son that teaches paralegals in Virginia.  And I have another son that is in administration in Florida.  And when I came to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]--my last military assignment was here in 1965 until 1969 and I retired, and one week later I'm working for the university as associate dean for student services and for the next fifteen years, from '69 [1969] until 1985, I worked at Tuskegee University as associate dean for student services, admissions and recruiting.
Story_ID: 466613
Speaker 1: We kind of got ahead of ourselves because I want to go back to while you're still in the service, and I want you to tell me about some of the other men that flew alongside of you.  Tell me about some of your friends?
Speaker 2: Being in the service, or being in the 332nd [332nd Fighter Group; 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group] from 1940 to--until 1949, seven years with the same group of pilots, you really get close and come to know each other pretty well.  Your wingmen and the officers serving with you and the enlisted technicians and mechanics that are maintaining the aircraft and the other equipment.  And you get to be quite a close-knit group of people; so much so that we still meet every year in convention.  And of the few thousand that started off there are two or three hundred of us still living, all over eighty years of age and those guys like myself, when I did get the chance after the war [World War II, WWII] was over, I went back to school, but didn't break my duty, but performed my duty and continued my education and I got my B.S. degree at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] in 1955.  And when I came back to Tuskegee again in 1965, I went back to school and I got my master's degree in 1969.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, most of these men who made the [U.S.] military a career continued their education and their professional development to the point that they have served some way, somehow, in the civilian life in some professional capacity from lawyers to doctors to what have you.
Story_ID: 466614
Speaker 1: Okay, before we go further, tell me some of the names of some of the people who flew alongside you?
Speaker 2: As I was saying, being together for seven years as a squadron, as a group, you really come to know the people who you're serving with, and of course, the nearest to me are the members in my class, 42F, and not with us today because they have joined what we call the lonely eagle squadron, that's those that have passed, is Spanky Roberts [George S. Roberts], that's one of the most well-known.  He was the commander of the 99th [99th Pursuit Squadron] for a time.  He was the operations officer.  He was in the first class that was commissioned at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama].  He was from West Virginia State University [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].  Just two weeks ago I was out in Sacramento [California] and had a chance to visit with his wife [Edith McMillan Roberts] and daughter.  They are still living, but Spanky was quite a pilot and quite an officer.  And also one of his classmates, Lemuel Custis [Lemuel R. Custis], he passed last year, and he was in the first class.  He was quite a pilot.  He served as--after the war [World War II, WWII] he went back to the police department there in Hartford, Connecticut, and he served until he retired with them.  A very, good, good friend of mine, Erwin Lawrence [Erwin B. Lawrence, Jr.], he was killed in Yugoslavia.  He was in the 99th, and he was a flight leader of a flight that--always makes me sad to think about--he was a victim of--a casualty of the war, so to speak.  You see back then we were doing tactical low altitude work, and very unsportsmanlike the Germans would stretch cables if there was a valley, they would, at the top of the hill, they'd put cables from across.  If you'd come in flying low and flying, that cable it would just cause your airplane to somersault and hit the ground and crash and that's to me was just so unsportsmanlike--just wasn't the way you fight a war, but that's how Lawrence left us.  Still living today, former commander of the 99th, we called him Wild Bill Campbell, his name is William Campbell [William A. Campbell].  He grew up here in Tuskegee [Alabama].  His family, his sister is still here.  He was from Tuskegee.  He lives in Phoenix, Arizona now, but Bill had two sons, one son is still flying with the one of the airlines and he's--Bill was always a pilot's pilot.  Dryden, Charlie Dryden [HistoryMaker Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dryden], he wrote the book 'A-Train' ['A-Train: Memoirs of a Tuskegee Airmen,' Charles W. Dryden].  He lives in Atlanta [Georgia], and he tells a very good story about the ninety--about the Tuskegee Airmen and it's a very good book, you should read it, and he would make a good interview for you.
Story_ID: 466615
Speaker 1: Charles McGee [Charles Edward McGee], McGee, all of us admire him.  He had the highest number of sorties of any pilot (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of, highest number of--
Speaker 1: Of missions.
Speaker 2: Of missions.
Speaker 1: Yes, and he also flew in all three of the wars: Korea [Korean War] and Vietnam [Vietnam War].  And he was just--I don't know anybody who loves flying as much as he does.  And had no, no qualms and no fear about life and living and flying.  Therefore, much to the chagrin of his wife and family, he volunteered for Korea and for Vietnam.
Speaker 2: Did you fly in either one of those wars?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't.  Of course, Colonel Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.], the commander always, with every respect for him and his life and how he--as I read his autobiography, 'B.O. Davis American' ['Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.: American,' Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.], he talks about what life was like when he a cadet at West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] those four years, 1932 to 1936 and how was totally ostracized.  Nobody spoke to him during those four years, only on official business.  And he could not participate in any sports other than golf because he could play that game by himself.  And how they tried to break his will where he would resign from the academy, but in 1936 when 275 were commissioned at West Point, he was number thirty-five in the class, and he brought that tenacity and that determination with him to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] as an officer to learn to fly and become commander of the 99th [99th Pursuit Squadron]; so it's people like that--
Story_ID: 466616
Speaker 1: We were talking about Chappie James [Daniel "Chappie" James, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yes, I was talking about Chappie James.  He was our first black four-star general, and he earned his rank and recognition during the Vietnam--Korean [Korean War] and Vietnam War.  During World War II [WWII] he was a pilot but he didn't get into combat with us, and his first opportunity came during Korea.  And he had such a record of performance in that integrated organization and the same thing in Vietnam.  So much so that as I say, he reached the top of the rank among all officers because a four-star is the highest rank you can earn in the [U.S.] military.  And these are just a few of the many men of the 332nd [332nd Fighter Group; 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group] and of the [U.S.] Air Force that in my twenty-seven years I have come to know and men who have excelled in their performance (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 466617
Speaker 1: Now you talk about after the war [World War II, WWII] you go--you come back to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and get your B.S. degree and it was in--what did you get your degree in?
Speaker 2: Industrial education.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then later on you come back and get your M.A. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) M.S.
Speaker 1: M.S., I'm sorry, in, what was your degree in?
Speaker 2: Administration.
Speaker 1: Okay, administration.  So tell me about your positions between those years of getting your B.S. and your M.A., I'm sorry, your M.S., some of the positions that you, that you held?
Speaker 2: Well, we're talking about the years between 1949 and 1969, some twenty years' span there and that was--I was still on active duty in the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I served as--in addition to being a pilot in the Air Force, I was always in my secondary capacity as an aircraft engineering officer or maintenance officer.  And all of my duty assignments except the two times that I was at Tuskegee in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], were primary duty as an aircraft maintenance officer at whatever base I was assigned.  This was total responsibility for the entire fleet of aircraft on that base, and for their maintenance and the quality of their mechanical being was my responsibility.  It was awesome because you not only had to have the highest percent of them available every day for operations, but the quality of their status had to be of such that there was no danger of them causing an accident, causing the loss of a life, a loss of property or any of those things, so, you carried a rather heavy burden daily.  Responsible for some three or four hundred men, technicians, highly trained in aerodynamics proportion airframe, avionics, hydraulics, communications, armament, all of the auxiliaries of an airplane.  You had to be proficient in technical knowledge of their functioning characteristics and how they were to be repaired if they malfunctioned.  Therefore, every time there was the introduction of some new type of aircraft, and that was very rapid after Korea [Korean War] because we were coming into the jet era.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I spent an awful amount of time in school because you'd have to go back and get technical training in electronics, aerodynamics, in proportion to stay up to speed with what you were maintaining.  So, it was very demanding, a tremendous responsibility, but I enjoyed it because it included flying.  Because anytime these--this equipment received any heavy maintenance before it could be turned back to the unit for operations, it had to be test flown to determine if it was in fact, qualified and suitable in safety, and safe.  And this is where I got my greatest reward, was having the confidence in my people when they would tell me it had been fixed or repaired, was to show my confidence by getting my parachute and going out getting in it and flying it first and coming back and writing it as being okay and turning it back to the squadron as sort of a day-to-day guinea pig so to speak.  And I did that at Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base [Richards-Gebaur Air Reserve Station] in Missouri when we had F-102s [Convair F-102 Delta Dagger].  I did that over in Germany at Erding Air Station [Erding Air Base, Erding, Germany] when we started with T-33s [Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star] and had F and RF-84s [Republic F-84 Thunderjet].
Story_ID: 466618
Speaker 1: And then when I came back to the [U.S.] Air Force for four years, when I came back to America, I went to Texas for the jet upgrading for the Delta Wing F-106 [Convair F-106 Delta Dart] and then I went up to Loring Air Force Base, Limestone, Maine, as a project officer with that aircraft to determine its capability to operate in severe climatical conditions.  Because in Loring a minus-fifteen degree was a warm day, so to speak.  And we operated up there for some three years and that was my last operational assignment before I came to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] in 1965 for the Air Force ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] program.
Speaker 2: Okay, and you became a professor at that time for aerospace studies?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And that job called for the selection of young men and women for training in Air Force life and style and regulations and what have you.  So that when they received their degree, they also received a commission as a second lieutenant.
Speaker 2: And you do that until 1969, is that right?
Speaker 1: (Nods head).
Speaker 2: Okay, and in '69 [1969] that's when you receive your M.S. degree, and tell me what happens now?
Speaker 1: Then I was offered a position at the university as associate dean for student services and my responsibility was for recruiting and admissions.  And I was responsible for developing a program that would be attractive to our high school graduates throughout the United States and interest them, motivate them to want to come to Tuskegee to get a degree.  And of course, being able to look at their academic records and have some sense of their potential as to being able and qualified to do college level work.  So you looked at their academic as well as their standard scores, and all of the instruments that you had available to make that decision.
Speaker 2: Okay, and how long do you stay in that position?
Speaker 1: I retired in 1985.
Story_ID: 466619
Speaker 1: Besides working as an associate dean, I know that you visited troops, different troops.  Want to talk about that?
Speaker 2: Well that's what I've been doing primarily, just before retiring from the university [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and since retiring, since '85 [1985] up until now.
Speaker 1: Until now, okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: I spend my time trying to inspire and motivate our young people toward aerospace careers, giving them examples of success stories of people who did make that choice and who have done well in it, and what are the advantages and some of the spinoffs.  And then trying to help them prepare themselves to be able to make that decision by suggesting that they have to start at least by middle school and take their math and their science and stay academically active and involved if they are going to be successful in this life.  And then trying to stay abreast of all the opportunities that are out there for them to help them financially with scholarships and whatever else they might need to get into college, or to get admitted to one of the academies where it won't cost them anything.  And I get a great amount of satisfaction when I, four years from a date, see some young person that I know that I had something to do with their decision to, one, pursue an aerospace career and second, that they have finished, they have their degree and they have their rank, or they went to the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado] or they went to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York], and I influenced them in some way toward a [U.S.] military career.  And that's what I do now, for my own satisfaction and pleasure.
Story_ID: 466620
Speaker 1: Before we talk more about the many recognitions that you've received, is there something else that you want to talk to us about as far as the time that you--during the war, during World War I [sic.] and the 99th [99th Pursuit Squadron]?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, World War II [WWII] and the 99th Squadron?
Speaker 2: I don't think of anything that I have not mentioned that stands out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Maybe a mission that was significant in your mind?
Speaker 2: All of the--in terms of missions, they were, they were all, all seventy-seven of them were, carried the same amount of risk and danger.  Any of them could have been the last one.  There were no, as I call them, milk runs.  It was a serious business, I took it that way, as I did even when it came to test flying an aircraft to determine its operational readiness.  I took the responsibility that I was about to make a decision that I was going to say this equipment is okay and somebody was going to get in it with faith and trust in what I had said.  And it could be, if it had been wrong or careless, it could have caused them injury or life, and I always felt deeply responsible in that sense about my duties and my work.
Speaker 1: On the same token, at one point they did not want blacks to be a part of the Air Force [U.S. Army Air Corps; U.S. Air Force], really.  And then you became, as you said, an escort and a lot of the, the bombers, or most of the bombers, if I'm correct, were white, is that right?
Speaker 2: All of them were.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is it true that there was a time that they would request the 99th to be their escort?
Speaker 2: That's what we were told.  I can't say that I heard anyone do that, but we were told that there were missions on which they, the bombers crews would say, "Well, we want the 332nd [332nd Fighter Group; 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group] to be our escort for this mission because you have briefed us that there is going to be a high incident of interceptors and they will protect us better than anybody else."
Speaker 1: How, how did you make that feel--how did that make you feel, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Well, it came after the war so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was after, okay so you didn't even--
Speaker 2: --I didn't have any idea that was going on then.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 466621
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of the--some of your medals and recognitions that you received?
Speaker 2: Well, I received for my performance and what have you, I received the [U.S.] Air Force Commendation Medal for my operations in World War II [WWII], I received the Air Medal and some five clusters and that is supposed to have been for extraordinary performance in flight over and above what was expected of the normal.  And in July of nineteen--in July of 2004, I received the French Legion of Honour, and this was for the 332nd [332nd Fighter Group; 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group] and pilots therein, liberation, of working in the liberation of France during World War II.  I had already received the Yugoslavian Bronze Star [sic. Red Star of Yugoslavia] for the same thing.  And of course, we're expecting on the 29th of this month, that the 332nd is going to get the Congressional Gold Medal for their exceptional performance as a fighting unit during World War II.
Speaker 1: Are there any organizations that you belong to now that you want to talk about?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: I sit--I'm a member of the Tuskegee Airmen organization [Tuskegee Airmen, Inc.], and we meet annually to keep our efforts up towards the motivation of our young people toward aerospace careers (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 466622
Speaker 1: You are so involved in the youth program, actually talking to youth about becoming interested in aerospace, and because this interview will be seen by future generations, do you have a message that you would send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: My message to the future generations of America is: your life will be no greater than the goals that you set and the expectations you have of yourself.  Therefore, don't sell yourself short.  Have high aspirations, and always strive to be the best that you can be in whatever endeavor you involve yourself.  And the key to success in life regardless of what career you choose is going to be an individual thing for the person to prepare him or herself academically and professionally, and take no shortcuts and don't compromise any standards.  Always try to go for the best and the highest degree of performance and recognition that you can achieve in whatever you do.
Story_ID: 466623
Speaker 1: Do you have a concern or many concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My hope for the community today is that they stay focused and inspired to higher degrees of achievement in their lives and that they don't compromise themselves in any sense.  That it's too easy to take a lesser competitive approach, or to take a position that is not competitive, but instead, I want them all to stay focused and keep striving for all that they can be, the best that they can be at all times.
Story_ID: 466624
Speaker 1: Tell me, how you would like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's a difficult question, really, but to be honest with you, be remembered as [HistoryMaker] Herbert Carter, a person that had high hopes of--not only for himself, but for his fellow man, high standards, and I hope I didn't compromise any of them in day-to-day operations, it's so easy to do so.  And I hope that I have left something that will--somebody will take and be inspired or encouraged to imitate if such can be done.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I want to thank you very much for taking the time.  I know it's been a long day.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But, I thank you very much for taking the time to share your story with us.
Speaker 2: All right ma'am, sure (laughter).
Story_ID: 466625
Speaker 1: This is Herbert E. Carter [HistoryMaker Herbert Carter], me, nineteen years old, aviation cadet captain at Tuskegee Army Airfield [Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama].

Speaker 2: Different ones.
Speaker 1: Different people, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's Herbert E. Carter, fourth from the left.  We are at a debriefing in Italy, and that's the 99th Fighter Squadron [99th Pursuit Squadron] with different friends and pilots.
Speaker 2: Very good.  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: That's the 332nd Fighter Group [332nd Expeditionary Operations Group] staff with Colonel Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.], number one, and I'm number four, at Ramitelli, Italy just before one of our long missions.  Others--man next to Colonel Davis is our flight surgeon, Captain Johnson [Maurice E. Johnson]; next to him is Captain Elmer Jones [Elmer D. Jones], he's the service group commander; next to that's William Thompson [HistoryMaker Colonel William R. Thompson], he's an armament officer; next is Herbert Carter, aircraft maintenance officer; Erwin Lawrence [Erwin B. Lawrence Jr.], 99th operations, and my mind goes blank on the gentleman standing next to Lawrence at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's the civilian pilot training days at Tuskegee [Alabama] before I became a cadet.  That's Herbert Carter on the left with a friend, we both were in the civilian pilot secondary training course, standing near (unclear) at Kennedy Field in Tuskegee, Alabama, 1941.
Speaker 2: Very good.
Speaker 1: That's my class, 42F, part of it.  I'm number three on the top--number two on the top.  With Willie Ashley and Herbert Clark.  On the bottom row of four is James Wiley [James T. Wiley], Spann Watson, Graham Smith and Charlie Hall [Charles B. Hall], all of Class 42F at Tuskegee Army Airfield, 1942.
Speaker 2: Very good, description please.
Speaker 1: That's--standing before my aircraft I named Mike, after my wife Mildred, I call her Mike.  And that was in Capodichino in Italy [Capodichino U.S. Navy Base, Naples, Italy] in 1944.
Speaker 2: Okay, description here?
Speaker 1: That's me on my German BMW motorbike that we had gotten there in Italy with Rodney Custis [Lemuel R. Custis], operations officer, Bill Thompson, Lieutenant Thompson, the armament officer, admiring my new bike.

Speaker 2: That's Herbert Carter in Paris, France, July 19 of 2004, receiving the French Legion of Honour from the French secretary of defense [Michele Alliot-Marie].  To her left, you can just see part of his face, that's Governor McGarin [sic. George McGovern], he was also a recipient of that French Legion of Honour.
Speaker 1: Okay and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Governor McGarin--what's his name--Minnesota governor [sic.]--ran for president, McGarin, McGovern?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: And go ahead with the description, although it's probably pretty obvious (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's Lieutenant Colonel Herbert E. Carter, 1969, just before retirement at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], [U.S.] Air Force ROTC Detachment 15.
