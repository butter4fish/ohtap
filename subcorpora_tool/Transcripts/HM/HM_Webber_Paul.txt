Speaker 2: Clemmie Embly, E-M-B-L-Y, Webber [Clemmie Embly Webber].  Clemmie is C-L-E-M-M-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 7, 1913, St. Matthews, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: All right, now what do you know about her side of the family, how far back can you trace the ancestors on her side?
Speaker 2: I can go back to her grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what do you know about him?
Speaker 2: His name was July, as the month it's spelled J-U-L-Y Embly [July Embly], and he fought in the Civil War, he actually enlisted shortly before the end of the Civil War and when he died, having been a veteran of Civil War, his widow was among the first black women in South Carolina to collect a government pension because of his being a veteran of the Civil War.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know what unit he fought in?
Speaker 2: I do not recall.
Speaker 1: Okay and what area was he, do you know what area he was in when he was, when he served?
Speaker 2: I believe that he served in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, I know there were some units in South Carolina, too.  Are there any stories about the Civil War that come down from him or, or, Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: None that I'm aware of.
Speaker 1: There're often stories about how people got their last name or how they acquired land or, or stories like that, nothing like that?
Speaker 2: Nothing that I've heard about.  We, we did a lot of research to find out about his having served in the Civil War, and that was about as much as we were able to get.
Speaker 1: Okay, was he real young when he served?
Speaker 2: Yes, and he died at the age of forty-seven, he died before my mother was born and if there were stories that were passed on, they didn't reach me.
Speaker 1: Okay (pause).  All right, so now, what about the rest of the family, are there any stories from them about, you know, growing up in that part of South Carolina in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother's father [Henry Embly, Sr.] was one of the first students to enroll at South Carolina State in Orangeburg [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], he became a teacher and a carpenter, his wife Colin Embly [Colin Robinson Embly], enrolled at south Claflin college [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], the college next door to South Carolina State, she became a teacher and an insurance agent.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They had five children, four girls and I think my grandfather thought that he would not have a son, so he named the fourth daughter, Henrietta [Henrietta Embly] and then after that they had a son named Henry [Henry Embly, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay so we got Henrietta--
Speaker 2: Finally got his son.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 475985
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Clemmie Embly Webber] talk about growing up and what it was like for her growing up in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, she talked about moving from St. Matthews [South Carolina] to Orangeburg [South Carolina] when she was a small child and my mother eventually wrote a book ['My Treadwell Street Saga: From its Beginning to 1950'] about the street in Orangeburg in which they lived, Treadwell [Street].  And about the durable attractive homes that black people had constructed on Treadwell Street not long after the end of the Civil War and her book club was quite popular in South Carolina and a number of other places.
Speaker 1: Now what was unique about Treadwell Street?
Speaker 2: The cohesiveness of the people, the independence of the people, the business sense that many of them had in Orangeburg at that time, most of the trades people were black, most of the barbers, most of the carpenters, mechanics were black people and many of them lived on Treadwell Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And their children, by and large did very well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is like a lot of cities in the South, they had a lot of black professionals and the trades people lived, lived not, not too bad a fashion, I guess?
Speaker 2: That's right and they, served as role models and inspirations for those small children growing up around them, something that many black communities seem to be losing these days as people move out, and spread out.
Story_ID: 475986
Speaker 1: So where did your mother [Clemmie Embly Webber] go to school?
Speaker 2: She went to South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] from which she received a Bachelor's of Science, later a master's [degree] and then she got her doctorate at American University here in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Now what did she get her doctorate in?
Speaker 2: Science education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, all right so, she was a good student and all that I suppose, too (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I think she was (laughter)
Speaker 1: Yes, I would say so.  Now, did she have any stories about, you know, trying to pursue a higher education in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, not necessarily things that she told me, but things I observed, that she was a very hard working person, my mother and father [Paul Webber, Jr.] are both teachers and they opened a business called the College Soda Shop [Orangeburg, South Carolina], across the avenue from South Carolina State and Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] and they gave employment to many students, part time employment at the soda shop and my mother managed the soda shop while she was teaching.  And then, at the age of forty-three, when I was in law school [South Carolina State College School of Law, Orangeburg, South Carolina] and my sister Carolyn [Carolyn Webber Thomson] was a first year medical student, my parents had my younger sister [Sheryl Webber Washington], so my mother started all over again raising a small child and it was shortly after that that she came to Washington to pursue her graduate degree at American University.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she had her hands full.
Story_ID: 475987
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father and let me get his full name and the spelling of his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Paul Rainey Webber, Jr. [Paul Webber, Jr.], spelled the same as mine except for the junior.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 7, 1911, my mother [Clemmie Embly Webber] and father had the same birthday in different years.
Speaker 1: Oh, everybody's got a January bir- birthday so far?
Speaker 2: So far.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay so, so and where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Gadsden [South Carolina], same place I was born.
Speaker 1: Gadsden, okay.
Speaker 2: Gadsden, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now, what do you know about your father's side of the family, how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Only to my grandfather [Paul Webber, Sr.] and grandmother [Carrie Webber].
Speaker 1: Okay well who, what, what did they do for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was a farmer and he had stores.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: General merchandise stores.
Speaker 1: Had they had a chance to go to college too, or?
Speaker 2: No, my grandfather dropped out of school in the third grade, never returned.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories passed down from your grandfather or grandmother about, you know, tr- not, well I think it's interesting that they were store owners, you know?  That's like way, that's a way back, you know and, just imagine that there should be a story or two, how to be a black store owner in those days?
Speaker 2: Well my, my fath- my grandfather was a very good businessman even though he only had a third grade education, he was a whiz at arithmetic and he acquired quite a bit of land in Richland County, Columbia [South Carolina], the state capital is the county seat of Richland County, and he was a very successful business man and farmer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he ever talk about any, any troubles of trying to be a black business man in those days or?
Speaker 2: Well, he didn't talk very much, he was a man of action, he, he told me when I was a small boy, he said, "Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Webber] let me tell you something, God gave each of us two eyes, two ears, but only one mouth, so you should spend a lot more time listening and observing then you do talking."  And that was his philosophy, so most of what I learned about him was from others or from watching him, but very few stories did he ever tell.
Story_ID: 475988
Speaker 1: What did your father [Paul Webber, Jr.] say about growing up?
Speaker 2: He grew up in part in Gadsden [South Carolina] and then, because of lack of high schools in the area at that time, he went to Columbia [South Carolina] about twenty miles from Gadsden and attended Booker T. Washington High School [Columbia, South Carolina] and then he came to South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] where his oldest sister was a nurse, campus nurse, stayed with her and attended South Carolina State, he made all southern end on the football team and after graduation he went back to Gadsden to teach in a small school, after that, after about a year and a half, he was hired as a home, as a county farm demonstration agent in Aiken, South Carolina.  So the family moved to Aiken and then he was hired after a while in Aiken, he was hired to be the assistant football coach, and to teach economics at South Carolina State, so the family moved from Aiken, South Carolina to Orangeburg [South Carolina], where my father became a college instructor and assistant football coach.
Story_ID: 475989
Speaker 1: He [Webber's father, Paul Webber, Jr.] was involved in athletics for a long time, I guess, we just looked at the pictures before we started?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was assistant football coach [at the Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] for a number of years, he was, he formed a baseball, a semi-pro baseball team called the Orangeburg Tigers, right after the war and they played teams in North [North Carolina], South Carolina in Virginia, Florida and they played a lot of the negro major league [Negro Leauges] teams when they were barnstorming throughout the South, they would come to Orangeburg [South Carolina] and the Tigers had a pretty good record against teams like the Homestead Grays, the Birmingham Black Barons, the Atlanta Black Crackers, one of my favorite names, and the New York Black Yankees (laughter).
Speaker 1: So they had a good record against these, I mean they, they had a--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --they could hold their own against this, they could play (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They could, they could.  I think because they had two colleges there, and neither college at that time had a baseball team, a lot of talented young men went out for the semi-pro team and so I think the fact that they had so much talent there was attractive not only to the teams that they barnstormed against but to the fans.  So they drew a lot of fans until Jackie Robinson signed with the Dodgers [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers] and then when they cou- when fans could see Jackie on TV or hear the games, the Dodgers games on radio, the interest in semi-pro teams started to drain, and dwindle and the team disbanded about 1954, I think they started about 1946.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, was, was that an exciting time to be around when the teams?
Speaker 2: It really was, it really was.  I was batboy and traveled with the team, they had a bus that they painted orange and back with big tigers on each side and little towns throughout the South where the bus went through, the kids would always run up and cheer and anytime we had a team, that bus was a major attraction.  And just sitting on the bus and listening to stories being told by some of the players, not all of the players were college age, some of them were World War II [WWII] veterans, guys who had been around the world and had a lot of interesting tales to tell.  So, for a kid my age, around twelve to fourteen or so, it was an exciting time.
Story_ID: 475990
Speaker 1: Is there a story as to how your parents [Clemmie Embly Webber and Paul Webber, Jr.] met?
Speaker 2: They met when they were both students at South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there, is there a story about the day they met or, what, what happened?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Not that they told me, you know.  My, my parents worked hard and didn't talk a great deal about themselves, you know?  And I guess I was remiss in not dragging it out of them, because I'm sure their stories would have been interesting, but they just weren't people to sit around and talk about themselves very much, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, well do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have two sisters, no brothers.  My sister Carolyn [Carolyn Webber Thomson] is two years younger, she's a pathologist in New York [New York], my sister Sheryl [Sheryl Webber Washington] as I mentioned earlier, was born when I was in law school [South Carolina State College School of Law, Orangeburg, South Carolina], she lives in Washington [D.C.], her husband is Judge Eric Washington [HistoryMaker Eric Washington], who is the chief judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Story_ID: 475991
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Pause) For some reason, the first thing that I can remember is, picking up pecans off the ground when I was a little boy and someone threw a stick to knock some pecans off the tree and the stick came down and hit my mother [Clemmie Embly Webber] below her eye and that's, that's the first childhood memory that's vivid in my mind, yeah.  Things that may have happened before that time, I don't recall.
Story_ID: 475992
Speaker 1: You said the area of town that you all grew up in was--was there, was there a name to the, the part of town that you, you grew up in, in Orangeburg [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well Orangeburg, I spent most of my time on the campus [of the Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] when my parents [Clemmie Embly Webber and Paul Webber, Jr.] moved to Orangeburg, they stayed briefly in the home of another professor and then when housing became available for faculty, additional faculty housing on campus, my parents moved into a bungalow near the athletic field and I stayed there until, for a number of years.  And then my parents built a large apartment building with additional space for their living quarters in the building and we moved there about 1949 and that's where I stayed until I left Orangeburg.
Speaker 1: Okay--did the black community have a name in Orangeburg?  Do they, was it a certain side of town?
Speaker 2: Well, you kind of generally referred to it as Riverside, a part of town over near the Edisto River.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but not a great deal, you know?  Not a great deal.  Some people talked about Sunnyside or Riverside--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But, you know, generally we just used street names as opposed to neighborhood names.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, what were the main streets that ran through there that, that they were referred too?
Speaker 2: Russell Street--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --boulevard [sic.], College Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wilkinson Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 475993
Speaker 1: Now, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well growing up in a college town, a col- a small town, with two black colleges [HBCUs] there were a lot of sights and sounds I mean there were always activities, athletic or educational or plays that came to town, stage  programs that came to town, football season, basketball season, it was, there was a lot to commend itself to you.  And in a town where, at a time when segregation was strictly enforced, it was like a cocoon living on the campus [of the Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], or near the campus and you really didn't feel necessarily with a lot of the harshness that segregation required in those days because, you ma--where the gymnasium were, they let us go and play when the teams were not practicing or swimming pool that we could swim in, a lot of campus activities that made life much more pleasant that it may have been for people who, who lived in a town of comparable size but without the two colleges.  So there were sights and sounds, smells of fires, bon fires, before a football games, the soda shop [College Soda Shop, Orangeburg, South Carolina] that my parents [Clemmie Embly Webber and Paul Webber, Jr.] had, ice cream, hot dogs and hamburgers cooking on the grill, joyful experiences growing up in Orangeburg [South Carolina].
Story_ID: 475994
Speaker 1: What was your personality like would you say growing up?  Or what would people say it was like, was, was there a difference between what you were really like and what people said you were like?
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly what people may have said behind my back.  (Laughter) People seemed to think that I was a good guy to get along with, I wasn't very loquacious, I played in the band, I played tenor saxophone, and we had, I played in the marching band and we had a band that played for dances and junior, senior prom, so we made a little money on the side and I played on the baseball team in high school [Wilkinson High School; Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School, Orangeburg, South Carolina], tennis team in high school and football team my senior year of high school.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --so then, they would say that you were quiet and?
Speaker 2: Fairly, I think so.  I think most people would say that I was fairly quiet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, probably studious I would guess but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I mean?
Speaker 2: Some of the teachers might debate that but (laughter), I was a pretty good student I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who, who do you think you take after the most, your mother [Clemmie Embly Webber] or your father [Paul Webber, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: I guess my father.  My father was a person who tried a lot of different things, apparently my mother has too, come to think of it.  But, he was mercurial, he would, he would try one thing this week and next week he was on to something else and he got a lot out of life.  Hopefully, that's true about me also.
Story_ID: 475995
Speaker 1: Now, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Felton elementary school [Felton Laboratory School; Felton Laboratory Charter School, Orangeburg, South Carolina] that was a laboratory training school on the campus of South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], from there I went to Wilkinson High School [Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School], public school in Orangeburg [South Carolina], from Wilkinson to South Carolina State.
Speaker 1: So Wilkinson High school, now, now let me go back to grade school first--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, so you went to the lab school on campus there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, what?  Did you like school?
Speaker 2: I did not dislike it, I don't, you know, I wouldn't say I was, going to school was one of my favorite activities at that time, you know, it was something everybody did, so I did it, you know?
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have a favorite subject?  Or is there any particular subject that?--
Speaker 2: Well, in elementary school, I guess, I don't know if we started social studies maybe in the sixth grade, social studies probably.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, were there any teachers that were particularly interested in your development or served as mentors for you?
Speaker 2: An English teacher, and a social studies teacher in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They, at least they were teaching something, social studies, something I was really interested in.  An English teacher took it upon herself to try to improve my English by, by tutoring me after school and trying to help me grasp the fundamentals of English and I could tell by her enthusiasm, that she was really interested in what she doing and the achievement of her students, so that impressed me and I tried to learn as much as I could so I could impress her.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did, so was, was English harder for you than math?  Or, I mean for you?
Speaker 2: No math was harder than English--
Speaker 1: Was it?
Speaker 2: --I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 475996
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: It was a, it was an activity in which I was involved, I was for a while an altar boy in the Catholic church and then I decided to become a Baptist, I was baptized in the Baptist church.
Speaker 1: Now, so did your parents like, take you to church with them or did you, was this something you did on your own?
Speaker 2: Basically, I went on my own.  Benjamin Mays who became the president of Morehouse College in Atlanta [Georgia], back in the '20s [1920s], started at South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], and he had gone to high school at the high school that was a part of South Carolina State, and he came back every Easter Sunday, to South Carolina State to preach the Easter sermon, and I was impressed with him, that I think that was more responsibility he, even more than anything else res- responsible for my attending church.  My parents [Clemmie Embly Webber and Paul Webber, Jr.] were church goers but, I generally went by myself, you know, I'd go to Sunday school and in the evenings sometimes to bible studies, but I wouldn't say that I was an avid church goer, I was an average church goer I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you were motivated, well you, you were self-motivated to go, it seems?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now did you, were you involved in church activities or, you know where you would get a chance to do some leadership thing or another?
Speaker 2: Not much at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 475997
Speaker 1: What did you do for fun?  Did you like, well you played the tenor saxophone, so did you like music, did you like the radio, or?
Speaker 2: I liked music a lot and there were good musicians at South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] who, if they saw that a kid was interested, they would take an interest in the kid and teach, you know?  And so, I got a lot of free lessons from guys who were excellent musicians and so I was constantly bugging them, fellows who I'd knew to be very good, I would go by and get them to teach me something on the saxophone and that occupied a lot of my time in high school [Wilkinson High School; Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have a favorite musician?  'Cause I know that you grew up during a period of time where jazz was, well jazz was, it's more jazz on the radio then it was more popular (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not in South Carolina, but--
Speaker 1: Not?
Speaker 2: --on a good night, you could get 'Symphony City' [ph.] from New York [New York] on the radio and there was a 'Moon Glow with Martin' from New Orleans [Louisiana], one of those strong stations in, out of New Orleans, it played good music that I liked in the evening.  But at that time I, I started out playing alto saxophone because of Charlie Parker and then I switched to tenor sax and, you know, I kind of liked Pres and ['Pres and Teddy']--
Speaker 1: Lester Young?
Speaker 2: --Lester Young--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and guys like that at that time, you know?
Speaker 1: All right, that's an era where people, you know people don't often think about this, there's a ti- time when most people liked jazz (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But, you know.  So, did, did--were you allowed to play jazz in the school band?  I mean, they, they played--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know?
Speaker 2: We had a school band that played for dances and some of the music we played is like 'One O'Clock Jump,' something that we could get arrangements for, you know?  And, then we had a little band that, one of my buddies and I organized and we played a lot in the summertime for various commercial enterprises around, around the state.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  It was nightclubs, big parties, weddings and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 475998
Speaker 1: Okay, we're talking about music, we're talking about things that you liked to do growing up.  What else, did you, did you participate in class politics to try to get, did you try to run for office or anything or?
Speaker 2: Not in high school, I did in college and I ran, I got to be business manager at the college [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], you know, the student business manager and then I became, went into fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] and became dean of pledgees in the fraternity.  But I was not very active in politics at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what, what's the name of your high school again, you went to?
Speaker 2: Wilkinson [Wilkinson High School; Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Wilkinson.  Okay, it's a, was Wilkinson named after some black person in?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was named after a man who's president of South Carolina State, Robert Shaw Wilkinson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay now, all right so Wilkinson High School, that was the local black high school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Orangeburg [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, so did, did, was political science there your favorite subject?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Now we--were you influenced by your parents [Clemmie Embly Webber and Paul Webber, Jr.] to, I mean, how did, how did you get, a lot of young people are not interested in political science, but I just wanna know how you got interested in political science, was it the radio, or?
Speaker 2: Probably the radio and magazines and in my parent's soda shop [College Soda Shop, Orangeburg, South Carolina], they sol- excuse me--they sold a lot of newspapers and magazines and I read them, listened to the radio and, then I had a professor in college, Dr. McMillan [Lewis K. McMillan] who I thought was a very good professor and he kind of inspired, inspired me with his teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you have a favorite radio show that there was pol- politics and all in those days?  Or was it just news or?
Speaker 2: Well, in those days, I guess, Edward R. Murrow, I beg your pardon, and we didn't get a lot of news in Orangeburg, they would probably have five minutes of news on the radio, maybe fifteen at six p.m., but whatever they had, I would listen to.
Story_ID: 475999
Speaker 1: What about local politics there, black folks weren't really participating we--were they in local politics?
Speaker 2: Not in a big way, when we got the right to vote there were various impediments placed in the way, poll taxes and literacy test and all kinds of things that made it difficult to exercise the right to vote, and, so that came along gradually.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when, you came out of high school in '52 [1952], right?
Speaker 2: Fifty-one [1951].
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, now this is before, I guess the big civil rights push, you know right, I mean, wh- what were things like, I mean when you came out of high school, can you kind of describe me, I mean were there, were people talking about change, are they, what were they (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wa- they were starting to talk about change, there were a lot of veterans coming back [from World War II, WWII], black men who had been to France and London [England] and Paris [France] and seen the world and when they came back they said, you know, this is not right.  You know, before they left home, that may have been all they've seen, what they grew up with, but they realized there could be a better world and so, they were starting to, to become active in making change come about and you could feel that, you know, that level.  And one of them, a veteran named John Righton [ph.], a black veteran, applied to the University of South Carolina law school [University of South Carolina School of Law, Columbia, South Carolina], his application was denied because of his race so he, he filed a lawsuit challenging the denial of application and while the suit was pending, the state decided to build a law school for blacks, so-called separate but equal law school at South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] on the campus at South Carolina State.  So, things like that were happening and there were ethics by the state to prevent or hold back as long as possible the integration of races and there were actions by blacks to speed it up, so there was that tension that was going on in the '50s [1950s], the time that I was growing up basically in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  South Carolina I think is one of them, I think two states who, I don't know if they're both like this now, but there were two, two states at one time, I know where the black population exceeded the white, one was Mississippi and one was South Carolina.  Did, did you have a sense that there were more blacks than whites in South Carolina when you were living there?
Speaker 2: Certainly, I think in Orangeburg County [South Carolina] where I lived and in many other counties, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you know, in terms of shared numbers, but in terms of economic or political power we were kind of, almost infinitesimal at that time.
Speaker 1: For instance, like how many blacks who came out of Wilkinson High School [Wilkinson High School; Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School, Orangeburg, South Carolina] with you, I mean or, or were in the school, do you have any idea?
Speaker 2: I'm guessing, between three and four hundred probably.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's--
Speaker 2: In School--
Speaker 1: --kind of a small high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a small high school, probably in my graduating class, maybe forty.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They did, did they just come and take, take care of the City of Columbia [South Carolina]?  They didn't--
Speaker 2: Orangeburg [South Carolina]?
Speaker 1: --I mean, Orangeburg (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it's Orangeburg--
Speaker 1: --right, Orangeburg, sorry.
Speaker 2: --yeah, and many of their surrounding area--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from the county.
Speaker 1: Oh so, okay.  So that, so I would guess then a lot of pe- people were not going to school?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  And I'll tell you something else, in those days, the black schools would, the school year would end when the crops were ready to be harvested, whereas the white high schools, would continue on until maybe early June.  But if it was time to harvest a lot of crops, black schools were closed down so the black kids could go and do the harvesting.
Speaker 1: And these schools are state run schools, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So the, the white fathers of South Carolina decided when to close these schools right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And to benefit the agricultural economy of the state (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Story_ID: 476000
Speaker 1: So now, now your parents [Clemmie Embly Webber and Paul Webber, Jr.] were fairly well off I guess, we--you know and did, were, were they part of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?  And, or was there one in Orangeburg [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: There was, there was and they had to participate in activities in a very discreet way because the South Carolina legislature then, enacted laws that made it against the law to join organizations like the NAACP and many public school teachers, black public school teachers were fired because they were members of the NAACP.  So a lot of what my parents did, they had to do in a way that would not bring undue attention to themselves, you know?
Story_ID: 476001
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating from high school [Wilkinson High School; Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School, Orangeburg, South Carolina], what, what did you envision yourself doing?  Did you, did you know at, at, at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At that time I really did not, I really did not.  When I graduated from high school the Korean War had just started about a year and I knew I wanted to go to a college that had ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], you know?  (Laughter) That's about as much thought as I'd given to it at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Plus later on I learned that a lot of the second lieutenants who had graduated in ROTC, were shipped off to Korea and they were among the first to come back in body bags, so my planning wasn't really that good.  You know, thinking about going to the ROTC to be an officer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, second lieutenant was right out there on the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right out there on the firing line.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay so, tell me what were the activities--now, now did, did you go to prom and all of that stuff?  You, did you all have all those kinds of events?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had junior and senior proms, we had fraternity proms [through Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], you know?  We had a lot of social activities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so you basically stayed there in Orangeburg [South Carolina] and went to South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you want to go someplace else?  Did you ever say, well I'd rather go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I'd rather go to--
Speaker 2: Well, I thought about Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], Morehouse was really where I wanted to go, but Morehouse, Morehouse did not have ROTC, so I decided I'd go somewhere with ROTC.  There was one right there in Orangeburg, so that's where I went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Plus it probably saved my parents [Clemmie Embly Webber and Paul Webber, Jr.] a little money because children of faculty members, they waived the tuition, so that was a tremendous help to the family I'm sure.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  It's a practical decision--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But, you know it seemed like a good practical decision.
Story_ID: 476002
Speaker 1: Were you familiar with most of the teachers at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] having lived in the community and?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you the majority of them I probably knew their names by sight.
Speaker 1: That's quite a different experience than today, when our teachers don't live in the same community and we don't for the most part and, you know, we just, we don't know who they are or where they come from or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but you, you actually, you actually live in your community, you can see, you see 'em at teaching, you see 'em at the drug store, or wherever else--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, it's a--did you have a favorite professor at South Carolina State?
Speaker 2: I think Dr., Dr. McMillan [Lewis K. McMillan], who I mentioned earlier, he was my favorite, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: He was political science?
Speaker 2: Political science and history (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 476003
Speaker 1: Did you get much black history in those days, in school?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, you know, in those days, we would have, it was Negro History Week [Black History Month] at that time, but that was just a, sort of a launching pad, we would build up to it, we'd start preparing for Negro History Week in September and build up to it and then after Negro History Week, we'd analyze and, and restudy all that we'd focused on during Negro History Week.  So, we did not have a class that was called Negro History per se, but the good teachers always wove it into the history that they were teaching, the regular United Stated history, Dr. McMillan [Lewis K. McMillan] for example, would use a textbook which was the history it's written by the majority folk and then he would look at the impact of what we were studying, the black population at that time.  So, we got a dual history lesson which I appreciated very much, you know?  But, no this was before the days when Negro history per se is a class, at least at my university, that's a, we had no such class by that name.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I said university, South Carolina State [South Carolina State College] changed the name to South Carolina University [sic.] after I graduated but that is now the name of it, South Carolina State University [Orangeburg, South Carolina] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, it was South Carolina State--
Speaker 2: State College then.
Speaker 1: --College? Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 476004
Speaker 1: So you were there for four years, now you joined a, you joined a, a fraternity right, in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --college [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you said you ran for a position--
Speaker 2: Well I was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was the guy who kind of indoctrinated the pledgees, the dean of pledgees is the position I had.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a pretty rough guy in a fraternity.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, we didn't, didn't give 'em a hard time.
Speaker 1: So you really didn't give them a hard time?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right, 'cause sometimes, I mean there've been some people who've gotten in--into trouble lately about it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --they're hazing too much.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But you were pretty--
Speaker 2: If I'm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Alpha's still have a rep--
Speaker 2: Not mistaken--
Speaker 1: --of not being as tough in terms of hazing as some of the other fraternities.
Speaker 2: --I think within the last few weeks some students at a university in Florida had been sentenced for the hazing activities they engaged in which led to some injuries of some pledgees.
Story_ID: 476005
Speaker 1: What else were you involved in, in college [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] besides the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] and--
Speaker 2: As I said, the band (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps]. Yeah, the band. That's, that's a lot really.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's, that's quite a bit.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were you still involved with the baseball team when you were in college, too?
Speaker 2: I went out for the baseball team my freshman, didn't make it, so that ended that.
Speaker 1: Were, were you still involved with your parents' [Clemmie Embly Webber and Paul Webber, Jr.] team?
Speaker 2: They--
Speaker 1: The Orangeburg Tigers?
Speaker 2: No, they were starting to reach the twilight of their existence, they, I think they disbanded in summer of '54 [1954].  So my studies kind of kept me busy at that point, um-hm.
Story_ID: 476006
Speaker 1: Now I didn't ask you, but I sh- I guess I should go back and ask you did you ever meet any of the old Negro League legends like Josh Gibson or Satchel (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 1: --Paige [Satchel Paige]?
Speaker 2: --I met Josh Gibson, Junior, Minnie Minoso was playing with one of the teams and came to Orangeburg [South Carolina], I believe that Dan Bankhead, I think that was his name, was on one of the teams that came, you know?  Those are some of the names I remember, I'm sure there were others, whose names I just don't recall, who did make the majors later on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 476007
Speaker 1: Okay so, when you're on the verge of graduating now from South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], what did you, what is your goal?
Speaker 2: Well I went to law school, they had, at South Carolina State they had a pre-law program whereby you could after your third year of college, you could transfer to law school, after your first year of law school, you would get your undergraduate degree and then you'd have two more years of law school.  So it was a combined six year program, it saved me a year, so after my junior year of college that's what I did, I transferred to a law school [South Carolina State College School of Law, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: That sounds like a pretty good plan.
Speaker 2: I saved a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --saved a year and a little money.
Speaker 1: So who were the teachers in law school, were they, did you have black teachers or it was a--?
Speaker 2: They were all black teachers and they were good teachers, at that time, the University of South Carolina [University of South Carolina School of Law, Columbia, South Carolina], the reason that our law school was built to keep us out of that school.  Most of their professors I learned by reading their catalogue, had themselves attended South Caro- University of South Carolina law school, there was a lot of inbreeding, but our professors came from all over, they're professors from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], from Western Reserve [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], from Wayne in Detroit [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan], from the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa], places around.  So, they were not just South Carolina lawyers and professors but people from all around the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well who were some of the professors you had in law school?
Speaker 2: Well, Professor Whitaker [ph.] came from Detroit [Michigan], Wayne, Professor Turner [Brenner C. Turner] who was a dean, who was from Harvard undergraduate, graduate, Professor DeJarmin [ph.] was from Western Reserve in Cleveland [Ohio], Professor Gord [ph.] had gone to the University of Iowa, Professor Gershwin [ph.] from Kansas University law school [University of Kansas School of Law, Lawrence, Kansas].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Washington, from Howard.
Speaker 1: Did, did you, did Howard--I know at that time there was a Howard contingent, well the Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] is producing a great number of civil rights lawyers.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Highly trained and they're focused on civil rights.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did, did those teachers from Howard have that same, you know, that focus?
Speaker 2: Yes.  At my time there, there was only one teacher from Howard, Charles Washington [Charles Washington, Jr.], and he came imbued with that Howard spirit that, that Houstonian philosophy of--
Speaker 1: After Charles Hamilton Houston.
Speaker 2: Charles Hamilton Houston.  You were using your law to be a servant for mankind, to improve the social condition.
Story_ID: 476008
Speaker 1: So did you major in any particular type of law that?
Speaker 2: No, everybody took the same courses when I was there unlike like undergraduate school [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] we would have majors, I mean, you might if you were interested in a particular thing, if you have time for an elective, you might take an elective course, but everyone took basic and the same prescribed courses in law school [South Carolina State College School of Law, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there any particular field of study in law school that gave you trouble?
Speaker 2: My first year, agency for some reason did and corporations, I think my second year, yeah, grasping some of the concepts.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now before we graduate you from law school, is there anything else about law school (laughter) we need to talk about?
Speaker 2: It was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you?  Were you in law school when Brown versus the Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].
Speaker 2: That's, well Brown was decided May of 1954, and I graduated in May, 1954, I would have that was my, the end of my junior year, so that's when I left the undergraduate school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and transferred into law school, so September of '54 [1954], I started law school.
Speaker 1: Now that would seem like that would be a kind of a fortuitous time to enter--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: --law, if you're a black lawyer, I mean, a kid--
Speaker 2: --it was--
Speaker 1: --who wants to be a black lawyer.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  There was so much going on around the state they, the black lawyers were handling defense of student sit-ins, sit-ins at lunch counters, boycotts and a lot of times they would come to the law school to do some research and talk to law students if they wanted to try out some argument that they were gonna use in court, you know they would use us to get ideas about how the arguments went, whether we could poke holes in them.  So it was an exciting time to be a law student in South Carolina.
Story_ID: 476009
Speaker 1: Now you just mentioned something again that I've, I've heard a number of times since I started doing these interviews and that is that the, the sit-ins at North Carolina A&T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] in 1960, were not the first sit-ins.  I mean you suggested here that there were other sit-ins and I know I've heard stories from--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that they were sit-ins in Wichita [Kansas], I know there were sit-ins in Dayton [Ohio] in the early '50s [1950s]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --sit-ins in, in Maryland here, the Mitchells were involved in sit-ins.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were a lot of things that didn't get the, didn't get the play in the media and perhaps escaped the attention of most people.  I don't know, I guess the A&T students boycott was the first one that really made the six o'clock news perhaps, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: I really don't remember the dates of various ones, I'm not prepared to say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There are articles, I've seen articles in The New York Times, the, the first sit-in, you know they, they, they treated like it was the first time it ever happened.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But, I certainly will not, doesn't seem like to be the first.  But so--
Speaker 2: But they were very brave and courageous students at A&T and what they did certainly deserves a place in history that it has and I take my hats off to them because to see them sitting there on the lunch counters with their backs turned to people who mean them harm, it took a lot of guts.
Speaker 1: Okay, but what were, were there sit-ins here?  I mean, I mean in Orangeburg [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Before those, those in 1960?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, the orange, the Orangeburg massacre occurred I suppose after the sit-ins at A&T in Greensboro [North Carolina].  But students at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] and Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] and Wilkinson High School [Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School, Orangeburg, South Carolina], marched on a bowling alley in downtown Orangeburg, that would not serve black people, black customers and that led to a big demonstration and then the police were called and they shot at students who were on the campus and three students were killed, two college students, one high school student at that time.  So Orangeburg had its share of demonstrations and sit-ins and protest.
Speaker 1: So the Orangeburg mas- massacre, that was like what, what year was that?
Speaker 2: I think that was '62 [sic. 1968], as I recall.
Speaker 1: That was, what was, was Robert Williams, was he in South Carolina then?  Was he, was he in the South Carolina NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?  You remember who I'm talk--you know who I'm talking about?
Speaker 2: I remember a Robert Williams who was a--
Speaker 1: Robert F. Williams who, he was involved in a shootout with the police and had to flee the country, you know, it's a lot written about him in the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Negro Digest in those days, which became Black World--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but, you know.  I think he went to, first to Cuba, then went to China, someplace that would not extradite him back to the U.S.--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  No, I don't think he was active in Orangeburg at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, I think maybe Greensboro, yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 476010
Speaker 1: When you graduated [from South Carolina State College School of Law, Orangeburg, South Carolina] what was our goal in terms how you were going to be involved with law?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to practice law, I went to practice in South Carolina and I, I did.  I practiced in Columbia [South Carolina] for a short while, for nineteen months.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think I really neglected to ask you about, how--we mentioned Brown versus Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], but I'm gonna go back a minute to '54 [1954].  Like what, what did, what were you and your friends saying about that when, you know, when it happened, did you see?
Speaker 2: Oh it caused a lot of excitement, you know originally we thought that integration would occur quickly, but later we learned that the states would drag their feet and come up with all kinds of barriers and road blocks to slow it down and then the case went back to Springfield [Missouri] and they said, integrate with all deliberate speed, which was subject to all kinds of interpretations.  So, it was just the beginning, you know, beginning of, the efforts to bring it about as a real practical matter that you can put into your hands and hold onto, but the theory of it was something that got us excited when, when the decision was first handed down.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what did you imagine at that time, integration would look like, I mean, you know, what did you, what did you think it would look like?
Speaker 2: All I could think about at that time was that where I went to high school [Wilkinson High School; Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School, Orangeburg, South Carolina], we had one bus, it was a hand me down bus that the white high school had finished with.  Our high school had at least as many students as the white high school, Orangeburg High School [Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School, Orangeburg, South Carolina], but I counted thirteen new buses that they had to take their kids to school, you know?  A lot of the books we got had stamps in the books, Orangeburg property of Orangeburg High School and so those hand me down books got sent over to our school.  So, all I was really hoping for was that we would get a decent education, not necessarily that there would be, you know, sitting next to a white student, although there was no problem, but that was not the dream, the dream was decent education, decent jobs, decent housing, an end to the harshness of segregation.
Story_ID: 476011
Speaker 1: When you graduated, you, you said you went into practice in Columbia [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay now, why did you go to Columbia?
Speaker 2: It was a county seat of the county [Richland County, South Carolina] which I born, it was a large city, I was a little familiar with it, I had friends there and at that time I thought Orangeburg [South Carolina] was a little, a little too small, I thought at that point.  Orangeburg already had two black lawyers at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there may not have been room for more?
Speaker 2: That was my thinking at the time although, I sort of revised that later on.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, how, how long did you stay in Columbia?
Speaker 2: Nineteen months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I taught business law at Allen [Allen University, Columbia, South Carolina] to help supplement my income because starting a law practice as a solo practitioner, about twenty-four years of age was a daunting task economically speaking, you know?  So, I taught business law and I practiced law and then I got offered a job at UCLA law school [University of California Los Angeles School of Law, Los Angeles, California] as an assistant law librarian, I came by it rather interestingly.  One of the law librarians at the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina] had helped me with some research on a case and I called to thank her, called on telephone to thank her for giving me some material and at that time she was, mentioned that she was going through her mail and she made a sound, sort of a gasping sound and she had a flyer from UCLA announcing that it was looking for someone with a law degree or someone with a degree in library science and experience working at a law school to be an assistant law librarian and she mentioned how much the salary was, and that sounded pretty good to me.  So I asked if I could have that and I corresponded with the law library at UCLA and got hired and moved to California in November of 1959.
Speaker 1: Now that must have been a big change?  So you moved to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was quite a change
Speaker 1: --California in those days?
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: What was the difference, I mean how, what did you, how, how did it affect you?
Speaker 2: Well, it affected me in many ways, I drove out there in the car, took about three and a half days to get there.  The Southern California lifestyle was a lot different from the lifestyle of Orangeburg, South Carolina, I found that I couldn't find a place to live near UCLA, which is near the more expensive sections of Los Angeles [California] such as Brentwood [California] and Bel Air [Los Angeles, California] and near Sunset Boulevard, not too far away.  So, I found an apartment which was about twenty miles away I guess, at least eleven miles over near univ- University of Southern California law school [University of Southern California School of Law; University of Southern California Gould School of Law, Los Angeles, California], so I'm commuting from USC is over to UCLA.  And, fortunately when I first got there some friends of my parents [Clemmie Embly Webber and Paul Webber, Jr.] who'd gone to South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] let me stay in their house and I stayed with them for several weeks until I could find an apartment of my own.  My wife [Fay DeShields Webber] remained in Orangeburg, with my family until she finished South Carolina State and summer school and then she and my sons [Paul Webber IV and Stephen Webber] joined me out in Los Angeles.
Story_ID: 476012
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's 1957 or so, we've got you in Columbia, South Carolina--
Speaker 2: Started practicing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 2: --in Columbia in 1958.
Speaker 1: --but not, okay no, we've got you in California now.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Not where you're out--
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I moved to California (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. So you're the law librarian at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 2: UCLA.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  All right, now did you know Leo Branton [HistoryMaker Leo Branton, Jr.] out there?
Speaker 2: I met Leo Branton--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --after I started practicing law in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, and so you, you were partners with Wiley Branton [Wiley A. Branton, Sr.] back in--
Speaker 2: In Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: --in Washington.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right so, is that how you all made that hookup?  I mean that connection or, or was that?
Speaker 2: Well, we're jumping quite a bit ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's not jump--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --well, let's just, just start with loss, the law (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I worked in the law library--
Speaker 1: --librarian position.
Speaker 2: One day I drove past Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company at Adams [Boulevard] and Western Ave [Western Avenue] and I was curious about the place so I stopped the car and I went in and looked around.  My job at UCLA law library was in the afternoon and evenings, I worked from two to eleven [o'clock], so I had mornings off and I really liked what I saw at Golden State so I went to the personnel department and said I'd like to work there for free and that kind of floored the personnel director but they kicked it around and I got hired to work in their legal department on a part time basis for free.  And then I did that about two or three weeks, the president sent for me, president of Golden State, Norman O. Houston, he asked me how much UCLA paid me and I told him, he said he'd double that if I came to work at UCLA, so I, if I came to work at Golden State.  So, I gave UCLA my notice and worked in the legal department at Golden State and then I decided to take the California bar examination and after doing that and passing it, I went into practice with Golden State as one of my clients.

Speaker 1: At some time thereafter I met Leo Branton [HistoryMaker Leo Branton, Jr.] who had, one of those years when I was out there was the Los Angeles [California] layer of the year, as I recalled, his total verdicts in trials in that year was the highest of any lawyer in Los Angeles County [California].  And so he was named lawyer of the year and it was a banquet or something for Leo and I went and that's where I met him.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, had you heard about him before--well I guess you hadn't.
Speaker 1: I had not heard about Leo until I moved to Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I heard he handled quite a few high profile black clients.
Speaker 1: That's right.  He was at one time the lawyer for Nat Cole [Nat King Cole], Dorothy Dandridge, Jimi Hendrix, [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis, among others.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So this is like 1959 maybe or?
Speaker 1: No, no.  This was around 1962, at that point.
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962]?  Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So you had been there a while?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-two [1962].
Story_ID: 476014
Speaker 1: You started working for Golden State Life Insurance [Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In August--August of 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and well what were, were there any interesting case--cases at Golden State that you handled for them or, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah they were very, in, well this was a life insurance company and a lot of the cases that I handled, it involved claims issues, perhaps someone not disclosing on the application that they had a particular illness, getting life insurance and then subsequently dying of a preexisting condition.  And they would be unhappy when the claims department denied the claim and we may get a little litigation involving that, that kind of thing agency issues where there would be questions about the timeliness of some activity and business issues that came up, they would get bumped up to the legal department for their opinion and that's the kind of thing that I would do.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is there any particular cases stands out that you remember?
Speaker 2: Not rea- not as such, I mean they were, they were interesting and they all involved difficult issues of human well-being.  And it is, I mean, for example you know that somebody was trying to look out for his family by getting an insurance policy when he found out his health was not in good condition, he may not live very much longer.  But, as the representative of the business, it was my job to render the opinion that he did not candidly disclose on the application for insurance that he had this condition and that was a ground for denying the claim.  You know, that would be heart wrenching if you got to know the people and you knew that you were taking bread out of the reach of his family that he's leaving behind, but that was the kind of thing I would deal with.  But there were no cases that, you know, nothing that made any headlines or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, all right, those are the little things, I don't know, I guess, you know makes a job either worthwhile or not, I suppose, yeah?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: It made it very, very interesting and sometimes, you know, your, your heart went out, but you know, you had to do what you had to do, you know?
Speaker 1: How did it, did, were you satisfied with the job or?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed the job, and I enjoyed working with the people, at that, that time it was one of the largest black owned businesses in the world and it was well operated, well run and a good environment to work in.
Speaker 1: Okay so, well what did you do, how, how long did you work for Golden State?
Speaker 2: I, I worked for them as an employee until I passed the bar examination and then when I went into practice I continued to represent them and I was on retainer, so I really worked for Golden State until I left California in 1964, to moved back to Washington [D.C.].
Story_ID: 476015
Speaker 1: Now what precipitated the move back to Washington [D.C.]?
Speaker 2: One day I was in my law office and I got a telephone call, it was from a lawyer who worked in the [U.S.] Department of Justice, the Los Angeles [California] office who said somebody had recommended me for a job in the Antitrust Division of the justice department and wanted to know if I'd be interested.  So I said, well, "Who recommended me?"  He played coy, he never told me who it was but, long story short, we made an appointment for me to be interviewed, I was interviewed in the Los Angeles office and hired and then I found out the job was to be at the Department of Justice main office in Washington.  So, I talked it over with my family and we decided that would be a good opportunity to move back east, because those times we lived in Los Angeles we rea- really felt like we were easterners, you know?  Most of the family was back here and although we enjoyed Los Angeles, and we were doing well, my wife [Fay DeShields Webber] had started teaching and things were going well, we just felt this was a good opportunity to get back on the East Coast.  So I took a job working in the Department of Justice Antitrust Division in August of 1964 and we moved back to Washington.  The work I was doing involved the motion picture industry, it was handling the antitrust divisions that had motion picture implications, two other, one other lawyer and I handled those cases and I worked in the Department of Justice until 1967.
Speaker 1: Now what, what would be a typical case or say an example of a case in that that you were working on?
Speaker 2: A theater owner would complain that he wanted to get, let's say, 'The Godfather,' he wanted to show 'The Godfather,' the distributor would say, "Okay, I'll let you have 'The Godfather,' and here's my price," and he would name a high dollar price, "Plus I want you to take three other movies that I'll name," and these three other movies would be movies with low box office appeal.  But if the theater only wanted to get 'The Godfather,' he had to agree to take these other movies.  So that in antitrust Sherman Act [Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890] parlance would be an unlawful tie-in, so then we would, we would have a complaint against this distributor and we'd call him on the carpet about that and rectify the situation or take him to court.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They call that blind bidding, a theater owner would have to bid in the blind for movies he never saw, movies to be named by the distributor if the motion picture theater operator wanted to get a particular movie that the distributor had.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long did you stay with the--?
Speaker 2: Antitrust Division?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Antitrust Division.
Speaker 2: Three years and about three months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 476016
Speaker 1: So that's, that gets us, that's like 1967 now or sixty--?
Speaker 2: I left [the Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice], from '64 [1964] to October '67 [1967], August '64 [1964] to October '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well so, so what did you do, or leave to do at that point?
Speaker 2: I left to become the manager of the Neighborhood Legal Services office [Neighborhood Legal Services Program, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: (Pause) Now is this something new, Neighborhood Legal Services?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was a part of LBJ's [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] War on Poverty and we set up law offices in low income neighborhoods and provided legal representation to people who fell below a certain income guideline.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay, so where, where were you located?  Were you located in Watts [Los Angeles, California] or?
Speaker 2: No this, this was here in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Oh, in Washington, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I was on 14th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 14th and Clifton [Street], Northwest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Now it's an up and coming neighborhood, but at that time it was good as it a neighborhood that had a lot of people who could qualify for our services, low income people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right now, '67 [1967], the, well this is, yeah the Johnson Great Society programs basically are being run and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --who taught (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The War on Poverty.
Speaker 1: Yeah, War on Poverty at the height of the Vietnam War.
Speaker 2: That's right, a lot of things were going on.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: While I was in Neighborhood Legal Services, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] was assassinated, you had the rioting in the streets and very, war protest, all kinds of things going on in the streets and so we stayed very busy.
Story_ID: 476017
Speaker 1: There's got to be some memorable cases from this time period I suppose, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we did--
Speaker 1: In the Neighborhood Legal Services [Neighborhood Legal Services Program, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: --not do the, the cases that made the big headlines, I mean we, we represented tenants, we represented people who were trying to get on social security, you know people who had the same kind of problems you and I would have, legal problems but couldn't afford to pay for it.  So, those are basically our tenants, now occasionally we would represent a group of tenants who would have a rent strike against the so called slum, slumlord and that would make some headlines, but most of those cases were, were just routine legal cases that we handled, but they were not routine for the people we represented.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now it's '68 [1968], you mentioned the death of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and the death of Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy], there are riots in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were you, what, what kind of legal problems did the riots create or?
Speaker 2: A lot of people were arrested and the jails were full and the courts were all out manned, it took days and days to try all the people who were arrested so, even though that was not our original mission, the Neighborhood Legal Service, the lawyers took part in defending people who were involved in various aspects of the demonstrations.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, I remember that D.C. was the target of the Poor People's Campaign?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That must have caused quite a few legal issues, I would guess, just by the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] had its own legal staff--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --of the people who were advising them and, so we had Neighborhood Legal Services, to the best of my recollection did not have any direct participation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, they had a tent city [Resurrection City], I know for quite a few weeks (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 476018
Speaker 1: Now did you participate any with Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] or any of the, those activities (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not directly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And there legal stuff, okay.  Well, so by 19--did, oh, did you know Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?  Did you get a chance to ever meet him?
Speaker 2: I had met him in Columbia [South Carolina] once when he was there.
Speaker 1: Okay that would be way back in the early '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: That would be back around 1958 or '59 [1959], I suppose.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you maintain like activity in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So the NAACP was very active in Mississippi at one point, and Alabama and other places.
Speaker 2: South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Yeah, South Carolina, too.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And there seemed to be a, at one point didn't the NAACP split from the--
Speaker 2: The Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the Legal Defense Fund.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  It split off.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So now there's the NAACP and then there's the NAACP/LDF, Legal Defense Fund.
Speaker 1: Well what was the nature of that split again?  Why did they have to split off?
Speaker 2: It's always been my understanding, that had basically to do with raising funds and it may be that at one time, Thurgood Marshall and the lawyers were making most of the headlines and attracting most of the contributions, that may not be accurate, but that's the story I've heard.  And so, that the NAACP decided it would go its way and the LDF another way and each could raise their own funds.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think, I think that even some funds were hung-up in court suits, you know, from states that and towns that were suing the, the NAACP, for one thing or another.
Story_ID: 476019
Speaker 1: Now, in '69 [1969], you become a partner with Dolphin (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I--
Speaker 1: --Grant and Stafford and Webber?
Speaker 2: --I, first became an associate there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I later became Dolphin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, at that time it was Thompson, Evans and Dolphin [Dolphin, Branton, Stafford, and Webber, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fred Evans [Frederick H. Evans] was on the board of directors of the Neighborhood Legal Services Program [Washington, D.C.] and he was the one who hired me to work at the law firm, Thompson, Evans, and Dolphin.  Thompson [William Thompson] later became a judge, Evans died, Wiley Branton [Wiley A. Branton, Sr.] joined us and the firm was renamed Dolphin, Branton, Stafford and Webber.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had met Wiley when both of us were at the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice], he came to Washington [D.C.] when President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] was president to work as a special assistant to the attorney general and one day in the justice department cafeteria, he introduced himself and said he was Wiley Branton, so I immediately knew who he was because he had been the lawyer for the nine black children who integrated Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas and I told him that I knew his brother Leo [HistoryMaker Leo Branton, Jr.] in Los Angeles [California] and so we struck up a conversation and later a friendship and we became very good friends and law partners.  I left to go on the bench in 1977, and Wiley left the firm to become dean of Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] in the following year.
Story_ID: 476020
Speaker 1: Now, was it '67 [1967], or '68 [1968] that Thurgood Marshall was appointed to the [U.S.] Supreme Court?  That's one of the--
Speaker 2: You know?
Speaker 1: I know it's during Johnson's [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] administration.
Speaker 2: As I get older these dates get harder and harder to hang onto.  I remember that, I know he was first appointed to the, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and there was a long, almost a year-long confirmation hearing and then later when Johnson appointed him to the Supreme Court, you know they say that Johnson called the southern senator who had a lot to do with who got confirmed and who didn't.  And he said, Johnson said, "Jim you got a nice military base down there in your home state, how'd you like to hold on to it?  How'd you like to keep it?"  (Laughter)  He said, "I've got this fellow, Thurgood Marshall, I think he'd be a fine justice on the Supreme Court and I don't want to see him have any trouble."  So, when he was nominated for Supreme Court, the hearings went much more quickly and so I kind of lost track, I, I guess it may have been about that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was even before, I think it was just before--
Speaker 2: He was--
Speaker 1: --he left office.
Speaker 2: --he was, I know that he was solicitor general when I was at the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] because he moved my admission to the Bar of the United States Supreme Court.  He stood up in court, in open court and told the justices that I had all the necessary qualifications to be admitted to the Supreme Court.  So, that was between, 1964, 1967, probably around 1965, when he did that.  And then, then he moved from there later to the Supreme Court.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, is that, that's something at that time did you, did you think that that was something that you were gonna see in your lifetime, black justice of the Supreme Court?
Speaker 2: Not, not in my lifetime, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was really a big deal?
Speaker 2: It really was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did, did you know Thurgood Marshall very well?
Speaker 2: Not very well, but I knew, I had met him when I was a boy in South Carolina and he would come there to handle cases, the Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], most people don't realize that the lead case was really out of South Carolina, it's called Elliott versus Briggs, Briggs versus Elliott [Briggs v. Elliott, 1952] and that was in Clarendon County, South Carolina.  Thurgood Marshall argued that case in the Supreme Court, another lawyer argued Brown versus Board of Education from Topeka, Kansas, and the reason that happened was that the South Carolina case was remanded from the Supreme Court back to South Carolina, to have some findings made.  So while the case was in South Carolina, they moved the Brown case up to the top, it originally had been Briggs, because the cases are listed in alphabetical order and B-R, B-R comes bef- before B-R-O, B-R-I, and so the Briggs case was the lead case.  But because it was sent back, the Brown case moved up and so now historically it's Brown versus Board of Education, but the big case involving the testimony of Dr. Kenneth Clark and the little black dolls, doll babies and how the black children would choose white dolls because they felt inferior in color and all that, that was the case from South Carolina.
Speaker 1: So that was the Briggs case?
Speaker 2: That was the Briggs case, yeah.
Speaker 1: Gee, that's a--
Speaker 2: But people assume it was the Brown case, but it wasn't.
Story_ID: 476021
Speaker 1: We've probably been told this before, because I interviewed Oliver Hill [HistoryMaker Oliver W. Hill]--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) about three years ago, he probably, told me this but I forgot, but that's, that's interesting, I'm gonna, I'm glad we have it on here.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's the Briggs versus (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Elliott [Briggs v. Elliott, 1952].
Speaker 1: --Elliott case.
Speaker 2: That's right. Yeah.  And that's the one that Thurgood Marshall argued in the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  But while the Briggs case was pending he would come down to Clarendon County [South Carolina], and he'd come to Orangeburg [South Carolina] and he'd come to my parents' soda shop [College Soda Shop, Orangeburg, South Carolina] for meals.  So I waited on him as a, as a waiter in the soda shop, you know?  And then when I started law school [South Carolina State College School of Law, Orangeburg, South Carolina] I was really fascinated when he would come down there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was more than just historical figure to you--
Speaker 2: Oh, he was--
Speaker 1: --he was somebody you had--
Speaker 2: He's a big hero.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was a hero to many black people when, when he was coming down there on the train, there weren't many airplane flights in those days, you know, you'd hear, you would hear the rumbling, it was a black community, "Thurgood's coming, Thurgood's coming, Thurgood's," and when the train stopped at the train station black people would be all around the train station and they would applaud when he got off the train.  Not bec- necessarily because of the Brown versus Board of Education cases [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] but the other cases that he had handled throughout the South for black guys accused of crimes they may or may not have committed and he would go to, to their defense and many cases, if he couldn't get them acquitted, he at least got the sentence reduced from death to life imprisonment, which was considered a big, big victory in many cases, you know, so, he was a big hero in the South.
Speaker 1: Okay. It seemed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then I knew, and I got to know him more when I became a friend and partner of Wiley [Wiley A. Branton, Sr.] because he and Wiley were very close and Wiley had argued the case, the Little Rock case [Cooper v. Aaron, 1958], you know?
Speaker 1: Okay.  It seemed to be ubiquitous in those days, all over the country, you know the suits--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --filed and, yeah, that's, that's something.
Story_ID: 476022
Speaker 1: So you joined the firm [Thompson, Evans and Dolphin; Dolphin, Branton, Stafford, and Webber, Washington, D.C.] in 1969, and were there any high, highlights from those days at the firm?
Speaker 2: Well, my, William Thompson who was the founding partner with whom I've practiced a short while before he was named to the bench [Superior Court of the District of Columbia], was a, was a well-known person, he was, he was quite a rainmaker in the firm, he was at one time or other president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], president of the Urban League here, he was president of the National Bar Association, he was head of the Judicial Conference [Judicial Conference of the United States], he was the first, he was on the first Washington D.C. city council [Council of the District of Columbia], and he was just a, just a joy to practice law with.  Fred Evans [Frederick H. Evans] who died shortly after I joined the firm was a real great trial lawyer, I got to learn a lot watching him try cases in court and we had as a client, the Capitol Cab Company which at that time was a very large taxi cab company who he represented in Washington [D.C.].  And when Fred died, Fred had represented so many of the cab drivers, that it was hard to catch a taxi in Washington on the day of his funeral, some of the cabs took their cabs out of service and around the church where the funeral took place, there were just cabs ring the church, ringing the church, such was their respect for him.  So, I really had two wonderful lawyers to practice law with and then later when they had moved on, Wiley [Wiley A. Branton, Sr.] joined us, my, one, one of my big regrets that Wiley had not had an opportunity to practice with William S. "Turk" Thompson and Fred Evans because they, they really would have made a tremendous team, those three guys.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now you were with the firm, how, how long? Before you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From, from 1969 to 1977, when I went to the bench.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 476023
Speaker 1: Now did you as, aspire to be a judge, sir?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Had never had any aspirations to be a judge at all.  One day I was coming from a deposition at an office near Connecticut Avenue [Washington, D.C.], and I was waiting on the corner of Connecticut Avenue for a taxi cab, the cab pulled up a fellow stepped out, his name was [HistoryMaker] Willie Leftwich, the cab was not a, was not a Capitol Cab [Capitol Cab Company, Washington, D.C.], so I waved it on, I was waiting for a Capitol Cab and Leftwich and I struck up a conversation, Leftwich told me that he was a member of the District of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission.  Their major responsibility was to recommend to the president the names of lawyers the president might appoint to positions on the courts in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.].  And he said to me, that he had just been to a meeting and that my name had been favorably mentioned by some of his colleagues on the commission, and he asked if I thought I'd like to be a judge?  I said, never thought about it, he said, but you ought to think about it, you know?  So, it was a really difficult decision because I was doing very well at that time and my practice had taken off and, you know, things were going the way I wanted them to.  But, you know, I thought about it, in 1977, to be named to the court was something of, well, big honor for a lawyer at that time, it's considered something of a crowning achievement especially for a black lawyer.  So, I thought about it, thought about it, talked it over with my family and decided yes, I would be a candidate, so I told Mr. Leftwich, yes you can, may consider me a candidate and so, President Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.], nominated me to the Superior Court [Superior Court of the District of Columbia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And say, and you were appointed and you're approved, I guess or how would you say that, in, in '77 [1977]?
Speaker 2: Well, let me back up a minute, my name was sent forward by the Judicial Nomination Commission, President Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.] was president, President Ford did not select my name, he was opposed by President Carter, President Carter defeated him, President Carter became president, President Carter withdrew the names that President Ford had sent to the [U.S.] Senate for confirmation, and sent a different list of names that included my name, so then the Senate confirmed me.  So really, President Carter got an opportunity to act on it after President Ford and not, so I was appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1977.
Story_ID: 476024
Speaker 1: What are the highlights of your career on the bench?
Speaker 2: Well, I became the presiding judge of the Civil Division which meant that I was the, the head of the Civil Division of the Superior Court [Superior Court of the District of Columbia] and we handled cases involving multi-million dollar accidents, medical malpractice, construction accident cases, all kinds of cases without any monetary limitation on it, down to small claims cases because our court was an integrated case meaning that we had--we did the work that in some cities a municipal court would do as well as a circuit or general jurisdiction court and we had the jurisdiction over, from one dollar up to multi billions of dollars.  And asbestos cases and cases that involved all kinds of difficult issues, that was a highlight for me.  I was also appointed to head the judicial training conference which meant bringing judges together from all around the area for training at the three day conference, was held out in Maryland, I was appointed to head the committee on the appointment of hearing commissioners, I was appointed to head the committee on civil rules [Advisory Committee on Civil Rules], so that when civil rules were proposed, the rules came before my committee for vetting and for recommendation, if we recommended the rule be adopted, then it would be passed on to the Board of Judges for adoption and printing as rules of the Superior Court, those were some of the highlights for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 476025
Speaker 1: In 1986, the Trial Lawyers Association of Metropolitan Washington, D.C. named me the outstanding trial judge of the year and then in 1996, the Washingtonian magazine named me one of the best trial judges in the metropolitan Washington [D.C.] area, two honors that I appreciated very much.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What, what should you, your judicial philosophy?
Speaker 1: Well, try to find the, the truth and apply the law as best you can.  The truth can be evasive, it can be difficult to find but you gotta do the best you can and if you do the best you can, eventually you'll be able to sleep at night.  I think if you're a good judge in the beginning, you won't be able to sleep at night, there'll be many a case that you just are torn by, but eventually you decide all you can do is the best you can and if you do your best you get a few hours of sleep at night.
Speaker 2: Is there any cases you can talk about where you were like torn like that and between one, one decision or the other?
Speaker 1: I remember one case I had involving a fourteen year old boy who shot and killed his stepfather, his stepfather had abused the boy's mother, the boy was charged with, as a juvenile, but he was waived to adult court, which was unusual and tried for first degree murder and there was evidence that the boy had planned it by going somewhere and getting a gun from a friend and coming back which to the prosecutor meant that there was malice of forethought, he'd thought about it, had enough time to think about what he was doing.  And we tried that case and it was a difficult case and I tried to come up with the appropriate sentence, it was difficult and, so cases like that are the ones that really deprive you of sleep.  And when you read pre-sentence reports on young men basically and they've done some horrendous things, involving drugs and killing people for monetary gain and so forth, you know, your, your immediate thing is to throw them away and lock away, lock away the key, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's what they say in these neighborhood meetings all over the country.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. And then you get a pre-sentence report and you read how this kid had been abused himself from the time he was eighteen months old, how what a light--what a difficult life he had and you get to thinking, suppose I had been raised like that, you know?  Can I really say that I would not have done the same things, you know?  Those are the kinds of cases that really keep you up at night, you know and, and, sometimes you, you're never really satisfied that you, that you did the right thing, but you, the, there's so many cases, the momentum just keeps you from spending a whole lot of time that may drive you to your grave thinking about it because you've gotta move on to the next on and do the best you can the next time.  So judging is not an easy proposition.

Speaker 1: Increasingly we're seeing, well we're seeing juvenile court decline in signi- I mean a lot of, all over the country, I know Chicago [Illinois] a couple of times that I can remember and may--maybe more than that, if I had researched, minors are brought up before the court and then tried as adults for crimes for murders and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there, there was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) especially that, I mean that and--
Speaker 2: --there was a great outcry particularly a few years ago, you know, when there was all this momentum for one strike, two strikes, three strikes and you're out and  waiving youngsters to adult court, try them as adults and, and now they're getting them off the street.  But that seems to be subsiding somewhat, now I'm not at court, I'm not as active as I was at the court so, I don't see as much as I used to see about what's going on at the court, but it's my impression that, that some of that is, is toning down a bit, you know, the harshness of the outcry for getting them off the streets so to speak.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And try to understand and come up with alternatives to jail, alternatives to incarceration, more programs that really work, things that, because so much of it is drug driven, if not the defendant, somebody close to the defendant, somehow drugs are involved in so much of the crime.  So, trying to come up with other solutions rather than just incarcerating people seems to be on the upswing again, it's my impression.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you ever have opportunity to render some kind of creative verdict, I mean, judgment that, and I've heard of judges sentencing juvenile's well, to read or something--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, or read some, or write an essay or something like that I mean--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --did you ever do that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: I won't take credit in saying I originated it, but you know, some things that are alternatives to the usual kind of punishment, you know, I would, I would designate certain books and have them write an outline of, of the book and write the, what the author was striving at, things that would get them interested in reading or I'd have them, you know community service, unique kinds of community service that kind of thing.  But I don't think I can take credit for coming up with something that you've never heard of before.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well those things are innovative, they're all, you know, they're not the usual thing.

Speaker 1: How did the--I know D.C. [Washington, D.C.] was one of the first major cities to experience the crack [crack cocaine] epidemic in the late '80s [1980s], I guess the mid to late '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --before it reached Chicago [Illinois], before it reached other cities, Washington, D.C. was, had an epidemic going on.  I remember in '88 [1988], at the time of the last Super Bowl champion, Washington Redskins, I guess the city was filled with shootings and [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry announced to the National Press Corps [sic. the National Press Club] that these were not murders, these were just some killings or something?  He said, that there is one of, that he was quote, quoted as having said and people would call for the National Guard to come out and what would, how, how did that affect the Superior Court [Superior Court of the District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, greatly, I mean that, the dockets were just filled, you know?  And almost every, every case was a drug case, you know just about, now whereas when I first went on the bench even in juvenile court, you know you would see maybe a little petty larceny or truancy or maybe joy riding, stealing a car for joy riding and then in the '80s [1980s], most of the cases you saw were involved with drugs somehow or another, either the drug dealers would get kids who they knew would be tried as children, to sell the drugs for them, because the punishment would not be as much, so a lot of drug dealers were recruiting kids to sale drugs, a lot kids were using drugs.  And so, that became the predominate kind of cases you were receiving in juvenile court at that time that you're talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it didn't, that's kind of subsided somewhat nowadays, hasn't it?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Well, was there any reason for it you think?  You think the, the courts had anything to do with it or what was it?
Speaker 2: I'd like to think the courts had something to do with it, I think more knowledge, more people finally coming to the recognition that you've gotta do something other than try to put people in jail because there are not enough jails to hold all of the people who are accused of drugs and drug related crimes.  And then recognition and some sophis- sophistication about the penal institutions and the, the rising kind of business that is, a growth industry and, some people getting wise enough to say well, we are not going to become tools in that, you know?  I think people are getting, are wising up, you know?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then you're getting drug courts where they'll try to focus the attention on, not just incarceration but real sincere effective rehabilitation and alternatives to incarceration.  And I think some of them are starting to work.
Speaker 1: Now can, can you point to one that re- really works, that you, I mean that you can tell us about right now, I mean?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that second genesis seems to be effective, the drug courts were, where the defendants are given an opportunity to go into certain programs and complete phases and not bite off more than they can chew at one time, but to work gradually up and up and to prove that they can accomplish one thing before going to the next and then having a graduation ceremony by people, with people involved who have high expectations for them, that's the kind of thing, without putting any names on the programs, those are the kinds of programs that I think are working.  It's, it's difficult because, I mean, you know, I know people who can't quit smoking cigarettes and so the addiction, if you're really addicted, it's, it's a difficult thing and it's not something that a, it's gonna be an overnight success for everybody and maybe even most people.  But here and there, we're seeing victories and I think also we may be seeing people who don't start in the first place, you know, because of the education.

Speaker 1: Now, in the early '90s [1990s], we had the nomination and subsequent approval of the appointment of Clarence Thomas to the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  Did you, or did you, do, do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope that our fellow judges do not speak ill of me, and I try not to speak ill of fellow judges.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that's, that's, that's it, that's the remark on?
Speaker 2: That's about all I care to say.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, and likewise, how do you feel about the, I guess in the, also in the early '90s [1990s], there seemed to be a number of courtroom shows, not so much dramas there, but there, there're a lot of courtroom dramas, but there's also these daytime court shows where you have a judge as a star, you know, I think it started with 'The People's Court,' and then you've got like now maybe at least four or five black judges with shows, you know, where they're on the bench.  And, what, what do you think about those for the most part?
Speaker 2: Well, to some extent they are good and that they can inform the public about legal issues and legal principles.  Television has a tendency to corrupt, I think, many things that it touches and if the judges who appear on these programs are not careful, they can let show business dominate their philosophy about what they're doing in my opinion and to the extent that they sometimes do that, I think they lower the, esteem with which real judges who are working hard in courtrooms, trying real cases, are held by the public, so that, if a judge can maintain his dignity or her dignity, and preside in a way that will draw an audience as would be demanded by the producer of the show, I'm sure, I'm all for it.  But I think it's a difficult mistress to serve because ratings are sometimes dictated something other than pure judicial determination of the outcome of a set of facts as presented in a case.  I'd like to say the judges honor the profession to the extent that they can do that, that's fine.
Story_ID: 476029
Speaker 1: In terms of the criminal justice system today, do you have any, if you could, if you had your wish, you know?  What kind of criminal justice system, I mean or how, how would you reform the criminal justice system or change it or would you leave it the same?
Speaker 2: I, I would try to come up with more alternatives to pure punishment, I would hold punishment back as hold punishment back as a sword of Damocles, but I would not use it as in the first instance in every case.  It would be to try to determine, if you can, why the crime was committed, what if anything can be done to rehabilitate the person other than putting them in jail which does not necessarily work and to the extent that the resources can be devoted to rehabilitation, that's what I would do.  Now, that may sound naive because that's what people have been saying for years and years, but I think there is a wide gap between talking about it and doing it and sometimes doing it is not accomplished because the resources is not really put where the mouths are.  So the more resources could be put and also before people get involved in the criminal justice system, put in the schools and in the community and although that is not per se, a part of the criminal justice systems to be re- to be reformed, that would have a big impact on the criminal justice system by depriving the system of a lot of its clientele which would make everybody happy, I think.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I'd like to see the African community be more cohesive, be more thoughtful about what's good for the community as a whole, to, when in a position to, to reach out and help to do so, to teach history, the real history, to--if you're a school teacher, to be a good school teacher, if  you're a plumber, to be a good plumber and to teach other people what you know and to, to be the kind of person that your children will be proud of and to spend time with your children.  I'd like to see more of that in our communities.

Speaker 1: Now you're involved in other activities, I mean, you're in, well tell us about some of your other activities and organizations that you belong to.
Speaker 2: Well, until December 31st when I completed seven years, I was the general counsel of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, I'm on the board of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, I'm on the board of the Council for Court Excellence [Washington, D.C.], I'm a member of several social organizations and I'm a member of the Judicial Council of Washington Bar Association, I was a co-founder of that organization with Judge Burnett [Arthur L. Burnett, Sr.] a few years ago, so I managed to stay fairly busy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 476032
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you'd do differently now?
Speaker 2: I think probably there are a lot of things that I would do differently.  I think I would spend more time with people that I know, or like or think I would like to get to know better, and when I read an obituary and at my age I started reading more and more obituaries of people around my age and I think about people.  I'd say, "You know? That's somebody I should have spent more time with," and that's what I'm try--striving to do now, trying to slow down and try to make each encounter I have with people a more meaningful encounter where we really touch each other and as time goes on you can say, "You know?  I really got to know the best of that person and hopefully, that person got the best, to know the best of me."  As a young man, you know, I'm rushing trying to make a living, trying to educate my children, trying to get a house, you know, this, that and the other.  And you don't, you don't appreciate those things but at least as I've gotten older, I think those are the most important things to me, material things have taken a, a real back seat and human encounters and relationships have become more and more important and that's what I'm trying to spend more time doing and nurturing.
Story_ID: 476033
Speaker 1: Now is, at this juncture, also what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think my, my three children, yeah.  My oldest son Paul [Paul Webber IV] is a successful lawyer, my second son Stephen [Stephen Webber] is a successful orthopedic surgeon, and my daughter [Nikki Webber] is a television producer, she's director of talent and casting for TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland], they're all doing well, they've made me proud, I have four grandchildren, each of my sons is, has two children and they're doing equally well and that I think is enough legacy for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, and I was gonna, you know, the next question was gonna be to ask you about your family but, (laughter) you've discussed them pretty, pretty well.  I mean that's it, they constitute your immediate family, now I guess right?
Speaker 2: Yes, with my wife [Fay DeShields Webber], right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, okay.
Speaker 2: She's a retired D.C. [Washington, D.C.] school teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 476034
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked you that you think we need to cover before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Well, I think you're an excellent interviewer, you've covered just about everything I can think of, well maybe the last question is gonna be a humdinger so we, (laughter) I'll hold something in reserve to try to answer that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No, it's a sixteen-inch softball, it's not, no problem.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You'll be able to hit at this. My last question is similar to legacy in a way but it's, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pause) As a person who tried to do the best he could under whatever circumstances he confronted, who tried to help people, who tried not to intentionally harm anyone, who when all is said and done, did it the right way as he saw it and as he could.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well thank you very much, sir.
Speaker 2: My pleasure.
Speaker 1: It's been a pleasure.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
