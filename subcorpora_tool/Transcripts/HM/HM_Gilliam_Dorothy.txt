Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions we always ask.  They are lightweight questions that only deserve lightweight answers.  And so the first one is: ma'am, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Possibly collard greens.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Purple.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?

Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: More specifically, that's--several places in the Caribbean.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, finally, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I think of a spiritual nature, it would be something like--such as, all things work together for good for those who love the Lord and are called according to His purposes.
Story_ID: 185986
Speaker 1: I would like to ask you about your family history.  I want to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.  Starting with your mother's side of the family and, but first, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Jessie Man Norment, J-E-S-S-I-E, M-A-N, N-O-R-M-E-N-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what's the last name again?
Speaker 2: Norment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: N-O-R-M-E-N-T.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born May 1st, in Lucy--I'm sorry, I didn't give you the year, 1901, in Lucy, Tennessee.  I'm sorry, 1900, in Lucy, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can only trace them back to her parents.  In terms of really substantiated research.  Her parents were from Lucy, Tennessee.  Her, her father was a man before the, the [Great] Depression--was a man relatively of means, as my, as my older sister tells me because he had a very large farm and he had quite a bit of land.  He lost a lot of that in the depression, but--so, he, he was a farmer.  My mother had one brother, and they had different mothers, so.  But he was, he was--his name was Calvin Norment.  My mother was--there is more history on my mother's side.  I just have not done the research to really, to really obtain that history.  My mother was educated at a, what we would call today, a community college, but, but in that day it was called a normal school.  And, so that prepared her actually, to teach in rural, or what we would just call country schools.  And it was--when--when she was there teaching back, back in rural Tennessee that she met my father [Adee Butler].
Story_ID: 185987
Speaker 1: Oh, we were talking about your mother's side of the family and you told, told us something about your mother [Jessie Norment Butler] and where she went to school.  She went to normal school and met your father [Adee Butler] teaching in the country.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  She went to--actually it was called Lane College [Jackson, Tennessee].  But it was really, you know, a normal school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lane College is a C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal]--
Speaker 2: It's now, right.
Speaker 1: --a C.M.E. school, I think.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I should know that.
Speaker 1: It is, it is.  And just above Memphis [Tennessee], just north of Memphis, I think.
Speaker 2: Certainly in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is--are there any stories about her side of the family, at all about, about slavery, or the Civil War, or any of that activity in the 19th century, because her parents apparently grew up right around the Civil (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: They were born around the time, time of the Civil War, or thereabouts, I would guess?
Speaker 2: I, really, really regret to say that I have not done--did not get that really from her and didn't really--wasn't really alerted to the need for that until, you know, years later.  I'm, I'm really--but it's a history I really, really want to do.  I know there's some history there.  You know, even the name Norment, you know, where did that come from?
Speaker 1: Right.  That's, that's an unusual name.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And was there, is there any story about how your grandfather acquired property and became you know, well to do at a time when a lot of people were struggling, you know?
Speaker 2: I, I regret to say I don't know that history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's history I look forward to getting.
Story_ID: 185988
Speaker 1: Your father's side of the family.  Let's have your father's full name, and if you could spell his name for us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My father's name is Adee Conklin Butler.  The Adee is spelled A-D-E-E, the Conklin is spelled C-O-N-K-L-I-N, and the last name Butler, is B-U-T-L-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born September 8, 1899 in Woodstock, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Again, I can only trace it back to his parents.  And even that history is limited.  So I have a lot of work to do on my, on my family history.  My father was one of seven children.  He--they lived on a farm and the boys--all the boys were part of helping to keep the farm going.  Had uncle--four uncles, and, I mean four boys and three girls in daddy's family.  What distinguished my father from the rest is that he talked his father into letting him leave the, the farming and to go to college and actually he went away to high school.  In those days very few of the rural areas actually had high schools for black people.  And so, he, he went to--but he talked his father after having finished the work there, which I assume was about eighth grade, he talked his father into letting him go away to school.  And he went to Rust College in [Holly Springs] Mississippi.  And then he went on to Hampton Institute [later, Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  At that point I think it was probably called Hampton Agricultural and Mechanical Institute [sic., Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute].  And then he graduated from Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  And my Uncle Odell [ph.], who had a more traditional kind of life, he went on to work in the steel mills of Gary, Indiana.  And he told me many years after my dad died, that you know, they, they were--the other family members were upset because they--you know, he got to go away to college and they ended up working on the, on the farm, and then, you know, going, going into jobs basically as laborers.  But, they, they felt that they still lived lives that gave them a level of satisfaction, however.  Because, you know, those were the days when a man who was, who was--who worked in the steel mill could, could buy a, you know, home and have a wife and children and have a good life.  One of my brothers, Uncle John, I'm sorry, one of my father's brothers, Uncle John, became a businessman.  He had a little store and a tailor--a tailor shop, and a cleaners in Memphis [Tennessee].  And he--my mother [Jessie Norment Butler] once my mother and father married, then they eventually moved to Memphis as well.
Story_ID: 185989
Speaker 1: But there aren't any stories at all about your grandparents on that side [paternal], or what they were doing in the, in the 19th century before your father [Adee Butler] was born (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very, very few.  I really--I am the eighth of ten children.  Five of my sisters and brothers died either as teenagers, or as--they were stillborn, or whatever, you know, I mean, they were--they died when they were quite young.  And, so, I, by the time I came along, I was not really here.  My--I never really knew my grandfather.  I did know my grandmother, who was Mary Butler, for--in a limited way.  Let me give you a little bit of the sequence of events, in terms of my life and I think it'll explain a little bit--why I--my, my knowledge is somewhat limited.  The--my dad was--became a minister, he was trained as a teacher, but then he became a minister, minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church [A.M.E.].  By the time I was born, he was an active minister.  When I was five years old, the family was moved from Memphis, Tennessee to Louisville, Kentucky.  So, most of my life and my growing up was in Louisville.  And also, by the time I, I was born, my--as I said, I did not really know, or remember my grandfather.  My grandmother on my father's side would occasionally come from Memphis up to Louisville and stay with, with us for several weeks or months at a time.  So I got to know her in a limited way, but I, I really never got to know my grandfather.  The other thing that's relevant is that my father died when I was fourteen years old.  So much of the history and the information that would have been passed on, you know, in my family by my father, did not occur because my, my father became ill and died when I was so young.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, all right, so they didn't pass on any stories about hanks or any objects, or anything like that, that they talked about from, from way back, nothing like that?
Speaker 2: I'm sure (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know how some people sat around and talked (unclear).
Speaker 2: -- I'm sure that some of those stories really exist, exist and existed, but, again, I think just given my, you know, my placement in the family as the eighth of ten children, given the fact that, my father had already died.  His name--I'm sorry, my grandfather who's Nick Butler, had already died, you know, I just really--my older sister now, I have an older sister who is seventy-seven years old, and she knows much more than I in terms of--I mean, she remembers, you know, grandfather and--but, in terms of a lot of the stories, you know, they just haven't passed on as many as I'd like to have had.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 185990
Speaker 1: Well you, you're the youngest of eight, you said, children?
Speaker 2: I'm--no, I'm the eighth of ten.
Speaker 1: Eighth of ten, oh, okay, all right.  All right can you name your brothers and sisters for us in order and--?
Speaker 2: My oldest sister is Evelyn Butler, I'm sorry, Evelyn Butler Campbell.  And my next older brother is Adee Conklin Butler, Jr.  You're talking about living, or you want (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, just the whole group, the whole bit.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'll, I'll name the living ones at this point and then I'll talk about the others.  Is that the way you'd like it or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It doesn't really make a difference (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --would you prefer it the other way?
Speaker 1: If you'd just name them all in order, that's all right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Evelyn Butler Campbell is, who is, who is--was first.  Theo Butler, who is, who is now deceased was next; there were twins, twin children who died--and I don't have their names.  There was another sister, Mary, who died--Mary Butler.  There was another boy who was stillborn, and I don't have his name.  Then there--my brother, Adee Conklin Butler, is one year--about eighteen months older than I am.  Then I was, I was number eight.  I have a younger sister, younger, who is, who is now deceased, Juanita Butler, then I have another brother, Lynwood Odell Butler.
Story_ID: 185991
Speaker 1: Tell me about growing up.  What were some of the--now, you spent your early years in Memphis [Tennessee], right, just a few years though, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How long were you--?
Speaker 2: I actually--we moved to Louisville [Kentucky] on December 7, 1941, a very famous day in U.S. history.  But I had just turned five.
Speaker 1: That's the Pearl Harbor (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, right, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, right.  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: The day that will live in infamy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt said, right?
Speaker 2: Exactly, that was the day that we, we actually--and my father [Adee Butler] had actually left Memphis and gone to Louisville some months earlier.  But it was by the time--we actually followed after the birth of my youngest brother, Lynwood [Odell Butler].  He was born on October 19th and then we moved a couple of months thereafter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're, you're like five or so then.
Speaker 2: Just turned five.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you don't--do you remember much about Memphis at all?
Speaker 2: I have relatively few memories of Memphis.  I, I know that we lived in a housing project called Dixie Homes.  That's what my family has told me.  I don't have many memories of that.  I do have memories of going to my uncle's [Uncle John Butler], you know, shop, store and cleaners and, and tailor shop.  I remember it was--there was a, a wooden side porch and we--they'd make ice cream and you know, other goodies.  I remember, you know, I still remember, you know, some of the--peach ice cream.  They would wind--they'd, they'd produce on those old fashioned--they didn't seem old fashioned at the time.  They just seemed to be the way you made ice cream of course.  But, those were--I really have relatively few memories.  It was almost as if my life kind of started, for me, in terms of my own memories, when I got to Louisville.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father had been the pastor of, as I said, of a church in Memphis, and I should get that name for you.  But the church he pastored in Louisville was called Youngs Chapel A.M.E. Church [Louisville, Kentucky].  And it was a church that really was not in great shape at all.  But my--but he was, he was known as a builder, and, so the bishop who was Bishop R.R. Wright [Richard Robert Wright, Jr.], said that every place my dad had gone, he had already--he'd, he'd always brought to it a level of building.  And so he, he wanted him to build up Youngs Chapel A.M.E. Church and indeed, my dad actually did build a new church and, so he was there from--we arrived in 1941, my dad died in 1951.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was there for ten years building?
Speaker 2: He actually left the church about two years earlier because he had been--when he began to be ill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He actually was promoted to presiding elder--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and left the church.  By then it was practically built.
Speaker 1: Yeah the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, I know the ministers are assigned and so forth.  So he was assigned (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --to Louisville.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 185992
Speaker 1: Tell us about growing up in Louisville [Kentucky].  What was some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I lived in a section of Louisville called--that was called California [Louisville, Kentucky].  And it was a very much a working class community.  At that point in 1941, Louisville was strictly segregated.  It was a, a place where I saw, you know, it was all, all black in terms of the people that I knew and the people with whom I associated.  I believe it was--because it was a little quote, unquote "further north," I, I believe there were a couple of things that were--made it a little less harsh than Memphis [Tennessee].  One was I don't believe the buses were segregated, but everything else was segregated in Louisville, schools, et cetera.  So, this neighborhood of California was, was my, was my stomping ground.  We--one of the things my dad [Adee Butler] did was to start a--take the, take the parsonage [at Youngs Chapel A.M.E. Church, Louisville, Kentucky] and begin to build it in a, you know, to kind of modernize it a little bit.  So by the time we got there it was, it was looking better.  He, he was building--because there were five children, actually six children coming along with his wife [Gilliam's mother, Jessie Norment Butler], he, he had started working on the parsonage to improve it by--before we got there.  And, then one--shortly after he got there also, he started building the church.  It was a, you know, in many ways a very wonderful period.  It--being the youngest--no that's not true; I was not the youngest, but--
Speaker 1: You were the youngest girl, which is important to us.
Speaker 2: No, I had a younger sister, Juanita [Butler].
Speaker 1: You did?  Okay.
Speaker 2: However, she was mentally retarded and that's really what I was, I was kind of referencing.  She was just, just a couple of years younger than I, and she was born with Down syndrome.  And then there was another boy born after her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, what was--it's very, it's very special when you're the preacher's daughter, special and also horrible because, you know, everybody expects you to be better, and of course, you really aren't, but you're trying to be good, you know.  But, one of the--one of my gifts, I guess, from God was the ability to speak well and to speak easily.  And I say that almost in contrast to my brother and my sister.  My older sister [Evelyn Butler Campbell] was a stutterer.  My brother, Adee [Conklin Butler, Jr.], my older brother was.  So, I was the one who always said the long poems in church and, you know, got all the accolades for, you know, memorizing 'The Night Before Christmas' ['A Visit from St. Nicholas'] from beginning to end and this kind of thing.
Story_ID: 185993
Speaker 1: My mom [Jessie Norment Butler] was just such a, a wonderful, wonderful, warm, giving person.  She, she was the person who had to do--had to work hard.  I certainly, I know when we first moved in the parsonage [at Youngs Chapel A.M.E. Church, Louisville, Kentucky], there was no refrigerator.  We had an old fashioned icebox.  As I said, it was very much a working class, class congregation.  And we had limited funds.  So mom worked and one of the things that I mentioned was that she had been a--she had been trained as a teacher, but because she went to a normal school [Lane College, Jackson, Tennessee], her credentials did not equip her to teach in a city school.  Because of the segregated system, there were no mid-level jobs that black women of her generation had, you know, sales clerks, secretaries, you know.  So my mom worked as a maid and she worked as a maid during the whole time that, that I grew up.  So, and I can remember that she would--people would call, I mean, I guess, what we used to call it then was doing day work.  You know, where she'd go out and work for different people and you know, she'd be home in the late afternoon and cooked our dinner and did all of that.  But I can still remember you know, people calling, saying, you know, "May I speak to Jessie," and I would get angry and I'd say, "Do you mean Mrs. Butler?" because she was so respected and revered at our church that, you know, I didn't, I didn't want to hear anybody talk about her in that demeaning manner, and she'd say (sound), you know, "Be quiet, it's okay."  And she'd go to the phone and, you know, did what she had to do in order to help her family.
Story_ID: 185994
Speaker 1: But, it was a very, it was, it was pretty close-knit community, California [Louisville, Kentucky] was.  There were people there of all levels of--all income levels.  And the--and that's not quite true.  I mean, I said that we, within the context of being working class, you know, there were, there were a few teachers, there were a few people like that.  But what I remember most about my growing up was that I was getting pretty consistent messages at home, at church, at school and the community, those messages being, you know, you can make it, you can do it, you can be special.  Even though it was in the '40s [1940s], the War [World War II, WWII] was going on, the--you know, segregation was rampant, you know, this is years before the days of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and, and Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  So at this point, you know, those, those opportunities were not on the horizon, as far as most people in my community were able to observe, but they, they--the consistent messages were you know, preparing me for, you know, the larger world.  And, you know, just, just doing it, doing all, all that everybody seemed to know how and what to do in order to, to strengthen me in both you know, intellectually, emotionally, spiritually in all those ways.
Speaker 2: Now when you look back do, do you think you really took seriously the role of being a minister's daughter and, and being the person that could articulate the, I guess, some of the ideals of your, your parents [Jessie Norment Butler and Adee Butler] and your community, you know, and public and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: I don't know that I necessarily saw myself as being able to articulate the ideals of the community.  I, I think mine were much more related just to the church [Youngs Chapel A.M.E. Church, Louisville, Kentucky].  For example, you know, there, there're very well developed youth programs at the church.  And so, I was involved in, you know, the youth programs and the Sunday school, and then at a certain age we started going to Sunday school conventions.  And at those conventions I would be one of the people who would speak, but you--they'd be primarily on, you know, with--on issues that had to do with very spiritual topics, not necessarily articulating the ideas of the larger community.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  But you were like one of the youth that spoke at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: I know that's special in the community--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, exactly.
Speaker 2: --or if there's a youth that can speak in public--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --you know, and what they give you--they often give you what you're supposed to say.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And which is--
Speaker 1: And that really happened.
Speaker 2: --which is kind of a reflection of what they think about--
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.
Speaker 2: --how you ought to live.
Speaker 1: And that happened to me, particularly in high school [Lincoln Institute, Lincoln Ridge, Kentucky] as I, you know, moved out from the, from the church, et cetera. Mr.--one of my teachers there, Mr. Mucker [ph.] used to--insist that I give speeches.  And I remember one that just made me the most unpopular person in the school, on the ills of smoking, why smoking is terrible.  And, you know, so I was up, you know, ranting and pointing my finger and waving it, you know, and talking about this, this issue of why smoking is bad, and of course, you know, there are plenty of kids at that point, who were trying to smoke.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, but you're right, that, that certainly carried over.
Story_ID: 186461
Speaker 1: In Memphis [Tennessee], when my family moved from the country to Memphis, that was before I was born.  They--usually families all kind of stayed together in little, you know, contiguous areas.  I don't know exactly where this was (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Little enclaves of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, little enclaves.  And my, my mother [Jessie Norment Butler] and my Aunt Gussie [ph.], both lived together in a--their families lived together in a little enclave in Memphis.  I'm not sure where it was.  But, but what I was told is that when they--there was this, this--in this little enclave they actually picked up a lot of the characteristics of people who, who, who had moved there and not just for, you know, this period, but had lived, but had lived there a long time.  And, so, one of the things they used to do was, there was a, a, like a, almost like a community faucet where they got water and they would all come around and get water and the women would wash their clothes and they would talk and it seemed like, you know, this was the same thing that had happened, you know, maybe in, in Africa or, you know, years before--
Speaker 2: In a well, or something, or stream or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Some, the, somehow the this became a gathering point, even in the city where they would all come and get water and then they'd use the water for washing and other things and--I, I've been, I really want to talk to my Aunt Gussie about it to get a--because she's the only--she's the last surviving person of that generation.  She's about ninety-two, and I want to really go and interview her to get more information about that kind of thing.  But, that was the only thing that, that I remembered that, apparently they would all go and wash and they'd talk and they, you know, they'd get, they'd gather the water.  It was like going to the well, you know, centuries before.  And that became very much a, a, you know, a community gathering point for the women.
Story_ID: 186462
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When you were a little girl like, what did you like to do?  I mean, what, what did you really like to do.
Speaker 1: I liked to read.  I loved to read.  And I read everything you can think of.  Books were my way of learning about the world.  I was, you know, what they considered a smart little girl.  Unfortunately, I also liked to eat and that really, I, I, I, I can still remember you know, foods and things that I ate, and unfortunately, that, that has been something I've had to deal with all my life, because you know, I think in a way food was, like many cultures in the black culture, food was very, very important.  And in those days, children were definitely seen and not heard.  So I think food became a way of, of you know, dealing with emotions, you know, pain, whatever, all the things that were happening.  And, so, that was another thing that I, I did like to eat.  I liked to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you're not big now.
Speaker 1: No, but that's--
Speaker 2: But I, I know that I read that at age fourteen, I think, there was some stress involved because your father [Adee Butler] died at about that age.  You were about two hundred pounds.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: Right.  And--but that was, you know, that was--those bad, those, that use of food at--to quell emotions had started early and then when my father--as my father got sicker, I would, you know, I used it more and more.  And that's when I, I blew up.  And, so, but it, you know, those, a lot of those tendencies can remain.  So you have to, you know, make certain in your--I've had to make certain over the years to do the kinds of things that I, I could do to make certain that eating didn't get out of control--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: --but, but I liked to, I liked to play with my friends as a child, you know, we played all kinds of games, you know, hide and go seek, the--you know, jumping rope.  I liked to play with my dolls.  We always--money was always limited, so I didn't have a lot of toys.  My father would often, when the church [Youngs Chapel A.M.E. Church, Louisville, Kentucky] was being built, he would take his salary and give it to the workmen.  So, I'm sure he didn't give it all to the workmen, but he gave them some.  And, so our money was very short, but, my--like so many of blacks of that generation, we always had, you know, plenty of food, and there was always plenty to share.  I recall for example, so many of the women from the church, would, would come every Sunday to our home and have dinner.  And my mom [Jessie Norment Butler] would, you know, cook these big meals.  There were always, two, two meals, two meats every Sunday on the table.  And, you know, we'd always--there would be Sister Turnbow [ph.], or Sister Patten [ph.], and a lot of the, you know, the women from the church who would come and join us at dinner.

Speaker 1: So it was that those years, those early years in Louisville [Kentucky], you know--we lived on 16th [Street], we lived at 16th and Saint Catherine [Street], which is where the church [Youngs Chapel A.M.E. Church, Louisville, Kentucky] was located.  I went--I attended Phillis Wheatley Elementary School [Wheatley Elementary School, Louisville, Kentucky], which was about a block from, from our house.  And at, at Phillis Wheatley I was given what they called a--I was, I was told I could skip a grade.  So, I ended up actually, coming out of high school at the same time, I'm sorry--I was skipped to the same grade as my brother [Adee Conklin Butler, Jr.], basically.  So, we both finished Phillis Wheatley at the same time, then we also both went to Madison Junior High School [Shelbyville, Kentucky] together.  And years later my brother used to say, "Why was she always in the same grade as I was, when I was eighteen months older?"  But, that was just the way they, they did in those days, you know, if they had a kid who they thought was slightly advanced, they would, they would promote them, give them, you know, give them a year, they'd skip a grade.  But, you know, we had--it was the kind of situation where we had in, you know, the summers were times of running around, there were a lot of the people in our neighborhoods went to my church.  So they knew me, and they kind of kept an eye on, on us.  There was a big family, the Grisham [ph.] family that lived in the alley behind our house, opposite our house.  And they were--they had about eight or nine children, and, and I think they were all living in three rooms and, you know, it was a lot of that, where there was a lot, where a lot of people were living in pretty stressful situations.  But, it's--it was a city neighborhood [California, Louisville, Kentucky], but it was also kind of well-contained.
Speaker 2: So you didn't have to venture out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not--
Speaker 2: --beyond the neighborhood very much?
Speaker 1: --not terribly far, no, no, I mean--
Speaker 2: And were--
Speaker 1: --I mean, and not--in that neighborhood, I'm talking about, you know, I'm talking twenty, thirty blocks.  So I think that would be, twenty, thirty blocks in depth and, you know, east to west and north to south, so it was pretty big.
Speaker 2: Was, was Louisville like a dangerous place for black folks outside of the neighborhood?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't get that sense, not in the '40s [1940s] when I was growing up there.  It was--we would, we would go down, you know, on Broadway, which was the, the main drag for parades and things like that.  But it was, it was a time when as I said, segregation was rampant and, you know, I don't remember a lot of the details in terms of whether or not people--I know you couldn't eat in restaurants or try on hats, or, you know, all that.  But, people just made their life outside of that, and tried to have as much normalcy as they could.  And that certainly was what happened in our case, where our life consisted of--church was really a focus, you know, there were social events related to church.  The, you know, Sunday school--my, a lot of my friends went to the church.  Then the elementary school--there were some of the same people, not totally.  Certainly when I went to junior high school, it was--we were kind of out of our neighborhood, and so we were, we were exposed to a larger group of people.
Story_ID: 186464
Speaker 1: How did you like school?  It sounds as if you would have been a good student.  I don't know.  Were you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I liked school.  I liked school, and I think in part would be--because I was a good student, and because I did get support and I did get the kind of attention that kind of helped me to continue to develop.  I can remember we had Latin in sixth grade.  They--the schools really had--you know, because of segregation a lot of the, the really brilliant teachers and all, didn't have many places to go.  And so even in, in elementary school and junior high school, we had a lot of people who were, you know, very, very strongly qualified.  And that certainly was the case as I, you know, left high school [Lincoln Institute, Lincoln Ridge, Kentucky] and went on to college [Ursuline College, Louisville, Kentucky].
Speaker 1: Now, who, who were some of the teachers in grade school that you remember?
Speaker 2: By name, or by--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, by name (laughter), if you remember their names.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm not remembering very many in grade school.  I do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) If there are any special ones that really helped you, or that you really admired?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The, the--our Latin teacher was one that I really admired, and Mrs. Black [ph.] was her name--was the name of another teacher that I really admired, and, and who really helped me.  Who, you know, saw something in me and helped to develop that.
Speaker 1: Was that at Phillis Wheatley [Elementary School, later, Wheatley Elementary School, Louisville, Kentucky], or at (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At Phillis Wheatley.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then after Phillis Wheatley, I went to Madison Junior High School [Shelbyville, Kentucky].  But, what, what happened after my dad [Adee Butler] became ill, we--and actually left, you know, his, his church [Youngs Chapel A.M.E. Church, Louisville, Kentucky].  He was promoted to presiding elder.  We moved from Louisville [Kentucky] to Shelbyville, Kentucky, which was a rural part of Kentucky.  It was very close; it was almost a suburb of Louisville.  But, it was, it was really rural.  And we--one of the things about the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church is that, again, this is, this is not a wealthy church, and so, as presiding elder, you know, dad did not make huge amounts of money.  One of the things that we ended up doing in order to have a place to stay is, we, we went and moved on this farm that was owned by these white people in Shelbyville.  And dad was not, was, daddy was too ill to do much, except to, you know, do his presiding elder duties.  But, my brother Adee [Conklin Butler, Jr.], the one who's eighteen months older than I am, he would, every day after school, work on the farm.  My younger brother, Lynwood [Odell Butler], was too young, but Adee almost became, you know, like a father figure because he, he, he learned to drive.  He was able to get his driver's license at age fifteen.  He did a lot of the work on the farm, and my mother [Jessie Norment Butler] worked in the house of the people who owned the farm.  So these--the people's name was Camera [ph.], and so, for three years we lived on this farm and it would be the equivalent, I guess, of sharecropping, except we didn't do that.  I mean we just took care of the farm for them.  That was, that was, that was the, the arrangement.
Speaker 1: Did they live on the premises too?
Speaker 2: They lived on the premises, right, right.  And we just lived right, you know, down the road from them.  But, basically he got built-in help to take care of the farm for him.
Story_ID: 186465
Speaker 1: --Your brother [Adee Conklin Butler, Jr.] really kind of stepped up to fill the void?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And, and when--but when your father [Adee Butler] died I guess, I suppose it was a tremendous blow emotionally, but also economically, I guess, to the family?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  It was just; it was just the most--such a hugely devastating time.  I think that for me the emotional devastation began when he began getting ill.  He died when I was fourteen, so, you know, by eleven and twelve, you, you know, clearly our whole status was changing because even though the, a presiding elder in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church is, is a higher rank than a minister, in the reality of, of that in, in the '40s [1940s] was that, you know, he really, he really didn't make a lot of money.
Speaker 1: And did, did you all live in a parsonage at the other church, or, did you have like a--was there a minister's home (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You mean at--when he was--
Speaker 1: --associated with the--
Speaker 2: --a presiding elding [ph.]?
Speaker 1: No, when he was a minister at Youngs [Chapel A.M.E. Church, Louisville, Kentucky]?
Speaker 2: Oh, right, Youngs Chapel.
Speaker 1: You lived in a parsonage (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, right, we lived in a parsonage right next to the church.
Speaker 1: --yeah, so then that was, there was no rent, I guess, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, that was provided by the church (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --church took care of that, right.
Speaker 2: --exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: So not only was he making less money, but he had to pay more to live?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And, and I'm really not sure what he made, but, certainly there was--you had, he had to provide a place for us to live and that's why we ended up on this place.  And I, I, I know it must have been devastating for him in some ways, you know, to bring his family to basically live on "the place," as we used to call it in those days.  I mean, he never said this to me.  And basically dad died after we were out there [farm in Shelbyville, Kentucky] one year.  We stayed a couple of years afterwards.  And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now this is '51 [1951], right, 1951?
Speaker 2: Right, he died in '51 [1951]. And then we stayed a couple of years after, until my brother and I both graduated from high school.  And then we, we moved back into Louisville [Kentucky]--
Story_ID: 186466
Speaker 1: Now, what high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Lincoln Institute in, at Lincoln Ridge, Kentucky.  That was a boarding school that had been set up by the State of Kentucky for blacks who lived in, in places where there were very few blacks and they didn't want them to integrate the schools, so they, they provided this boarding school.  And these, these people would come to Lincoln Institute.  So there were all, also many of us who were day students, who lived, you know, within the general vicinity of Lincoln Ridge, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: So you could commute?
Speaker 2: I was a commuter, right, I road the school bus everyday.  So we walked up, you know, a couple of miles, or whatever--a mile to a certain point where my brother [Adee Conklin Butler, Jr.] and I caught the school bus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was Lincoln Institute like?  Did you like it?
Speaker 2: I liked it, I really did.  It was a very interesting place.  It was headed by a name, a guy, man named Whitney Young, Whitney Young, Sr.  His son, Whitney Young, Jr., would eventually become, as you know, president of the National Urban League.  Whitney Young, Sr. was a noted educator.  When I was at Lincoln, Whitney Young, Jr. was not there.  But, I actually worked in the office for, for Whitney Young, Sr.  I was not, you know, I was one of the student typists and, and employees.  I worked there--actually was able to get a job there in the summer.  But I liked it.  I liked it a lot.  There were a couple of teachers there that I, I remember, and one is actually, I, I believe, still living.  And I liked, was a very favorite of mine, Mrs. Gearing, G-E-A-R-I-N-G, Lorraine Gearing, and she was the librarian and also the English teacher.  And she said that she saw something in my writing early on, and in fact, she said she, she sometimes wondered if I actually wrote some of the things I turned in, because she thought they showed some level of maturity.  And she, she really had to set me straight several times because I remember once I was in the library and I, I had this big book, but I was really reading 'True Confessions,' and so, she walked up one time and I had this big book and I was, I was definitely into 'True Confessions,' and she saw it, and you know, she stopped me, and you know, laid me out, as they say, and you know, just, just really tried to let me know that, you know, I was better than 'True Confessions.'  I kept reading 'True Confessions,' however, but that's one of the things, you know, my reading, you know, I read so many kinds of books.  I mean, I read the great books, but I also read, you know, that was, that was how I was learning a little bit about, you know, love and romance, I guess, because I wasn't getting very--doing very much, as a--as in my--in my little preacher daughter role.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were curious about what, what other people, wilder people did.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, exactly.
Story_ID: 186467
Speaker 1: Now you're writing [at Lincoln Institute, Lincoln Ridge, Kentucky].  Now, did you write a lot, or did you write any, I mean, did you write more than most youth, you think?
Speaker 2: You know, I honestly cannot remember that I was, you know, that--I didn't keep diaries, I didn't you know, I didn't write poems.  I don't know where this idea for being a reporter and a journalist, I can't really directly trace, trace its, its origins.
Speaker 1: What did your parents--your parents were both educated?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: All of you; your mother [Jesse Norment Butler] went to normal school [Lane College, Jackson, Tennessee], which is something a lot of people didn't have a chance to do.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Your, your father [Adee Butler], you know, attended three black colleges and graduated from Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  I think--
Speaker 1: Did, you know--
Speaker 2: --that, you know, Rust [College, Holly Springs, Mississippi] was really more of a high school, the one in--I believe it was, and the colleges were--
Speaker 1: You know, thinking about those days and the type of English they taught, I would imagine that the, the level of discourse was higher in your family, I don't know, or what, than it would be in normal black households.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think, I think that it definitely was.  And I think when you add to that, the, the fact of the ministry and the, you know, the, the Bible and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oratory and all that.
Speaker 2: --all the things that, right, that my dad was reading.  I remember a book he had called 'Think and Grow Rich' by Napoleon Hill, which I, you know, subsequently took off his shelf and, and became a part of my library.  He, it, you know, it's funny when I, I can't even remember a lot of the sermons that my dad preached.  But when I go back to, when I use, I used to try to go back to the church, because the church is still standing, and my sisters and brothers still attend Youngs Chapel [A.M.E. Church, Louisville, Kentucky], one sister and one brother still attend Youngs Chapel.  But, some of the older people there tell me that my dad used to teach a lot about--used to preach a lot about love and, but I have to say I don't really remember a lot that he taught.  But--
Speaker 1: So you were reading about love though?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But he was preaching about a different kind of love.  But, he, you know, he, he--what were the blocks that made him a builder, I don't know.  I mean, when I think about a man, and I've written a column, I wrote a column about it actually, you know, what would the, what, what was going on with a man who, in the midst of a, of a war, World War II [WWII], who with the--this working class congregation, decided that yes, he was going to build a church and it's a legacy that still stands.  The, but then as I said, he, he was known as a builder and he--I just wish I could have known him more as a, as a, as a slightly older child, because of course, you know, I was just at the age where he was just my father, you know, I was--I never--I didn't really have the opportunity to talk to him as I would have, and I, and frankly in the last you know, year or two of his life.  He was, he, he really wasn't well.  But, you know, I just, just never really had those talks that sometimes you have at, if you're, if you get to be twenty-five or thirty and you go back and you know, you really talk with your parents.  I do know that I really was the apple of my daddy's eye.  My sister and all, they all tell me that, and I felt it too, that, that I, that I was, I was you know, real special to my dad, and that was, that was special.  But, as I said, unfortunately, I never had the chance to really have a more developed you know, adult relationship.
Story_ID: 186468
Speaker 1: Now, in high school [at Lincoln Institute, Lincoln Ridge, Kentucky] were you involved in very many activities in, in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I was, as I said, I was in the oratorical club and did a lot of, did a lot of oratory.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did a lot of writing, but I mean, but I'm thinking writing for classes.  I don't even remember that we had a high school paper, so I think we didn't.
Speaker 1: But do you--do you think it may be you know, that you read so much, I mean it's got to inform the way you think and the way you put words on paper, you know.
Speaker 2: I think it was that.  I think my father [Adee Butler] also subscribed to several papers.  We got--we read the, he got the Louisville Defender, which was the black weekly newspaper.  The Courier-Journal, the Louisville Times.  So, you know, newspapers were constantly coming into my home.  I think that was a part of it as well.
Speaker 1: And you read them I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm sure I read a lot of the comics, but I read the front pages as well.  But, the Louisville Defender was a very important, important part of the life of our community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, in high school did you run for class office or anything like that, or were you considered a leader in high school?
Speaker 2: I did not run for class office.  I think I was considered, you know, quote, unquote "smart," you know.  One of the things that again, when I--you mention the, the weight problem.  When I went to, first went to Lincoln, I was really heavy.  I was weighing two hundred pounds.  So this was not a time when I was doing--when I wanted to be out front doing much at all, but it was while I was at Lincoln, when my dad died, that I, that I also, you know, lost a great deal of weight.  And then I felt like I was--I wanted to be more involved and more active.  But, I was never involved in sports or you know, any of those kind of things.  Most of mine was of the more, you know, intellectual variety, speaking and trying to do very well in my classes.  When I graduated in the, in the yearbook, I said that I wanted to be either a reporter, or I may have said a journalist, or a lawyer.  So those were the two, or I think, I specifically, I said a children's lawyer, and, I'm not sure what that, what that is, but that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're not sure why you would say that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it would, it would be because of you know, my religious upbringing and, and wanting to do something for others, and who would be the most vulnerable would be, you know, children--young people who got into trouble.  I think that is what I was thinking.
Speaker 1: Did you know youth, you know, during that time that, that were in trouble that you were thinking about maybe?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really.  I mean I know there were a lot, you know, people in our neighborhood, who, who didn't do that well.  I don't remember any who were actually, you know, deeply involved in any kind of, you know, I mean, who, who were being chased by the police or anything like that.  But, you know, there was always that segment in a, in a, in a black community like that, of people who stood on the corner, you know, didn't have jobs and you could, you could see that they, they, they hadn't made very much out of their lives.  But, so I think it was, you know, how you're--in high school you have all these thoughts and you're not really sure what it is that you want to do, but it, but it was interesting that, that I said that I was interested in either being a lawyer or, or a journalist, or a reporter.  And soon after high school I, I really started trying to put that into, into motion to at least see if there was anything, you know, to see if I could find out more about these professions.
Story_ID: 186469
Speaker 1: As I mentioned, I went to Ursuline College in Louisville [Kentucky].
Speaker 2: How did that happen?  How did you end up, end up going to Ursuline (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That happened because--through Mrs. Gearing, the high school teacher that I told you that I liked so much.  She said that--she apparently heard that, you know, this school was looking for--they wanted to, to integrate and they were looking for black students--black girls, and she recommended me.  And certainly if I had not had a scholarship, I would not have been able to go.  This was--there were eight of us who integrated Ursuline College.  And this was not--this was, you know, a peaceable integration because the, the nuns, and you know, they had come to the conclusion that it was time to do that.  So this would've--this was 1953.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I went there for, for two years.  But while I was there as a--I got a job at the Louisville Defender in the afternoon, and it was that work at the Louisville Defender that helped to shape my journalistic ambitions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 186470
Speaker 1: My brother [Adee Conklin Butler, Jr.], as I said, who became kind of, almost took up the slack when my father [Adee Butler] got ill and after he died, had actually started working when he was--I think he used to sell ice when he was seven or eight years old, you know.  So, he's always worked.  When I started working in the office at Lincoln Institute [Lincoln Ridge, Kentucky] and then when I graduated from Lincoln and started Ursuline College [Louisville, Kentucky], I also was looking for a job to help the family, to help myself, even though I had a scholarship to Lincoln, obviously there were other needs.  And so I was able to get a job at the Louisville Defender.  I was hired to type letters for Mr. Stanley after school.  But after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who was Mr. Stanley?
Speaker 1: Mr. Frank Stanley was the editor of the Louisville Defender.  And I had been there a few weeks and he came in one day and he said, "Dorothy, the society editor is, is ill."  And he said, "I'm gonna send you out to cover some stories."  So, at the age of seventeen, after having this pretty sheltered, certainly not totally, but this pretty sheltered life as a, as a minister's daughter, I'm, I'm working, I'm covering social stories for, you know, black Louisville [Kentucky] for the Louisville Defender.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: At age seventeen?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, I graduated from high school at sixteen.  And I'm sure my writing was not that good and I'm sure I didn't--I had a lot to learn, but the, the importance of that was that it really showed me that journalism could be a key that could open the door to you know, people, institutions, new ideas, all these things that I, I never knew about.  I didn't know, for example, you know, we--people, some of these people in Louisville actually existed, except for having read about them in the Louisville Defender.  But now, I was out interviewing them and writing about them, and it really just, underscored, it, it concretized my determination to be a journalist because I saw, what, what being a journalist could do.  I met all kind of people that I would have never met.  I remember meeting the first black who had gone to--who was from Louisville, who went to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] and who, who came through, and I'll show you, I think I have a picture from that era.
Speaker 2: Well, what's his name, can you remember?
Speaker 1: I'm sure I'll--hopefully it's on the back, otherwise I can get it to you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I think he was--if he wasn't the first black, he was certainly one of the first blacks from Louisville to go to West Point.
Speaker 2: Is that the one they did the television movie about, or is that (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  So, I think I'm wrong.  I don't think he was the first, but it was certainly significant even (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He still, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --at that point.
Speaker 2: --to have gone at all and to be a veteran (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Right.  To be at West Point, right.  And, I mean, but those were the kinds of things we did.  I remember one year I covered the Kentucky Derby, you know, which was, you know, I--the closest I had gotten to the Kentucky Derby was when people used to park their cars on our lawns, you know, that everybody tried to get a little bit of the action when they had the Kentucky Derby every year.  And our--I think mother [Jessie Norment Butler] actually would--people would actually stay in our house, if I'm not mistaken, so.  But I had never been to Churchill Downs [Louisville, Kentucky] and here I was, you know, writing and getting names--in the middle.  And I just, it just opened up, it just showed me what a, what a--that journalism really was a key to open, open the door to worlds I didn't know about.
Speaker 2: So this is 1955 or so?
Speaker 1: Right.  I worked there from 1953 to 1955--
Story_ID: 186471
Speaker 1: And then I transferred to Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri.  I wanted to go to the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri] because I'd heard of that and knew it was a good school, and, but they did not offer me any assistance.  I asked for assistance.  They had no scholarships.  But Lincoln University did offer me a scholarship and I went to Lincoln University and graduated in 1957.  That was a great experience in many, many ways, although I was, you know, pretty quiet.  And, but, it was first of all just going--being away, away from home for the first time was very wonderful.  And being on my own and I had gone into a sorority while I was at Ursuline [College, Louisville, Kentucky], a city chapter, so I'm an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].  So, when I got there I was already an AKA.  So I was able to, you know, meet my sorors [sorority sister] and it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They introduced you to people and--
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.
Speaker 2: --as a soror.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly, exactly.  So that was a wonderful way to quickly integrate into the school.  I spent a lot of time at the journalism school, down at the bottom of the hill.  I was the editor of the [Lincoln] Clarion, the school newspaper.  I was the--I'm pretty sure my, my views were not very distinguished at that point.  One of my favorite teachers there was Doctor Armistead S. Pride, who was the dean of the school of journalism.  He was very, very encouraging.  And my--another very favorite teacher was Doctor Lorenzo Greene, who was a history professor.  And his gift to me was just to really begin to expand my horizons as a black person in America.  I remember he used to talk about, you know, our history didn't begin with slavery.  And, you know, this, these were ideas that I really hadn't embraced before then.  Doctor Lorenzo Greene was--had been associated as--in a very--I'm not sure what, I think he may have been like his intern, had been an intern I believe, to Carter G. Woodson--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --who was the founder of Black History Week, now Black History Month.  And--
Speaker 2: With the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History [later, Association for the Study of African American Life and History], right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm, and Doctor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lorenzo Greene was yeah--he was very well known.
Speaker 1: Yes, he was, he was--one of his specialties was on Missouri history.  But, he also just--he was such a marvelous teacher, and just made everything come alive.  And it just planted in me the seeds of wanting to know more about Africa and wanting to know more about this history, and, you know, you--when you, when you grow up in these segregated environments, no matter how much your parents and your church, and your community, and your school are trying to encourage you and tell you that you can make it and, you know, you're as good as anybody else, you know, you still get all these other messages from the larger society.  You know, I wasn't seeing black images in movies.  I wasn't seeing black images on television, very, very, occasionally.  I wasn't seeing black images on--in the, in the daily newspaper.  So, a lot of the larger world was not reinforcing these messages.  So, Reverend Greene, Reverend Greene, Doctor Greene just began to, you know, just planted those seeds that, that made me want to know more and made me, you know, kind of thirst for greater knowledge of this, of, of our people before all of this, this horror of segregation began.  So that was a very, very important thing.  I had a lot of fun at Lincoln.  As I said, I was quiet.  I didn't, I didn't--I think I still had a lot of the, you know, that sort of preacher's daughter mentality of not, you know not--just instead trying to kind of do my work.  And it's funny, I went to a--I was just inducted into the hall of fame at Lincoln earlier this year.  And I went back and a couple of people said, "Well, now, who did you date," you know, and they were like--and I was like, "Oh, you know, I was kind of quiet."  I didn't have a lot of big, big stories about that, you know.
Speaker 2: Did you date?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I dated some, yeah.  But I didn't remember the guys' names, so it couldn't have been very important.  I'm sure if I thought about it, you know, I would probably have gotten a, gotten a little better there.  But, so that was an important, that was an important experience for me.

Speaker 1: When I finished Lincoln [University, Jefferson City, Missouri] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Now what, what year is this, when you finished?
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-seven [1957].  Tried to get a job on--tried at the Louisville Defender, tried at the, at the Courier-Journal, trying to get a daily newspaper job, no encouragement at all.  So, I went back to--I went to Memphis [Tennessee] and got a job at the Tri-State Defender.  And it was August 1957.  And [L.] Alex Wilson was a tall, gruff, ex-marine who really knew how to, knew really how to turn a story, and he was trying to teach me how to tell a story.  The big story of that era was, was Little Rock [Arkansas], the integration of Little Rock [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].  And Memphis is just a few miles from Little Rock.  Mr., Mr. Wilson had been watching the unfolding of all these events, you know, all the machinations of [Governor Orval] Faubus and so when it was time for integration, he went over to, to, to cover it, and he said, all right, you stay back here, you're a rookie, you don't know what you're doing, I mean, he didn't use those words, but that was the implication.  And it was quite--he was quite right.  He was the one who should have been there to cover that story, and he did.  What happened, however, though is that, as you know, the--Governor Faubus called out the [Arkansas] National Guard in, in pretense of trying to protect the children, but in, but in reality, he was, he was trying to stop them from entering the school.  And Alex Wilson drove up to the school to cover and he was with a group of other black reporters and he was actually beaten when he refused to run--the crowd, the crowd jumped on him and they, they--you know, he was pelted with rocks and even though--now the students didn't actually get into the school on that day because the, the Arkansas National Guard stopped them.  There was one student who was not with the rest of the eight, Elizabeth Eckford, and she tried to come in and she didn't know the plan, that they were all coming in together and she ended up getting hustled out of there.  But, Wilson, I think what they thought when they saw Wilson coming with some of these other black reporters, they thought they, they were the parents of these children and they started you know, screaming and yelling, you know, "Get the niggers, get the niggers."  And they--he was, he was, he was really seriously hurt, so, I left Memphis and went to Little Rock, and the--that was in Little Rock.  We went to the home of Mrs. Daisy Bates, who was the editor, I'm sorry, who was the president of the Little Rock NAACP [National Association for the Advancement  of Colored People], and I, you know, met a lot of the reporters, including some of the reporters from Jet magazine.  I did some writing, obviously, I, I don't, I don't remember what I wrote, but I certainly was very much a beginning writer, but apparently what I wrote was okay.
Story_ID: 186473
Speaker 1: In addition to covering that [1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas], what came out of it was that I met some people from Jet magazine and in October of 1957, I was hired as an associate editor of Jet magazine, and went to Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As an associate editor?
Speaker 1: But that's what they called everybody.  I mean I was just a writer and, you know, still very young at that.  The editor of Jet at that time was a man named [Edward] Buck Clayton, and he, he, he told me one time he said, "Oh, you write like you've got concrete in your fingers."  So, they, they gave me a pretty hard time.  But I think out of all that, you know, you end up learning to write better, and you, you continue, I continued to hopefully grow as a journalist.  That was, that was a enormously interesting time, enormously interesting.  The--as you know, Jet magazine is a place for everybody, certainly at that point.  I don't know what happened now, but you know, every star didn't--you know, who came to Chicago, came by Jet.  Everybody wanted a picture in Jet.
Speaker 2: Now, did you--were you stationed in Chicago?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  I'm twenty years old, I'm working at Jet, and thank God that a couple of older people kind of took me under their wings and sheltered me so that I could weather that storm, because you know, it's a pretty fast moving--fast paced situation.  And my sister was already living in Chicago, so--that's my sister Evelyn [Butler Campbell], so she and I eventually got a place together and, so we lived together for the two years that I was there.  One of the--I covered lots of different stories, you know, lots of learning, hard work, you know, met some fascinating people.
Speaker 2: Were, were they mostly celebrity stories, or hard news stories?
Speaker 1: You know, there, there were a little of all of those things.  I even wrote those little blurbs that--about the girls in the, in the, you know, in the bathing suits, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Jet centerfolds.
Speaker 1: The Jet centerfolds.  I used to write those, just wrote a little of everything.  And I remember going to a prison in Illinois (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Pontiac [Correctional Center, Pontiac, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: No, I don't think that was the name of it, but interviewing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Statesville [Correctional Center, Crest Hill, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: --prisoners.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Was it Illinois or Indiana?  One of those--I went to prison more than once.  But I'm thinking of one in particular, I'm not sure, but it may have been in Indiana; you know, all those, those, all those states are contiguous.  That's where, that's when I met Tom Mboya, I mean there were a lot of people coming.  I think Sammy Davis, Jr. danced on a desk once when I was there.  I mean it was just an amazing time for this, you know, for somebody coming out of Louisville [Kentucky] and Lincoln [University, Jefferson City, Missouri] and you know, suddenly you're at the, at the--kind of the pinnacle in terms of where blacks come in and out, and, you know, where celebrities and--
Speaker 2: Did you know [HM] John Johnson?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: Did you--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: What, what was he like as a publisher?
Speaker 1: He was very much in his heyday at that point.  And you know he still is very, very active.  You know, he was, he was clearly the boss.  You know, he was, he was always driving and dynamic.  The--he, you know, just clearly, clearly a visionary, just an incredible mind.  Jet at that point was right--Jet and Ebony were kind of on the same floor, but we were in the front and Ebony was in the back.  The editor of Ebony at that point was a man named Herbert Nipson.  And I believe Lerone was there on staff, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 2: [HM] Lerone Bennett, right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: What about Era Bell Thompson?
Speaker 1: She was there.  She was, she was the editor, and, and, Nip I think, was her--the co-editor.  I think when Era Bell died he became the editor.  You know, that, that information is--needs to be checked in terms of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --actual years.
Speaker 2: She was a significant leader in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But Era Bell was definitely there.
Speaker 2: --that, that position in those days.
Speaker 1: Oh yes.  That was incredible.
Speaker 2: She was from--
Speaker 1: She was marvelous.
Speaker 2: --North Dakota.  She's from North Dakota.  One of the, you know.
Speaker 1: She was marvelous, marvelous.
Speaker 2: I think her family was the only black family in town (laughter).
Speaker 1: And she, she wrote about those early experiences--marvelous writer and just an incredible, incredible journalist.  I felt so privileged, you know, being there and learned a lot.
Story_ID: 186474
Speaker 1: But, you know, I always had this idea that I wanted to be a daily journalist.  And the, and so, you know, I, I really knew that if I was really gonna be a daily journalist and work, work for a mainstream paper, I was going to have to get a credential other than Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri].  That was just the nature of the times, you know, the segregation was such that, you know, black schools were still not considered the equal of white schools.  And so I wanted to, I applied to Columbia University [Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York] and was told that I didn't have enough liberal arts hours to be, to actually be accepted, but if I got the liberal arts hours, you know, they would, they would want, want me as a student.  And so, I went--I took a year and went down to, to Tuskegee [Institute, later, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and, and got these twelve liberal arts hours.
Speaker 2: Now, what, what year was that when you went to Tuskegee?
Speaker 1: It would have been 1959.  So I worked at Ebony--Jet from 1957 to 1959.  And then I entered Columbia in September 1960.  I went to, Tuskegee as--along with [HM] Samuel Yette, Samuel Yette, who is the author of 'The Choice' ['The Choice: The Issue of Black Survival in America'].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He was a reporter, I'm sorry, he was a writer for Ebony.  And we became friends and so, when, he, he had left Ebony to go to Tuskegee as head of the information bureau, and so he gave me a job as the assistant director, I think it was.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you had a job there too as you--
Speaker 1: Right, so I got the twelve hours.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Sam Yette is important, very important.
Speaker 1: Very important, absolutely, I know you want him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he taught journalism at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  He has written several books.  I think his book, his book 'The Choice' is in about its twenty-first, twenty-second printing.  It's used at colleges and universities all over the country.  So he's a very important figure in black life, good friend of mine too.  I feel very--
Speaker 2: Okay.  You've got to give us his number before we leave (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 186475
Speaker 1: So you were at Columbia [University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York]--you went to Columbia then, in '60 [1960]?
Speaker 2: And graduated in June of '60 [1960]--1961.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was it like living in New York City [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, I lived at International House [of New York, New York, New York], and, which was a few blocks from Columbia.  That really helped to make the experience for me because there were a lot of international students there.  And so I was able to, you know, immediately make friends with, with people from all over the world.  And that, you know, that, that gave me a community, a, you know, a circle, kind of a little family, if you, if you, if you will.  Going to Columbia j [journalism] school was, was quite challenging, however.  There were two blacks in the class, one man and myself.  And years later I learned that, that my files had contained a letter from the person who interviewed me in Chicago [Illinois], you know, back when I, I was interested in applying.  And he indicated that, you know, he thought I was a very interesting person, but if Columbia did accept me they should know that there--that I'm a dark skinned black person.  I mean, there was, you know, this was, this was not going to be one of those people who was, going, going to kind of almost look black, maybe yes, maybe no.
Speaker 1: At a glance, when you glance in a classroom you would notice that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --that you were there.
Speaker 2: Right, you would notice, you'd notice me.  And the, the person who, Luther Jackson, who set that up, you know, later, years later found that letter.  I thought, that was the way it--that was America.  It was challenging.  Even though I had worked for Jet [Chicago, Illinois] for two years, I'd had a little bit of experience working at the Tri-State Defender [Memphis, Tennessee], a little bit at the Louisville Defender [Louisville, Kentucky], the people there had much, much, much, more--they'd been exposed to so much more than I had.  Many of them had been daily reporters.  Some had been daily editors.  The Columbia experience--they, I think they expected to give them some, you know, some broader, and some wider exposure.  The people there had definitely traveled all over the world, so many of them.  I just felt as though I was kind of out of my league, but I had to make it anyway.  But luckily I was blessed to have met a few women who became good friends of mine and they were part of the support structure.  I remember one of the professors there, John Hohenburg, said to me, you know, he said, "You have so many handicaps, you'll probably make it."  And I think he thought that was a compliment.  But he meant, you know, race and gender, and you know, that was the, that was the reality of what I was facing.  One of the things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were there very many white women in, in school with you?
Speaker 2: We always felt there was a quota of women period because the class had eighty people and there were about fifteen women period.  And some of the women said, you know, interestingly enough, that's about the number, you know, it's, it's been this--
Speaker 1: Always (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --this number for a while.  Now, I have not done any research on that.  I, I wouldn't make that statement in print until I, you know, double-checked to see if that was so.  But, no, there weren't that many white women, 15 percent--fifteen out of a class of eighty.
Story_ID: 186476
Speaker 1: --It was challenging [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York].  It was challenging.  Just, but it was also fascinating, and you know, unforgettable in so many ways, being in New York [New York], you know, being with this international crowd.  Then on the other hand being, in--at Columbia and, you know, really trying to prepare myself to go and be a daily journalist.  I really didn't know how much of a white male dominated business it was.  One of the ways I got hired was the--Columbia was one of those places that newspapers routinely sent their editors, you know, every spring to interview the students to see who might be bright, or potential employees, so I was, I was interviewed by Ben Gilbert of the Washington Post.  And he told me, he said, "You know, you're, you're an interesting person."  But, he said, "You need to go and get some more experience."  He said, "You need to go out into the boondocks and, and work on a daily newspaper because you've never had, you've never had, you've never worked on a daily.  And once you do that then come back and, and see us."  And--but he, he--this was, he said in a letter.  But he said, you know, "If you ever happen to be in Washington [D.C.], come meet our managing editor."
Story_ID: 186477
Speaker 1: And it just happened that, that seed that Mr.--Dr. [Lorenzo] Greene had planted about Africa was still very much, you know, in my, my heart and my spirit.  And I'd also met Tom Mboya when I was at, at Jet and that had also fueled my (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tom Mboya was a--
Speaker 1: He was the leader of--from Kenya.  He was the leader of the labor party [Kenya Federation of Labour, KFL] from Kenya, young guy, twenty-nine years old, just brilliant and you know, emerging as one of the, the final leaders in Kenya.
Speaker 2: He was--yeah, subsequently assassinated, right?
Speaker 1: Subsequently assassinated, yes.  But at this, at this time, you know, I was looking for a way to travel abroad.  And I learned of a program that started by a Harlem [New York, New York] minister named Reverend James [Herman] Robinson.  The program was called Operation Crossroads Africa.  And I was able to get a partial scholarship.  I was able to raise the money and--so after graduating from Columbia [University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York], I went to, I went to Kenya and spent the summer there.  And basically this is a program where they pair equal numbers of American students with an equal number of African students.  And so we, we--I, I went to Kenya with the group that went to Kenya.  Again, incredible experience, difficult (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, this was--
Speaker 1: --in many ways.  This was--
Speaker 2: --this was prior to Kenyan independence, right?  Or just--
Speaker 1: Yes, it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen--
Speaker 2: Just prior (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --it was 1961.  Kenyan independence was 1963--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but it was beginning that summer.  For example--
Speaker 2: So it was--
Speaker 1: --I, I was, I was in the small group of people who were in the compound in, in [Jomo] Kenyatta's compound when, when he was actually released from prison and he was allowed to come back to Gatundu [Kenya], which was his, was his compound near, near Kenya, near Nairobi [Kenya], rather.  And, you know, so on that day we were, you know, there unpacking dishes and, you know, just doing all these, this physical stuff.  But, you know, to witness his return to Gatundu from, at that point, he had, he had not, he was not coming directly from jail because he had been held in some other--the, you know, remote places.  But that was a wonderful experience.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 186012
Speaker 1: --This was a time of great change.  This was a time of enormous change.  I mean on the one hand you were having the, you know, the Civil Rights Movement was in full swing.  I, I didn't mention that one of the advantages of being in Tuskegee [Institute, later, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] a year and, and actually living in the South, was and Tuskegee is right down the road, as they would say down there, from Montgomery, Alabama.  So I had a chance to go to [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King's [Jr.] church to hear him preach; to hear him--I didn't go every week or anything, but I was able to, you know, to have a close up and personal look at history of that period.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now that was right after the bus boycott [1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott], right?
Speaker 1: Right, that was right after the bus--
Speaker 2: It was in '59 [1959] right after--
Speaker 1: -- that was right after the bus boycott. But the Civil Rights Movement was in full swing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Then of course, in--worldwide, especially in Africa, you had the, you had the move for African freedom, and that's what I was tasting when I, when I went to Africa.  So, this is a time of just incredible change.  And here I was coming of age in this incredible period and actually living in the middle of it as a journalist.  Again, you know, very young, very much in, in the early stages.  But, just, the time at Jet, then at Columbia [University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York], preparing for, you know, the next stage, then having the opportunity to go to Africa in 1961.  And one of the things that Africa did for me, just, I can remember landing in, in Nigeria because we actually stayed in Nigeria for a week before we--before our group was flown to Kenya.  I remember getting off the plane and, just, the tremendous importance to me of seeing that many black people, you know, walking down the streets and then seeing blacks in all kind of jobs.  That was something I'd never seen growing up in Louisville [Kentucky] and, and, you know, being born in Memphis [Tennessee]; you know, airline ticket agents, police, stewardesses, you know, just jobs that normal people held.  And that was very, very important to me, to be able to see that, you know, my horizons started expanding.  And then once we got to Kenya, again at this point, independence had not yet come, but independence was in the works and the people would ride around and they'd say, "Uhuru, uhuru, uhuru," you know.  Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Cecetrusa [ph.], Andeana [ph.], you know.  That whole idea of freedom was, was there as well.  So I had left an America where, you, you know, you had this awakening and, and freedom was being, was being shouted and then I moved into Africa and that was happening there.  And basically what we did, our group [Operation Crossroads Africa], there were seventeen of us.  We, we built a road leading to a children's hospital, but it gave us a chance to really work with the African students and to just have a more normal experience than many people have when they go to Africa.  And that was the idea behind this, behind this trip.
Story_ID: 186013
Speaker 1: At the end of that summer [in Africa with Operation Crossroads Africa, 1961], I came back to, I came back to the U.S.  But I missed something, and that is--I forgot to tell you something.  When the program, the Operation Crossroads [Africa] program was going to--getting ready to go off to Africa, they brought all the students to Washington [D.C.] for an orientation because we were all going to different countries.  And in the letter from Ben Gilbert of the [Washington] Post, he told me if I was ever in Washington I should come by the newspaper and meet their managing editor.  Well, I was in Washington on my way to Africa, so I called and said, "I'd like to come by."  So I went to the Post and I met the managing editor, a man named [Alfred] Al Friendly.  And he said, "What brings you to Washington?"  And I told him I was on my way to Africa and he said, "Oh my, that's, that's interesting."  He was--he said, you know, "Have you--will you write me some stories from there?"  And I said, "Sure."  And that was not hard to do because there was so much to write about.
Speaker 2: That's right, a lot of drama in Kenya (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A lot of drama.
Speaker 2: Jomo Kenyatta.
Speaker 1: Oh my, yes, exactly.
Speaker 2: [Jaramogi] Oginga Odinga (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 2: All of them.
Speaker 1: And we were--because we were American students, we were--we had access to a lot of things.  You know, we could go--I mean it was a very, a very tense situation in many ways, but we still had access, in that we were able to go to, you know, to have these people come to us and speak to us.  I already knew [Tom] Mboya, so that was, you know, that was a friendship.  I met a lot of other people.  I mean it was--I'm not saying it wasn't difficult and challenging, but the bottom line was that it was, it was really one of those unforgettable experiences.  And, so I wrote some stories for the Post.  And when I came back I--they called me at my home in Louisville [Kentucky] and asked if I wanted to come and work for them.  And that is the--that was my, that was my first--the Washington Post was my first daily newspaper job in 1961.  October 1961, is when I went there.
Story_ID: 186014
Speaker 1: That was an incredibly challenging experience [working at the Washington Post, Washington, D.C.].  There were two other blacks in, in--reporters at the newspapers--two men, so I was the first black woman.  And I was on the city staff.  At that point there weren't that many women reporters and a lot of them were in the women's section.  So, to be there and to be on the city staff was a, was a--different as well.  Washington, D.C. in the fall of 1961 was a very sleepy, very segregated town.  This was several years before the Public Accommodations Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title II].  And there were not many places downtown where I could eat; getting taxicabs to cover my stories was, was so hard.  There were--I can remember standing on corners, you know, after having covered a story, trying to get back to the office to write it and, you know, just unable to get anybody to pick me up.  You know, the minutes are ticking away.  Meanwhile, it was the time and because I--there were so few of us, I, I couldn't go back and complain everyday.  I couldn't go back and, and tell all my woes, I couldn't get a cab.  I'm late because a taxi wouldn't pick me up.  You know, you couldn't do that because you'd just be dismissed as a whiner and you know, and if I didn't succeed it was going to be harder for the next person.  So, it just was very, very, very challenging.  I just think God was with me through the whole thing.  And, you know, I managed to do, I think, some good work; wrote stories about Junior Village [Washington, D.C.], which was like an orphanage for children.  This was during the [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy era.  [Jacqueline] Jackie Kennedy went to Junior Village after a lot of the stories that I wrote.  And I, you know, covered her when she went out there.  I wrote--a lot of stories I was able to get into the, to the black communities in, in ways that perhaps had not been penetrated before and got a, got a lot of stories.  During this time at the Post I also got married.  In 1962, married [HM] Sam Gilliam, an artist from--who I had met in, in Louisville [Kentucky] when I was a freshman in college [at Ursuline College, Louisville, Kentucky].  And so we, we got married and a, a year later we had our first child, daughter Stephanie [ph.].  And I--it surprised me, you know, how much I wanted to spend just a little more time with her.  And I remember asking them at the Post, you know, can I just--please work four days instead of five; having this new baby--I had a maternity leave.  I mean I had a four month maternity leave, so that was wonderful.  But when I went back I wanted to try to have a little time with her and they, they finally said, "Okay."  And then after a while they said, "No, you can't do it anymore."  I said, "Why not?"  And they said, "Well, you're, you're lowering the morale at the office because there are other people who'd like to work part time, and if we let you work part time, we have to let everybody work part time.  There are men who'd like to, you know, write the great American novel, but you know, so, you know, we just can't let you do it anymore."  So, I think I got pregnant a second time so I'd have an excuse to quit.  And so I quit the Post and--when I went on maternity leave with my second child, who's my daughter, Melissa [ph.].  And actually stayed out seven years, and--
Speaker 2: So that's, that's from what time to--that's from 19--
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-five [1965] until 19--and I went back in 1972.  I didn't know that I'd be rehired.  I had no idea that I would be rehired.  I was just, you know, as a young mother trying to do--work in journalism in ways that could help me accommodate, you know, our young family.
Story_ID: 186015
Speaker 1: So I did television.  I did free-lanced articles.  Wrote articles, I think, for Redbook magazine.  I was on a program for channel five here [Washington, D.C.], now Fox Television, then it was just WTTG-TV, program called Panorama with a guy named Maury Povich.
Speaker 2: Maury Povich who has the--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --'Maury Povich Show' now.  He's--
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.  He was--he and another woman were the co-hosts of the show.  I was--there were two of us who came on a couple times a week and did these special reports.  So I was one of those.  And that, that was very, that was very good.  That was a good experience, but I was very happy to return to print journalism because I, I just really felt it was more substantive.  I could get, I could really get more deeply into a story, even though I returned as an editor.  I was glad to be back on a newspaper.  One thing that's important about the time I was on maternity leave is that I got a chance to attend the 1963 March on Washington as a participant, not as a journalist.  The march was in August, and I didn't go back to the, to the [Washington] Post until September.  So, my husband [HM Sam Gilliam] and I marched in the, in the March on Washington.  So I was there that day with all those crowds and all of the--I had--very caught up in the, the fear and the trepidation on the part of President [John Fitzgerald] Kennedy and so many leaders in Washington [D.C.] as to, you know, would there be violence and what, what would be the outcome.  And it was just such a beautiful, peaceful day.  And I still remember the excitement when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] spoke, you know, what a mesmerizing speaker, and just such a, such a thrill to really be there to hear the I Have a Dream speech.
Speaker 2: So you weren't--you never wrote about that, or, or anything during that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, I wasn't, I wasn't--no, no I was, I was in my special little motherhood cocoon at that point, so.
Speaker 2: Did you hear any good stories about it that, that weren't written?  You know, because its so many personalities were involved in it.  And the whole idea of--I know, Malcolm X has a speech where he talks about how SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] organized it, and then the Kennedy Administration pulls together the "Big Six" and asked them to stop it.  And they said, well we didn't start it, so we can't stop it.  So, he said, well, let's get in it and then maybe we can be part of it, you know, and not, not look like we are opposed to it, you know.  And so, there's a, there was a lot of intrigue involved in that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There was a lot of intrigue.
Speaker 2: And as a reporter I wonder if you heard--
Speaker 1: --and as I said, I had I left on maternity leave in I believe, May or June of 1963.  When a lot of the stories were, you know--the story was building during that time and then I came back after it was over.  So I wasn't actually a part of the reporting and that makes such a difference in terms of your knowledge of what's really going on on the inside.  But, so I, I can't say that I can tell you anything that probably hasn't already been written.
Story_ID: 186016
Speaker 1: Well, as a reporter did you ever cover any of the [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy Administration's civil rights activities, Louis [E.] Martin, or, or any of those people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I covered the integration of Ole Miss [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi], which happened under the Kennedy Administration.  The [Washington] Post sent a team of reporters down there and that was one of the times when I called on my friend, [HM] Ernest Withers, who I had met when I was working for the Tri-State Defender [Memphis, Tennessee].  He, because he very often worked as a photographer for the Tri-State Defender.  The Post wanted me to go to--cover the black community.  And I--this was 1962, September, October 1962.  I hadn't been married very long.  The, the only reason--one of reason I wasn't afraid to go was because I knew that, that if Withers went with me, he was gonna help me pull this off because Ernest Withers was not just a photographer.  He was a man who knew the South.  He knew the players.  He knew how to move around.  So I flew into Memphis [Tennessee] and he and I drove to Oxford [Mississippi] from Memphis.  We were stopped on the way by this, this, this truck that had those gun racks over the top of it.  I don't know what he said--I don't remember what he said, but he got out and talked to them.  I knew how cheap my life was in Mississippi.  And tensions were high, so high.  You know, given the fact of the pending integration by James Meredith.  And this was before, you know, Kennedy had actually called out the [U.S.] Army.  But one of the things that happened, was that as a reporter, I didn't have any--I couldn't stay in a hotel.  There was no black hotel in Oxford, Mississippi.  The, the--my white counterpart, a guy named [William] Bill Claiborne stayed at the Sun and Sea Motel.  That's where all the white reporters were staying.  I had to stay with families.  One night I stayed in a funeral home.  And interestingly enough, Withers does not remember this.  I have to--one of the things I need to do is go down and interview him as well.  He says he didn't remember that.  But I, I could not have made that up.  It was just too fantastical.  It was a frightening time, frightening time because there was just, just--you had Governor Ross Barnett standing in the school house--in the college door, "You'll never get into Ole Miss."  James Meredith determined, finally Kennedy calls out the Army and escorts him in.  So, this was an incredible story to cover.  And I remember I wrote articles for the outlook section of the Post.  But again, Ernest Withers was just a godsend.  He knew the people to take me to.  He knew how to steer me through.
Story_ID: 186017
Speaker 1: [HM] Ernest Withers was the person who, who led me through the experience [1962 integration of University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi].  And I think it very much speaks to, you know, those of us who were of a different generation.  But, but, you know, looking back to, to for help to people who--like Ernest Withers, who, he was able to make it happen for me and help me to turn out a really wonderful story.  But--you know, he took the pictures.  He also took me over to meet Medgar Evers.  Little did we know that before long Medgar Evers would be shot.  But it was a very, very frightening time.  And just very--I mean, my experiences were, were typical of the experiences black journalists at that point, had in just covering the South and covering the Civil Rights Movement.  You see a lot of focus on the fact that television was in its finest hour in covering the Civil Rights Movement because those television images really were important, and they helped to educate America--Americans to the--what was happening in the South.  And, and, you know, it was a very important tool.  But I think it's also important to really give credit to those black journalists who worked for Ebony and Jet and who worked for the black press.  Who, who covered all of those things and those stories under, under great stress and under great duress.  You know, my experiences, you know, having to find someplace to sleep at night, not being able to check into a hotel and, you know, hang your clothes up and know you'll be there and safe at night, but not knowing where you'll sleep, that was very typical of black journalists of that era.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I have a lot of regard for what they did and for the role of the black press, as an advocacy press, as a press with a mission.  And, even though much of my career has been in the mainstream media, I still, you know, I still have much admiration because from my time in the black press, I became very aware of what they were able to accomplish against the odds.
Story_ID: 186018
Speaker 1: Just a, I guess a follow up on--that [integration of University of Mississippi] was '62 [1962] in [Oxford] Mississippi, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then in '63 [1963]--
Speaker 2: It was the March on Washington.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also Birmingham [Alabama], you know when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, I did not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did not.
Speaker 1: So you weren't down there for Birmingham or--were you in, in Mississippi in '64 [1964] when the Freedom Summer activities were going on?
Speaker 2: No, no, I was not.  I was writing primarily in Washington [D.C.] at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did, did you cover the [Democratic National] Convention of '64 [1964] in Atlantic City [New Jersey] when (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, no.  The way the [Washington] Post was organized, a lot of those stories were covered by the national desk.  I was on the city desk.  And, what happened is during that time, the reason I was able to go do some of those stories, like Mississippi, was some of those stories came under the aegis of the city desk, and, but, most of the other stories you named were called national stories and done by national reporters.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well in terms of Washington, D.C., let's see, what was happening on the local scene in [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: On the local scene in D.C.--first of all, I've always been a resident of D.C.  At that point, my, my husband [HM Sam Gilliam] and I were living up in upper northwest Washington.  Later we moved to Mount Pleasant, the Mount Pleasant section of Washington, which is a very economically and racially diverse section.  And what was happening in Washington at that point, in the early '60s [1960s] was that Washington still had never had an elected mayor.  The, Washington was being run by, a system of three commissioners and they had a congressional committee that oversaw it.  And they had some awful overseers of the district, very, very, hard on D.C.
Speaker 1: Just the name overseer kind of brings to mind (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, kind of gives you an idea of what was going on.  A lot of the--you know, some southern congressmen were, were part of that cabal, but basically there were two--the commissioners were two whites and one black--Mr. [John Bonner] Duncan.  Washington would, would remain under that commissioner system until the--
Speaker 1: Was that [HM] Charles Duncan, the attorney?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I'm sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 2: No, I bought this house from Charles Duncan, who used to live here.  That's why, that's what made me pause there for a minute, because--but no, this was not him, or no relation to him as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The, the other thing was that in addition to what was happening on a civil rights front, with the passage of the Voting Rights Bill [Voting Rights Act of 1965], with the passage of the Public Accommodations Bill [Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title II], you also had the beginning of the urban insurrections, many people call them riots, I call them urban insurrections culminating of course, with the death of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] in 1968.  Now, for much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, let's go back to that for a second.  Why would you call them urban insurrections rather than riots?  They are popularly known as riots, but what's the difference?
Speaker 2: Because I think that these were genuine, you know, explosions from within that were, that were prompted by the pressures from without.  And I think that the term riot, it does not do justice to the depth of, of deprivation and, and pain, and obvious denial that so many of these communities had been subjected to.
Speaker 1: So you're saying you think riot's reductive like in the sense that, you can have a soccer riot, but you couldn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, you could have a riot after, you know, at a, at a baseball game, but this was--these were people who had lived under, you know, really suppressed conditions for a long time and finally just reached the boiling point.
Story_ID: 186019
Speaker 1: And these [urban riots]--that, that happened in Washington [D.C.] in 1968, after the assassination of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  That was Washington's time to blow up.  The black ghetto, et cetera had long suffered many, many indignities.  But this was, this was the final blow.  At that point I was not working for the [Washington] Post.  I was, I was, as I said, working--being primarily a mother doing part-time television.  But our house was within a couple of blocks of where the riots were taking place.  So, they, they--we felt like we were very much a part of this, this, this incredible three days of violence and, and of fury and anger and resentment that was swirling about the city.  In my own case, my husband [HM Sam Gilliam] thought--by now we had three children, that I should leave our house since we were so close, and I actually went out and stayed with [HM Samuel] Sam Yette and his wife and his children for a few days, and then we came back after things began to cool down, after the troops and all had, had--were beginning to leave.  But, the particular relevance of those riots to journalism is that President [Lyndon Baines] Johnson, who succeeded [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy, as you know, set up a commission to find out why these riots had occurred.  It was called the Kerner Commission [National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders].  And one of the findings of the Kerner Commission was that the news media, the daily news media was directly in part, to blame for these riots.  And he said that they were to blame because they had not fully reported on what was going on in these communities.  That these communities were left uncovered, nobody knew what was happening.  And it said that part of what the newspaper industry had done was to have to contributed to two Americas, and at that point it was black and white.  Obviously it's a, you know, different--much, much more a rainbow now.  But at that point, it was black and white.  And so it also said that the news media should hire blacks as editors and reporters and--so the news media was, was really put on the line publically as having failed to, you know, contribute and to cover the nation in the way that it had been.  And so people like me who had been there in 196--you know, 1961 through 1964, when I was one of only, you know, three blacks among hundreds of reporters, could really say, you're right, you know, there is no--there's tokenism in the extreme.  In the, in the early--in the mid-'60s [1960s] you could put all the black reporters for daily newspapers probably in one telephone booth.  But, this, this was the beginning of change.  And the other reason the media needed to hire black reporters and editors was because they didn't have anybody to send into these riot corridors.  When they sent white reporters in, they, they ran 'em out.  And so they began to look around, you know, they found people who were working in the library, or working some--one place, I understand, a janitor was hauled into service to become a reporter.  So, that marked the beginning, of the news media recognizing that it had to move from its segregated status to begin to hire black reporters.  And interestingly enough, minority reporters were a big part of bringing about that change.  This was not something that was totally done on the largesse of the white media.  The minority reporters were a very important part of bringing about that change.
Story_ID: 186020
Speaker 1: Walter Washington who, who became mayor in the late '60s [1960s], late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s] was the first mayor, first, an appointed mayor, and then he was an elected mayor of Washington [D.C].  And who--he's recently died, and so a lot of attention was paid to that.  But, he was a very important person.  He helped to steer the city through the riots.  Then he was, as I said, actually appointed, as mayor to Washington, still at this point, does not--people in Washington still do not have the full rights as citizens.  And you've heard a lot about, you know, the importance of having and needing home rule.  Washington was the first of, of four elected mayors that we have had, but his was an important role.  And when I went back to the [Washington] Post in 1972, he was really hitting his stride.  When I was rehired by the Post in 1972 as an assistant editor in the style section, there were gonna be four assistant editors.  Each of us had a cluster of reporters with whom we worked.  I went back to a different Washington Post than I had left in the mid-'60s [1960s].  Because of the riots and because of the Kerner Commission [National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders] report and because of, you know, the times were changing.
Story_ID: 186021
Speaker 1: Because of the Kerner Commission [National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders] report et cetera, the [Washington] Post had really begun to hire black reporters.  One of the things that had happened was that some of those reporters sued the Post in 1970.  They were called the Metro Seven.  They were metro reporters, but they sued the Post and said the Post should--was not elevating African Americans to editors, et cetera.  When I went back, I went back as an editor.  And one of the things that I wanted to try to do was to, to bring some coherence to black culture.  I was able to hire quite a number of reporters in the style section.  I think we did some very good work.  We were able to do, for example, one of the reporters back there was a guy named Hollie West.  And we were doing, you know, three-part series on certain black intellectuals, you know, deep stories that really gave history and context to, to some of the events that were taking place.  And you have to realize that we were just coming out of, out of the '60s [1960s], you know, still reeling from the effects of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King's [Jr.] death.  [President] Richard [Milhous] Nixon is about to ascend to the White House [Washington, D.C.].  Vietnam [War] is going on, you know, in the, in the international theater.  So this was a time when--it was a very fertile time in America.  And it was--I, I, I very much appreciated the opportunity to try to, to be bringing more of that black culture and bringing in a coherent way into the pages of the Washington Post.  One of the, the people that I became familiar with during that time was Paul Robeson.  I--even though I was hired as an editor, I occasionally wrote.  And one of the stories that I went to write was a story--the story of Salute to Paul Robeson that was held in New York [New York] at Carnegie Hall.  And I was very surprised when I got there to see this huge audience of, you know, blacks and whites and people of all races celebrating the life of Paul Robeson.  Coming as I had from a, a conservative, southern background, I didn't really know all the, the, the full story of Robeson and some of his, you know, dealings and his progressive associations.  But obviously I knew about him as a singer and actor, et cetera.  But I wrote about that, and just, became utterly fascinated with this--wanting to know more.  The Post asked me to write his obituary and I wrote his obituary and in the course of doing that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was in '76 [1976] when he died, '76 [1976]?
Speaker 1: No, but, I was writing this in '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: Oh, anticipating that he--
Speaker 1: Right, that's a standard procedure in daily newspapers that you write--when people get--begin to get old and infirm, you write their obituaries years before.  So that when they die all you have to do is put it in the paper with--you change, you know, you update the date, but that, that's just standard procedure.  So, I wrote the obituary.
Story_ID: 186022
Speaker 1: And in the process of writing that [obituary for Paul Robeson], I just became more and more fascinated with him and was able to get a book contract.  And I wrote a book on him called 'Paul Robeson, All-American' and that was a very, you know, important decision for me and a very important experience for me.  It was published by New Republic Books in 1976 in hardback, and in softback by the same company in 1978.
Speaker 2: The title is intriguing because it's Paul Robeson.  You know, he was an All-American football player, but he's also someone who was chastised and vilified as being a Communist and anti-American.
Speaker 1: That was the reason for the title, of course, because of the double entendre.  Paul Robeson was a, in my mind, a Renaissance man, actor, singer came from extremely humble beginnings, but also, you know, with, with, with a large share of trauma.  But he, he was able to triumph over all of that and just break new ground in so many different fields, but you're absolutely right.  And what I did in the book was talk about his, his first trip to Russia and, and what that was like.  And you know, compared it to the experience in America that he had, and talked about how he began to really love a lot of the Russian people.  According to my records, I was never able to find any evidence that he actually was a member of the Communist Party.  But there's no doubt about the fact that he, you know, he--the--he had very progressive associations.  But just writing the book was a fascinating experience and I think it was part of, of--one of the books that began to bring him back to the public eye and I was very happy to have had that experience.
Story_ID: 186023
Speaker 1: Another thing that happened in the mid-'70s [1970s] was that I became part of, of groups of, of, of black and other journalists of color who began to be involved in trying to change the--to, to increase diversity, racial diversity in mainstream media.  I was--joined the board of The [Maynard] Institute for Journalism Education, which was a group of minority journalists that basically set out to train other minority journalists.  During this same time, the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ] was started.  I was not a founding member, but I certainly was an early member of that.  So these--I, I found myself in, in these parallel roles of working as a journalist, but also on a volunteer basis working with these, these media diversity movements to try to increase diversity in the media.  And that has been--I've continued that role until today.  And I think it has definitely made a difference in terms of bringing more, more people of color into media.  And hopefully also, eventually changing and making media much more sensitive in its coverage of people of color and, you know, just continuing to be a part of making hopefully, eventually making the media better.
Story_ID: 186024
Speaker 1: Talk about your column.  How did your column come about?
Speaker 2: At the end of the '70s [1970s] after having been an editor [at the Washington Post] for about seven years, I was looking around for the next thing I wanted to do.  And I wrote a letter to the editor in, in, in which I laid out a case for why I should be made the editor of the Washington [Post], of the magazine called Potomac [later, The Washington Post Magazine], which was the weekly Sunday magazine.  And the editor at that point was Benjamin, Benjamin Bradlee and he said that that basically that the Post was not thinking about changing the magazine at that point.  But he asked me if there was anything else that I was--that I wanted to do.  And I said, well, maybe write a column.  And so he suggested that I move over from the style section to the metro section and begin writing some extended features and when the, the editors of the metro section thought I was ready to write columns they would, you know, they'd say, "Go to it."  Or, if they never thought I was ready to write, then they would say, "Don't go to it."  But the editor of the metro section at that point was Bob Woodward, who by then had, you know, triumphed as the, the, the writer of Watergate along with [Carl] Bernstein.  And the, the editor of the city desk was a man named Herbert Denton, so after a few months they said, okay, we think you're ready to start a column and that's when I, that's when I started writing a column.  I started writing the column--I started doing a lot of people columns, but after a while I really started getting much more into issues.  And I have to say that as I started getting into issues, I think people who liked my people column were not as pleased with, with my issue columns because, you know, I wrote from the perspective of a black woman.  And I often saw things a lot differently from other people because our experience was a lot different.  So, but, I wrote a lot about local politics.  I wrote about national politics.  I wrote about gender and race and education and whatever was topic A, that was something Ben Bradlee used to always say, you know, you have to write about topic A.  So, you know, whatever was the big story at the moment, very often I would write about it.  It was a, you know, an incredible experience.  I, I wrote the column for about eighteen years.  That was hard, I wrote a column for, you know writing a column for two weeks--twice a week is a challenging thing.  Near the end when I became president of the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ], I cut back to one a week.  But it was, it was just, it was a tremendous experience.  It--Washington [D.C.] is a very challenging market in which to write.  You have a--not only do you have the [U.S.] Congress, you have the local, you know, obviously you have the local scene and the local officials, but Washington is a place that's also just peopled by a lot of very, very bright, you know, outstanding people.  And so, it, it, it was on the one hand, challenging, but on the other hand, very, very satisfying to write the column, during that time.  Technically, you know, I always thought I wanted to do it better, you know, I would look at, at some of my colleagues, like a [William] Bill Raspberry, who, who seemed to, to, to write so easily and I always felt I was--mine was more of a struggle, but, I think, I think the community seemed to really feel as though I was--I think many people in the community could relate to the columns that I wrote.  Got a lot of criticisms, I got criticism, you know, from Washingtonian, Fortune, you know, they said I wrote too much about race.  I was always playing the race card, you know.  And I remember once thinking that, maybe I should try to see if I can have a, a national column, a nationally syndicated column.  So I went to a well-known lawyer in town and I said, you know, what should I do?  And he said you have to write more conservatively.  And I said, well, I guess I'll never have it.  So, I did write--I was carried for a while in the Philadelphia Daily News.  But after a while it began to become the trend that a lot of daily newspapers started hiring people to do their, you know, to do their own--local reporters, or started having their own local columnists.  So, I was never syndicated beyond the, the Post and the Daily News.
Story_ID: 186025
Speaker 1: But, all along, all--writing the column [Washington Post metro section column], I still worked in all this diversity in the media.  And one of the reasons that was so important to me was because, you know, I started so early and I started when there was so little diversity, you know, I talked about some of the experiences I had, just getting the news.  Some of the experiences of I knew, I knew the pain of being one of, you know, two or three blacks in a huge newsroom.  And I also knew that the, that the newspaper that wasn't diverse, the product was not going to be as good.  It wasn't going to be as relevant.  It wasn't gonna, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't gonna dig as deeply and it wasn't going to have that authenticity that I think newspapers want to have.  So, that was very close to my heart.  I spent a lot of time, you know, on weekends going to board meetings of the [The Maynard] Institute [for Journalism Education], or, you know, going to--spent part of the time in the summer training other journalists and finally, in 1991, when I'd taken a year off to go and study at the Freedom Forum [Media Studies Center, Columbia University], I decided to run for president of the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ].  And I, I ran first--was elected first, as vice president for print and then in 1993 I was elected president.  And that was a, a, a big step for me.  It was--I saw that as being a more activist role than my role had been as a member of the board of the Institute for Journalism Education because that was more of a training vehicle for minority journalists.  This, I saw as a way to more actively push the agenda of diversity.  And, so that was, that was a very challenging time as well.  You know, heading a national organization of almost three thousand members.  It was challenging getting, you know, dealing with a very opinionated board, dealing with all the issues that came up, but it was also a time of tremendous growth.  I was present during a, a convention called UNITY [UNITY: Journalists for Diversity], which was the time when the four associations of color came together in a joint conference: National Association of Black Journalists, National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Asian American Journalists Association and the Native American Journalists Association.  I believe it was--it's one of the few organizations in the, in the country--I think ours is one of the few professions in the country where they have these, these cross-cultural, multi-cultural conferences.  And I was president during the, the first one.  So that was a real challenge, you know, bringing together all these different cultures and people with different agendas, but we all came together.  The first conference was held in 1994 in Atlanta, Georgia.  And those UNITY conferences--they are now held every four years.  The last one was held in Seattle, Washington in 1999.  And next year it will be held in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: What did those groups have in common?
Speaker 1: What they had in common in terms of journalism, was that their numbers were not well represented in daily media, both on the print and the television side.  Very, very few Latino journalists, very few, you know, Asian journalists at that point.  Even today Native American journalists are, are hard to find.  So, while there were many differences, different agendas, and you know, certainly different challenges, what they had in common was that, as I said, all of their numbers were underrepresented in media.  And so what we tried to do was to come together around those things that we had in common, and push the industry to further diversify.
Story_ID: 186026
Speaker 1: What were the, some of the specific issues of the black journalists in those, in those days?  I--those were times when a number of black professions formed organizations, black organizations, national--The Association of Black Psychologists, black teachers got together, almost every field, you know, every professional field there--National Black Police Association came together, black firefighters (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, in 1978, when the, the NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], the black journalists were the, were the first to organize as a, as an activist membership group.  All the other groups followed suit.  The, the agenda consisted of once again, getting people hired, getting people promoted, bringing more into the pipeline, getting better coverage of the community, you know, getting more balanced coverage of the community, trying to make certain, that, that all the coverage didn't, didn't just focus on the pathology.  Fighting to make sure that, that stories had more context so that when stories were, were written about incidents that might have dealt with crime, et cetera, it was, it was very clear that, you know, we're talking about a small percentage of the black population, as opposed to, you know, a huge percentage.  So, part of what we were doing was just trying to bring a, a, context, and you know, more, more voices, just trying to take a media that basically was segregated and to bring it into touch with the realities of America.
Story_ID: 186027
Speaker 1: Tell me about the Young Journalists Development Project.
Speaker 2: In 1996, I, I had a four year fellowship to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and so I left the column [Washington Post metro section column] and when I came back, they--I came back ready to resume the column and they, the [Washington] Post asked if I was interested in doing something different.  So I asked what they had in mind, and the, the idea of starting a program in journalism education was brought up.  Now, because I had been working, you know, as a volunteer in all these diversity projects, I was certainly, you know, open to seeing if, if we could bring more young people into journalism.  I was, I was open to seeing if we could start a program that would, that would attract young minorities to journalism.  So, I spent much of the year, 1997, you know, continuing to write the column, but also checking out what was going on, what was the status of, of, of high school journalism in Washington [D.C.], what was the status in the Washington metropolitan area.  And what I found out just outraged me because one of the things I learned was that in 1997, for example, not a single high school in Washington, D.C. had published a high school newspaper.  And I had spent, you know, all these years running around the country trying to advance diversity on, you know, on, on the national front, meanwhile, right in my neighborhood these children were just being horribly cheated.  So, I kept--I came up with a program that would begin to address some of these needs where the Post would give them money--give high schools money to start newspapers.  Then we would look at the students who worked on those newspapers and select those who was, who were the most outstanding and begin to try to put them into a series of successively more challenging assignments to see if they could possibly go to college, become journalists--the program eventually started scholarships, fellowships and we, we started out with about three programs.  Now we, now when I left in June, the Post in June, there were more than twenty programs.  We've worked with hundreds of students.  We have students all--who are studying in colleges.  We have about--altogether the students who have been through our programs more than--I would, I would say we are approaching about one hundred kids who are actually studying in colleges to become journalists who've been through some of the Post programs.  Some of our graduates, alumni have already, are already working in daily newspapers.  We have people who come from our program who are now back on the Post as reporters.  And we--the Post program is really gonna be a national model for what newspapers can do to reach out and touch communities, by, by not only helping in schools that don't have papers, but also by helping, helping to attract, you know, bright young people to, to journalism.  And I think--the, the goal is that it's going to advance diversity, but not just, just racial diversity, but, but within racial diversity, you know, economic diversity as well.  Not every--so often, you know, middle class blacks who've been to certain colleges are the first people who are hired, but we hope with these kind of programs, that we're able to get people who come from all kind of neighborhoods, and they can bring that diversity of experience to it as well.

Speaker 1: So, I retired from the [Washington] Post on June 30th [2003] and I, I had this faculty appointment at GW, George Washington [University, Washington, D.C.], and part of what I'm trying to do there, in addition to working with the students, is to start--try to advance these programs on a national level, these, these young journalists development-type programs on a national level.  The American Society of Newspaper Editors has been working in this field.  They--the, the newspaper industry is losing young readers.  It's losing readers period.  Circulation is, is dropping.  The television networks are losing viewers; young people are not, are not watching network news.  Young people aren't watch--aren't even listening to radio news.  All the studies talk about that.  Then with all the new immigrants coming into the country, you know, they, many of them aren't reading.  So the newspaper industry is very interested in young people.  And so what, what I'm trying to do is to help design some programs and to help push them through GW and through my other associations since I'm still on the board of the Institute for Journalism Education.  It's now the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education; trying to push this program of having media really get involved with, with high schools by, by--and I'm talking about print and television by putting funds into these schools to help them start student media, help them continue to publish their papers, or, or have their television stations.  At the same time, you're helping the school, we can also see those youngsters who have a, who have a particular interest, and those youngsters can be trained to become journalists of the future.

Speaker 1: Ma'am, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: One of my concerns is, particularly for young black men, I am very, very, very concerned about the, the large number of young black men who are being programmed to go into college, I'm sorry, to go into jail, not college.  I'm also very, very concerned about the state of schools and about the state of public education and the, the chaos that seems to now be existing, particularly in terms of urban education.  So, I'm very, very concerned about that.  I think that we are challenged as a people, to not be totally focused on ourselves and our, our individual careers and our, you know, so often the middle class gets very involved in, in their homes and their children and their, and their, their lives and they don't, don't realize that we all have an obligation to reach back because the system has--is so designed that a large portion of our people have been left behind, and if they fail, we fail.
Story_ID: 181583
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking about some of your hopes and concerns for the black community.
Speaker 2: You know, my, my hope is that the opportunities that are available to other people in this country can be available to all blacks.  And I just am particularly concerned that, you know, that the, the, the segment of blacks who are at the bottom are having more difficulty than ever in pulling out of that.  You know, because of the economic times we've been in, a lot of middle class blacks are, are struggling.  But I think that we all have an obligation to take the risk of, of pushing the, the institutions in which we work, pushing the professions in which we work to try to do what we can to, to reach back and reach out and, and to pull up.  You know, we often talk about each one reaching one because, you know, so many people who are so solid in, you know, worked in jobs for years and years, you know, they have the capital to, to go out and, and use those positions to help bring about change and very often they don't.  Fortunately I was able to do that at the Washington Post with this young journalists program [Young Journalists Development Project].  Here, here was an opportunity, first of all I had to, I had to make a difficult choice.  Was I going to leave the limelight of writing a column and go and do this behind the scenes job that was going to help these youngsters, but it wasn't going to be as glamorous for me, you know, I wasn't going to be on the White House guest list.  I wasn't gonna be, you know, I wouldn't be, be, you know, invited to all the embassy parties because, you know, you get those kind of invitations when your name is out there.  I wasn't going to be invited to all the--to be on the television shows, not that I was, you know, did that a lot--much, but I did a lot of the local television and all that, so, but I have never really regretted that decision to move over and start working with young people.  And, but, but what I was able to do was to use the capital that I had been able to amass at the Washington Post and, and even all the experience that, that I'd had working in these volunteer positions, in The [Maynard] Institute for Journalism Education, in the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ].  When this opportunity came to start a young journalists development program at the Post, all of those, those pieces came together and I just think it was really God led and God inspired because it was, it was a time when we were able to make those programs grow.  You know, we got--we were able to get money from so many different sources within the Post, outside the Post and then finally, we were able to get a grant of $175,000 to write a handbook for newspapers and television stations all over the country to, to show them how they can create these successful high school partnerships.  And that may not sound like a lot, but if you think about the fact that we have newspapers and television stations all over this country, if there is an outreach from those in their local communities reaching into high schools, that can have a profound impact on, on young people of color, as well as other students, but the reason it's so key for young--for, for blacks in particular and Latinos to a certain extent, is that the statistics show that if blacks don't get involved in journalism by high school, the chances of them becoming--choosing journalism in college, the chances are much reduced.  And so, it's very important to get them at this, at this high school level.  And, and the reason all of this is important is because we're talking about moving this country forward.  You, you need the voices of all Americans reflected in the media.  I think there is still an important role for the black press on a weekly basis, but it's that daily media that, that, that's out there influencing the, the, the activities and the movements and the, and the, and the ebbs and the flows of government and of life that I think can really bring about change.  And my feeling is that media has not given much to communities.  And television stations in particular, make huge profits.  Some television stations make as much as 50 percent profits and they don't give anything back.  So what we're trying to do is create a vehicle so that both newspapers and televisions can, can reach out to communities in a win-win scenario, in which they are able to advance their goals of reaching young people and increasing viewership and increasing readership and at the same time, bringing on to their stations people from diverse communities who can help improve the product.
Story_ID: 181584
Speaker 1: When you look back on all you've done, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: At this point I suspect it will be the contribution of, of working with young journalists.  Certainly again, you know, through just the grace of God just being able to have been a pioneer in those early newsrooms, you know, to be the--one of the first black reporters in the Washington Post and having been able to persevere against those terrible odds to, to be successful.  And then to, you know, to, to come back and to, to be able to make a contribution as an editor and as a columnist, all that has been important.  But others have done that.  I think, you know, hopefully we've--I've been a part of a group that helped to open the doors for others to come through.  But, I think potentially, I don't--certainly don't think one program [Young Journalists Development Project] at the Post has done it.  But I think potentially if we're able to go forward and stimulate within media this work that will be, that will be an important legacy.  And I think by extension, it's gonna also change somewhat the definition of news.  One of the things that I've often studied when I've taken these breaks from the Post has been you know, how do we redefine the news; how do we broaden the definition of news because right now it's pretty narrowly confined to, you know, the negative, the aberrant, the, the problems, you know, obviously, it does some very important work in terms of watchdogging government and hopefully, more work will be done in terms of watchdogging businesses as well.  But, I think that, that news can also be the heroic, the people also interested in, in those stories that give them hope.  They're not--I remember an editor once told me that, you know, people aren't interested in reading, reading about the fact that, you know, a thousand planes landed safely at [Ronald Reagan Washington] National Airport [Arlington, Virginia].  They want to read about the plane crash, and that's true, but I think that increasingly people are also interested in some of, some of the more ordinary things that, but, but, but that are heroic in, in the sense that they're part of how people do achieve against the odds.  I think that there, there are large segments of the news that don't get much coverage.  I think religion is one of those subjects, not in terms of, you know, the--looking at the, the, the creeds and the dogmas, et cetera, but increasingly you know, religion plays a huge role in politics, in, in, in terms of how people live their lives.  That doesn't get much coverage.  I think the news needs to broad, be broadened, and the definition needs to be broadened to encompass some more of the realities of people's lives.  And I think that, that they will be interested in that as much as they're interested in the plane crash or the war in Iraq [Iraq War].
Story_ID: 181585
Speaker 1: When you look back on your career, is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I think my challenge is to, is to begin writing more, you know, writing some books.  I don't--I, that's, that's my next--in addition to trying to do this work with high schools and, and the, you know, hopefully start more of these programs nationally, or help to advance that cause.  I also want to write.  So I think the one thing when I look back on--I wish I, that I had perhaps, produced more books, but I still have the opportunity to do that.  And I've been fortunate to have been, you know, to have written chapters in some books, but I think it's so important for African Americans to tell their stories and to just write more of what, what, what's going on, to, to let those stories be a part of the, of the ongoing history of the times.  So, I would not have done anything differently.  I'm very happy that I chose the field of journalism.  I've been very blessed to have people who have helped to guide me in, in ways that have given me a chance to have expression both, you know, as--in terms of a national role in pushing racial diversity in media.  I've been very fortunate to have people to help and guide me in terms of continuing to, you know, writing the column; to, to--gotten very good feedback from the community in terms of the columns that I've written.  I've, I've got--I've had, you know, a lot of assistance even now in some of these programs that we want to start for the future.  So I feel that, I've just had a very, very blessed career, and a lot, a lot of help.  But, there's nothing I would do differently.  There're just some things I would like to do in addition.
Story_ID: 181586
Speaker 1: And lastly, this is similar to legacy, but different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's a tough one.  How would I like to be remembered?  I would think as a person who was not content just to be a journalist, but as a person who wanted to make the whole media feel better.  And who invested the time and the energy.  Made my mistakes, but you know, and had the opportunity to try--to be a part of trying to make the entire media feel better.
Story_ID: 181587
Speaker 1: Okay, this is me at the age of probably nine, nine or ten outside Youngs Chapel A.M.E. Church [Louisville, Kentucky].  These are--we're all part of the Sunday school.  And this, this to the left is part of the old church, and this to the right is the new church that my father [Adee Butler] is building with, obviously with the aid of his congregation.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: It's in construction, you're right, but this is, this was part of the old building there.  And these are the Sunday school teachers all--this is Ms. Turnbow [ph.] who I--used to always come and eat dinner with us on Sunday.  This is--this young lady here, now is my sister-in-law, Margaret Butler, she married my brother.  This is my brother Lynwood [Odell Butler] and--so I don't, who do I have to tell you.  Is that enough?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 1: Is your brother Adee [Conklin Butler, Jr.] in there?
Speaker 2: He certainly should be on here.  I think this is Adee.
Speaker 1: Should be 1946, right?  You were just about--you were ten, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, I'm sorry.  The importance of this picture is that is my dad, my daddy, Reverend Adee Conklin Butler.  And he's standing outside the church with members of the stewardess board.  And that's a visiting evangelist.  And I think the church is at that point, still under construction.
Speaker 1: What, what year do you think that is--same year?
Speaker 2: I would say approximately 1946, '47 [1947] at the latest.  Okay this is me when I was a student at--oh, let's see, must have been high school [Lincoln Institute, Lincoln Ridge, Kentucky].
Speaker 1: Okay, you can move the pen now.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 2: That's what I'm trying to figure out.  Give me a minute or two.
Speaker 1: In high school then?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 2: Okay.  What year was this?
Speaker 1: Is that Lincoln?
Speaker 2: Yes!  Yes, Lincoln Institute, but I don't know which (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 2: But it was--what I--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 2: But this--okay.  But for this I can say it was between the year--between '55 [1955] and '57 [1957].  I just don't know where it was.  Okay.  And here, this is the--one of the deans with--for whom I was working, and this was just a staged picture of me.  This is probably one of only two or three white girls--kids in the whole school, because that was the start of integration at Lincoln.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of me in Chicago [Illinois] when I was working for Jet magazine, trying to be--
Speaker 2: Was, was that shot by one of the Jet photographers?
Speaker 1: It probably was, and that's why I'm probably sitting on a Triumph and, and thinking I'm looking glamorous.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's pretty glamorous.
Speaker 1: Would have been between 1957 and '59 [1959].
Speaker 2: I think we need that.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is me and this is my mother [Jessie Norment Butler], my brother Adee, my sister Evelyn [Butler Campbell], my sister Juanita [Butler], my brother Lynwood, my sister-in-law Margaret, and my, my nephew Blair [ph.].  This would have been approximately 1960, '61 [1961] just before I got married, and taken at our home in Louisville, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: I see the continental suits there and the skinny ties.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 1: This is me as part of the graduating class at Columbia University [New York, New York].  You can see the women all along the front, there're just about--I think all the women just happened to be standing along the front.  And you can see the makeup of the class and as I, I pointed out, there's one black woman and one black man, who I can't find, but he's up there.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That would have been during my year at Columbia where I entered in September of '60 [1960] and graduated in June 1961.  I don't know exactly when that picture was taken, probably the spring, looks like it's warm outside.
Speaker 2: This is me upon arrival in, in Nairobi, Kenya.  This is a woman, Emily [ph.], who was another part of our group.  And this was a, a local ambassador's wife in Kenya.  And they took that picture for the newspaper when we arrived.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 2: The summer--you don't need that, that's me pregnant.  You don't need that.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This was taken in 1961, summer of 1961.
Speaker 1: This is me with my husband [HM] Sam [Gilliam], and two of our daughters when we only had two children.  That's Stephanie [ph.] and that's Melissa [ph.].  That would have been approximately 1964.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 1: This is Sam, Sam and I when we were posing for, I think, a magazine.  This was for a local magazine.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 1: Approximate date would have been 1967, '68 [1968], something like that, because I wasn't working at the [Washington] Post at that point.  It would have been between I would say, late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  Picture of my mother, me, my daughter Stephanie, my Aunt Gussie [ph.], and my, my cousin Iris [ph.] and my cousin Leetta [ph.], taken at the sixtieth wedding anniversary of my aunt.

Speaker 1: This is me at a family reunion. (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 2: By then my mom had passed on.  This is my sister-in-law, Earlean [ph.], my brother, Lynwood, my sister-in-law, Margaret, and my brother Adee.  And this is my sister Juanita, the one I told you who had Down Syndrome.  And this is my sister, Evelyn, who was very much kind of the matriarch of the family, and after my mother's death she took care of my younger sister.  And these are our cousins and aunts and uncles.  And these are my three--these are two of my three children here.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is, this is me in my role of, of working for media industry diversity, working with industry leaders.  This is Donald Graham, who is the publisher of the Washington Post.  This is Robert Maynard, of, of The [Maynard] Institute for Journalism Education.  The Institute for Journalism Education was later renamed for him.  At this point I was chair of this--of The Institute of Journalism Education.  This is Ellis Colson [ph.].  I believe this is Arthur, this is Arthur Sulzberger, Sr., the New York Times, I believe so.  But these are some of the, you know, people with whom we worked and interacted.
Speaker 1: Are we going down here?
Speaker 2: No, those are industry--national industry work.  This is Robert Maynard again.  These are some industry leaders.  This is Don Graham speaking to John Dotson.  So these are, these are some of my colleagues in the, in the struggle for racial diversity in the media.
Speaker 1: This is in the '70s [1970s], right?
Speaker 2: This would be in the, in the '80s [1980s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Eighties [1980s], all right.
Speaker 2: --in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Here I am with John Quinn of USA Today at a function given by The Institute for Journalism Education.  But again, that, that--part of that role--and this is Don Graham again, and this is Arthur Sulzberger, Sr. who were also at that event.
Speaker 1: More in my role as a columnist, [HM] Jesse Jackson was one of the newsmakers that I covered.  I think this was not a part--this is--I was not actually writing on this occasion.  But I--this was--but this was Reverend Jackson just being friendly.
Speaker 2: Did you know [HM Reverend Dr.] Barbara Reynolds from Chicago (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Oh, sure, sure, sure.  Barbara's a--I know her very, very well.
Speaker 2: This is me again, in my role of journalist, I'm--this--we're in Russia.  Jesse--I went over covering Jesse Jackson, who went to Russia, at the--after the earthquake that was held--that occurred in, in Russia.  Jesse decided to go over and see what he could do, and I thought that would be an interesting thing to do, and I went over and--part, part of the party that covered him.  And these are both Russian diplomats and some of the Americans who accompanied us on that trip.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 2: That would have been probably early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This was--this is me when I was president of the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ], President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton.  The event was the--the occasion rather, would have been 1994.  The occasion was the--[Nelson] Mandela's visit to the White House, may have been 1995.  And this is my friend, John Gamble [ph.].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is one of my favorite assignments.  This is Nelson Mandela, of course, and that's Winnie Mandela.  This was his first visit to the U.S. after he was elected president.
Speaker 1: Ninety-two [1992] or--
Speaker 2: No, '94 [1994] was when he was, he was elected president in '94 [1994].  He was released, I believe in '92 [1992] [sic., 1990].  And, so here's me walking behind him.  I'm sure I have a note pad somewhere.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This would have been approximately 1994.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is me with [HM] Vernon Jarrett, who for many years was a columnist for the [Chicago] Sun-Times.  And he's one of my colleagues in the National Association of Black Journalists.  He's important because he was one of the journalists who was not content just--merely to be a journalist, but actually did a lot of work to help improve the industry and also reached out to help the community as well.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 2: This was taken at an NABJ convention.  I would say, in the, the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 2: This is me at, at the University of Mississippi [Ole Miss, Oxford, Mississippi] covering--at a conference they were having on covering the South.  I, I went to the University of Mississippi as one of the people who had, had covered the Civil Rights Movement and talked about my experiences covering Oxford [Mississippi] in the 1960s.  That was held on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the entrance into Ole Miss.  And that would have been 1988.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 2: This is me in 19--in 2002 when I was inducted into the hall of fame of the Society for Professional Journalists.
Speaker 1: You certainly look like a kid in that picture.
Speaker 2: That's--my hair was back.
Speaker 1: Just recently when the--when I was inducted into the journalists--I'm sorry, into the alumni hall of fame at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is the book I wrote in 1976, 'Paul Robeson, All-American.'
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 1: No, he--I was not allowed to interview him at that point when I started writing.  So I had to interview around him.  I talked to a lot of friends, a lot of people who knew him.
