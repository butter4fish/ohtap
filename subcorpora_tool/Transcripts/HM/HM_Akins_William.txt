Speaker 2: My favorite color is brown and gold.  Both of them are my favorite colors.

Speaker 2: I really like stew and, of course, I like chocolate cake, anything chocolate (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year is the fall. I, the anticipation of going back to school when I was a student, and when I became a teacher, the anticipation, the excitement of getting started again--taking place in the fall.  And I love the football season, the crispness of the air.  Of course in Texas it's pretty warm, but at the same time it's a new beginning for me, and I've enjoyed the fall of the year.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Now, I'm not very well traveled.  I, and I should have been, I guess over the years.  We've gone on some vacations with my family, and we enjoyed it.  When they were young, I recall we took a trip to Washington, D.C., and that was the first time for all of us, and that was truly an enjoyable time for me.  I would say that I like to go to California, and I like to visit, to see the historic sites in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: When I see people, I think about all of the good things that have happened to me.  And good things happen to most of us.  I always say, "It's always good."  And it is always good.
Story_ID: 614901
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your parents, and let's begin with your mother.  Will you tell me her name and where she was born, and when, if you know?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Austin, Texas.  Her name was Mattie Lee Watson [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] prior to her marrying my father.  She was born August 12, 1912 in Austin, Texas, as a matter of fact.  There were five in her family.  Her mother was Beatrice Watson [Beatrice Gordon Watson].  The word was that my grandmother's family was from Cincinnati [Ohio].  She and her sister somehow or another got to Texas.  I don't know how or what happened, but they said that they came from Cincinnati.  And my grandmother married a Lewis Watson [Robert Watson] who was--I think in terms of--they had some--down from the York Creek [Texas] area, which is near St. Marcos, Texas [San Marcos, Texas], not far from Austin [Texas].  And I don't, the union took place there, and then she became Beatrice Watson.  And of course, that was my mother's mother.  She had a sister who married--and I think this is interesting (laughter).  My great-uncle was Mr. Andrew Lawsha, and he was from the York Creek area, which is, as I say, near St. Marcos.  I thought that name, when I heard about it, was sort of unique.  He always said he had some, "I have a French background" (laughter).  I don't know how true that was, but my Aunt Emma [Emma Gordon Lawsha], who was a sister to my grandmother, she could say Lawsha with such poise and class.  So, I remember that.  Well, my mother was not a very large lady.  She was a hard worker, and loved me.  I'm the only child.  I guess I was spoiled.  I say that because people would always say if you're the only child, you must be spoiled.  And so, (laughter) I say that I was spoiled.  But a great love she had for me, my mother, and a great love I had for her.  My mother was not college trained.  As a matter of fact, both she, and later on my father, she married Elmer Akins, both left school before they got to high school.  I think my dad left in the eighth grade, as did my mom.  And so during that era, you know, she had to fend for her family, working and so forth.  And he was--I may be jumping the gun a little bit, but he was from the area called Pilot Knob [Texas], which is near Creedmoor, Texas, which is about thirty miles [sic.] south of Austin.  And I don't how the union took place, but Elmer Akins married Mattie Lee Akins, and of course they had a great marriage, married over sixty years.
Story_ID: 614902
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She talked about how she had to go to work.  And she used to use this term, (laughter) "I had to work in the white folks' kitchen" (laughter).  She was a domestic.  She, when I was a small boy she worked for--and I did some research afterwards--a family, Mr. and Mrs. Proctor [ph.], and I recall the street they lived on.  They lived on Duval Street here in Austin [Texas].  Well, my mother had to go into work six days a week because she had to work on Sunday, because she had to prepare the Sunday meal and all.  And then during that time mothers were able to bring some food home, and she did that after getting off of work on Sunday afternoon.  And that was, of course, our Sunday dinner.  She had a great feeling for work; she wanted to do it well.  Both she and my father [Elmer Akins] had a great desire to be on time for everything, "You don't want to be late."  And I think that was an attribute that was very good then and very good now.  And I have that tendency to want to be on time as well.  But she used to come back and tell me some of the experiences at work.  And she learned--because she was able to see how those people were living, and she learned to really be a good cook.  Because she was taught by Mrs. Proctor, and she became an outstanding cook.  My mother was a pastry cook.  Peach cobbler was her favorite, and one of my favorites as well (laughter).  Because she would make it all the time, and of course my dad loved it as well.  But she would talk about that.  But then later on, she moved to a better job.  She moved to work in the nurses home at Brackenridge Hospital [Central Health Brackenridge Campus, Austin, Texas] where the trainees, the young ladies who were studying to be nurses, they lived there.  That was the dormitory, so to speak.  And she worked there in housekeeping, a cleanup person.  And she worked also at Brackenridge Hospital as a cleanup person.  As a matter of fact, she worked in the nursing home [ph.] until she retired.  She would come home and tell me stories of the day's activity.  Sometimes her supervisor and she would have some difficulty on occasions, because my mother was a proud woman, and she took pride in her work.  And she didn't take too well to being overly chastised by supervisors, and I would hear her talk about it at home.  But she was smooth enough not to put her job in jeopardy; she always kept a job.  (Laughter) She worked there for over thirty years, and retired there.  She did a good job, and they liked her in housekeeping.
Story_ID: 614903
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your grandparents, your mother's parents, Beatrice [Beatrice Gordon Watson] and Lewis [Robert Watson].
Speaker 2: Now, I didn't ever know my grandfather.  He had, he had passed, he had passed on when I grew up as a teenager.  I lived with my Grandmother Beatrice on occasions when my mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] had to work, and I had to stay with her.
Speaker 1: What was your relationship like with her?  And what type of person was she?
Speaker 2: My mother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your grandmother.
Speaker 2: --was the older girl.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother.
Speaker 2: My grandmother?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My grandmother, I don't know.  She had a look of mulatto.  Had real pretty hair, and she was, she was light-skinned.  She took pride in her hair, and looked like she would be combing it all the time, as I remember when I was growing up.  And all of her friends called her Bea.  But Bea didn't work.  Her children took care of Bea, my mother included.  They called my mother Sister.  Sometimes the older girl in the family during that era, they were referred to as Sister.  So, for a long time I don't know if the neighbors knew her name.  They'd say, "That's Sister's boy," when they'd talk about me.  So, she had two brothers and she had three sisters, one of whom is still living in Los Angeles [California] presently.  Two of my aunts were young teenagers when I was in elementary school, and they really cared for me.  I was with them all the time.  As a matter of fact, my mother's younger sister Jewel [Jewel Watson Richardson] dated a young man, both were students at Anderson High School [E.H. Anderson High School; L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas].  That was before, I think I was still in the elementary school [Blackshear Elementary School; Blackshear Elementary Fine Arts Academy, Austin, Texas] at the time.  And they would take me to the movies with them, reluctantly.  I would want to go with--David [David Richardson], his name was.  And that was during the time of World War II [WWII], at the beginning of World War II.  It would have been around the 1940s when they were recruiting young men.  And he got out of high school and they recruited him in the [U.S.] Navy.  He played in the Anderson High School band, and consequently he was, he was good enough to make the Navy band.  And they moved to Florida, Pensacola first.  And they would write my mother and tell her--I always liked Uncle David.  And when he would come home after they got married, he'd bring me a sailor cap.  (Laughter) And I always took a lot of pride in wearing my sailor cap from my uncle.  I was in, you know, in the elementary grades then and then getting ready to go to junior high school.  But I kind of grew up with that aunt, because she wasn't that much my senior.  I mean she must have been, what, eighteen or nineteen, and I must have been ten or twelve, because I wanted to be with them all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had another young aunt as well.  And then I had an older aunt.  And my uncle--
Speaker 1: What were your aunts' names, besides Jewel?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Helen [Helen Watson Floyd] and Jewel, they were about two years apart.  And the one after my mother was Waldine, W-A-L-D-I-N-E [Waldine Watson Hill], she became Mrs. Hill.  Helen became Mrs. Floyd, and Jewel became Mrs. Richardson.  Her husband was David, one of my favorite uncles at that time.  He still lives, by the way, in Los Angeles, and we communicate by computer.  He sends me some of the messages, and I reply.  And so we, we stay in touch.  He may be eighty-nine now, so still doing well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, I got two other uncles, too.  The older brother--my mother was the oldest girl, and her older brother was, they called him Son; his name was Andrew [Andrew Watson].  And then the one that's the favorite was Cornelious Watson, a beautiful body, handsome.  I call him Uncle Bubba (laughter).  And so they started calling me Bubba.  My nickname is Bubba (laughter).  And some people call me that now, people I grew up with, and I like it.  I say they know me if they call me Bubba, so I'm at home.  So I had Aunt Helen; I had Aunt Jewel; Aunt Waldine; Uncle Andrew, Son, they called him; and then I had Uncle Bubble, Cornelious.  And of course my mother had made the Watson family.
Story_ID: 614904
Speaker 1: You said that your [maternal] grandmother [Beatrice Gordon Watson] appeared to be mulatto?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know any more information about that, or who her parents might have been [Callie Gordon and Sherman Gordon]?
Speaker 2: Coming out of the area, the Cincinnati [Ohio] area, my Great-aunt Emma [Emma Gordon Lawsha] did not talk about that very much.  It was just the appearance that my grandmother had.  And that's why no one said that, and I didn't pay that any attention during my growing up.  It was after I got to be an adult that in my reading--and people would talk about mulattoes.  But she was light-skinned.  And my Aunt Jewel [Jewel Watson Richardson] was also light-skinned, and my Aunt Waldine [Waldine Watson Hill], who still lives.  My mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] was just regular brown-skinned.  But somehow or another, in the genes--my Uncle Bubba [Cornelious Watson] I called him, he was real reddish with red hair and kind of freckles.  So, it was just a mixture in the family.
Story_ID: 614905
Speaker 1: Tell me your father, his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Elmer Akins.
Speaker 1: And where was he born, and do you know what year?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was born March 10, 1911.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your dad.
Speaker 2: My dad, I admired him, of course; I loved my parents.  He worked all the time.  A great churchman, a great Christian.  I say that because I followed--I try to follow in his footsteps, a great churchman.  He never did miss church if he was well.  And let me just say a word about his work ethic.  Dropping out of school at that time, those men just had to work as they could on the streets.  He worked in a barbershop where he shined shoes on the drag in the university area.  With his personality, he was able to get along very well at the barbershop; he worked there several years.  And he met some of the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] students there and became friends, because of his personality.  And because we had open minded students, most of the time they were a little more liberal than their parents, especially we're talking about early, during the '40s [1940s] and late '40s [1940s], in that era.  He worked there until the barbershop closed, and then he got a job working at the state, working at the state capitol [Texas State Capitol, Austin, Texas], working with the supreme court [Texas Supreme Court].  And he worked for them for about thirty years.  He was a custodian, but then he stayed so long and handled himself so well until they gave him the title of a clerk.  And he would, you know, clean the offices.  And then he became one of the people who would do the errands for them.  The cases coming to the supreme court and the briefing packages come in, and he would take them to the law offices downtown, which afforded him an opportunity to meet some of the prime attorneys in the State of Texas, and especially in Austin [Texas].  And, of course, this being the capital, most of the prime law firms had offices here in Austin.  And so, he learned.  And he was professional in his own way, not having a college degree, but yet professional.  Because he watched and he learned from his association with those attorneys, and with the supreme court, and he had a lot of admiration and respect for them.  As a matter of fact, he would wear a tie to work every day, every day.  And so, I admired that in him.  He was serious about his work, and they admired him there.  And I have nothing but fond memories of both my mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] and father, because they loved me dearly.
Story_ID: 614906
Speaker 1: I'll say this about him [Akins' father, Elmer Akins].  He liked quartet music, gospel quartet music.  And when we were growing up he was a part, when I was growing up, he was a part of the gospel association.  He started the Austin Quartet Association, and it became a state organization.  But he was a part of the Royal Light Singers, and they would sing at churches in the rural areas on Sunday, Sunday afternoons and at night.  And of course, I'd have to go along with them.  And so, I'm a gospel quartet fan as well.  And then he became a promoter of gospel music and, you know, he was able to be on the radio.  He was a disc jockey for gospel music and started on the station KNOW [KNOW Radio, Austin, Texas], and KNOW is still in existence now.  Do you know he worked for fifty years as a gospel promoter and as a gospel disc jockey?  Every Sunday morning, the 'Gospel Train,' Elmer Akins and the 'Gospel Train.'  And so, I grew up with that.  And I enjoy gospel music and quartets now.  That's just a little bit about my parents.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They were both church people.  Well, let me tell you one thing that's a little different, and I think it still happens.  But it never was--it wasn't a point of contention with them.  My mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] was a member of the Methodist church, and my father was a member of the Baptist church.  My mother didn't drive, but my father would always take her to church and come back and pick her up, dutifully.  And so they went to their respective churches.  But on Sunday afternoon when there was a program at the Baptist church, yes, we would all go.  Or at night, during that time we didn't have any programs at the Methodist church [Wesley Methodist Church; Wesley United Methodist Church, Austin, Texas] at night I don't think.  We still do, and they started having what they call vesper services (laughter).  But I thought I'd mention that, it was interesting.  My mother took me to church with her, and so I'm now United Methodist as I've been pretty much all my life, although I visited other churches as well.  But I just wanted to say a little bit about they were great church people.
Story_ID: 614907
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your grandparents on your father's side.
Speaker 2: My, I didn't know my grandfather on my father's side.  His name was Jim Akins.  They were from Pilot Knob [Texas] area near Creedmoor [Texas].
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Hattie, Hattie Akins [Hattie Franklin Smith].  Excuse me, her maiden name was Hattie Franklin, and they were from the Gonzales [Texas] area.  And Gonzales is about a hundred miles from here south, as if you were going--let me use the term as if you were going to Victoria [Texas] or if you were going to the coastline.  Highway 183 [U.S. Route 183] will take you to Gonzales, Texas.  It's about a hundred miles from here.  Heavily Hispanic area.  My grandmother said that she was part Indian [Native American] and, you know, she'd say, "Well, look at my high cheekbones and all."  But she was a loving person, and I lived with her.  While my mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] and dad [Elmer Akins] worked, I lived with my grandmother, with this grandmother for the most--I was with the other grandmother as well, but I was with this grandmother.  I was very fortunate to have two grandmothers that I loved dearly until I was an adult before they passed away.  And so, I really enjoyed the benefits of Miss Beatrice Watson [Beatrice Gordon Watson] on my mother's side, and my dear grandmother Hattie Akins, Hattie Franklin Akins (laughter) and so forth.  She had, what, five children.  Oh, she was a great Baptist as well (laughter).
Story_ID: 614908
Speaker 1: Let's begin to talk about you as a child.  What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think my--well, my earliest reflections of childhood would be in elementary school [Blackshear Elementary School; Blackshear Elementary Fine Arts Academy, Austin, Texas].  I was a student at Blackshear Elementary School.  And I remember my teachers, I remember my principal, and I remember the activities with some of my students, and I--
Speaker 1: Is there a specific memory of something?
Speaker 2: Our principal was a Mr. F.R. Rice [Friendly R. Rice], interesting.  Mr. Rice initiated in our school, and started in the Austin system [Austin Independent School District], the hot lunch program.  You're talking about in the late '30s [1930s], the hot lunch program.  The year before, they hadn't had a hot lunch program.  We would take our lunch every day in our sacks and in our lunch buckets.  But then somehow or another, I guess through the government and through the school district, he was able to initiate that, and we had hot lunches on our campus.  And then as a result of that, they had hot lunches on all the campuses.  And let me tell you what I remember about it.  We used to have assembly programs.  That was during the time when you could, teachers could use corporal punishment.  And I had, you know, I received some spankings from my teachers.  They loved me, but of course I was mischievous like most boys.  But I remember the first grade teacher, Mrs. Maggie Washington and Mrs. Moten [ph.].  And later on I remember Mrs. Perry [ph.] in the fifth grade, excellent teacher.  We had a scout master by the name of Mr. Taft [ph.].  Mrs. Johns [ph.] was our drama teacher--and great experiences.  Oh, (laughter) I remember we called it the tripping ground, where all of us kids at lunchtime--you know, boys want to show their power.  And we would play this kickball, but we also had to do this wrestling, and they called it the tripping ground.  And that was, that was the activity that took place practically every day after, during the lunch period.  So, but, they always fostered strong academics.  The guy said, "If you're going to be a student at Blackshear, you're going to be a good student."  That was during the days of segregation, of course.  That was the only elementary school that, you know, we could go to, but there were three other elementary schools during that time.  But Blackshear was the one, and I say it was the best.  So, I do remember that activity.
Story_ID: 614909
Speaker 1: If you could think of a sound, a sight, or a smell that would take you back to that time, what would they be?
Speaker 2: I would think in terms of, maybe the smell of food, where it looked like we were really ready to eat during lunchtime.  And we, as you, you know, you'd get in the line, and you'd enjoy your meal and have a little fun, and then you'd go to the tripping ground (laughter) or outside to play.  And we had, that would be something I would remember.  Oh, speaking of that, I was in a play called the Tom Thumb play.  And I was one of the characters, and I had forgotten my lines and, you know, I felt a little bad about it. (Laughter) But the teachers let me do it again.  And my mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] was proud, because she bought me a little military uniform to be in that play.  And some of the people that I was in the play with, they were with me throughout high school [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas].  Fond memories of elementary grades [at Blackshear Elementary School; Blackshear Elementary Fine Arts Academy, Austin, Texas].
Story_ID: 614910
Speaker 1: You said that you were a mischievous child.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, what type of student were you?
Speaker 2: Average, average student.  I had trouble with math.  You know, I wanted to do it, but I don't know if I was--I would study.  I think I'd play a lot, and always liked to read comic books and read.  And I--somehow or another during that era, you think you could draw.  You know, I always wanted to try to draw.  I wasn't very good, but I enjoyed doing that.  And I spent more time doing that than I should have.  So--
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject?
Speaker 2: My favorite subject has always been social studies, I guess because I enjoy reading and I like to talk, and I could recite.  So, I enjoyed my elementary days [at Blackshear Elementary School; Blackshear Elementary Fine Arts Academy, Austin, Texas].
Story_ID: 614911
Speaker 1: We were talking about your elementary school days.  Now, tell me about the community in which you lived.  We're going to go--well, we were talking about school.  So maybe we--let's just go ahead and finish talking about your elementary school days, and--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --with your mother, living with your mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins].  And you did talk to me about Miss Proctor [ph.].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, let's talk about the community in which you lived.  Give me a tour of the square block in which you lived.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I lived at that time at 1711 Washington Avenue [sic. Pennsylvania Avenue], which is about four blocks from Blackshear Elementary School [Blackshear Elementary Fine Arts Academy, Austin, Texas].  We lived across the street from Kealing Junior High School [Theodore Kealing Junior High School; Theodore Kealing Middle School, Austin, Texas], and Washington [sic. Pennsylvania Avenue] intersected right in front of Kealing.  But we walked to Blackshear going south every day and back, and would play on the grounds of Kealing Junior High School.  This is in East Austin [Austin, Texas].  Across the street from Blackshear Elementary School is Huston Tillotson College [Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas].  Now, at that time it was Tillotson College, and we're still talking the late, the early '40s [1940s].  The community--Rosewood [Avenue] was the street where many of the derelicts and persons who did not have work would stand around and hang around.  So, our reputation in East Austin at that time, as we refer to it now as the hood, had some shortcomings based on the fact that many of the persons were out of work at that time, and not having a lot to do.  And there were taverns that were there on Rosewood at the time, and sometimes the taverns would breed situations that were not very good.  Fights would occur, and there were even some shootings and some stabbings during my time in elementary school, which was kind of horrifying for us.  But it was an occurrence that happened, and we got a chance to adjust to it because we had to walk through that area and walk back because we didn't live too far from there.  We didn't have any unpleasant things happen to us directly, but on weekends there would be skirmishes and police sirens and ambulance sirens, and people would have difficulty.  And that occurred pretty regular when I was growing up, on Friday and Saturday nights.  And I'm glad that that situation has surely improved over the years, but that was kind of a sense of it.  We walked to town from where I lived.  We, there was a bus, a streetcar then (laughter).  The streetcar would come to 12th [Street] and Chicon [Street], which is in the same area, and it would be the end of the line over here in East Austin.  They called it the end.  So we would go near the end, because upon coming from town on the streetcar, that's where we would have to get off, and then we'd walk to our respective homes.  And of course I lived there on Washington, and it wasn't far from Rosewood Park [Austin, Texas], which was an outstanding social place for us in our neighborhood.  Rosewood Park still exists; it's a very nice park even now.  And so, we spent a lot of activities on Saturdays and Fridays going to Rosewood Park to play games.  And the swimming pool was there.  And I didn't swim, because my mother said, "No, you haven't learned to swim, so don't get near the water."  And so, I was obedient and did not.  But we would walk to the movie, which was on 12th Street near the end, as I mentioned.  We would walk there and kind of enjoy--there was a Yates Drugstore [Austin, Texas] and we would go by and get an ice cream cone.  So, that was kind of the--oh, and there was a Carver library [George Washington Carver Branch, Austin, Texas] which was on Angelina [Street], which is not very far from where I lived, nor from--and even now near Kealing Middle School now.  The Carver library was there early on then, and we would visit there.  And the church that I attended, and I still attend, is not far from there.  So, everything was within walking distance when I was in the elementary grades.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Wesley Methodist Church.  It's Wesley United Methodist [Wesley United Methodist Church, Austin, Texas] now, because of the change that occurred in 1968.  But, yes, the church is still there and it looks the same, really.
Story_ID: 614912
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your friends from that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were the other occupations of some of your friends' parents?
Speaker 2: Most of them were domestics.  Maybe one would have a father or mother who worked at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], but many of them worked at department stores.  Many of them worked at grocery stores.  Many of them worked at the warehouses around.  Most of the ladies were domestics.  Most of them worked as maids in homes of some of the more affluent people, white people, who lived in West Austin [Austin, Texas].  And we ate well, because during that time our parents were able to bring food home to us from those work stations, and clothes as well.  So, we didn't have any--early on, we didn't have any sense of any quest for civil rights.  When I was in elementary school [Blackshear Elementary School; Blackshear Elementary Fine Arts Academy, Austin, Texas] I didn't hear very much about that.  I guess I wasn't in that circle, and my father [Elmer Akins] and them didn't talk political at that time, either.  Everybody seemed to try to make a living, and everybody wanted good jobs, so to speak.  So, they stayed on their jobs.  And every now and then there would be some taxi drivers.  But to work at a department store like Scarbrough's [E.M. Scarbrough and Sons, Austin, Texas] was a good job.  Or to work for a Mrs. Proctor [ph.], you had a job.
Story_ID: 614913
Speaker 1: You wanted to tell me a little bit about Mrs. Proctor [ph.].  But before we go there--now, you were growing up during the Depression [Great Depression] time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So your family never felt the sense of--well, I should ask you.  Did you feel the pressure of being in the Depression era?
Speaker 2: I didn't, I couldn't tell.  Being very honest, if someone said later on, "Did you know you were poor?"  I didn't think about being poor, because if I, if I wanted a new pair of shoes, somehow my mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] would struggle to get it for me.  But she kept a job, and my father [Elmer Akins] kept a job.  And everybody for the most part--my grandmother [Beatrice Gordon Watson] didn't work, but everybody else was working.  I don't, I can't explain the horrors of not having a meal, because somehow or another they always provided, provided for us.  But that was during the Depression years.

Speaker 1: We were going to talk about Mrs. Proctor [ph.].
Speaker 2: Oh, that was an experience.  My mother, they loved her dearly, and she was a good worker.  And they had a big Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve, where all of the family, the Proctor family, would come in to have their Christmas party and exchange gifts.  So, they always invited my mother to bring me.  And I never did want to go, because it was an all-white setting and I wasn't accustomed to it.  But my mother said, "Yes, you're going."  And we would, I'd get a good bath and she'd clean me up, so to speak.  And there was a certain time when they wanted me to come in, and so my mother would take me, have me there, excuse me, would have me there about an hour before.  Later, I would go in and meet with the family, because they would have their dinner and all, and I wasn't going in at that time.  But after the dinner, at the gift exchanging, when Mattie Lee [Mattie Lee Watson Akins]--they wanted her to come in so she could get her Christmas gift, and they always said bring me.  And so, and I remember going in there a little embarrassed, you know.  But after all the years, I got used to it, and so I looked forward to it.  They'd always give me nice gift (laughter).  And so, in later years I said well, maybe I was being prepared to go into an integrated situation later in my life, and I didn't know that that was taking place.  I only say that in some jest, but I have thought about it like that.  But that was an experience, because that happened to me every Christmas for about six or seven years while I was growing up; we'd get a gift.  "Miss Mattie Lee, where is he?"  "Here he is."  "Come here."  And we'd enjoy it, and I would be so happy that it was done, you know, a relief.  "Come on in."  Reluctantly, but I'd go in.  But that was an experience.  They were showing kindness and benevolence to my mother and to me and my family.
Story_ID: 614915
Speaker 1: Did you have any dreams or aspirations at that time?
Speaker 2: No, I really didn't.  I didn't know what I wanted to do or what I wanted to be.  Like I said, I liked to draw.  And then when we got--later on then it began to ferment in my mind--some things I'd like to do.
Speaker 1: So, where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: I went to junior high school--I'm trying to get my years straight.  I may be in error here.  It was in the early '40s [1940s]; it must have been '42 [1942] or '43 [1943].  Let's see.  I was in, I graduated--excuse me.  I graduated from junior high school in 1945.  So, I was there in '42 [1942] and '43 [1943] at Kealing Junior High School [Theodore Kealing Junior High School; Theodore Kealing Middle School, Austin, Texas], which was right across the street from where I lived.  And then my mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] and my dad [Elmer Akins] bought a home at 1705 Chestnut [Avenue].  So, I remember these places I lived (laughter).  And, you know, we had to walk.  That was a good distance from there, but that was still the only junior high school for, you know, African American youngsters.  So, we all went to Kealing.
Story_ID: 614916
Speaker 1: Your parents [Mattie Lee Watson Akins and Elmer Akins] were renting--was it a house or an apartment?
Speaker 2: No, we never did, I never lived in an apartment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We would--Always a house.  But let me just describe it.  When I lived with my [paternal] grandmother [Hattie Franklin Smith], we lived in what they called a Hofheinz house.  You know, a lot of people in Austin [Texas], they didn't know what a Hofheinz house was.
Speaker 1: Well, spell that for me.
Speaker 2: Well, let me--it's a German name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hofheinz.  I guess it would be H-O-F-I-E-N-Z [sic.], or something of that sort.  But anyway, that was the name of the owner.  And they had these tall underpinnings to hold the house up, so to speak.  So underneath, you could play underneath the house.  And the structure was about two bedrooms and a bath and a kitchen, it was nice.  So, we lived in a Hofheinz house.  But then my father was able to get a house next to my grandmother, who was living in Austin at that time.  And you know, it wasn't much of a house--a little--what you'd call kind of a shack. 1705 Chestnut [Avenue].  But it was home, and so it was fine with me.  Again, I say we never thought in terms of poor.  You know, clean--and make sure you take a bath in the tub.  I did that, and my mother kept me clean and mannerable and respectful.  Always kept, always kept me clean.
Speaker 1: So these houses, this was the name of the man who owned the houses (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He owned the houses--
Speaker 1: And he rented those out?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and there were several of them. There were several of them all over Austin.  And of course there are still some remnants of Hofheinz houses.  If I had some time to go with you, I'd show you one (laughter).  But anyway, I mention that because that's where we lived.
Speaker 1: And then your parents saved up enough--
Speaker 2: To buy--
Speaker 1: --to buy a house (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To buy a place, uh-huh, and had it built.  It wasn't much, very small, but it was a home.
Story_ID: 614917
Speaker 1: Tell me about your junior high school years.
Speaker 2: I think that that's where we wanted to be in the band.  We had a--the band director was a recruiter, and he wanted to recruit some players and people.  So I joined the band, and my mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] bought me a clarinet.  I wasn't very good at it, but I wanted to be in the Anderson High School band [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas], because the Anderson High School band had a great reputation.  And I wanted to play football, but my mother said, "No, you don't want to play football."  So, we had good teachers at Kealing [Theodore Kealing Junior High School; Theodore Kealing Middle School, Austin, Texas] I thought.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any?
Speaker 2: Yes, one of my experiences with Mrs. Onie B. Conley.  Miss Conley was an outstanding physical education teacher.  And by the way, she just passed a few years ago.  But a strong disciplinarian.  That was during the era when if you came to school and your hair wasn't combed, she had a comb for you.  "Boy, comb your hair."  And she was very clean.  She would have alcohol and all of that on her desk.  "Wash your hands.  Here's a napkin for you, a Kleenex for you," you know.  Meticulously clean (laughter).  But she taught that in her P.E. [physical education] classes.  But I remember her.  And I remember English teacher, Mrs. Brigsby [ph.], who was very good, and the math teachers, Mr. Norman [ph.] in math and social studies.  And our principal was Mr. T.C. Calhoun, who later on--you know, I didn't know a thing about college then.  But later on after I got to high school, he took pride in the fact that he had gone to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] to get a master's [degree].  And, you know, we often wondered why would a person from here--well, he couldn't get in the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], you know, that was out of the question.  But, so most of those people had gone to schools outside of the state to get their further training.  But they were good teachers, I thought.  So, I had good experiences at Kealing.  And see, then we became interested in girls and, oh, little girlfriends and so forth.
Speaker 1: Were there any other extracurricular activities, maybe like Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America]?  Was that available?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association]?
Speaker 2: Yes, the YMCA.  I was a Boy Scout for a while, because we had a Boy Scout troop at the church [Wesley Methodist Church; Wesley United Methodist Church, Austin, Texas].  So, I participated in that part.  But for the most part, I was in the band.  And I wanted to be a--I liked social studies, and they would have little debates and so forth, and I'd try to engage in some of those.  But it was a good experience for me at Kealing.  I made pretty good grades, but I wasn't outstanding (laughter).
Story_ID: 614918
Speaker 1: So you go on to high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And which high school?
Speaker 2: Anderson High School [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: Is this the Old Anderson?
Speaker 2: Old Anderson, located on Pennsylvania Avenue.  That's the high school.  As a matter of fact, Kealing [Theodore Kealing Junior High School; Theodore Kealing Middle School, Austin, Texas] was right--a block from Anderson then.  The new Kealing is still located in the same place.  I was in the school district as one of the administrators when we rebuilt Kealing, and we put it back where it was.  But the old Anderson building burned down, and there was a new Anderson building after I graduated, and it was built at 900 Thompson [Street].  And I don't want to get a little ahead of myself, but I became a teacher there at the new--at that time, the new Anderson High School.  But going back to the old Anderson High School, I was in the band and we had great bands and we had strong teachers.  Let me tell you about one particular teacher that had followed me, I'll say that (laughter).  Mrs. L.E. Frazier [Lucille Frazier], outstanding English teacher, we were all afraid of her.  She was small in stature, but good nonetheless.  A strong disciplinarian, no question about it.  She was at Blackshear [Blackshear Elementary School; Blackshear Elementary Fine Arts Academy, Austin, Texas] when I was there, and I'll say, mean, mean (laughter).  And lo and behold, when I got to Anderson, there she was again (laughter).  A good teacher, though.  We had to really write well and try to speak well and, you know, do your assignments.  She, along with Mr. Timmons [Raymond Timmons], who was a geometry teacher--which I was pretty good in geometry, wasn't very good in math--and Mr. Isaac Chapman [ph.], and some of those.  Mr. W.E. Pigford was the coach, the football coach when I was high school.  I couldn't play football, but I loved it.  I played it every opportunity I could get, sandlot.  But he was a fine gentleman.  He became principal later on, but he, while I was in high school he was coach.  Mr. W.B. Campbell was our principal, who we admired dearly.  He had been in World War I [WWI], and he was a captain in World War I.  And, you know, reading all the stories, we couldn't imagine an African American being a captain in World War I, but he was.  And big stately man, a great disciplinarian.  He, too, had gone to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] to get his master's [degree].  And so, we admired Mr. Campbell.  Walking down the hall, "Boy, get in the class."  Miss Frazier and all those teachers were just--and then we had a science teacher that we loved dearly, and I want us to talk about him. (Laughter) His name was M.L. Pickard.  Mr. Pickard was so enthusiastic about his work; he had humor all the time.  I recall when he would write a formula in chemistry on the chalkboard, and he would not erase it with the eraser.  He'd be so enthusiastic to go to the next point, he would like wave it with his sleeve and just keep on going.  And we didn't think anything of it right then.  But later on we said, "Hey, Mr. Pickard--."  But we loved him because he had a little humor, he was an excellent teacher, and he made us good students.  "Do your work."  He didn't have to be the firm disciplinarian.  Because of his subject matter, you became disciplined and you handled yourself and now--some teachers have this innate ability to make you feel good, and you like to go to class.  He was such a teacher, M.L. Pickard.  Anyway, I remember Mr. Pickard.  All of them were good.  Mr. C.P. Johnson was the social studies teacher that I admired and I wanted to be like.  The first time I'd ever heard that there was a Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] was in his class.  I didn't know, I wasn't well read.  I'd read newspapers and read our assignments, but I didn't know about Morehouse. I mean, in Austin [Texas], read the newspapers.  He was a Morehouse man.  He talked about it and got us all inspired about Morehouse.  And then I began to think in terms of college, going to a university or going to a college when you get out of school.  And they gave us kind of a thirst I think for learning.  "Elevate your horizons.  Be somebody.  Go to school."  And that's what I kind of I wanted to--I wanted to do that.  When he said Anderson was a good school, I always thought it was a good school then.  And even after I got out of there and came back to teach there, it still was a good school.  And so, many of our students were inspired to move onward and upward, and to do your very best so you can become a professional and really be a credit, not only to your parents, to your family and to your community.  So, I wanted to do that.
Story_ID: 614919
Speaker 1: Did you know, or did they teach you at the time who Anderson was, who the school was named after?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Mr. Laurine Cecil Anderson had been at Prairie View as an administrator, Prairie View University [Prairie View State Normal School; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas].  But he wasn't--they called him, not a president then.  He was called the principal of Prairie View.  But he left Prairie View, and his brother, E.C. Anderson [sic. E.H. Anderson], had been the principal of this school in Austin [Texas].  And they brought him in to succeed him, and he became our principal.  Laurine Cecil Anderson, Miss Ernie Mae Miller's relative [HistoryMaker Ernie Mae Miller].  I never did meet him.  We saw his picture.  But Mr. Campbell [W.B. Campbell] was our principal, and we admired Mr. Campbell.  Those principals during that era--and I wanted to be one later on (laughter)--would dress well.  They were upright citizens, church people, you know, kind of pillars in the community, and we wanted to be like them.  And so I said I want to be a high school--I want to be a teacher first, but I want to be a high school principal one day.  And lo and behold, the Master blessed me so I was able to be that.  But high school [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas] was good for me.  I was in various debates, the debate team.  I wasn't much in drama.  They had me do a little something every now and then, but I wasn't very good at it (laughter).  But I enjoyed being in the band and I enjoyed being part of the football team, and I wanted to do good in social studies and in English.  And I just wanted to be a good citizen.
Story_ID: 614920
Speaker 1: That particular teacher, was he the one that helped you prepare to apply to college?  And what colleges did you apply to?
Speaker 2: Only one, and that was Huston Tillotson.  It was Tillotson [Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] then.  My mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] said, "You're going to go to school," of course, she hadn't been.  And you know, I hadn't--nobody in my family.  But I had a cousin on my father's [Elmer Akins] side, Miss Algerine Craig, who had gone to Prairie View [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], and had graduated and became a librarian, and she was the librarian at Blackshear Elementary School [Blackshear Elementary Fine Arts Academy, Austin, Texas] when I was there.  And she was my cousin, my father's first cousin.  But that was the only person who had to go to college.  But my mother wanted me to be a professional, and to have some things she did not have.  And she was a stickler for--, "You're going to go to school, boy."  And so, I was able to go to Tillotson.
Speaker 1: How did you prepare to go off to college, even though it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At home?
Speaker 1: --still here in Texas at home?  But how did you prepare to--?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, Miss Gines [Denise Gines], what happened was most of the kids at Anderson [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas] at that time, their parents wanted them to go to school, to go to college.  And since everybody else seemed to, they wanted to go.  I wanted to go too.  And Mr. C.P. Johnson, and Miss Frazier [Lucille Frazier], and Miss Marguerite Harris, and Miss Verna Long, these were my teachers--they were inspiring, and were talking about schools all the time.  "You need to do this," and, "You need to prepare yourself."  And Mr. Pickard [M.L. Pickard], the man I was telling you about, he talked about it pretty much daily.  And so we wanted to, we aspired to go to college.  And so my mother said, "You're going to Tillotson."  Now let me--may I just say something quickly about that.  Sam Huston College [Samuel Huston College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] is affiliated with the Methodist church.  And those students who were attending Sam Huston at the time, they would come to Wesley Church [Wesley Methodist Church; Wesley United Methodist Church, Austin, Texas], and that's my church.  And so, most of those pretty girls and those young men in the choir and all, they were coming to my church every Sunday.  So, people said, "Well, why didn't you go to Sam Huston?"  Well, most of my friends wanted to go Tillotson, and my mother wanted me to go to Tillotson, too.  I don't know, I think at that time Sam Huston had a party reputation or something, and mother knew about it.  I didn't (laughter). And so I didn't get a chance to, I didn't get a chance to go there.  But anyway--
Speaker 1: So, what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a, I think a picture of the class I want you to see.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I'm jumping the gun, probably (laughter).
Story_ID: 614921
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your freshman year in college.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Had you had, did you have to work to pay for college?  Or, tell me how that was taken care of.
Speaker 2: I always had a little job.  When, I worked at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] in the commons area.  You know, that's the cafeteria, and I was a dishwasher.  But my mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] worked--she's working at the Brackenridge Hospital [Central Health Brackenridge Campus, Austin, Texas] now in the nursing home.  And she and my dad [Elmer Akins], he's at the supreme court [Texas Supreme Court] now at this time.  And they, they were able to take care of my tuition.  But I always had a little job also. Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, tell me about your first year.
Speaker 2: Well, we were afraid that academically we would not be ready.  And so I recall they had--what's it called?  English 103, I believe.  If you got out of high school and that, you weren't proficient in that particular English, they'd send you back, put you back into a lower level English class.  And I was so happy that--because I guess of Miss Frazier [Lucille Frazier] and some of the others--I was able to be in the regular English class.  And I think that was my first noteworthy accomplishment (laughter) that I felt good about, that they didn't put me back into the remedial kind of English class when I first got to Tillotson [Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas].  I was able to be in the regular English class, and I was able to get along all right.  I wasn't so very good in--I took French, which I should not have, and I wasn't very good in that.  And I wasn't good, very good in some of my math classes, but then I blossomed later on.  I took a minor in English and a major in social studies.  And we had a history teacher who was very good, Mrs. C.J. Shackles [sic. Chrystine I. Shackles], and she kind of helped us get along when we were, you know, faltering and wasn't putting time into studying; she helped us.  But they had a lot of good professors there at the time, Dr. Curry [Marion Milroy Curry], who was a P.E. [physical education] teacher and a friend and a fraternity brother.  I later on became a member of his fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].  They were all inspirational to us.  And the dean was Dr. King [John Quill Taylor King, Sr.], who was a member of our church [Wesley Methodist Church; Wesley United Methodist Church, Austin, Texas].  And I always admired him, Dr. John King.  He was a math teacher and he was dean at the college, and I admired him.
Story_ID: 614922
Speaker 1: Yes.  You were talking about the professors at Tillotson [Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 1: And one thing you said earlier was that you didn't go to Sam Huston [Samuel Huston College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas], which was affiliated with the United Methodist church.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But is Tillotson also affiliated with the United Methodist church?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was when I attended Tillotson, before the merger in 1952, Tillotson is affiliated with the United Church of Christ.  Originally it was founded by the American Missionary Association, which was through an affiliation with the United Church of Christ, which is called the Congregationalist church now.  But there was a merger in 1952 where Tillotson College and Sam Huston College combined.  And so it's called Huston Tillotson, with the United Methodist affiliation and the United Church of Christ now, both in unity; there's strength.  And so that's how Huston Tillotson University came into being.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now you were talking about the professors there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And you wanted to talk more--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --about some of the professors.
Speaker 2: We had a teacher of English named Mrs. Wilson, who was excellent.  She was a very strong churchwoman, and that's one of the things I think that is an asset of a small liberal arts college like Huston Tillotson College then.  But now it's Huston Tillotson University.  There were persons who would be concerned individually about our students.  There weren't many students there; we're talking about six or seven hundred.  Now here in 2010 there are over eight hundred students, which is very good, one of the largest numbers we've ever had.  While I was there it was about six hundred, so the professors were available to visit with the students, and the class sizes were small.  And so, many of the professors influenced us greatly.  And I mentioned Miss C.J. Shackles [sic. Chrystine I. Shackles], and I want to mention also Miss Lilly Wilson, that's our English teacher.  And then of course we had Mr. Robert Whitley [ph.], who was an outstanding teacher as well.  And Dr. Marion Curry [Marion Milroy Curry], we also mentioned him.  During that time we had Dr. John King [John Quill Taylor King, Sr.], who was a math instructor, but became the dean of the college later on, and later on became president.  So, there were a lot of people there that really took time with the students to help us.  Many of us were coming from families where there had not been any college graduates prior to us, and someone said that we were really diamonds in the rough (laughter).  We needed somebody to help us, and I think that those professors helped us, and I think we were, we're better now because of it.  And that's one of the, I think, defining traits of a small college like that.
Story_ID: 614923
Speaker 1: During this time you also became a part of the fraternity?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which fraternity was that?
Speaker 2: Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity in 1952.  Let me tell you.  That was during the time when the two colleges merged.  The charter day would be October of 1952.  It was a glorious time, when students from Tillotson [Tillotson College, Austin, Texas] met students from Sam Huston [Samuel Huston College, Austin, Texas], now, some of which were a little hostile.  Members of the faculty and some of the alumni, and some of the students didn't want to do that.  But it was better for both colleges, for their existence, to do that.  And so, the merger was consummated and chartered in 1952 [as Huston Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas].  And that was the same year that I made the fraternity.  So, I met the young men who were already in the fraternity over at Sam Huston.  And during that time they, you know, they used the term, "We made them," (laughter), which means they brought us through over the burning sands; they used these terminologies.  But we met some fine young men, and we all became Alpha brothers.  And there were other fraternities that were mixing the same way.  And of course, we were fortunate.  I guess we had most of the African American sororities and fraternities on campus.  My wife [Estella Wilson Akins], I met her while I was at Tillotson.  I met her my junior year, although we started at the same time.  I think I, you know, I had a chance to see her around campus, but we didn't really, you know, know each other.  But later on we met, and of course she became my wife.
Story_ID: 614924
Speaker 1: Tell me the story about how you met [Estella Wilson Akins].
Speaker 2: I guess--we had a canteen.  We called it a canteen, where you had dances, you know, on Friday nights.  And you'd meet the girls, and you'd want to try to--I'm not a very good dancer (laughter).  But anyway, I met her and we kind of started dating and talking.  She's quiet.  She doesn't, didn't talk much, and I'm a little more talkative.  But anyway, I was able to meet her.  And she was going to church across the street from the campus [Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas], which is, the church is still there.  It wasn't there at the time we were in school, but it was nearby, and she was attending that church.  She didn't attend the church that I attended very much, but when I'd go on campus I'd get a chance to see her, and we'd talk.  And finally, we had a nice courtship.  As a matter of fact, when I worked at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] washing dishes at night, when we'd get off we'd walk from the University of Texas to the campus practically every night to see the girls, (laughter) and you know, I'd get a chance to see her.  So, it kind of developed.  That was during the time when we couldn't go into the girls' dorms.  I think we could go in there maybe in the lobby on Sunday, but other than that it was off limits to us.  So, what was--I guess people say, "Oh, that's kind of immature-ish."  Well, it wasn't for us.  We would sing to our girlfriends at night.  The fraternity boys would go around the windows.  And they'd come out and wave, you know, wave to us, and we would sing to them (laughter).  We did that; and of course, that was part of it.  But we, a courtship developed.  She's from Palestine, Texas, which is in East Texas about a hundred and eighty miles from here, and I was from Austin, Texas.  But then we started dating, and I would even make some trips to Palestine to see her.  The trains were running then, and we used to go by train there.  And then finally I got a car, but that was near the time when I was graduating that I got a car (laughter).  But--
Speaker 1: How long did you date before you got married?
Speaker 2: We started dating in my junior year, and we got married in 1956, which is two years after we graduated.
Story_ID: 614925
Speaker 1: And you talked about those train trips.  What was the experience like riding on the train?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) When someone would come down from East Texas, coming back to school after Christmas or after summer vacation--it was the Missouri Pacific line [Missouri Pacific Railroad], I remember, an Eagle [Texas Eagle].  And so I would take the Eagle to see her [Akins' wife, Estella Wilson Akins], and I enjoyed it.  Now, when I take a bus ride or a train ride, I get sleepy.  But then, I didn't.  (Laughter) I guess it was the anticipation to get there.  And her mother and her grandmother and her sister, they all lived together, and they were very cordial to me from the very beginning.  Miss Wilson, her mother, was a very nice lady.  And her grandmother lived at that time, and my sister-in-law.  My sister-in-law just passed away two years ago, but such a fine person.  And they welcomed me, and so it was a delightful experience for me to go to East Texas.  And at Christmastime, I'd try to go to East Texas to see her and meet her people, some of her cousins.  Some were younger like myself, and we'd get a chance to visit.  And sometimes we would drive to Tyler [Texas] as a group to go out a little bit and all.
Speaker 1: Did you experience any unpleasantries riding on the train, being that it was segregated at that time?
Speaker 2: You know, Miss Gines [Denise Gines], you know, we talked about--I didn't take offense to anything, because it was commonplace.  And it was just the thing to do, to ride in the section that they asked you to ride in.  And for me to get on a bus in Austin [Texas], on a streetcar, I just automatically went to the back, because it wasn't a, it wasn't a consciousness that I needed to protest that.  And I guess my personality and my upbringing--I know my mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] would talk about some experiences she would have, and she was pretty outspoken.  My mother had a, had a temper sometimes, and she would let people know if she didn't like things.  I just kind of flowed with it, and I didn't seem to take any offense when I rode the bus.  Even we would have fun driving, coming on the bus from the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] at night.  Sometimes we would ride home, and so one of the fellows said, "Well, I'm going to sit up here tonight."  He said, "I'm going to tell them I'm a black Mexican" (laughter).  That was during the time they weren't using the term Hispanic.  They were using--so I said, "Okay, tell them that" (laughter).  We were just having fun.  We'd go and sit in the back, no problem.

Speaker 1: You received your B.A. in--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I received a B.A. in history (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in 1950?
Speaker 2: In 1954, two years after the merger.  And my wife [Estella Wilson Akins] and I graduated at the same time.  I missed being cum laude by about two points, and I wasn't conscious of that until I got ready to graduate.  And see, if I had been conscientious in the beginning, I would have taken care of it.  But I wasn't conscientious, and I got conscientious at the end, and it was too late.  So, we graduated at the same time.  I had made the honor society at Huston Tillotson [Huston Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] finally.  And so, she became a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], she made the sorority.  And so, and she was a Delta and I was an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].  So, we were happy.
Story_ID: 614927
Speaker 1: What happens after you receive your B.A.?  Do you go on to get your M.A.?
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you.  That was a time in my life that I like to talk about, because I tell young people sometimes things don't work out for you.  My wife [Estella Wilson Akins] was able to find a teaching job before, before I was.  Let me just say this.  It was two years before I was able to find a teaching job.  When I graduated in '54 [1954], I didn't find a job until '56 [1956], you know.  What did I do in between time?  Well, I took a course at the university as a, you know, as a graduate student, and I didn't do very well there.  But I waited tables.  I had a job at the engineering club, and I worked at a place in the university area called Jack around the Corner's [ph.].  It was a tavern, and I worked there.  And then I worked at a service station.  And finally a job opportunity came open to me, and I said to my wife, "If I ever get a job, I'm not going to ever be without one," (laughter).  "I'm going to work hard and do whatever I need to do to keep a job."  And that was 'cause I had that experience of not having one.  So, it worked out; it worked out for us just fine.
Story_ID: 614928
Speaker 1: As you're preparing to graduate--because you graduate in 1954?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It came out, yes.
Speaker 1: --is happening now.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you want to be a teacher.  What were your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: You know, I thought that the new opportunities were going to come right away.  There was great anticipation.  I said, wow, this is historic, the first time in history that we're going to have, we're going to desegregate the schools.  We thought, happy day.  But it didn't happen right then.  It didn't happen quite like that.  I remember the, being on college campus when we were in the classes, anticipating it and talking a lot about it.  But it was a little different.  My first teaching job--may I say how I got it?  Papa Hines, Mr. Charles "Papa" Hines, we called him, he was a fraternity brother of ours.  He was head of maintenance at Huston Tillotson [Huston Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas], and I would go by and visit with him and talk.  I said, "Papa, I need a job.  Can you help me get a job?"  He would help people get jobs, because he knew people across the state because he had recruited for Huston Tillotson.  And a lot of people who had graduated had become principals in various places, and he knew them.  And so I would--one day I went to see him.  I said, "Papa, you know, I need a job."  He said, "Well let me tell you--maybe I can help you.  My brother was a principal."  His brother, Mr. Harry Hines, was a principal in Marlin, Texas.  And there was a death of a social studies teacher in Marlin.  That message had been chronicled back to Mr. Hines here, Papa Hines.  And he said, he said, "My brother's coming here to a church conference."  I have a lot of affinity and love for the United Methodist church anyway.  And this kind of adds to it, because I said, "The church helped me to get a job" (laughter).  He said, "My brother's coming to the annual conference that's going to be held at your church.  He's going to be with Reverend Parnell [ph.]," who was the pastor of one of the churches here.  Not the pastor of our church, but the pastor of another church, Methodist nonetheless.  They were friends, and they were going to be at Wesley Church [Wesley Methodist Church; Wesley United Methodist Church, Austin, Texas]; I think it was a Wednesday afternoon.  Yeah, he said, "Go up there and try to see him."  So, I hurried home.  I was married then, and Stella [Estella Wilson Akins] was already in Palestine [Texas] or somewhere with my little daughter [Dianne Akins Iglehart], you know, we had a daughter.  And so I remember I came home to get a shirt, and the button broke up there. (Gesture) Oh, excuse, I'm being too demonstrative (laughter).  But the button broke, and I couldn't tie--you know, I couldn't button it.  Oh, Lord.  So I had to get one of these--my daddy's [Elmer Akins] ties, one of these big knots.  I had to make a big knot so I could look--to try to look representative.  (Laughter) I remember that.  And I met him.  He and reverend, they were walking in the church together, and I stood out and waited.  And they came, and I went up and told them who I was.  He said, "Yeah, Charlie told me you were coming."  Charlie was Papa Hines.  His name was Dr. Charles "Papa" Hines, and we called him Papa.  So he said, "Well, Charlie told me you were coming."  He said, "What's your major?"  And I told him.  He said, "What you been doing?"  I said, "Well, I've been working, and I took a class at the university, but I need a job.  You know, I'm married."  He said, "Well, come up to see me next week."  And I went up to Marlin the next week, and he gave me a job.  And then I became a social studies teacher at Booker T. Washington High School in Marlin, Texas in September of 1956.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was happy about that, and my career started.  I was a social studies teacher, and I was the assistant football coach and head track coach.  And I said, wow.  Excited?  Yes, I was.  Met some good people.  There were several people that started at the same time that I did, lifelong friends of mine, as teachers.  Several people who were already on staff, they really helped us to develop, so that, you know--I did student teaching at my old high school, at Anderson High School [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas].  By that time, there was a new Anderson, you know.  I finished at the one on Pennsylvania Avenue, but by this time the school was located at 900 Thompson [Street], and I had a chance to go back and teach there.  But that was after I had been in Marlin for two years, three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you stayed in Marlin for three years?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Story_ID: 614929
Speaker 1: And did you ever (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was, social studies teacher.
Speaker 1: So, did you ever go back to grad school?
Speaker 2: To grad school?  Yeah, oh, well, let me tell you.  When I got to Austin [Texas], Mr. Pigford [W.E. Pigford], who had been the high school coach, he sent word by a friend of mine that he wanted to see me, because he had a vacancy in social studies.  And I was so happy to get that message, so I went by to see him, and he hired me.  He sent me down to the personnel officer and told them, "Hire this young man.  He's a graduate of our school."  And I went down and he hired me.  It was a happy day, I was so happy about that.  That was in 1959.  My second daughter [Joyce Akins] was being born in 1959.  Anyway, we moved to Austin, and Estella [Estella Wilson Akins] had been teaching in Dallas [Texas].  She taught before I did, she got a job in Dallas.  And my mother-in-law was keeping my little girl, so I would commute from Marlin [Texas] to Dallas to Palestine [Texas] back to Marlin.  It was fine.  I had a little '56 [1956] Plymouth car, and it was fine with me.  You know, I was young, I didn't get sleepy at night (laughter).  So, that was fine.  But anyway, I got to Austin to work.  And being in the atmosphere here where people had master's and that same mindset of Anderson High School [L.C. Anderson High School Austin, Texas] that was there when I was a student there, it maintained that same kind of interest and desire and culture that you needed to go to school and better yourself.  And so, my wife and I decided we'd go to Prairie View [Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] on Saturday while we were working.  So, we drove down to Prairie View each Saturday morning along with some other friends of ours.  And then we went in the summer and we took the children with us.  And we got, we got our master's.  She got her master's before I did, but I was in history, and I didn't finish my paper (laughter).  And so, I had to do a little work on my dissertation.  But she marched in 1962, and I marched in 1963 with a master's degree in history from Prairie View.  And she had already had hers, you know.  And so I came back as a--I felt good about it.  I had a master's in history, and we were doing pretty good.  I met a friend when I became a teacher at Anderson, Dr. H.L. Gaines [Hobart L. Gaines], who was the assistant principal.  He started when I started, we became great friends.  He became my mentor.  He helped me tremendously.
Story_ID: 614930
Speaker 1: In what way did he [Hobart L. Gaines] help you?
Speaker 2: He taught me how better to get along with people, how to be a better administrator--how to be an administrator.  He encouraged me to go to graduate school again.  For example, we would play softball on Tuesday and Thursday night as the faculty at Anderson High School [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas]; I was a teacher then.  We called him Boss Man Gaines.  And he, you know, he had foresight, and was a smart man and been a military man.  So he said, "You guys got to go to school."  I said, "Well, Boss, we already have a master's [degree]."  He said, "No, no, no, you need to go and try to get some administration."  He said, "Jobs are going to open up pretty soon, and we don't have anybody to fill them."  So, a friend of mine and I, we started going to Texas State University, Southwest Texas down in St. Marcos [Southwest Texas State College; Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas].  And I drove down until I got, I got my--well, I didn't do the dissertation.  All I wanted was a certification, so I did the number of hours necessary for the master's, but I received the certification for administration in 1968.  But before I get to that, let me tell you what happened in the meantime after I came back to Austin [Texas] to work.  It was in 1962 that somehow I was able to get along with my students in such a manner--and my fellow teachers--that they named me Teacher of the Year in 1962.  Happy day.  I don't know how that happened.
Speaker 1: This was at Anderson?
Speaker 2: That was at Anderson.
Story_ID: 614931
Speaker 1: Mr. Pigford [W.E. Pigford] and Mr. Gaines [Hobart L. Gaines] were my supporters, and they encouraged me.  And one day Mr. Pigford called me in and said, "Boy, we're going to, they're going to recommend you to go to be an integrated teacher.  For the first time, we're going to break some ground in Austin [Texas]."  I said, "What?  Me?"  He said, "Yeah."  I didn't have a choice, but I mean, you know.  He said, "Well, you think about it," being nice to me.  I thought about it and I said, "Well, if y'all want me to go, I want to go.  You know, I work for this district [Austin Independent School District]."  So, Mr. Pigford called me in again, and they sent me to meet the new, my new principal down at Johnston High School [Albert Sidney Johnston High School, Austin, Texas], who was Anglo; he was a white principal.  Mr. Gordon Bailey, his name was.  Well, I talked around and thought about it, of course, but I tried to get myself together.  So, I went down and met him.  And the deal was already done, (laughter) so they let me think that by me thinking about it, well, I didn't really need to do any more thinking.  Because they said, "You're going," and I, so I was there.  I met him and he welcomed me.  And I appreciated him, he seemed to be a nice guy.  When I met him, the contrast in principals--Mr. Pigford was dressed all the time in his tie and looked good--my former principal who hired me.  Mr. Bailey, when I met him, he was on a tractor cutting the grass at the school.  And I said, "Oh" (laughter).  But that did not tell me what a good man he was; he was a good man.  You can't tell by just the outward cover, you've got to know them and meet them.  And I'd been associated with his people, because they'd always been good to me.  I would not have made any steps toward progress had it not been for them, and I know that.  So, I went ahead.  It turned out all right.  I got there in 1964, and I was the only African American staff person in Austin as a high school principal.  Excuse me--
Speaker 2: As a teacher (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) as a teacher.  And I didn't think in terms of that significance; you know, I didn't.  But I wanted to meet the kids.  They put them in a portable building.  You know, the enrollment was enlarging, and they had portables on the campus.  So, my class was in a portable building.  I didn't take offense to that.  When I told other people, "Where's your classroom," you know, friends, "I'm in the portable."  "What?  They put you in a portable?"  Fine with me.  I had some, met some friends and we had a good time.  And finally when one of the classrooms came open and one of the teachers left, they put me in the building.  So, it was all right.  That was in 1964.
Story_ID: 614932
Speaker 1: Civil rights is going on--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --during this time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are you involved in any way?
Speaker 2: Only through the school district [Austin Independent School District]--not to go protesting in any way, or not to do anything other than try to be a good teacher, and to study so I could be a better teacher so that those kids could accept me.  They had white kids there [Albert Sidney Johnston High School, Austin, Texas], they had a few blacks, and they had quite a few Hispanics for the most part.  And so I had not taught any Hispanic youngsters before, and I'm not, I'm not bilingual, but I had to use my skills to get along with them.  And it worked out fine, they accepted me.  No one called me any name, I don't remember being called any name.  They may have said something in Spanish, and I didn't know what they were saying.  But I didn't know any better (laughter).  I fought through it and I worked through it.  I worked pretty hard to make sure that I was competent each day, and I wanted to study my lessons well and to get along with the system.  So, Mr. Bailey [Gordon Bailey] liked me somehow.  You know, I appreciated it.  And then he asked me to be a dean.  I said, "What?  A dean?"  He said, "Yeah, I have a dean of girls, and I need a dean of boys, and we're going to ask you to serve in that capacity."  Well, I appreciated it.  Now, I mentioned going to get the master's [degree] and the certification down at Texas State [Southwest Texas State College; Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas].  That was another initiative that I needed, to make sure that I was complete.  Mr. Gaines [Hobart L. Gaines] had already encouraged me to go, and I had already gotten in the program.  And I graduated from--by way of the certification--I didn't graduate.  Because I already had a master's, but I got the certification in 1968, and he made me dean of boys when I got my certification.  And ooh, happy day, happy day.  So, I got along pretty good.  You know, I had to stop some fights as dean, and some little racial confrontations.  I had to do that, but I was young then, I was capable of getting in between them and stopping them.  And I tried to treat them fairly all the time.  All of the kids, I tried to treat them fairly.  I tried to make some friends, and I did.  And so, I had success.  I have one of my yearbooks over there that I want to show you.
Story_ID: 614933
Speaker 1: What about during this time also, and a little bit before this-if you can remember what you felt about Vietnam and about King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination?  And we haven't gotten to Martin Luther King yet, but we're working up towards that.  So, what were your thoughts about that?  Were you--you registered for the draft, of course?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: I received deference when I was at Huston Tillotson [Huston Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas], um-hm.  So, um-hm--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what were your thoughts about any of these tragedies that happened during that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a great admirer of Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], because he's from Austin [Texas] and the area, and I was a strong supporter of his.  And some of our teachers at Johnston High School [Albert Sidney Johnston High School, Austin, Texas], they were pretty active politically, and we would talk.  I didn't think much of the Vietnam War.  I didn't think we should have been there.  And I had some friends who were in Vietnam, and I wanted to see that completed; I wanted to see them get out.  And so, I was disappointed that we stayed as long as we did.  And we finally got out, and I was proud of the president when he withdrew us.  But I was disappointed when he said I'm not going to run again, I'm not going to run anymore.  He said, I will not be drafted, and I will not accept being drafted.  I'm not going to run any more.  I was disappointed in that, because I had been a great admirer of him because of his thrust of civil rights, and all of his efforts that he put forth.  And it took so much courage to do that for a man of--a white president to do that--to put his entire career on the line like that for the good of the country and for the good of the people.  So I admired him, you know.  And I've been a Democrat all along, and I still am, of course.  But I admired him, but I didn't think much of the Vietnam War.  By way of other situations during that time, you mentioned later on Dr. King.  I remember where I was when I heard about the assassination in 1968.  That's the year that Dr. King, the dean--but I remember April of that year.  We had, we had saved up and we'd gotten a new car, a '68 [1968] Buick, and I was so happy about it.  And a young Hispanic teacher from Johnston and I--one of the jobs I had at Johnston as a teacher and as a dean, I was the sponsor of the boys service club.  And Mr. Bailey [Gordon Bailey], the principal, worked at the Texas Relays, and had been a great athlete himself.  And he had students from Johnston High School assist at the Texas Relays, and it was my club that assisted.  We were hurdle servers for the famous Texas Relays.  So, I had to take some boys there every year to do that.  So I was on my way to the Texas Relays orientation meeting when I heard about the death of Dr. King.  And I just want to say a word about that when we get done.
Story_ID: 614934
Speaker 1: You wanted to talk more about the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When we just left off--Okay.
Speaker 2: I was on my way, with Mr. Augustine Garza.  I wanted to, you know, I had a new car and I wanted to show it off, so to speak.  So I drove--I said, "I'll drive you." And we were going to the orientation meeting and we heard it, and I was lamenting about it.  But when we got there, that was--the orientation meeting was, it included coaches and officials, and they had food and drink there.  And one of the officials came up to me and said something that I really, I've never forgotten.  And I didn't particularly like it, and I think he could see that I didn't.  I think my response to his statement kind of indicated that.  He said, "Well, he has, chickens come home to roost."  And that, to me, was a derogatory statement.  I loved Dr. King, and for someone to say that--although he was Anglo.  But to say that to me, I don't know how he thought I would respond, but I didn't respond very favorably.  It was a negative to me, and I think I responded negatively by saying I was disappointed in him making a statement like that, and walked away from him.  That was a hard time.  That put a kind of a damper on the enthusiasm and gaiety that you usually experience in one of those orientation meetings.  And I remember that.
Story_ID: 614935
Speaker 1: Now, you stay at Johnston [Albert Sidney Johnston High School, Austin, Texas] until 1971?
Speaker 2: Yes, let me tell you (laughter).  I became dean, and they were still making integration moves in Austin [Texas].  That was an integration move, being the first African American teacher, of course.  But then there were some other teachers that they were making--I just went to high school.  Mrs. Bertha Means [Bertha Sadler Means] went to the junior high school, Allan [John T. Allan Junior High School, Austin, Texas].  And Mr. Booker Snell [Booker T. Snell] went to Allan, and then they moved him the next year to Austin High [Stephen F. Austin High School, Austin, Texas] which was a flagship school, as a teacher.  But I was now at Johnson as the dean now.  And Miss Narvaline Drennan, another very bright young lady, they moved her to Allan at the same time they moved me to Johnston.  But I was the only one to go to a high school.  But they were the first teachers to be moved for integration, okay.  And, well, in 19--between '68 [1968] and '69 [1969], the courts were saying that we're going to close the old Anderson [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas] for desegregation reasons, and we had just a few years left.  Well, the courts continued to vacillate.  They'd come out and say, "Yeah, we're going to do it," and then suddenly, "You got some more years."  They continued to do that.  Well, by this time they wanted to make another move for integration.  Mr. W.E. Pigford, who was the principal at Anderson High School, they asked him to become an assistant principal at Reagan [John H. Reagan High School, Austin, Texas], to integrate the staff there.  So, that meant Mr. H.L. Gaines [Hobart L. Gaines], my great friend who was the assistant principal, they moved him up to principal.  What did he do, but to call me and say, "I want you to be my assistant principal."  I said, "Boss man, I like my job here."  He said, "No."  He came here to this house to see me.  I was here then, we had moved here.  And he said, "Well, you need to come back to help me."  So I said, "Yes, sir," and I did.  So, I became an assistant principal during the years of '69 [1969] through '71 [1971] at Anderson, leaving Johnston and working with Dr. Gaines.  And I was there when they closed Anderson in '71 [1971].  They moved Dr. Gaines to the central office.  He became the first African American assistant superintendent in the district.  And they moved, they closed our school and moved all of our students to other schools in the district.  All the students were dispersed to the various schools based on where they lived.  And the boundary lines, they were changed, and the teachers were dispatched to all the other schools, too.  Well, at that time they sent me to Lanier High School [Sidney Lanier High School, Austin, Texas] as an assistant principal at Lanier, and I stayed there two years as an assistant principal.  So, Dr. Gaines was there at central, (shakes head) at central office as an assistant superintendent, and Mr. Pigford was at Reagan as assistant principal, but he soon retired.
Story_ID: 614936
Speaker 1: You went to Kealing Junior High School [Theodore Kealing Junior High School; Theodore Kealing Middle School, Austin, Texas], right?
Speaker 2: No.  Not as a--that's the school I attended (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, I'm talking about that you attended.
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 1: They closed that school the same time as they closed Anderson [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 1: And these schools in that community, what was the feeling of the people in the community about the closing of these two schools?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you.  The scar still remains.  The community was tremendously upset.  There were demonstrations.  Our kids demonstrated at Anderson before they closed us.  They did some sit-ins, some walk outs, and all that to let us know.  Many of the parents were upset, and protested to the school district [Austin Independent School District].  But the school district had to hold firm, because the courts had done it, they said.  So, very unhappy for a long time.  Even today, they talk about the fact they closed our school, and they took the center of culture away from our community.  They still say that.  And I kind of was in between that, because I became principal of the new Anderson.  And so, I was in a kind of hotbed.  But anyway, that's what happens.  But what happened was after they closed both of them, a group of citizens from East Austin [Austin, Texas], including Volma Overton, who was an outstanding gentleman--he was head of our NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]; Volma, the top man.  It was he who filed a suit against Austin [Texas] to initiate integration in the first place.  He continued to exercise his influence to try to get the school district to do what was, what was right.  A great spirit, a great man.  And then there was another young lady more--we would call her more boisterous, more vocal.  And you would, some people would call radical, Dorothy Turner.  Well, Miss Turner--boy, I'll tell you what.  She can shake the rafters with some of the words in her voice.  But she was effective, she continued to talk.  Well, these forces continued to work, and the district decided with the court's permission that they were going to build, rebuild Kealing at the location where it was previously located, a brand new Kealing.  Well, that placated the community somewhat with the district, you know, we're going to get a new Kealing, a beautiful new Kealing--and it is pretty now--and bring it back to where it was built.  The old Anderson building from which I graduated from, it had burned down.  The new Anderson building at 900 Thompson [Street], where I taught and went back as assistant principal, you know, it remains there.  But people continued to say it should never have closed, okay.  So, we're in a hotbed of controversy for those few years.  Just look at the picture now.  I'm at--I'm near, as assistant principal.  They're building a new school in northwest Austin.  I heard about it, but I didn't have any inclination of being a principal, nor going there, so, while all this was going on.  And so I stayed at Lanier [Sidney Lanier High School, Austin, Texas] two years, and they came and asked me, gave me a promotion to become the new principal, African American principal, at a predominantly white school, the new Anderson High School.  They were going to name it Anderson.  My neighbor [HistoryMaker Wilhelmina Delco], the school board member.  She was on the school board at that time.
Story_ID: 614937
Speaker 1: Who is this?
Speaker 2: Miss Wilhelmina Delco [HistoryMaker Wilhelmina Delco].  Miss Delco was a very strong member of the board, and she was very strong in making Austin [Texas] as inclusive as possible, which was good.  So, she and the school board said, "We have a new school in northwest Austin, where over the years to come, it'll be a predominantly white school.  It would be so inclusive and would be a great mark in the favor of Austin's efforts to desegregate, to name that school L.C. Anderson."  And the board did.  And of course, at the time I never knew that I was going to be the principal there.  The other new school that was coming on board at that time was the northeast high school, which was going to be called LBJ High School [Lyndon Baines Johnson High School; Lyndon Baines Johnson Early College High School, Austin, Texas].  But instead of the northwest high school being called LBJ, and the northeast high school being called Anderson, it was just the opposite.  And of course, it was a strong move I think on the part of our board to really be inclusive in Austin.  You know, I wasn't involved in that controversy, but I was involved in the controversy when they said we're going to name a black principal there.  So I was named, and I was excited.  Scared, but excited to become principal of the new L.C. Anderson High School [Austin, Texas] located at 8403 Mesa [Drive].
Story_ID: 614938
Speaker 1: I want you to talk more about being a principal, an African American principal, in a school that has a majority of white children.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that you had to face?
Speaker 2: The initial problem, in my judgment, was trying to get the kids to accept each other.  Initially, the first two or three years, we had racial conflicts, pretty extensive fights.  I wouldn't call it a war zone, but Austin [Texas] had trouble at all the schools when we initially integrated, before Anderson [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas] was built.  They had tremendous fights at Reagan High School [John H. Reagan High School, Austin, Texas], where the kids were trying to accept each other.  They didn't know each other, that's why.  And McCallum High School [A.N. McCallum High School, Austin, Texas]--and we had a few at Lanier [Sidney Lanier High School, Austin, Texas] where I was an assistant.  Well, at Anderson High School, when it opened, the kids who were brought there didn't go--old Anderson had been closed since '71 [1971].  The new Anderson at 8403 Mesa [Drive] was opened in '73 [1973], so it wasn't too much time in between there.  So the youngsters who formerly attended old Anderson, 900 Thompson [Street], who living in the Booker T. Washington projects [Booker T. Washington Terraces, Austin, Texas], they were bussed into northwest Austin each day.  That created hostility from the very beginning, because they didn't want to be bussed.  First of all, they didn't want the school to be closed, and then they didn't want to be bussed there.  Then some of the youngsters who were at--the white youngsters who were there--many of them had been students at McCallum and many of them had been students at Lanier.  And I suspect their parents felt like they were probably safe from so much of this movement.  But that wasn't so, because these kids were being bussed in every day from the Booker T. Washington units over on Thompson Street.  Well, they were not.  They were coming from disadvantaged situations, and their backgrounds were not as the backgrounds of those middle-class and upper middle-class youngsters.  And so, there was a clash.  And so one of the great challenges we had was to get the faculty together with me and the community to see if we couldn't, through our human relations efforts, to bring those kids together so they could know each other and to appreciate each other and respect each other.  And that took a while, but I was very fortunate to have a lot of help.  We had some parents from East Austin [Austin, Texas], and some of the ministers came in to assist me.  And the district [Austin Independent School District] had mandated that we would all have human relations committees, parent committees, student committees, community committees.  And all of that together, I think helped us to get through the first two or three years, which we had some difficulty.  Okay, then the other thing was--and I think the school district, they were very nice to me, because they allowed me to help select my faculty, and that was really a joy.  I was able to bring in some people who I had known and who had respected me, I thought (laughter.)  And they did.  So, I brought in some of my friends with whom I had taught at other places.  For example, I brought in Mr. Charlie Weiser [ph.], who I had known as a fellow teacher down at Johnston [Albert Sidney Johnston High School, Austin, Texas].  The secretary from Johnston, she was nice to me.  She came to be my secretary.  They sent in another young man that I had not known, but he came in as another assistant principal.  And then I was able to get a counselor that I had known.  I brought in two counselors that I had known.  I brought in some teachers that I had known.  I had about seven or eight African American teachers on my faculty with me, with the other hundred or so from the other schools.  And so, I had a faculty that was really supportive.  Initially some of them were not, of course, and they were not accustomed to having an African American as their supervisor.  I understood that, and so we had to work with that.  We had to let them know that I wanted to be fair, and I wanted to be objective and open.  And I wanted them to respect me, as I was going to sure respect them.  And over time, my faculty was very supportive, and I appreciated them.  As a matter of fact, I have friends even today that we still communicate and visit.  So, that worked out fine finally.  Now, some of the parents were a little hesitant, of course; you would imagine that they would be.  We had some rather affluent parents in the area, and then we had some that were not so affluent, but who wanted to be, and who wanted to carry themselves as if they were.  I could see through some of that.  Many of them were critical of my administration, of course.  It, it, would be shown in various ways.  Discipline--my tendency is to be relatively mild mannered, but I've always been a pretty good disciplinarian.  We had, we had school, but the fights occurred.  And the building was three stories, and supervision was somewhat difficult, but we tried to man it so that we could be in position to stop the fights before they would occur and to be a deterrent.  They wanted to work with the student leaders to get together and--, "Let's have little Coke [Coca-Cola] parties together.  Let's talk about our problems during the day, and let's see how we can reach some common ground."  And so, finally we did that.  Our band program came together, our cheerleaders came together, and our football team came together.  And so, we had all the ingredients to have a top school.  Why wouldn't we?  We had some affluence, a great amount of affluence.  We had very bright students, and we had some students who wanted to be in a setting and wanted to improve themselves.  And we had some students who did not have strong backgrounds, but they had come to Anderson and they too wanted to deport themselves better.  And so, our quest was to get them together.  We sought as a theme the pursuit of excellence, from the very beginning.  And with the ingredients that's there, we should be the top school in the district.  There was no question about it; we should have been, and I think we were.  And even today, Anderson is still among the very top schools in the district, because that clientele has not changed appreciatively.  We have fewer African American students now than we had then.  And I stayed there right at ten years.  I would have made my tenth year, but they moved me to central office.  But I had some good years.  I had some trying times, of course, I wouldn't deny that.  But I grew as a person and as an administrator, and even as a teacher.  And I worked with the community, and it worked out.
Story_ID: 614939
Speaker 1: Can you tell me two things?  The most stressful time or the most trying time?  And then your greatest accomplishment there?
Speaker 2: One of the rather--I had a lot of stressful times, but I don't know how to measure them.  But let me tell you how these little.  There was a fight my second year, in the restroom, the girls' restroom.  We had fights.  They had fights, you know, the schools as well.  Sometimes the kids would go into the restroom and cut the lights off, and seek to take money from the other kids.  Many of the kids coming from the Booker T. Washington units [Booker T. Washington Terraces, Austin, Texas], you know, their mindset was a little different, and they were hostile because they didn't want to be there.  And so they sought to take advantage of some of the students, which was not the thing to do, and we had to work hardest getting that stopped.  But anyway, this particular day there was a fight in the girls' restroom.  Some black girls were in there, and some white girls came in.  And some words passed, and there was a fight.  Well, the superintendent of the school's daughter, Nancy Davidson, happened to walk in during the fight and tried to stop it.  And finally, some teachers came in and stopped it.  And one of the little girls who was attacked, a little white girl, went home and told her mother, "Mother, they lived in the community not very far from the school."  I won't forget her name.  Her name was Mrs. Epsneider [ph.], and her husband.  They seemed to be nice people, but whenever you have anything happen to your daughter, that's traumatic.  And to come in in a time of desegregation when you had skepticism swirling about anyway, and here's an African American principal and these were African American girls and they're fighting my daughter--that sets a tone where it's not going to come out quite as good as you would want it.  And so Mrs. Epsneider was hurt, and had problems with that.  So, some of these fights were occurring in junior high schools in other places in the city also.  One in particular was over at Burnet junior high [Burnet Middle School, Austin, Texas] where a young man was fighting in the cafeteria, I think, and he got his arm broke.  We didn't have anything to do with that at Anderson [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas], but those parents got together and went before the school board.  The quest, I think, was against the principal, me (laughter).  So I had apprehensions about that, because I wanted it to come out all right.  And I didn't know whether they were going to send me away.  Or the next week--I suspect if certain superintendents had been in charge at that time, they probably would have sent me away in the next week.  But they didn't.  I had progressive, open minded, and good people on the school board, including my neighbor [HistoryMaker Wilhelmina Delco].  And we had--Mr. Will Davis was the president of the school board, a top fellow, a fine gentleman.  And we had an excellent superintendent, Dr. Jack Davidson, who gave me the job in the first place.  And so they supported me, and I'll be eternally grateful for that.  I remember the school board meeting.  It was held late, early one morning, and I'll say a word about that.
Speaker 1: You can continue.
Speaker 2: What happened was the school board president was very skilled, Mr. Will Davis.  The agenda was long, and I don't know--maybe the board extended it before they allowed these people to come before the board.  It was well after midnight before they had a chance to make their statements.  By that time many of the persons had left, and some of the steam was out of it.  And the board listened to them patiently and with understanding, and let them have their say.  And then afterwards, sent us all back in and gave me a word of endorsement by saying, "I'm sure that the principal will work it out."  And I was able to work it out, and after that we had pretty smooth sailing.  But that came as a result of a lot of assistance, a lot of community people, a lot of ministers in the area being of assistance and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 614940
Speaker 1: Tell me your greatest accomplishment while you were there [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: Well, I don't really know how to cite that other than to say that when we had National Merit scholars [National Merit Scholarship Program];  when we had honor toll students who accomplished academically; when we were UIL representatives, the Interscholastic League [University Interscholastic League, Austin, Texas], which is the state organization that offers competition for high school students across the state--when we would come in well there, when we would excel; when we had some UIL champions; when we had some academic champions; when we had some National Merit finalists; when we had more students taking the SAT; when we had good scores; when we were just looked upon as being a top school; when we had our band winning, going to the state finals; I deem all of that as being elements of accomplishment.  And I think when the community accepted me as a principal, not a black principal, but as a principal, which I had wanted to happen--I just wanted--I happened to be black, and I wanted to be a high school principal.  And I think, I deem that as an accomplishment.  And it was a joy for me after we got through those early years of trauma and fights and conflict, and when people began to blend and to see what we could do together.  It's a marvelous thing when you have an inclusive--and I believe in inclusion, and I believe in what I think America ought to be like, and the world be like.  And I deem that as an accomplishment.
Story_ID: 614941
Speaker 1: You said this is short of ten years.  Tell me how you go to the central, central administration.
Speaker 2: My good friend, Dr. H.L. Gaines [Hobart L. Gaines], whom I've spoken about, retired.  And when he retired--do, you may recall, I don't know if you recall this.  During that time, school districts were trying to come out of the court situations, because they were tied up in courts a lot over integration, school districts across the country.  And they were trying to, trying to come to what they called a consent decree, where the community was pretty satisfied with the movement up to that time of integration, or desegregation of the community and of the, of the school district.  And so, we were interested in having a consent decree.  So after Dr. Gaines retired, they brought me to the central office as the assistant superintendent for human relations.  And in effect, I was the affirmative action officer.  And so I won't forget a Mr. Robinson [ph.], who was one of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]--he was a high official, but he was also heading their desegregation and civil rights division.  He came to Austin [Texas] to visit, and they were making periodic visits along with the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] to see whether or not a consent decree would be granted, wherein there was a sufficient amount of integration taking place.  And so I had to meet with them and became the affirmative action officer, where we formed a community action--a committee group commission, or committee.  I worked with that and the human relations commissions on each one of the campuses.  I worked with them, those organizations, on all the campuses.  What we were trying to do, excuse me, was to solidify our efforts to make sure that we had an integrated system in Austin.  Problems?  Yes, but we were working through them.  And we finally got that consent decree, and I was in the central office at that time.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: I started in 1960--excuse me, in 1982, 1984, '85 [1985], and '86 [1986].  And I stayed there a long time.  I stayed at central office--wait a minute--until 2000.  So, I stayed at central office longer than I stayed on campus.  (Laughter) I enjoyed it though.  I grew, I developed, and I became a better person and a better administrator, I hope.  I was able to work with the community, and with the chamber of commerce [Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce], and with the various high tech companies coming in--IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], 3M, and some of those companies.  I got a chance to meet some new people and to make our school district [Austin Independent School District] strong.  I worked under several superintendents.  I guess I worked under maybe--throughout my career about seven or eight (laughter).  But they were all I think good persons, and I was able to get along fine.
Story_ID: 614942
Speaker 1: Huston Tillotson University [Austin, Texas] presented you with an honorary doctorate?
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 1: That was in 1982 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighty-two [1982], right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was very pleased.  I had been working as an alumni with the alumni association for a long time, even before that time.  When I was a teacher at Anderson [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas] they came to me, one of the professors, Dr. Hammond [ph.].  He said, "Why don't you come and work with our alumni group?  You're a teacher here, and we need some new blood.  Why don't you be the Austin [Texas] chapter president?"  And I said, "Okay," and so I was.  We were the first group that year to take our alumni banquet off campus (laughter), and I was surprised.  But I worked with the group, and I visited the campus and tried to support it in any way I can.  And I guess I was one of the loyal sons and daughters of the campus, and they awarded me that degree.  And I've been thankful.  You know, people started--I know it's honorary, but people started calling me Dr. Akins [HistoryMaker William Akins], and I appreciated them and I thanked them for doing it.  And I said, "Wait a minute."  I said, "I'm not a real doctor."  They said, "Well, you're honorary, and that's good enough."  So I said, "Thank you."
Story_ID: 614943
Speaker 1: What other community organizations were you involved with, or are involved with (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) During-Well, during the time I was at central office, that afforded me an opportunity to work with the chamber of commerce [Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce].  A Mr. Dan Bullock, who was a fine community activist, just an outstanding young man, came to our then superintendent and talked about a new program he wanted to initiate and to foster, called Adopt a School, wherein the community organizations, churches, and businesses would adopt schools.  They would come in and support the schools, not only financially, but also with tutoring and mentoring and being on campus, just generally support them.  And I was the point man for the school district [Austin Independent School District].  And so, that was kind of good for me.  I got a chance to help organize that.  And I think I was one of--something I'm really proud of.  It's now called Partners in Education [Austin Partners in Education, Austin, Texas].  But do you know we had over two thousand or three thousand adopters of our various schools?  Where, although we don't have that many--didn't have that many schools, we had several organizations that would adopt one school--three or four organizations, including churches, social service agencies, businesses--it's just a great thing.  It's called Partners in Education now.  And of course it has changed over the years, but that's been one of the outstanding programs I think that we have had in our school district, and I feel a kinship with that.  So, I'm proud of that.  Also, I was part of the Junior Achievement program [Junior Achievement USA] early on.  And, you know, the Junior Achievement program is a program that fosters an appreciation for the pre-enterprise system and capitalism in our schools.  And, but we started a chapter at Anderson [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas] when I was principal there.  And then I became a board member, and of course that meant that we tried to get chapters in all of the schools in Central Texas.  It's included in Austin [Texas] schools, and in others too.  So I think it's a fine program, and I take a lot of pride in being a part of the Junior Achievement program.  And I worked with the Boys and Girls Club [Boys and Girls Clubs] as a board member, and I worked with the Urban League [Austin Area Urban League, Austin, Texas] as a board member.  As a matter of fact, they were nice to me.  They granted me the Whitney Young Award [Whitney M. Young Jr. Award] for working in the school district and working in the community, and I'm proud of that.  But there are several.  And we became--and this doesn't have anything to do with the school district.  We became the Capital City Lions Club [Austin Capital City Lions Club]; we meaning our organization in the club, which I've been a part.  We organized in 1967, which was the first African American Lions club, we thought, in Texas.  But it was really one of the first in the country.  There were African Americans who were in other Lions clubs in other parts of the nation, but as an African American club, it had not, it had not been been chartered.  So, we take a lot of pride in that.  And by the way, we're still part of the Capital City Lions Club (laughter).  So, these are just some organizations that I've appreciated being a part of over the years--organizations that have fostered helping young people to learn, and that's important, it's very important.  Then, during my career and now, I would want to always advocate good teaching and learning, which is really the backbone of the American society, and I advocate that 100 percent.
Story_ID: 614944
Speaker 1: One of the greatest honors is to, for an administrator and a teacher is to have a school named after you.  Tell me about how you felt when you first heard that they were even thinking about this.
Speaker 2: I, it's such a humbling experience.  I was at the central office at the time, and I think I'd been elevated to associate superintendent, which I was very proud of that.  And I'd never thought in terms of any kind of honor coming to me like that.  But some people around the central office, they said, "I heard that they're naming a school."  And I said, "Yeah?"  "People are sending in names for the new school."  And I--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I don't know how my name came about, but one young man said to me, he's a former teacher, that he sent my name in, and I don't know what happened after that.  However, we were at the school board the night they were doing the naming.  And our superintendent at that time was Dr. Fox [James H. Fox], and Dr. Fox said, "Charles [HistoryMaker William Akins], stay around tonight."  And I said, "Oh, yes, I'll be around."  I didn't know, because I had to be at school board meetings anyway.  And finally when we got to that, they named me.  And I said, "What!"  I couldn't imagine they would name a school in my honor.  Me (laughter)?  And so they all came and they embraced me, and I was so taken by it.  My father [Elmer Akins] was sick at the time.  He passed away in 1968.  He passed away in December of that year, and that was before the school year was out, when they named the school in my honor.
Speaker 2: I thought they named the school in your honor in two--what year was this?
Speaker 1: In 1968.
Speaker 2: No, 1998.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Please, excuse me.  I got all the--
Speaker 2: That's all right.  I know you have a lot of things on your mind.
Speaker 1: But, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1998.  So your father was still alive until 1998?
Speaker 1: He was still alive, and he was sick.  And I came home and I told him about it.  It must have been about midnight, and he said, "Well, it's about time."  I'm surprised he would say that (laughter).  But that's a father.  My mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] had passed on.  And so I called my relatives in California to let them know.  It was early there, ten o'clock or something.  "What!"  So we rejoiced, and I called my daughters [Dianne Akins Iglehart and Joyce Akins].  And my wife [Estella Wilson Akins] and I--she was home.  The school board meetings, she didn't attend those; she'd watch it on TV.  She heard about it, and then I called her by telephone.  But I was so humbled by that, and it's an exhilarating feeling.  You don't know how things happen.  You're so elated, you're happy.  But you're humbled by the whole thing.  And you're so appreciative that people think that much of you to do that.  And then you wonder, what did I do (laughter)?  And I know that I worked hard, and I know that I've been involved in a lot of, you know, activities that have been school related, and I've moved around and have enjoyed what I've done, but I didn't know it was to that magnitude.
Speaker 2: Tell me where the school is located, and when they opened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm going to get my dates right.  I hope you crossed that other out (laughter).  It opened in 2000, the year I retired.  It's located at 10701 South 1st [Street] in Austin, Texas.  It is a high school with an enrollment of over twenty-six hundred students.  We have, they have an academy called high tech academy, they have a social studies academy, and they have a vocational academy, all combined in one school.  It's a beautiful school.  The school composition is very similar to the composition of Johnston High School [Albert Sidney Johnston High School, Austin, Texas] when I went to teach there in 1964.  We have predominantly Hispanic youngsters.  We have--I don't know what percentage, the racial percentage, of the school is, but I would think that we would have 55 to 60 percent Hispanic.  I think we'd have maybe 20, 25 percent black youngsters, and the other percentage would be Anglo youngsters.  I think that's about the racial composition of the school.  But an outstanding facility, a beautiful school, and a great student body.  I visited there last evening.  I was there for the honor society program. I was able to congratulate the honor society students coming in.  There must have been about thirty of them who were inducted.  And I was also there last evening to congratulate the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] cadets.  We have a strong ROTC unit there; I was proud of them.  They allowed me to pass out some certificates.  I've been proud of our academic program.  I've been extremely proud of our band program.  We've been to the state finals in the ten years that we've been open three times (laughter).  To the state finals, we have an outstanding band program.  We have a very strong program relative to computers.  We call it high tech high within the school, and those kids are very proficient.  We even offer some agriculture out there in Akins High School [Austin, Texas], which is sort of unique.  They have their own television studio.  I don't have right off the top of my head all that they have, but I'm very, very proud of the facility, very proud of the principal and all the teachers and staff, and most especially I'm proud of the student body.  And we have some outstanding parents.  So, it's a good feeling when I go out there to visit, and I enjoy going to visit.
Story_ID: 614945
Speaker 1: Dr. Akins [HistoryMaker Williams Akins] (laughter), is there anything that you have not done that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: I've been so blessed to have a lot of good things happen to me.  Let me tell you a few.  I wanted to be a football official, and I got that opportunity.  Mr.  Gaines [Hobart L. Gaines], the gentleman that I mentioned to you, my friend, he was a football official, and he had been one when he came to Austin [Texas] to be the assistant principal.  And he started a chapter here; that was during the time of segregation.  And we were young men, and he brought us in and we studied and we passed the test, and we became officials.  A few years after that, integration came forth, I think it was about 1966.  And the former white association brought us in and merged, they included us.  I recall we had to go down on Sunday morning to take the test.  We had, you know, we had to, taken it again.  We had taken it already, and we had to take it again to make sure that we qualified.  And I won't forget it.  It was on Sunday morning down at the Austin Hotel [Stephen F. Austin Hotel; InterContinental Stephen F. Austin, Austin, Texas].  And I was going to church later on, and I wanted to--and we were able to pass the test.  And I became a football official for over thirty, thirty-five years, and I enjoyed that immensely.  When I got ready to retire from it, they allowed me to have a state championship game in the Astrodome [Houston Astrodome; NRG Astrodome, Houston, Texas].  So I said I went out on top (laughter).  And then another phase that I had--and I hope I'm not taking too much time to bore you--it had to do with being a broadcaster.  I was a teacher at Johnston High School [Albert Sidney Johnston High School, Austin, Texas], we have already talked about that.  And there was an English teacher there who was a friend of a Mr. Bill Arhos, who was a director at KLRU.  It was KLRN then [KLRN-TV; KLRU-TV, Austin, Texas], public broadcasting, on the University of Texas campus [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].  And they wanted to make a breakthrough in integration.  They had no black person on television in the Austin area.  And so, they chose me.  I said, "What!" (Laughter) So they asked me if I would, if I'd come and audition.  So, you know, I was very rough, not very good at all (laughter).  So, they gave me some practice sessions to help me with my diction and my mannerisms and my reading.  And I wasn't a journalist, but they wanted to make a breakthrough, and they had some confidence in me.  And so, do you know I worked there ten years as a sportscaster.  And every now and then during the news--we had a newscast at KLRU.  It was called KLRN then, every night starting at six o'clock.  And I had three or four minutes doing the sportscast, and that was a great delight for me.  I had to stop, and they closed the newscast out.  You know how they do in television.  And they gone, went to the national PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] broadcast, and they closed our news ad, and I lost out, of course.  But then I was principal, and it was getting a little difficult for me to drive in every night for the show and go back to work, because I'd go back to some school function.  But that was a great joy for me to be a, to do that.  So, that was kind of a breakthrough in Austin as well.
Story_ID: 614946
Speaker 1: Being an official when it was segregated and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --it came together, integrated--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --did you have any hard times being an official, or working with the people who were in charge of that organization?
Speaker 2: We had some people who really welcomed us.  We had some of the persons who were probably resentful of our coming in, and they probably indicated that through body language.  Every now and then somebody would say something that would not be becoming, and some of the officials would kind of let them know.  Because they were younger than I was, and I could not afford to be out of character.  I was still a teacher, although I was a football official.  And then I became a principal, and I could not afford to be out of character.  I had to do my chastising in a manner that would be more professional.  But there were some who let them have it (laughter).  We experienced some things, but we got through it.  Let me tell you about an experience.  It was a little humorous, sending us in to work games with white teams initially.  Coaches would be skeptical, as it were, parents would be skeptical.  And, you know, in these small towns, it took a little courage for us to go sometimes.  So, I had an experience early on.  I had several, but this one was at Dripping Springs, Texas, and it's not very far from here.  Dripping Springs is a thriving school district now; it was small then.  And of course they have some black families that live out there now, but not then.  But this particular night, the field was not very developed.  It was a stadium, but not a stadium as we know.  It was more of a field with bleachers, and they had cable around the area instead of a fence.  And I was the back judge.  And then I moved to side judge, which would place me on the sidelines.  You know, in officiating you have your back judge, you have your linesman, you have your referee.  You have your umpire and you have your side judge.  I was a side judge.  That means I'm right next to the coach every time.  And every now and then you would hear one or two expressions that were not--but you can't let that bother you.  You must maintain your decorum and your poise.  And so, I saw through that.  But this particular time, another official called a foul, and sometimes that upsets parents and coaches; you understand.  Anyway, the ball went outside of the cable area, outside the field, and I had to retrieve it.  Now, I was pretty young and fast, but this hostile group--(laughter)--I didn't go in and get that ball.  So, speedily, I hurried and I got the ball.  And they were saying a few things that probably were not too complimentary.  But understand what I'm going to say--I want to say they were not in racial context.  And that's hard to believe during that era, but they were not.  But they were still mad at us, so I got the ball and hurried back on the field.  And the game was nearly over, and on this side--well, they were Florence, Texas, Florence High School was playing.  And boy, they were irate.  So at the end of the game, one of the fellows, fans, came out on the field and struck our referee.  And I saw it, and the crowd was coming.  I had some speed then (laughter).  And so, we were going to the gym to get in.  I was the fastest one.  So I was sprinting, and one of the great decisions I had to make--and I tell people about it.  They had a cable--whether I should go over that cable or go over it.  Should I jump, or should I go under it?  I didn't want to trip, so what I did, I chose, I chose to go under it.  But I got to the door first, and so we finally got in.  And this crowd was following us, so we had to remain in there for about, oh, an hour after the game was out, because we couldn't get out.  So we got, finally the highway patrolmen escorted us to the highway and escorted us out.  I was the only black official, of course, in the car (laughter).  I won't forget that.  And of course we had to go before the UIL [University Interscholastic League, Austin, Texas] that Saturday--that was on a Friday night--the next day, to--you know, there was a complaint, and that school was placed on probation.  But let me say this.  Amid all of the movements, some racial epithets were thrown while I worked, and I heard some of them, but I tried not to hear them.  One of the gentlemen at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], official and a professor, they call him Dr. C.J. Alderson, Dr. Charlie Alderson [sic. Curtis Jackson Alderson].  He was a white Anglo fellow, an outstanding teacher and official, and taught football rules, but he was trying to help us.  And one thing I want to say about this whole movement: there were always people who were open minded, who had good feelings toward people, no matter what your color was, to try to help you through the process.  And they understood the kinds of things that you would experience, and they tried to empathize with you, and help you and teach you how to cope with it.  And I think I learned a pretty good lesson.  But anyway, Dr. Alderson said, he said, "Don't ever have rabbit ears, what you hear on the sidelines.  Don't ever have rabbit ears."  And I've tried not to have rabbit ears, and I advocate that.  So, yes, those ultraconservatives will have those statements that will not be proper, and they will use the N word and some other things that will try to degrade you.  But remember, if we're going to be inclusive--and I think we still have to be role models, I use that term--and I have to have character, and to try to emulate the very best in citizenship.  You can't have rabbit ears.

Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, I have been serving--may I tell you another experience before I get to--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: I've been a churchperson at United Methodist [Wesley Methodist Church; Wesley United Methodist Church, Austin, Texas] all my life.  I told you my mother [Mattie Lee Watson Akins] raised me up in church.  And I never had the opportunity to go to the General Conference, which is the law making body of the United Methodist church.  There are one thousand delegates there, half clergy and half lay.  And I got a chance to be elected as an alternate to the General Conference held in Fort Worth, Texas just in 2008, my first time.  And I got a chance to be elected as a delegate to the jurisdictional conference where we select bishops.  That was a great opportunity for me as a district lay leader.  I've been serving as district lay leader, and I've learned more about the church and the inclusiveness of the efforts of the church.  I think most churches--and I don't want to put this one aside or any other--but the inclusiveness of trying to make sure that all people work together and be citizens in the world.  And while we were there with that delegation, in that meeting, we had people from Africa and people from, delegates from all over the world.  And that was impressive to me, thinking in terms of the importance of inclusion in this great America.  It is a great country, and I think that we all have to make sure that we try to do what we can to be inclusive in our thinking and be appreciative of all people.  So, if I had something to leave, I would want people to think of me as a good family man.  I love my wife [Estella Wilson Akins] and my children [Dianne Akins Iglehart and Joyce Akins], and I'd want them to think in terms of me as being an educator, because I know the importance of it and I want to encourage it.  And learning is a lifelong process, and I would want all people to realize that.  And I would want people to be as close to the church and to be people of faith, no matter what their faith would be.  I think that would be enough for me (laughter).

Speaker 1: If you had a statement to make to the future generations, what would it be?
Speaker 2: I would urge our young people to get as much education as they possibly could; to be comprehensive in their thinking and in their appreciation for people; to exercise good citizenship; to enjoy themselves with some leisure; to seek to have fun in life; to be serious enough to take care of their spirituality, and to enjoy their family.
