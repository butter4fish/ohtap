Story_ID: 520899
Speaker 1: So I want to start out with your, if you could talk a little bit about your, your father and give his name and his year of birth?
Speaker 2: Sure, my father, John Henry Jamison [John Henry Jamison, Sr.], my brother was John Henry Jamison, Jr., okay so, John Henry Jamison is my father, born in 1915, '15 [1915], '14 [1914], 1914 in Orangeburg, South Carolina (laughter); I have to think about that 'cause I haven't even talked about my father in a long time, or his birth, or I haven't been to his grave site in a long time in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]; thank God for cousins who have been there.  My father was--I think my mother [Tessie Brown Jamison] thought she married Clark Gable because Clark Gable looks like my father; it's that handsome kind of wide faced, divine grin, regal, carried himself so magnificently, southern gentleman, deep baritone rich voice, handsome as all get out, smart as a whip, could take anything apart and put it back together again, carpenter, sheet metal mechanic, classical pianist, opera singer, my father, gentle man.
Speaker 1: It was that, you know, 'cause you know I remember reading a book about how he made everything in the house, I mean he was a (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He did, he did, he was--that carpentry, I don't know where he learned carpentry, I have no idea, or sheet, being a sheet metal mechanic, but yeah, the dining room table, the kitchen cabinets, there were so many things that--the grill that we, you know, I thought all grills looked like that.  This was before Weber [Weber-Stephen Products LLC] was invented, you know, Weber grills.  My, we had a grill in our, our little, teeny corner house backyard with a beautiful garden that my mom took care of, beautiful flowers in the garden.  They were so meticulous about what they knew how to do and they did it well, both my mom and my dad; so that when he played the piano--I heard him practicing and making mistakes.  I don't know who taught him classical piano, but when he played it was the most magnificent, I can still hear him in my ear practicing and playing and then teaching me you know, by the time I was what, eight, nine, how old was I, maybe eight because I took my first piano lessons and I couldn't learn a thing because I had, I, I had my own fingering, I had, I had to start with scales and he had already taught me how to play you know, second movement of 'Moonlight Sonata' [Ludwig van Beethoven] and I, and I was reading music already so it was kind of backwards for me to start with scales, which I had to do, was a terrible student, but he was a wonderful teacher, just by example and also singing opera--
Story_ID: 520900
Speaker 1: I mean we sang--we went to Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church [Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Reverend Butts excuse me, I'm a now member of Abyssinian Baptist Church [New York, New York], Reverend Calvin O. Butts, III [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Calvin O. Butts], but I grew up in Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church and that was, that was a miracle in itself to have a family of four with four voices; my mother's [Tessie Brown Jamison] soprano, I'm an alto, my brother's [John Henry Jamison, Jr.] a bass and my father [John Henry Jamison, Sr.] is a baritone (laughter) and there we were you know, with the pageantry of the black church, the beauty, the spirituality, all of that, every Sunday you had to be there every Sunday from birth you know, a tradition of the black family and just to be sitting in that balcony, there are such incredible memories of looking down on what was going on on the main floor during processional of all the choirs; I wrote about that in the book; all the choirs, all the colors, the ministers, how brilliant they were, I mean if you can get a kid to listen to a sermon you know, on a Sunday morning when they don't necessarily want to be sitting there and be riveted and be moved and be scared because people are getting the Holy Ghost, they were being visited upon, people were doing dances in the aisles, but very conservatively because it was Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church, still when people would go off or my mom would weep, I'm going like, "Why is she, why is mom crying," all of that had to do with what--our engagement with God.  We were all so close and all understanding there was one way to go period, the minister was up there telling you which way to go and you heard it eventually, you heard the message, you heard what the message was, be it delivered by a Reverend Dandridge [ph.] with red suspenders on underneath his, his robes or by Reverend Stewart [Charles E. Stewart] who I though was [President] Abraham Lincoln, I mean he was eloquent, totally eloquent and, being there with the head of the household, my dad, that was my dad and my mom you know, it was a family unit period, and my brother, my older brother, my three year, three year older brother, that, when I look back on it how blessed were we to have that unit and then to return home to our row home, 'cause we lived in a row home, there were like eight houses in a row, we lived on the corner house in, in Germantown in, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], suburb of Philadelphia and there we were in this small three story house with the bricks pointed perfectly by my father, no other house looked like that, ours looked like that; there was a little garden, exquisite little garden right down in the front and my [maternal] grandparents [Annie May Brown and Timothy Brown] lived next door, you know, so talk about going home to a family, in a house with, with your grandparents next door and your, your aunt eight blocks away, aunt and uncle eight blocks away and the other one in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], aunt and uncle, cousins, still have a couple of cousins left, I'm so happy about that, but that was my dad, that's the Jamison family, we won't even get into the Browns yet.
Story_ID: 520901
Speaker 1: Can we talk about your mother [Tessie Brown Jamison] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: --and her, her, her year of birth and her family?
Speaker 2: Okay, so my father [John Henry Jamison, Sr.] is 1914, so she's 1917 and, and I hope I'm right about this 'cause I could be a year off it could be '15 [1915] and '18 [1918].  I think it's--we can always look that up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, she was born in Bartow, Florida (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're right your mother is 1917--
Speaker 2: Seventeen [1917], so my father, right--
Speaker 1: So it's 1914, it's '14 [1914].
Speaker 2: So Bartow, Florida, I didn't even know where Bartow, Florida is.  I looked--I just met people recently from Bartow, Florida, it's in the middle of Florida, it's right smack in the middle of Florida, no coast and no ocean and no nothing, it's in the middle of Florida and I have never been there and when I would say that to people from Florida, they'd go like, who, Bartow where, and then finally ran into people who knew where it was.  My mom was queen of the household, yes, but very much, she knew exactly, very brilliant, very smart, very brilliant, she would've gone on to college I think had she not you know, had kids and you know, got married and all that because I had an aunt, Aunt Allie Whetstone, who did go on to college, who never had any kids, but mom was the, the queen of the household, the head of the unit, between the two of them my mother and father were, held things down equally, that's what I loved--there was not one that was going like, "I'm doing this and I'm doing that," no, everybody knew what they were suppose to do, period and it was a necessity to do it, to play the role that you were playing; she was mom, he was dad.  He went to work, my mother didn't learn how to drive, my father drove you know, and then I found out, I was a driving fool later on in life.  I had no idea how, how much freedom you could have from it, but mom, my father would chauffeur every, all of us around, no, he drove, she didn't.  She took care of the house, right and then only later on in life did she step out into the world even though she was really out into the world because of the magnificent things she did with the church.  She was in every kind of club you could think of.  She was in every kind of ministry you could think of inside of the church. She was a calligrapher. I had you know, I didn't realize until I looked at some--going, going through some of the signs that she had made for church events or that she was heading certain committees.  She was head of the hostess committee, or there, she, they were both very involved in Mother Bethel [Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and so much so that whatever skills she had she contributed to the ministries of the church, so she made these magnificent posters, full, you know, huge posters and she would always have these pens on the table and I would watch her working on them on the dining room table and wouldn't think anything of it until I looked back on what she did.  She was teaching and counseling in the school system of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] later on, later on in her life, without a college degree.  People knew how valuable she was as mentor, as a guide, as a mother and how she could nourish young people in the church as well. I still have young people who come to me who have their kids now, who talk about my mom and how they, how she helped them get through life and was such a prime example of, of womanhood, you know and particularly how a black women should carry herself, you know, she was, she was a magnificent woman, as I said, a queen.
Story_ID: 520902
Speaker 1: Well you know I think--when you, you know, it was such a rich environment--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that you were raised in and exposed to so many things with a very, a true dedication to that, so I mean because she's [Jamison's mother, Tessie Brown Jamison] the one who opened up dance for you?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah and dad [John Henry Jamison, Sr.] was the one the chauffeured dance (laughter) you know, I mean he--
Speaker 1: So then how, how was that, was that, was that everybody doing that at that time, I mean in your, in your, in your area, you know, in the, in the church [Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?   I just want to--
Speaker 2: No, everyone in the church wasn't sending their kids to ballet school and then you have to also remember that my, my studying was pretty parochialized, I mean I, I didn't know what was happening out there, over there.  My brother [John Henry Jamison, Jr.] who was engaged in the neighborhood, cowboys and Indians [Native Americans] you know, playing, because we use to do that all the time you know, kids had cap guns and it was no big thing back there in the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s], so my, my, my brother had a lot of friends in the neighborhood [Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I had some friends in the neighborhood, but not a lot of friends in the neighborhood you know, because it was a small tree lined street, mixed neighborhood, it was quiet you know--not now.  So I was, I was really engaged--when she got me at six years old to be in Marion Cuyjet's, Judimar School of Dance [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] that was it for me once the curtain went up once and I heard all these people applauding I was good, I was good to go.  She protected me in that situation and I have Delores Brown [Delores Brown Abelson] to tell me about how strong my, my mom was in getting me--not a, not a stage mom, not these crazy people that are on television now that are pushing their children (unclear), never felt pushed, always felt that I had to be excellent though, but knew that before I even started taking dance, you know, but yes, she was totally instrumental in knowing that her daughter was going to be this tall, gangly kid.  I, I had to wear corrective shoes when I was a kid 'cause my knees were knocking and my feet were--I was pigeon-toed, so I wore, I don't remember wearing corrective shoes, but that's what they told me.  She was there to take care of her baby, both her babies 'cause my, my, my, my brother was studying clarinet in school.  I was studying violin in school, but the dance thing she, she wanted this daughter to not be uncomfortable in, in her body, I think that's what she was thinking and so there I was at six years old with my father taking me back and forth to these classes with my mom you know.  Can you imagine working as hard as these parents were constantly to keep food on the table and keep a roof over your head and then after a long day's work he would actually get in the car or, or both of them would come with me, or my brother would come with me on public transportation, it would take at least three--a bus, a train, a subway or whatever to get where I needed to get to, downtown Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]; sit with you the whole time while you're studying a class, or sit out in the car or just wait and then take you home; that went on for eighteen years, not eighteen, six years old, say ten years, eleven years, twelve years that went on that long you know.  What, what kind of love does a parent and a brother, all of them, the family has to have that and be supportive whenever you had a little recital they'd show up for that little recital, everybody, aunts, uncles, whoever, cousins to support you without a big brouhaha and fanfare because you always, because we, we have such communication now and television and all that so you hear about people doing this, they were not celebrated.  Their celebration was in how well you did, that was it.  That was their, their reward, their recompense, they loved that you did so well.  Your teachers loved it, your mentors, your parents, your cousins, your entire family was there, not all the time, but you knew that that support was behind you without them being cheered on.
Story_ID: 520903
Speaker 1: So I want you to take yourself back in this period that you're talking about and tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the smells is food, 'cause people could cook (laughter) my mother [Tessie Brown Jamison] could cook, but she wouldn't let me in the kitchen.  I thought, I think she thought I, I was going to be some queen or something and have servants around me all the time.  She wouldn't let me in that kitchen.  I learned how to cook from my [maternal] grandmother [Annie May Brown]; so smells, food, food, food; my mother could bang some pots together.  She was really fabulous.  And the smell of--that's why I like spring so much, the smell of Fairmount Park, Fairmount Park runs all over Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]; it's a huge park.  It runs all over Philadelphia, so we could go up you know, about six blocks down the hill from my house and there was Fairmount Park, Wissahickon Creek and you could see the changing of the seasons and everything, that was--I still love green.  I love the smell of fresh cut grass, I still love all of that you know.  I like the smell of, of what a stage smells like.  I like, especially an old house 'cause there's, there's wood and, and I like the feeling of it, the sense of who's been there, who's been on those boards and lights and, and ropes to pull the curtains up and down and the, the whole, the whole thing of theater has a, has an aroma to it.  Gosh, what else do I like the smell of, there're so many things.  I have to think about that. Those are the things that come to my mind right away (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sounds?
Speaker 2: Oh sounds, definitely theater, boom, theater does it right away; theater is for me boom.  Any--music, good, really excellent music from symphony, because I grew up with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra, so, the, the extraordinary- and I played violin for All-Philadelphia Junior High School Orchestra.  I played first chair, second fiddle so I knew it and I have a good ear and, and I just, my father [John Henry Jamison, Sr.] introduced me to classical music that I played--I was listening to Duke Ellington on records when I finally started making my collection of things, Louis Armstrong on the you know--Ella Fitzgerald, Joe Williams, I mean, all of the, all of this music from, from 'How Much Is That Doggie In The Window' to 'Tennessee Waltz' to 'Sophisticated Ladies' [sic. 'Sophisticated Lady'] to--I mean there's just so much I was, I was exposed to, to 'Tosca' [Giacomo Puccini], you name it, I heard it; great chorale music, the 'Messiah' [George Frideric Handel] of course, I heard all this and I had to dance to classical music every single day, ballet class, ballet class.  So it's even hard for me sometimes to listen to certain, some classical music because all it does is put me back in class again, very difficult because I go--you go to the beauty of it, I go to, "Gosh, this is, this exercise is hard to do (laughter), you know this was work."  Leaves, leaves moving through, through the air, fall, when leaves are moving through, I love the rustle, the rustle, I love that.  I love the sound of the ocean right, and I love the sound of silence, corny as it sounds, the sound--when you're in the country, if you're deep in the country or if you're in some other country that does, isn't as busy, or even here in the United States there are pockets in, in, in this, on this planet, period, where there is silence, there's utter silence, it's like being in total blackness, I love that you know, especially if I know where I am, but I love it that you, you have to go inside you know.  Fortunately with dance you have to go inside anyway you know, that's, that's the beauty of being an artist, but when you're in nature and you have to go--I don't know if you've been outside in, in the dark with no moonlight and you can't see your hand in front of you and it's either a, it's a fearful thing to be if you don't know where you are, if you're stuck in the middle of the woods some place, but if not, I used to have a house out in the country a long time ago and it's just so peaceful, pitch black, no sounds, no hums, you know, only natural things you know, only a bird here, a loon here or there or whatever, but just that silence is just beautiful to me, just as is the cacophony of an orchestra, a full-blown orchestra, or a flute you know, or a drum.  I love drums.
Story_ID: 520904
Speaker 1: What was the, what was the young Judith [HistoryMaker Judith Jamison] like?  What was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Scared, I was scared.  I was uncomfortable in my skin.  I was like gangly, all the, the--I remember the, the clothes that other people were wearing, I, there's no way I could wear--my body wasn't shaped that way.  I was a gangly, skinny legged, I mean skinny, so you didn't put anklets, you know those little, those little ankle socks, that was the wrong thing for me; high waist, you don't put a cinch belt on me with a little poodle skirt going out this way.  All that stuff was anti what I felt inside and that's why dancing was so wonderful because I had a, a leotard on, it was just my body, it was not decorated with stuff that the world said I had to wear so I was very uncomfortable that way and also the good part until I was a teenager was that my mother [Tessie Brown Jamison] made all my clothes.  She could sew like you wouldn't believe and I still--somewhere in storage I have my [maternal] grandmother's [Annie May Brown] sewing machine with the treadle, not a, not an electric one right, it's the one was a Singer sewing machine [Singer Corporation; Singer Sewing Company] with a treadle that you rocked, that's how my mother was making my clothes and I had some fashion, I was--oh, she made some great clothes for herself and for me and then of course that teenager thing kicked in and I was like, "I can't wear those clothes, I want this," you know, it was one of those, the teenager thing.  But yeah, I felt out of body, it didn't feel right until I stepped into a dance class when I was there, or I was playing, I was playing a sport or I was in the class that I was interested in, like in high school [Germantown High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I remember I had a wonderful teacher.  People remind me of his name and I can't remember his name at the moment.  He was my modern European, modern, modern European history teacher.  I feel--that, I feel in love with Renaissance painting.  I feel in love with, with Impressionist painting.  I, I went crazy.  That, I felt, I always felt at one with myself when I was listening to someone that felt at one with themselves so they had a lot to impart about what it was to be one-on-one with that person.  If you're engaged with that person right, you're, you're, you're talking, you're listening, you're learning, you know you're engaged.  Dance gave me that instantly without words, so that was my most comfortable experience, but other than that I felt kind of gangly and kind of uncomfortable in, "Where is my first date?" And there was no first date and you know, everything was like, it reminds me of these movie stars now that talk about how gangly they were, you know and or how uncomfortable they were, wallflowers and all that kind of thing and then all of a sudden they turn into these budding beauties, budding beauty I never felt like.
Speaker 1: So, but your mother's encouraging you all this time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So she's encouraging you.
Speaker 2: But you're, but your mom always tells you--
Speaker 1: Sometimes--
Speaker 2: "You're my queen, you're wonderful, you're a princess, you're beautiful, you're this, you're that," they always say that you know, parents say that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so but not always, but in, in your case--
Speaker 2: True, but in my case--
Speaker 1: In your case.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 520905
Speaker 1: So, but Marion Cuyjet, what, can you talk about her role?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because she also was an interesting person (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Marion, Marion, oh my goodness; Ms. Marion, we called her--
Speaker 1: Ms. Marion.
Speaker 2: --Ms. Marion, we never called her Marion.  I didn't even call her Marion when she came to see me dance and I was an adult.  I was like, "Hi Ms. Marion," and became this little kid again, you know.  She was an amazing black woman who looked white.  She had red hair, white skin and green eyes and she was as black as you and me and she was proud of that and she started a school [Judimar School of Dance, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for the little black kids who study ballet because you couldn't study back then.  To this day people still have trouble getting in schools to study classical ballet; so she made that possible, I mean that's her, she made, she opened a world to us that was not just about classical ballet, but about [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham 'cause she was studying--she was teaching Dunham's technique, tap. I'm so glad I had tap because I ended up on Broadway starring in 'Sophisticated Ladies' with Gregory Hines, the greatest, oh my goodness, what a dancer he was and there I was on the stage with him. Thank God I had--Ann Bernardino [Veda Ann Bernardino] was my tap teacher back then.  We had the, in--I said Dunham classes, we had acrobatics, that's when I found out there was no way I was going to be a gymnast, no way, this back does not do what gymnasts' backs do, didn't enjoy that, but learned something, had to try it, right.  So she gave us the--and she gave tea dances.  On Saturday afternoons and she would have guys, the guys in the school and the girls in the school and we'd have gloves on and little skirts and it would be tea on the side and she would actually have dances where you know, you had to stay that far apart and the guy was like this (gesture) and you danced you know, it was, it was very formal and very enriching, I mean you learned so much about how, how to be social even though I wasn't, but you learned how to be, you know, and to engage other people in conversation other than dance.  This was one thing I loved about Alvin [Alvin Ailey], Mr. Ailey, he taught us how to do, how to, how to live outside of the box of dance and engage everyone because everyone's your audience.
Speaker 1: Well I was surprised also with how many people she, you know, what, how much you were exposed to--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --from a dance perspective, through, through, through Ms. Marion (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. And she was, and she also farmed me out so-to- speak, farmed me out.  Was--and she--I don't know if everybody was getting the same attention I was getting and I'm not, I can't remember that everyone got a chance to study with Antony Tudor when you, they were ten years old, you know, or that--I started taking private lessons with a, oh, what was his name, Yuri Gottschalk, he was a marvelous--I think he was a Latvian, please be Latvian.  When I, when I was a kid, I was ten, eleven, twelve and I would take class at his home holding on--there's a thing called the barre; you start class with the barre, you're at the barre, you hold on to the barre and you do--I use to hold on to his stove and he use to put oil on the floor and if anybody knows anything about maintaining these positions that we have in, in ballet, first position, second position, it's based on rotation of the hips, so you were turned out, very unnatural way to stand, but you rotated and turned out, your, your feet are turned out this way (gesture) and in order to hold that properly you really have to use muscles that you don't think you have, you've got to find them and if somebody puts oil under, you better find those muscles otherwise your feet just slide back and, so here I was learning these little tricks of the trade that really would help me later on because Marion passed me on as I was studying her to all these different teachers, excellent teachers.

Speaker 1: --That's the good thing that I have to say about Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] is that--because sometimes I, I go to the darker side of Philadelphia when I'm thinking of the racism that was going on there, but the brighter side is I got Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church [Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. I got the Philadelphia art museum [Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. I thought all art museums in the world looked like that until I went to the world. The Rodin Museum [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I finally went to the Rodin Museum [Musee Rodin, Paris, France] when I was in France you know, I mean I was--all that, Philadelphia Orchestra, right. Pep's [Pep's Musical Bar, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which I wasn't suppose to be in because I was underage but I got a chance to see John Coltrane, Ella Fitzgerald, I got a chance--all this because I was sneaking into this club that I wasn't suppose to be in, ha, ha, ha, so I got to see some--Ahmad Jamal, I got to see all these incredible artists. There was Uptown, it's the equivalent of the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York], in Philadelphia it's called the Uptown Theater [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. Patti LaBelle and the Bluebells you know, before all of this broke out right, before it was, before it was Patti you know, and LaBelle all that, this was Patti Labelle, this was when they were teenagers 'cause they're a little younger than me, you know what I'm saying. So I was, I had all kinds--University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I saw Dr. Pearl Primus when I was about seventeen years old because--and Ravi Shankar, yeah so I got a chance to see that. Yes, it is, it's amazing exposure, the Philadelphia Zoo [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] you know, I mean, the Planetarium [Fels Planetarium, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the library [Free Library of Philadelphia], the resources that were in Philadelphia were remarkable in that the school system provided us with you know, the instruments and the trips, which kids still do which is really great, was amazing but that your parents were always open to you receiving all this information, you know. There was a settlement house where kids that didn't have a whole bunch of money to go to camp, my family, the settlement house was right there where you could play instruments, you could go swimming, there was one overnighter that we could do, it was, you know it's not like people, you know how people send their kids to camp and they disappear for two weeks, this wasn't that way. We would come home everyday, but everyday there would be some new adventure to do you know, go, go pick flowers or herbs in Fairmount Park [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] you know, and there was that wonderful man, God rest your soul, his name was Mitch [ph.], I don't remember Mitch's last name but he was in charge of my group and you know, we were rambunctious kids and he would have us all pay attention, doing what we were suppose to do, did my first swimming, learned how to swim because of the settlement house you know, and I'm a great swimmer. I don't swim for long but I look pretty.

Speaker 1: So what kind of student are you in school and where do you go?
Speaker 2: I'm okay, I'm not great, I was okay, I was, I was wonderful 'til I got to first year of high school I was great (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So elementary was--
Speaker 2: Elementary was Henry, Henry Street School [sic. Charles W. Henry Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and my, my brother [John Henry Jamison, Jr.]--at first I thought my brother was one of the first to integrate the school, but then I ran into some, a, a woman that stopped me cold and she said, "No, my brother was." "Oh, excuse me I've been saying the wrong thing." Her brother is 1939 and my brother didn't get to elementary school until like six years later, but there were still very few blacks in, in the school, so by the time I went there I loved it. I loved every minute of it. I had a good time in school. My grades were great in school then my grades were okay.
Speaker 1: They weren't (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were okay later on in high school.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) in high school, in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so later on--
Speaker 1: So high school you went--
Speaker 2: Germantown High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 1: Germantown High School and that was also primary- wasn't that still primarily white?
Speaker 2: Everything was primarily white (laughter), everything was. I had a great time at that school though, I really did and I remember playing sports there. I remember learning how to play badminton and volleyball. I was lousy at basketball. Everybody thought I was supposed to be fabulous at basketball. And there was also a thing called the eurhythmics class. I think in the Olympics it's called rhythmic gymnastics, something like that, where they throw the balls in the air, they do the twirls, we weren't throwing balls in the air or anything like that, but we were doing very patterned exercises that you did in a group and always in that group, I tell about it in the book, I was at--we were formed in a, in a, a triangle formation and I was always at the point and I was good and I knew I was good 'cause I had studied dance and nobody else had and I was really terrific and that I knew, but by the time we got to the All--the, the All-Philadelphia on the Academy awards' stage [Academy of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and the point was here and I wasn't at the point, I wasn't anywhere near the point, I was all the way in the back in the corner on the last row and I was the best thing on that stage and I'm not that way, I'm not the braggart kind that goes like, well I can do that, you don't know what--I wasn't that kind of kid at all, but I had eyes and I had common sense and I was the best thing on that stage, period and I was also the blackest thing on that stage and I needed to go up there in the corner and that, was that lesson learned from Marion [Marion Cuyjet], I don't care where you put me on the stage you're going to see me. She said, "If you mess up I will put blue light on you, I will turn the lights to blue." Blue doesn't show up very good on this. She knew what she was talking about, you shine no matter where you are on the stage, you shine, period. So I stayed mad up there and there, but my, my fury you know, presented something that was fabulous that some people saw and if they didn't see it then, then certainly twelve years later they saw it.

Speaker 1: When was it when you saw Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]?
Speaker 2: In 1965 I went to an audition, when, oh when I saw the company dance (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, when you saw the company dance?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-three [1963], I was at the Philadelphia Dance Academy which is now University of the Arts [The University of the Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and I went to an audition because a wonderful woman who was the pianist at American Ballet Theatre, that was my first gig, Ballet Theatre. Everyone thinks Ailey was my first gig, my first gig--how do we say, you start from the top but then where are you suppose to go from there. I went to Alvin Ailey because my first gig was at Ballet Theatre because Agnes de Mille found me in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at the university at Philadelphia Dance Academy; came here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because you had, you had gone there, so--
Speaker 2: Philadelphia Dance Academy is the college I went to because I went to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] first and at Fisk that was--I was floating. I didn't know what I was doing at Fisk.
Speaker 1: Now tell what--who, who, who decided Fisk for you, that's what I want to know?
Speaker 2: I think Marion [Marion Cuyjet], Marion and mom [Tessie Brown Jamison] and, and everybody because Marion had a connection to Ms., what was her name, oh, what was her name, oh, she was so fabulous; she passed away about twenty years ago. She had--was it Rose [ph.], no, I don't think it was Rose. I can't remember her name but it's, I think it's in my book, that she had a dance club there and that's--they knew that I could dance so that was part of me getting into Fisk.
Speaker 1: Mabel Love.
Speaker 2: Mabel Love, that's it, Mabel Love, she was amazing, amazing woman with like this, southern college, rich southern college right, because Fisk University use to have some very wealthy people going there and that's the last thing I was, was very wealthy, but they were very warm wealthy black folks; you're still black, period, and that's how I got there, through scholarship there and I lasted about a semester and a half there. It wasn't, that, that wasn't--
Speaker 1: It didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: What didn't, what didn't settle right with you? Was it being in the South, was it--
Speaker 2: Well, number one being in the South in the '60s [1960s] (laughter), oh my goodness you know, periodically people were going downtown and doing sit-ins you know what I'm saying, I was like, oh come on, and I went by train so that was an experience, I don't know, how long, twenty-four hours to get down there; I don't know how long it took but that was a very slow train and I couldn't palpably feel anything on the train, "Oh, we just passed the Mason-Dixon Line or here I am in the South," I didn't feel that because everything was like, like enclosed you know, we, there was, there was a womb there you know, at Fisk University. If you stayed on the campus, which I did and I remember it was a world within itself and the men were gorgeous and the women were also beautiful (unclear), just gorgeous, oh my goodness.
Story_ID: 520909
Speaker 1: And I, I remember, the things that I liked [at Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] were I had one teacher who, who taught Spanish. I liked her very much. She was good, I wasn't learning very much, but she spoke Spanish, she, she taught Spanish. I liked just the, the feeling that as I was entering Jubilee Hall that, what the history was about Jubilee Hall you know, and, and the choir and the, you know Jubilee Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers] and all that, I mean when I walked in there it wasn't just about how old the wood was and the sound of the wood and what, what the dormitories were like and all that, but it was the history of that place really impacted me. I knew where I was going. I knew it. I knew what I was walking into. I didn't feel outside of it, but I, everybody was walking around in different clothes than I was walking around in because I was a dancer I was use to walking around in slacks and you know, comfortable clothes and people were walking around in dresses and heels and their hair was all done up and all that and now that, I certainly wasn't about that. I did find some really divine friends there, a guy named Stinny who was from Troy, New York, who could sing. Oh my gosh could he sing. I have no idea where he is now. There were some marvelous friends there. Every now and then I run into somebody, they say, "Hey I was in school with you (unclear)."  I go like, "Um, okay." And there was the choir, the, the, the Jubilee Singers, listening to rehearsal or convocation, listening to what was going on in convocation you know, because I was a church, church kid. So going, going to church on Sunday it was you know, a wonderful repetition you know, or wonderful tradition, so that was, that was great. And going to--I'd never been to really basketball games and football games and stuff like that and dancing at half times 'cause I use to put my pointe shoes on and dance. In the dance club there would be routines that we did but I would put my pointe shoes on and I'm sure they thought I was totally nuts and do a little something in these pointe shoes. Gosh, those were the days, what can I say (laughter), but you're brave back then you know, it's kind of like I'll do anything, you know because that was my, my habit. I was use to going to dance school and use to performing so why not perform here. And I remember playing bid whist. I didn't know what bid whist was. I had never heard of bid whist. I'm from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], you played pinochle and I had never played pinochle either because I didn't have time to learn it or anything like that, so playing bid whist was a lot of fun, you know and watching the magnificence of all these frats [fraternities] and sororities. I didn't want to belong to them at all. I, I thought it was very kind of snobbish you know, that people were--because I didn't know what they did. I didn't actually know what they were for, but I though it was you know, kind of like this (gesture) you know, oh, okay, they've got these societies, I'm probably not--couldn't even get invited to one or whatever. Wouldn't you know eventually I'm an honorary Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] now because Lena Horne inducted me into the Deltas, I find that fascinating, but I was kind of like, offish about them you know, about these different fraternities because I didn't actually know what they were about, but boy when it came time to watch stepping you know with the stepping that everybody you know, now I don't know what they're doing now, but oh, the step, the step programs that they did, that was right up my alley. I was like, are you serious, you'll are doing--I didn't know, I didn't know. It was also the first time I ever saw Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], you know, they had come to visit, to play a game or something and I saw this man down on the field, I went like, "What, are you, are you kidding me?"
Speaker 2: The marching band [Marching 100] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So anything that was connected to movement I was very much into. If it was connected to just sitting I, to this day, only because I'm on this comfortable chair, cannot sit for long periods of time unless something hurts me. It--I, I'm totally connected to very fluid energy, movement, dance, music all the arts, anything creative. And, at Fisk University I met Linus Pauling, Dr. Linus Pauling there. I had to think about that long time ago and go like, "You know you met Dr. Linus Pauling? You talked to Dr. Linus Pauling." He visited the campus in this little--I remember it being like, not the student building, it was something else where they showed foreign films, I saw 'The 400 Blows.' I saw 'Rashomon.' I saw all these incredible foreign films that you wouldn't have seen in--I wouldn't have seen it in my neighborhood in Philadelphia, but I was exposed to all of that at this university, I'll never forget that as long as I live and then I had to get out. I had to get out because I had to dance.
Story_ID: 520910
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that I had to dance until I got there [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and then I realized, I was like oh--
Speaker 2: You really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is not right for me, wrong fit; transferred to Philadelphia Dance Academy [The University of the Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], we're at 1963 finally, from '61 [1961], so 1963 the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater comes into--
Speaker 2: Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 1: Philadelphia, I forget which theater. I don't think it was Walnut Street Theatre [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I forget which theater it was, but they came into--there was plays, plays and players, not sure, but we saw them. It was part of our curriculum that we had to go and see whatever companies, went, "My God." I saw and my thought was, oh I can do that. (Laughter) That is so stupid. And it was my thought, I can do that and how--who is that man on the stage, who are these dancers, how incredible. It felt so right to be on the stage and be absorbed by what they were doing and not moving like anything else I had ever seen. So then afterwards I remember being backstage and just sticking my head around the corner and seeing them packing their, their clothes, ironing their clothes, they were doing everything because back then everybody knew how to do everything. There were only seven or eight dancers. You had to know lighting. You had to know sewing customs. You had to know choreography. You had to know how to teach a class. You had to know how to speak, I mean it, it, it wasn't just a one shot deal, nor is it to this day with any Ailey dancer, the tradition continues. So I saw him, I saw him do "Wading in the Water" [sic. "Wade in the Water," 'Revelations,' Alvin Ailey]. It took your breath away, "Wading" and "Fix Me Jesus" ['Revelations'] with Minnie Marshall and James Truitte. James Truitte became my first partner when I joined the company in '65 [1965], who knew. I always say God knows 'cause I don't, I don't, I wasn't even thinking about, "Oh, I'd like to be a member of that company." All I was thinking was, "Well that was fabulous, how wonderful that was," and then next day in our improv classes, because we had improvisation classes to do where you have to really concentrate and focus and composition classes and so ain't nobody did anything original, all of it was imitational, what we had seen the other night. For weeks we didn't do anything original.
Speaker 2: So he first, he formed the company in what year?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-eight [1958]--
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-eight [1958], so you're seeing him in 1963 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineteen sixty-three [1963], see he was still dancing because he stopped dancing shortly thereafter. By this time I joined the company he had stopped dancing.
Speaker 2: And that was just the, the rigors of trying to own the company, right?
Speaker 1: I didn't know how he did it. Well, once again, here we go; how do people do these things. They do it because they have to do. He had to do this.
Speaker 2: But you're moving along very quickly then, I mean when you come back to Philadelphia you're really on a track, right? I mean--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't think it's on a track. I don't know what I'm doing. All I knew is I had to transfer out of a school that wasn't working for me, Fisk University, get to The University of the Arts, which is, you know, was the Philadelphia Dance Academy back then and I'm still at, at odds and ends (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So when, when do you transfer though from ballet to, to modern?
Speaker 1: I'd, I'd been doing it all the time.
Speaker 2: The whole time--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--when I was nineteen was the first time that I had a Horton [Lester Horton] class, which was the technique of, of the Ailey company of 'Revelations,' of Mr. Ailey [Alvin Ailey], but at Marion's [Marion Cuyjet], that's what I was saying, I was studying tap, acrobatics [at Judimar School of Dance, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Dunham [HistoryMaker Katherine Dunham]--
Speaker 2: Ballet (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) ballet. She gave us everything you know, so she had a little jazz you know, so she gave us everything. The concentration was on classical ballet, then I discovered Horton when I was nineteen while I was at The University of the Arts and went like, my goodness, this is a neat way to move and then I saw Ailey of course.
Story_ID: 520911
Speaker 1: Do you think that you have an advantage having a classical--where has classical ballet helped you?
Speaker 2: Classical helps you in, in recognizing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean in your career--
Speaker 2: --in recognizable Western civilization lines. We all understand an arabesque and we all understand pirouettes and fouettes and Mr. Ailey [Alvin Ailey] always use to say, "Give me that line, I need somebody with that line." So he wanted a modern top and a ballet bottom, he use to say that all the time. Which meant he just wanted recognizable lines in Western culture and what's so marvelous about the Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] and what I had a chance to do and what Mr. Battle, the artistic director at Ailey now, [HistoryMaker] Robert Battle, had the chance to do was--and Alvin always wanted it to be mixed so that the, the repertory would--there are over three hundred ballets in the repertory now, so that the repertory included things that were classical, things that were quote, modern because there're, there're at least ten different modern techniques, things that were from colloquialisms, everything that you can think of, styles of dance and styles of dancing and techniques are incorporated into the Ailey saga of what dance can be in America and so when we take those, these repertories this is what's so interesting about the company to me because you don't know what you--it's like a box of chocolates, you don't know, you're going to get, something from a choreographer maybe you've never heard of and then the next act you're going to get a classic from the tradition of African Americans, Talley Beatty, Donnie McKayle [HistoryMaker Donald McKayle], Dunham [HistoryMaker Katherine Dunham], Pearl Primus, whatever and then you might get another piece that, you know, is abstract or whatever, and then you'll get 'Revelations' [Alvin Ailey], classic work, you know, been done more than any other modern dance in history. So in order to do that you have to have a base that has several modern dance techniques because when you come into the company the first thing that you're going--when, when you come to an audition to get into the company, the first thing you're going to have to do is have classical ballet barre to show me that you understand where you're living, but you better be able to get down from your, your classical horse and get down, I mean get down meaning literally you have to understand how you're connected to the earth and that comes from the Motherland.
Story_ID: 520912
Speaker 1: So you, you tell the story of how you were at the audition and you know he [Alvin Ailey] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was a disaster.
Speaker 1: --sees you, what does he see, that's what I'm saying--he called--
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: You've never, you've (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I did not. I was terrible at that audition. All I know is I've always had an upward trajectory in my head that I had God's ear and that I was just going this way (gesture) up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up; okay, so in that can you imagine my emotions after not having danced for three months; because I was working the World's Fair [1964 New York World's Fair, New York, New York], you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --from '64 [1964], '65 [1965] after Ballet Theatre [American Ballet Theatre]. There're no black people in Ballet Theatre, hello, now, what do we have, one, two, three something, but you know, every step, what can I say, but there was no gigs, so I was there at the log flume ride Texas Pavilion, that's when Martha Johnson comes in, the pianist I was telling you about at Ballet Theatre, she tells me to go to an audition. I haven't danced for three months. I'm at an audition with people who have been dancing for their lives and back then in 1965, black women were wearing wigs like crazy, lashes like this (gesture), heels, stiletto heels. You went to an audition for a television show. You didn't show up in pink ballet shoes and tights, which is what I did and, and then I couldn't learn a step because it was a wonderful woman named Paula Kelly, who was an extraordinary dancer, who was demonstrating Mr. McKayle's, [HistoryMaker] Donald McKayle's steps and I had never seen steps like that before and I was so stunned by the steps and by her executing them and I was like (gesture), I couldn't learn a thing. I was too stunned. I was just (gesture) so that he calls me three days later after I failed this audition miserably and I didn't even see him at the audition. I didn't know he was there. I just passed by somebody that was sitting on the steps. I didn't know it was him because I was like this (gesture). I was totally in a state of shock, calling my mother [Tessie Brown Jamison] on the phone saying, "I don't know what I'm going to do, but I want to stay in New York [New York], but I don't know, you know," I'm boohooing.  And that's the three days later then he calls me and said, "Would you like--this is Alvin Ailey, would you like to join my company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]?" And of course I go, "Yeah, fabulous," and I'm excited and all that, but it's like a blur. It's like a blur. I didn't, I didn't go like, "What did he see in me that he would--?"  I didn't then, that, and then I walk into the, the, rehearsal, my first rehearsal and all those people that I saw on stage, not all of them, but some of them are in that, and the first partner I had is the person that I--you know, I mean that, that, you just kind of--and you walk in, I walked in like, like this (gesture), you know like, "Oh, Mr. Truitte [James Truitte]." And then he says, "Girl get over there and learn those steps," you know, I mean--it was just shut down right away, that come on, this is terra firma, you've got a gig now. We're going out in, in four weeks, in three weeks, you got two weeks, you've got to learn eight ballets, go learn them, boom, boom. I went to work right away, there was no like awe and you know, like, like people on pedestals or anything like that, you had your chance when you saw him on stage, then you put him on a pedestal, now you're working with him, guess what, no time for that other stuff. So it wasn't until much later that I figured he saw--and he would tell me that I was probably the most musical dancer he had ever had. I was totally musical, innately musical, that there were things that, how did he call it, revatto [ph.]. There were things that I understood about continuing movement and stopping movement and just a, in, just a natural talent, not a technique talent, you, you've got to learn technique. A lot of people, black people, get into that all the time where it takes no thought, you can dance, you've always been able to dance, not like that, I had to go to school to learn how to do this, period, you know. But yes, he saw that musicality in me and he would, he would--that's why when we were working together that he didn't have to turn around and tell me a whole bunch of stuff. He didn't have to explain a lot of things to me. He would do the movement and I would do the movement copying him and there's no way I could look like him doing the movement, but what, when he would turn around he would be pleased.
Speaker 1: With what he saw--
Speaker 2: Yeah, most of the time (laughter), most of the time. So, yeah, that, he, he, he saw something--I always, when I see dancers that are really special to me it's like they're, they're not from this planet. They are from someplace else you know, they've, they've just arrived, they're here for a little bit then they go on back to where they, where they came from in the first place. They, they're creatures. They're creatures. They, they're human when they step off the stage and do whatever they're doing there, but they are, they are creatures that have, that are full of, of this loving humanity that they only want to share with you for that two and a half hours on stage, isn't that a wonderful thing you know, and when that, when that hits you know it, the audience knows it, you know it and you go away with an experience that you'll never forget. That's what I saw when I saw the company the first time, you know.
Story_ID: 520913
Speaker 1: What was the rehearsal schedule like, you know, 'cause everybody was having to do other things, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, well, like remember the first go round it was two weeks, it was, it was two weeks of rehearsal of trying to learn everything. It was either two weeks or three weeks, something like--of having to learn like eight ballets, like "Congo Tango Palace" ['Come and Get the Beauty of It Hot,' Talley Beatty] and 'Toccata' and oh, Talley Beatty's work, [HistoryMaker] Donald McKayle's work and Alvin's [Alvin Ailey] work, 'Revelations,' which I thought of course, was the easiest thing, you know a lot of people to this day think 'Revelations' is the most easiest thing to do, try it sometimes, it's not. That's why to tap slightly on what you were talking about, "Are you glad you had that classical training?" Yeah, I'm glad I did, but I'm, I'm glad I had Dunham [HistoryMaker Katherine Dunham] and Horton [Lester Horton] technique and all that because a lot of people see sometimes only classically trained dancers trying to jump into modern, they can't, they can make it look pretty, but it's, it's on the surface and what's happening now is we're getting much more of an amalgam of the dancer, which is great because you get, you get the support of your, your, all your techniques, you know, classical being recognizable on these shores in Western civilization, but when you, when you add weight to that and you understand where things are coming from in modern dance then you get, you get a whole other ballgame going, you get another kind of artist and it's, it's a wonderful thing.
