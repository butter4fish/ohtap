Story_ID: 27195
Speaker 1: So I'm going to ask you about your family history; your mother's side of the family and your father's.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for it?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Ethel Bell Pearson and that's E-T-H-Y-L, B-E-L-L, I'm sorry that's E-T-H-E-L, B-E-L-L, and P-E-A-R-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: You can give us an approximate, you know.  What do you think?
Speaker 1: 19--
Speaker 2: Was it in the '20s [1920s]?
Speaker 1: 1920 something, I think.
Speaker 2: Okay in the '20s [1920s].  And where was your mother born?
Speaker 1: She was born in Stamps, Arkansas, I believe.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.  What do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace or are there any stories that you remember?
Speaker 1: No I was, really I was too young.  But I do know that they were all or at least most of them were in Arkansas.  And some of the sisters I think moved or what we used to call back in the old days moved up North, that would have been Ohio.  She had a sister who moved there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What part of Ohio, do you know?
Speaker 1: I'm guessing it was around Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now do you know what kind of work the family did there?  Did they have a farm or did they--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 1: In Arkansas. Yeah.
Speaker 2: No I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's not even part of my memory.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The only time that I really got to see my grandmother is when we take a trip to Arkansas, I mean Louisiana, and we would spend maybe a day.  I was a young kid maybe three, four years old running around in the yard.  That's kind of all I remember.  I remember a house you know, an old house almost upon stilts, it was high but I don't remember much else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now so they lived in town in Stamps in the city?
Speaker 2: In the city of Stamps.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is Stamps famous for?  We hear that name in the news from time to time.  Does it have something to do with [President] Bill Clinton or I know he was born in Hot Springs but Stamps, Arkansas--?
Speaker 2: Stamps, Arkansas is not famous for anything (laugh).  Stamps isn't famous, you know.  It's not a major city, in fact, we say in town but the town back then is not like the town now.  So it was a separate black area which was at least that part of my memory is intact about it.  It was impoverished, so there was nothing famous about it that I know of even to this day.
Speaker 1: There is something noted about Stamps but I don't know what, I can't remember what it is.  I should have looked it up before I got over here.  I think it is in relationship to Bill Clinton.  So you spent very little time there and you didn't spend that much time with your mother's relatives?
Speaker 2: No very little.  I guess we may have gone there maybe once every three or four years, you know when I was small.
Story_ID: 27196
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Ethel Bell Pearson] have a chance to finish school, do you know?
Speaker 2: No.  That much I do know my mother finished the second grade.  The story that was handed down to me was that she only finished second grade because they had to work in the cotton fields.  This was Louisiana, South back in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s].  So even though slavery was over, Jim Crow was very much in force.  Different form of slavery was still going on particularly in terms of education of African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now your mother, I think you were telling me before we got started that she passed away shortly after you were born.
Speaker 2: She passed away when I was seventeen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember for years that I didn't grow up at home completely.  I actually grew up kind of between my house and the house across the street.  I told you, I think I mentioned to you before that the lady across the street whose name was Ms. Trillie B. Jones was like a grandmother because she was the age of my grandmother and they had kind of raised each other's children together so they were close friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Ms. Jones now was she--that was there in Stamps?
Speaker 2: No that was in Minden.  I did not grow up in Stamps, I grew up in Minden.  I was born in Stamps.  Minden is in Louisiana and Stamps is in Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Minden, Louisiana?
Speaker 2: M-I-N-D-E-N.
Speaker 1: Minden, Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27197
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side.  I'm going to try and put them together.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: His name was Patrick Donald Lyons.
Speaker 1: So what his is date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth I don't know but he was born in 1917.  I had to call my sister last night and she got the actual date but I just don't remember.  But he was born in Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She also gave me the name of the town which I never heard of.
Speaker 1: Do you remember it?
Speaker 2: No.  The first time I heard of it was last night.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So what's the story about his side of the family that you know?
Speaker 2: His mother, my grandmother was a school teacher which back in the day that they lived was a real big deal.  Because the primary professions that black people had was school teachers, they were considered professional like today you would consider a lawyer or something, and preachers which were pretty much professional in a sense.  But especially school teachers back then.  And then my grandfather, as far as I know, I don't know what his profession was, because at least when I knew him, I had to be less than six years old, and so he had already retired from whatever he had done before that.  I didn't hear any stories about him.
Speaker 1: So you don't know what he did.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What do you suspect?  Do you suspect he did some farm work?
Speaker 2: I suspect he did some farm work but, you know, I suspect he did more than that.
Speaker 1: He may have been a professional too on some level in those days?
Speaker 2: On some level but it wouldn't have been a school teacher because I would have heard about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Maggie Lyons and I don't remember her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your grandfather?
Speaker 2: His name was Patrick Donald Lyons, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any stories about how your father's family, you know, why they moved from Oklahoma to Louisiana?
Speaker 2: No.  I haven't had any connection, didn't even know about the Oklahoma connection until last night.  So I don't have that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oklahoma connection could be an interesting story.  There are a lot of black folks that moved to Oklahoma after slavery and founded black towns.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: About thirty black towns in Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: I wouldn't be surprised if it were somehow connected.  Even the land that my mama had, Ms. Jones--we'll talk more about that because that's a real big part of the story.  They had their original forty acres from when they granted forty acres and a mule and so that land is still there.
Speaker 1: Now who had that?
Speaker 2: This is Mrs. Jones, Trillie B. Jones [neighbor who acted like a grandmother to Donald Lyons].
Speaker 1: Oh Trillie, okay.
Story_ID: 27198
Speaker 1: Did your father [Patrick Donald Lyons Jr.] grow up in Minden, Louisiana?
Speaker 2: He grew up in Minden.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any stories about him growing up?
Speaker 2: I can tell you that people had a lot of respect for him they said he was very bright.  I think the first day that he went to school they skipped him.  Back in the day when they saw a kid that was smart and could do math and all of that they skipped him a bunch of grades when he started school.  He still went no further than the sixth grade because of the way things were set up.  And I don't know if sixth grade back then was equivalent to sixth grade now.
Speaker 1: No, it was higher.  It is considered a higher accomplishment in fact if you graduated from grade school it was like graduating from high school in those days.  In some areas, it depends on where you are.  So he got skipped in school but he only made it to sixth grade.  Now was it the same reason, agricultural demands?
Speaker 2: I think it had something to do with working.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't know.
Speaker 1: Did your father have any specific talents?
Speaker 2: Well he could paint, he actually art, he did music, he was able to do math at a higher level than most people and he wasn't taught, he taught himself. Taught himself music and art.
Speaker 1: What instrument did he play?
Speaker 2: He could play saxophone, he could play guitar, he could play any instrument he picked up.
Speaker 1: Now I remember I saw--you showed us a photo earlier of him when we came in and we'll shoot it later of your father with a case.  It seemed like it had his name on it or initials or something.  And it was done artistically, did he do that himself?
Speaker 2: I'm sure he did.
Speaker 1: Was it a music case?
Speaker 2: I don't know what it was.  My sister gave me that picture when I actually went to Minden a few years ago for a funeral and so I asked if she had any old pictures so she let me take those--borrow, actually I digitized them so I've got to send them back to her.  The more interesting part of that picture is the thing that he is standing in front of which was a car.  Back in that day we couldn't afford those kinds of cars.  I think his parents bought him a car.  And people talk about--they tell a story about his father buying him a Model T, a brand new Model T Ford which I don't know what that one is--.
Speaker 1: That's not a Model T.
Speaker 2: That's not a Model T but he did get a brand new Model T when he was young and I don't know how they did something like that.
Speaker 1: Did he have a large family?
Speaker 2: Well he had at least two brothers and a sister that I know of.  There was a brother Solomon and a brother Jimmy [James] and then a sister Carrie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there may have been more but I just don't know.  Once again I would have been too young.  The ones that were alive when I was growing up were Jimmy, Solomon and Carrie
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever see your father perform?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said he could play everything?
Speaker 2: He could play anything.
Speaker 1: Was there a name--did he perform with the same band all the time?
Speaker 2: No, I think he had formed a few bands but, you know, that would have been when I was pretty young.  I didn't really get to see any of that when I got older.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he have a stage name or--?
Speaker 2: He may have, I would guess that he would have.  Once again my older sister would have known.  There was some separation between, you know, what I was exposed to and what she was exposed to.  Don't quite know how to word that but she remembers a lot more of those details probably because of her age when she experienced it.
Speaker 1: How much older is she than you?
Speaker 2: She is about seven years older than me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's significant, are you the youngest?
Speaker 2: No, there are two younger.
Story_ID: 27199
Speaker 1: So did your father make his living as a musician and an artist?
Speaker 2: Your questions are curious and the answer is even funnier.  But no my father actually made his living bootlegging.  You know what bootlegging is?
Speaker 1: Yes sir but tell the audience, I mean I'm sure they know too.
Speaker 2: I don't know if he started doing this stuff around prohibition or what but there were a few people around who did.  They actually made moonshine at one point.  I remember seeing the stills, I remember them drinking it, I don't remember a lot of details about it but years after he had built a club because I told you he played music, so in that club he would have music and I think sometime he played there but usually what they had was what we called a jukebox.  And so he would have that and he would sell alcohol, it was not legal.  At one point in time he got what they called a license to do it.  But for a long time, I mean that's how he made a living.  We also grew food, we lived on ten acres of land in Minden, it was a family property.  But that food didn't bring in money; that food was just to feed the family, it wasn't sold.  But the bootlegging, you know and the selling--and he sold alcohol, he sold barbeque which he was kind of famous around town for and he built a club there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did he have acts come in there from out of town to perform?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: So he had his band there to play the music and he had the jukebox.
Speaker 2: Right.  I remember him playing in the band, like vaguely but the jukebox I remember really well, because it would keep us up at night.  Because it was in the house. The house was a club.
Speaker 1: Oh the house was the club.  So you lived in the same place as the club?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was like downstairs--?
Speaker 2: No there was no upstairs or downstairs.  He built the house and he built it on a flat concrete slab and so the big part of the house which was like a room bigger than this room, that was the club.  There were rooms where we slept in the back really to the side it was smaller rooms for sleeping.  But I remember it being small and hearing music all night, people coming in and going out; drinking and dancing and doing what people did.
Speaker 1: That was a lot of noise--.
Speaker 2: A lot of noise.
Story_ID: 27200
Speaker 1: How did your parents meet?  Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't have a story, if I did I would certainly tell you but I don't.
Speaker 1: So did your mother [Ethel Bell Pearson] live in Minden [Louisiana] with your father [Patrick Donald Lyons Jr.] when they got together?
Speaker 2: I don't know when they were married but they were, they were legally married and I think, my guess would be, that he met her in Arkansas.  Because being a young man like that he would go around places and he would get a group of guys and they would go riding, you know, in cars and maybe that's how they met.  I don't know any details.
Speaker 1: Okay, because he had the transportation.
Speaker 2: Right, he apparently always had transportation, which was a rarity back then.
Speaker 1: So did he travel as a musician?
Speaker 2: He did travel and did some musician work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they met and legally got married what around 1950 or what?
Speaker 2: No, it had to be before that because I had siblings who were born in the '40s [1940s] so it was before that I don't know when I don't know the date.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is your older sister your only sister?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of your questions leads to others.  He actually had another wife before he married my mother and my sister remembers her name, I don't remember her name.  But I remember the sisters, the half-sisters. And in fact, when I moved to New York to Long Island, one of my sisters was there; very nice people, very nice ladies.  In fact, they tell me a story that they actually took care of me when I was little and I very much believe it.  Because they still to this day, I heard from one of my oldest sisters maybe three years ago something like that, maybe two and a half years ago.  But they live in Florida and there are three of them.
Speaker 1: Did your mother live in Minden too?
Speaker 2: My natural mother, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: So there was apparently a divorce; divorces in those days for black people is that they quit.  You heard of that, the terminology so you know what I'm talking about.  I mean that was a divorce, I don't think anybody went to court; I don't think anybody went to have any legal papers done, not back then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the previous wife he had was--he had quit her before he started dealing with your mother?
Speaker 2: But the children were still around, the girls.  And so my mother--I would say she took care of the girls because the girls were older so they probably helped her with the younger children that my mother had.  But they apparently moved away and I don't know how all of that happened.  But my father's wife I think she out lived my mother.  My mother died pretty young, she died at forty eight.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay.  And you say you were seventeen at the time.
Speaker 2: I was seventeen.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So-- But your mother was with your family up until she died, they didn't--?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So they stayed together?
Speaker 2: But my father liked to--he would drink and they would fight and things like that.  Now the previous wife would fight him back, my mother wasn't like that and so she stayed.  But the previous wife--I'm sure, I am absolutely positive that's why the previous wife left.
Speaker 1: So he would abuse your mother, punch her?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There were times when he would get drunk he would do that but when he wasn't drunk he wouldn't.
Speaker 1: That happens so many times with people who drink a lot.
Speaker 2: People who drink a lot and then they exorcise their demons on other people and I don't know what the demons were.  Probably, and I'm taking a guess I would say that and I am probably 99 percent sure that the demons were that he was extremely talented and there was absolutely nothing to do with it in the south, absolutely nothing; nowhere he could go.  Anywhere else, any other country he would have been a Ph.D., a scientist, an engineer or something.  But in America in the south in the '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s], '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s], you know, there was nothing he could do, nothing, so totally frustrated.
Story_ID: 27201
Speaker 1: This is interesting because there are so many people that we have interviewed that are scientist, some are physicists here that are musicians too.  That the musicians that are artist and this is something that most people can see as two separate trains of thought.
Speaker 2: I love music, I played three different instruments by the time I graduated from high school but what happened was once I started doing chemistry, I was the top student in chemistry, in fact, when the teacher was gone I taught the class because I was so fascinated by the idea of what people had come up with in terms of chemistry, Dalton's Law, partial pressures and all these other things that I had never heard of.  I just ate it up and I thought that's what I am going to be, I am going to be a chemist.  And then I took physics, I said "No, this is a whole lot more fun, this is more challenging," and so that's why I became--that was part of the reason I became a physicist.  But that actually started earlier because what happened was my sisters and brothers would bring home experiments that they would do in school, I think they brought me a microscope home when I was five and taught me how to use it, telescopes and things like that and they taught me about science.  One day we were--we didn't have a TV until my father went to a junk yard, found the TV and fixed it.  That's why I say he was extremely talented, there was virtually nothing he couldn't do; but nothing to do with it.  My favorite TV program was 'Twilight Zone' and so at the beginning of the 'Twilight Zone,' the old episodes, you would see this equation come across the screen E = mc2 and you would see this wild haired man on it and I asked my sister, "Who is that man," she said, "Oh, that's Albert Einstein, one of the smartest people that ever lived."  I said that's what I want to be, you know, I was five years old and pretty much I didn't deviate from that.
Story_ID: 27202
Speaker 1: So you say your father--let's explore this a little more, you father built the house?
Speaker 2: He built a house, he went to a junk yard and found stuff and fixed it.  There was nothing he couldn't fix.  Yeah he built a house. Alone.
Speaker 1: That's a feat of engineering, you know, he just built a house.
Speaker 2: He just builds it. Nobody taught him, he just built it.  That was a weird thing about it, I'm sure this is a story that's been repeated a lot of times.  But you know, you just have people who were just born with gifts and talents but as I say again and not to beat a dead horse in the South Jim Crow in those days there was nothing to do with it which was a key reason I said that I would get away from the South.
Speaker 1: Was there a story about where his mother [Maggie Lyons] went to school who was a school teacher?
Speaker 2: I bet you there is I don't know it but my sister seems to know everything.  She is a repository, she has a memory like my mother [Ethel Bell Pearson], I mean, I called her up last night and I guarantee you if we had telephone numbers back in the 1950s she would remember, she just has that kind of memory.  I have some of that but I'm not quite like she does.
Speaker 1: Well you got something else.  Yeah that's-so your father was talented man he had some native engineering ability, building a house, fixing televisions.
Speaker 2: He did his own work on his cars and like I said, nobody taught him.  How do you do that without somebody teaching you something but he did and that was known over the whole town.
Speaker 1: Did he work on other people's cars?
Speaker 2: He worked on, he would do every--I can't even tell you all the stuff that he would do.  Back in Louisiana there was a storm, this is a little bit off shoot but it's short, there was a storm in the '50s [1950s] I believe that came through and killed a number of people, it was a tornado in other words.  And so my mama, the one we call big mama, Ms. Trillie [B. Jones, neighbor who was like a grandmother to Donald Lyons] wanted a storm shelter built and so he built a storm shelter.  He built this underground shelter that was solid concrete with reinforced steel bar, he built it underground.  And so whenever there was a storm coming up we would all go into that shelter kind of like being in the middle of Kansas, in Louisiana, so he built it.  I don't even know the number of things that he did like that.
Story_ID: 27203
Speaker 1: So did your father [Patrick Donald Lyons Jr.] have any help from these, I mean when he would do a building project did his brothers or some friends help him, or work with him?
Speaker 2: Solomon, you know, this is terrible I forgot my other uncle who I should have never forgot.  But is this a trick that memory plays on you.  There was an uncle we called him uncle--his name was Theodus, I believe, but we called him Uncle Tib like you spell it T-I-B.  He had a stroke so I only knew him after he had a stroke.  He had real difficulty speaking but it was said that he was actually brighter than my father.  And so he lived--he actually lived in the house with us but I was a little kid, so he couldn't have helped him because the stroke actually paralyzed him.  My Uncle Jimmy [James] lived up in what we called up in town, he lived uptown or whatever you wanted to call it.  He had a house there and he was married to my Aunt Mattie and as far as I know he never helped my father build.  But my father didn't seem to need help.  I thought you were going to ask me if my oldest brother or somebody or one of the older children helped him.  I think they might have--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Or anybody really.
Speaker 2: They might have sometimes, but my memory of that house that we grew up--my grandmother's house was right up on the hill on the same property up from the house where he built the club and stuff.  He built that house, I don't remember anybody helping him, he built it.  I don't remember him receiving help from anybody.  Now my memory might be faulty there, but I don't think he had any help.
Speaker 1: Usually people, you know--(simultaneous.
Speaker 2: Usually you have somebody to hold the boards or do something, I don't remember him having--he had a way of rigging stuff, you know, but I don't remember him having help.
Speaker 1: Okay. He might have.  But certainly not from Uncle Jimmy I don't think Uncle Jimmy could have helped him.  Uncle Jimmy was a very small man and my father was maybe three or four inches taller than I am and I'm not tall but I mean he was three or four inches taller than I am.  And then his brother Solomon, I don't think he could have helped.  My best memory of Solomon is that Solomon was very alcoholic, that's my only memory of him.  I remember his name and I don't even remember his face or anything, I don't remember any of that.
Story_ID: 27204
Speaker 1: So growing up did your mother [Ethel Bell Pearson] like work in the club, did she help with the club?
Speaker 2: She did, she helped.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's a lot of work to run a club, you know, any kind of club, I guess.
Speaker 2: There is a lot of work and there is a lot of organization.  She's more the organization person, make sure things were supplied; that the place was clean it was more like that.  I don't remember him that organized but she was very organized.
Speaker 1: Okay.  On that note, when you think about your parents personalities, their disposition, sense of humor, how they walked, talked, dressed who do you think you take more after.
Speaker 2: Probably both but tend probably toward, personality toward my mother and maybe that would be true for all the kids.  One of the things that my sister says was the women who married her brothers are very fortunate because they all died.  One of the determinations that I made when I was young is that I would never treat my wife like my father treated my mother, you know, you could decide.  I could decide to drink and act crazy, I have reason to act crazy, there are reasons we won't put on film but I won't do it, I decided to go the other way.  I won't touch alcohol, can't stand the smell of it.  People have choices.
Story_ID: 27205
Speaker 1: At what juncture did you go to live with Mrs. [Trillie B.] Jones?
Speaker 2: I think I went to live with--I'm going to call her Mama from here on out  I think I went to live at Mama's house when I was about six years old.  I didn't live there all the time, I would stay at my house and I would stay at mama's house and I would go back to my house, you know, and be back and forth up to a point.  But the thing I remember about being at Mama's house was that it was so peaceful.  No noise, you know, very quiet and like I said she actually got me when she was about sixty years old.  She had had-- I had stayed with her when I was a baby but I didn't remember.  She took care of me when I was a baby for a little while.  My mother [Ethel Bell Pearson] went to stay with her for while because of the domestic problems.
Speaker 1: I was going to ask if that was kind of-(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: That was, that was the motivation.
Speaker 1: --the gauge of when you were going to be there was the domestic issues.
Speaker 2: Right.  So I was a baby, she had to leave in a hurry, she felt she had to leave in a hurry so she went and stayed with my mama, I mean I went and stayed with mama.  She took me, She took me up there and she took care of me.
Speaker 1: Your other brothers and sisters too or just you?
Speaker 2: No just me because I was a baby, the older ones were able to some extent fend for themselves, not that much but more so than I was.
Speaker 1: Tell us about Mrs. Jones, what was she like and--?
Speaker 2: Very interesting personality. She had, she was-- Before she was a Jones she was a Smith.  She outlived both of her husbands.  I never met Mr. Smith because he was already deceased by the time I knew him, by the time I was conscious of knowing Mama.  Mr. Jones, we called him grandfather, he was her second husband and so the thing I could tell you about her personality was that she was a very strong willed Christian woman.  Very strong physically at age sixty she was still seemingly to have as much energy as a twenty year old.  She was always working; she would get up at three o'clock in the morning and go to bed at seven or eight o'clock at night.
Speaker 1: So did she work at home or did she--?
Speaker 2: She had retired by the time I knew her.  She said she used to work on an aircraft, so I don't know the history of that but she was born in 1892 and she had seen a lot of life before she had me there.  The main thing about her is that, like I said, she was a very strong Christian and so we lived in church and so that was a big part of my life when I was growing up.
Story_ID: 27206
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: There was Union Grove, and there was Pleasant Grove, most of them were Groves.  And sometime I went to church with her [Trillie B. Jones, Donald Lyons' neighbor who was like a grandmother] daughter which we called Mommy; she also helped raise me, that was St. Rest Baptist church, still there in Minden [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.  These are all Baptist churches?
Speaker 2: All of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She also was Pentecostal, she went to Pentecostal churches; I couldn't tell you the name of them but she had a really strong influence on me.  The thing I remember about her all the time is that she always prayed.  She had a regimen of daily prayer and reading the bible, you know, so that was a big deal.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any formal role in the church when you would go as a youth, did they have, did they organize the youth in any--?
Speaker 2: No I didn't do any of that stuff what I did basically, she [Trillie B. Jones] would be in church all day and I would just listen.  The church seemed like it would never end and as a kid the last thing you would want to do is to go to church, you want to stay at home and play.  When TVs came around you wanted to stay at home and watch TV.  When she went I had to go and like I said, the human brain has a way of dealing with everything and she got to like it.  It's like people that go to prison and say you know, "I don't want to leave prison, this is my home" (laugh).  That's not to down church but I'm just saying you have a way, interestingly enough that adjustment to church and spirituality actually has taken me through life, because there has been some crazy occurrences, some really, really challenging things that I had to deal with and that actually has taken me through.
Speaker 1: Do you still go to church?
Speaker 2: We do, I don't go as much as I did when I was growing up because everywhere we've been, this family have been, we have found a place to go and we call it our church home and something like that.  Here it's not been that easy because the job has been more demanding than normal, that's the best way I can put it.  So I have spent weekends and holidays because it took me ten years to build the laboratory that I built.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is this laboratory still in existence?
Speaker 2: It still exists but not in the form that it was ten years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I will ask you more about that when we get to--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah and I will be careful about what I say.
Story_ID: 27207
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sights were the trees, growing up on all that land and like I say Mama [Trillie B. Jones, neighbor who was like a grandmother] was on forty acres and she--it was called Heirs Property because I think it was the original forty acres and a mule kind of property.  So it was passed down and so--(simultaneous) I used to just.
Speaker 1: It was called what, I'm sorry what was it called?
Speaker 2: Forty acres and a mule. This is historical.
Speaker 1: And you said it was called some kind of property you said--?
Speaker 2: Heirs.
Speaker 1: Heirs how do you spell it?
Speaker 2: Like inheritance. H--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Heirs, that's what I didn't hear.
Speaker 2: But I remember walking around on that land, I was just wandering that land and look at nature that was inspiring and just smell the fresh air.  Louisiana is still--down there it's still very country.  My daughter and I went down to the funeral a couple of years ago and we noticed when we drove down the highways and we didn't see anybody for the entire time that we drove from the airport to Minden.  There was nobody on the road, just us.  Just straight driving, I think it was Highway 40; I'm not sure what that main highway is.
Speaker 1: It's different from being there and being in California.
Speaker 2: Oh California, New York especially, its' very different.  California was pretty busy too.
Speaker 1: Okay, so. Now, tell us more about this Heirs Property.  So the story in Ms. [Trillie B.] Jones family is that the property had been passed down since the end of the Civil War?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's the story as far as I know it.  And it was forty acres it wasn't a magic number.  But I think it was the original forty acres that they granted and it passed down.  She was actually the overseer of it in the sense that there were many relatives and often she would have to fend off relatives who wanted to come and sell it.  It happened often, it happened more often than I can remember.  But it was one of those things where you have this property and it's supposed to stay in the family and then people would come and want to sell it or they would with some tricky logic where they actually wanted to sell their part and it wasn't allowed and so it is still there, it still belongs to the heirs.  And I have a brother who is not a blood brother but you know, but a brother who I grew up with and he still lives on that property and he still takes care of that property, actually two brothers.  Because Ms. Jones', Mama's youngest daughter who was a school teacher also helped raised me, as I said earlier, her two sons, we grew up together.  They still look after the property.
Story_ID: 27208
Speaker 1: What was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: My first school was J. L. Jones Elementary [Minden, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Now is this Jones related to Ms. Jones at all or her husband?
Speaker 2: They may have been related.  I remember her telling me a story about a fight she had with him.  The fight revolved around her oldest son or one of her children who needed books.  In those days when you went to school in order to get books they had something that she referred to as incidentals, and I don't know what that is.  It's something she called incidental, it's like a credit would be my best guess.  And so she being at the age she was and being retired she didn't have the money for it but she would get money later for it. But she still sent her children to school because school was a premium back then for black people.  And so she took her son to school and the principal told her in affect that if the kid didn't have any incidentals he couldn't get any books and so she had a big fight with hem and she got the books for him.  I think what she did was she went to the superintendent who happen to be Caucasian and then he called the principal who is black, J.L. Jones and Jones released the book to the kid.  So that was a famous story that she told often.
Speaker 1: And so J.L. Jones--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: It must have been very important.  J.L. Jones was black.
Speaker 1: He was the principal?
Speaker 2: He was the first principal, I believe and after he died they named the school after him.  Those schools could not have been built by black people they had to have been built by majority.
Speaker 1: Why do you say that?
Speaker 2: Because they did not have those kinds of funds.  This was a school, this was a big facility.  We did not have that kind of money.
Speaker 1: Was it an older place?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't old when I went. Now, it may have started off small.
Speaker 1: So this was a newer school?
Speaker 2: It was a newer school.  And also schools had to be built by permission, you know, we couldn't just say let's put together a school or you would have a cross burning in your yard the next day or your house burning down.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well you know this is--you were born in 1954 that was right after 'Brown v. The Board' ['Brown v. The Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas'] and the southern states were trying to demonstrate that they had equal schools and a lot of schools were built to try to impress their federal government that they actually spent money on black education.
Speaker 2: Yes, separate but equal and that's what he had.  In fact, schools were not desegregated until--I mean I never went to school with anybody white until I got to graduate school.  I think we had--at Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] when I went to Grambling it might have been one white student.  It was permitted but it didn't happen.
Speaker 1: So at J.L. Jones did you like school growing up?
Speaker 2: That's a funny question.  Did I like school?  I actually hated school.  I didn't hate the education; I couldn't stand the kids.  I grew up, as I said at mama's house, it was all peaceful and so when I went to school it was all chaos and I just wasn't familiar, wasn't use to chaos at that point.  So the kids were wild and loud and all the things that I wasn't and I didn't hear in my house. So I didn't like it at first.  The first day my real mother, my mother [Ethel Bell Pearson], took me to school and I just felt like she had abandoned me; she just dropped me off.  She didn't do that though, she took me to school and she introduced me to my teacher, Mrs. Odom (ph. splg.), my first grade school.  Mrs. Odom was a very nice lady.  She sat me by another child named Donald; Donald Thomas was my class mate.  But that very first day I got attacked in the play yard--in the school yard by a girl, Millicent Herd (ph. splg.) who we later on we became very good friends growing up; we grew up together.  But she sat on me and she said I want you to be my boyfriend and that scared me to death.  That's was my first experience at school so school wasn't fun.  It became fun when I got into high school into my last few years of high school.  It was a horror story but I was always a good student.
Speaker 1: You say your sisters brought home a microscope and some other scientific--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: My sister and brother--my oldest brother and my sister taught me how to use them when I was little.  My first memory of knowing that there was something a little different about me was in math when I was like fifth grade, fourth grade or something like that.  We were doing fractions and people were--they had which is bigger 1/4 or 1/3 and so people would say 1/3. But I could see this pie cut up in my head and I knew that four slices were smaller than three slices, you know.  I tried to explain it to them but they just couldn't get it.  Anyway, so I knew math was something that I could understand, that was back in elementary school.  I always made pretty good grades.  I made "Bs" and some "As" maybe a "C" or something here or there.  But the magic happened in high school when I got into Project Upward Bound.
Story_ID: 27209
Speaker 1: Now was there a middle school?
Speaker 2: There was middle school.  Middle school was more intense in terms of the science and stuff like that and I always did really well in science.  I understood it and I liked it a lot.  But still I was more concerned about my surroundings than I was about thinking about school.
Speaker 1: So there was a lot of chaos --?
Speaker 2: There was a lot of chaos; I mean, fights, you know-- fights every day, every single day.  Public schools had fights, no guns, no knives just fists, you know.  And I always avoided the fights and the noise and the craziness and the chaos.
Speaker 1: You had--really the only place--well a couple of places you found any peace were at Mama's [Trillie B. Jones] house and at church, I guess.
Speaker 2: Right, those were very peaceful places.
Speaker 1: Or in the country because the bar at home--
Speaker 2: That wasn't peaceful it was chaos.  When night time came and the drinking started I mean, you see the nicest people walk into the place and you see monster leave.  And like I say, in defense of all of those people, I can tell you that everyone had frustrations mostly associated with where they were living.  It's interesting the way human beings function is that when we have it really good we still have problems; it's like we create problems.  I mean if we are really rich, we have problems because we come up with these problems that you don't have when you are poor and then when you are really poor we got problems because we got to deal with poverty which you wouldn't have if you had money.  So it's like--so what you really realize in the end is that it doesn't matter whether you are rich or whether you are poor. It matters whether you have peace on the inside and that's when the chaos stops.
Story_ID: 27210
Speaker 1: Just for the record now, Minden [Louisiana] was like a lot of other southern towns and they had signs up about colored or white?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  The memories that I have about, you know, colored and white, I mean if you wanted a hamburger you could buy a hamburger but you had to go to the back door to get it you couldn't come through the front.  If you wanted to go to a movie, eventually we could go to the movies, but you had to sit in either the balcony or in the bottom, they always keep the races separate.  When you had to use the rest room and you are on a hundred mile trip you'd stop by the side of the road and you go into the weeds and you use the restroom because you could not use a public place.  Those memories are very vivid and that went on for a long time. Even when the Civil Rights Act was passed and there was desegregation of schools. The way that they did it was, the DE [Department of Education] used this trick, they said, "Okay well we got to desegregate schools" so they took black teachers and moved them to white schools; white teachers and moved them to black schools but they wouldn't move the children that's how they desegregated.  And so that was that way when I finished high school, there were no white kids in school, they moved white teachers to our school.  Some of the teachers were very nice and took some of our best teachers and moved them. Interesting history.
Speaker 1: So you went to J.A. Phillips Junior High School?
Speaker 2: J.A. Phillips Junior High.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So you say that was alright but you really caught fire in high school.
Speaker 2: That was alright but and it became better because that's when I joined the band under Mr. Quarles and in fact, Mr. Quarles is still alive here in Minden [Louisiana].  Interesting note is that my son's best friend is a family who is a friend of ours, they are Caucasian, and we were out one night at a football game recently and my son plays in the band and their son plays in the band and they will over here this evening playing basketball together, they were both on the basketball team together.  But just really nice kid, same personality as my son, even the same voice as my son.  And we were out one night and I saw the family and we spoke and he said, "These are my parents." And so we met them and they said, "Where are you from?" and I said, "You wouldn't have heard of it a little town named Minden" and he said, "That's where we're from." They're from Minden.  Then they said, "Our best friend is James Quarles," my music teacher from the seventh grade.
Speaker 1: That is interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, an interesting story.  So we go over their house for dinner, they come over here.  They came over and visited when my first grandchild came home.  They are just really good people.  From the same town never, never intersected, you know. So everybody in Minden wasn't you know-everybody that was white in Minden wasn't for Jim Crow, but that was a law and it was a strict law.  I don't know how I got on that but I at least wanted to interject that.
Story_ID: 27211
Speaker 1: So [J. A.] Phillips [Junior High School, Minden, Louisiana], I had band and that's when school started being a lot nicer because band was ordered it wasn't chaos, you didn't have chaos in band.
Speaker 2: What did you play?
Speaker 1: I started off with the trumpet because I wanted to play an instrument that got attention (laugh).  That was a mistake I should have played woodwind, but back in the day, you know, guys didn't play woodwind, that was a girly instrument so I played trumpet.  I started off trumpet and then in high school I started playing trombone and baritone.
Speaker 2: So you got bigger, trombone and baritone.  So did your high school band march in the style made famous by Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and you know, FAMU [Florida A and M University, Tallahassee, Florida]--?
Speaker 1: I think we tried to imitate some of that stuff.  One interesting thing I told my wife is that some of the musicians in that band were as good as any professional you want to see anywhere, in high school.  I say how did that happen?  These people are still to this day musicians but they were just extremely--they were above anybody else in the band, you know.  One was a trumpet player and other one played clarinet.
Speaker 2: Did they go on to achieve any kind of fame or anything?
Speaker 1: I don't know because I didn't keep up with their careers but it wouldn't have been hard for them to do that.  The only, only problem they would have had in achieving fame is that there are so many musicians, so many really good musicians out there, you know.  It's not like physics we don't have a whole lot of physicist white or black, you know.  But musicians we have a lot of.
Story_ID: 27212
Speaker 1: So, high school is Webster High School [Minden, Louisiana], right?
Speaker 2: Webster High School, ninth grade, nine through twelve.
Speaker 1: So you say by this time the state of Arkansas or that county, I guess, had put the white teachers in the black high school--.
Speaker 2: No, we are in Louisiana now.
Speaker 1: Oh Louisiana, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes they had put--I don't think it happened--even though the laws had been passed, I don't think it happened then it had to happen around tenth, eleventh grade, maybe around that time.
Speaker 1: So you started off with all black teachers at Webster?
Speaker 2: Right.  My best memory is that all black teachers at Webster and then a year or so later then I ended up with some white teachers.  We had one Hispanic teacher that I didn't think of her as Hispanic, she might have been married to a Hispanic man, I don't know, Rowena Jones.  I can't remember but I had her some years there, very good teacher, very brilliant woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Another Jones, Rowena Jones.  Now was she considered a white teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was white.
Speaker 1: And did she teach math or science?
Speaker 2: No she taught English, I believe.  I had another teacher who was a male teacher, I can't remember his name but he taught math.  We became close, he was a good guy. What happened with him was-- I think eleventh grade, the eleventh grade I had Upward Bound, because eleventh grade I would have been seventeen.  So I started Project Upward Bound.
Speaker 1: So did you go to Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: I went to Grambling.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Upward Bound started by Rev. C. T. Vivien, you know.  So it would take high school students to college campuses for the summer?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And give them some instruction especially in the sciences.
Speaker 2: Oh very, very good program, extremely good.  It was broad too, we did plays and there was some acting, we had some actors and we had some people who had interest in math and an interest in science.  But I was one of the math/science people.  But the thing that was really good about it was you start the program and it was very orderly.  I remember we had a former person in the military, he was like a sergeant; you had to make your bed up a certain way and you had to be up and ready by so and so time.  It was really good, because, you know, you bring in some kids in there who absolutely have no discipline at all.  Then they got this man over there and everybody had a lot of respect for him. He would say make it a certain way and that's what you did.  The most important part is that Upward Bound gave me the opportunity to take classes under college professors and one of the professors who was teaching me math, because they had more than just math, they had English and they literature and they had some other stuff.  But the most important part of that was he gave us an exam and I did really well on the exam and he said, "I think that this math is below your level; I want you to take this book and I want you to work problems in this book."  And so that was the first book that anybody had ever given me.  Growing up in the house where I was we might have three books.  That's my original home, where my mother and father were we may have three books total.  This man gave me a book called, 'Trigonometry and Logarithmic Functions' and so he told me to work in that book and I worked every problem in that book that I could remember from back to front.  And when I went back to school and I got straight "As" in every class in everything.  Because what the book taught me was that I could teach myself, you don't have to wait to take a class in trig [trigonometry] to learn trig, people write books on trig and if you can speak English, you can read the book you can learn it yourself; you don't need to go to take the class.  And so that year I did take it formerly and of course, it was a piece of cake, but I realized I could do that with everything.  So from that point on from eleventh grade on I made straight "As" in school.  So I came from probably number eighteen or something to number three in my class, so I got more awards than the valedictorian because I did that in chemistry, math, everything.
Speaker 1: Did you teach yourself calculus in high school?
Speaker 2: I started teaching myself calculus in high school.  My teacher tried to get a tutor for me and that worked pretty well. So he tutored me for a little while.  Then the next time I went to Upward Bound she found a class and she put me in a precal [precalculus] class and so that was precal under the toughest teacher--probably the toughest teacher at Grambling, Mr. Johnson; Emmett Johnson.  And so there were three high school students in there, two were from Texas, from Austin I believe they both came from Austin and they had some of these--they had a better background than me but the three "As" in that class with all the college students in there were the three high school students.  We learned everything, we did every proof in the book, we did every problem that we could go through in the time that we had.  So after that, it was on for learning anything.
Story_ID: 27213
Speaker 1: So did you stay in touch with the Upward Bound teacher at Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: I did for some years but after awhile it started to fade--once I finished Grambling and went to Stanford [University, Stanford, California] there was no time to do anything.  I mean just no time, you know.  We can talk about that a little bit more.
Speaker 1: So Grambling--Emmett Johnson taught you precalculus.  Is this when you first start at Grambling?
Speaker 2: No this was in high school.
Speaker 1: Oh you are still in high school.
Speaker 2: I'm still in high school and then I started learning calculus.  Then when I took calculus, you know, it was "A" in all the math courses.  So calculus and took linear algebra and took differential equations under Emmett Johnson and I told somebody the other day because they were asking me, I don't know who was asking this question I said you know, one of the--another profound turning point for me was we took linear algebra we had done, the three of us those three high school students, we stayed together all the way through.  They both ended up being math majors and then they got married and then I was a physics major, but I actually started to outperform them just because we had one cal [calculus] class where the guy would come in and just give a pop quiz every time.  And so, gave a pop quiz I always failed it, you know. I said, "Wait a minute, so he says he's going to give a pop quiz." I say," I don't how to pass a pop quiz," the only way I could pass is to just do all the problems, so I just did all of the problems, all of them.  So when he would give a quiz I could just fly through those problems in my head, I would be finished in no time perfect scores from then on out.  But that was the trick, the trick was to do all the problems before he even gave them to you.  So he could pick any problem it wouldn't matter because once you do them there was a technique for solving calculus problems; there are techniques for solving everything.  You know, once you do them, I mean people had worked these things out centuries ago.  He would give a pop quiz and they would say, "How do you do so well on them?" And I said, "Do all the problems."
Speaker 1: Now did anybody else catch on to your techniques and do the same thing?
Speaker 2: Nobody did it, I'm sure they understood it but I don't know why they didn't do it, I don't know why.  Because sometimes there was no--they would have examples then they would have the problems and there is something about math that after awhile you start seeing a pattern.  I can't really explain past that but there is a pattern.  A pattern is something that people have laid out in terms of theorems and stuff like that, but in your head it's a pattern and so I caught the pattern by doing all the problems.
Speaker 1: Now that's essential to my learning math.  We've been told by people that involved in math is that you have got to-- it's sequential, you have got to learn one thing before you can another and as you go on you--  You can't start with algebra without knowing fractions, you know, that sort of thing.  So you're going ahead and doing the whole problem,  so this is labor intensive, of course, so even if somebody knew how to do it, it's not a trick, it's labor intensive.
Speaker 2: It's not a trick.
Speaker 1: You have to do all the problems.
Speaker 2: It's labor intensive and I still ask, sometimes I ask my son, I say, you know, they have a lot more to do, I think, in high school than we had but I said, you know, "What else do you have to do?  You're in school, school is about learning."
Story_ID: 27214
Speaker 1: I talk to my students at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], I said "Well wait, you guys are having your parties twelve to two, why not take a book?"  See that was the other thing, people were embarrassed to walk around with books.  I don't even know how to phrase that, you are on a college campus and you're embarrassed to walk around with books.  People were embarrassed, they say I don't want anybody to think I--they didn't have the word nerd back then but you know, people are embarrassed.  I use to walk around with bags of books everywhere.  If I was sitting in the cafeteria, I would be studying, if I was sitting--in fact, the chairman of the Physics Department at Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] gave me the key to the building so I would be in there two, three o'clock in the morning, however long it took to do what I needed to do because what are you at school for other than that.  So I finished physics in three years, I stayed that extra year to do the math major.
Speaker 2: Where do you get that kind of discipline or that kind of zeal?
Speaker 1: I got it from being poor.  Who wants to grow up and live there life picking cotton or you know, not having enough to eat, who wants to grow up like that?  Who wants to raise a family like that?
Speaker 2: I'm sure there were other students that were poor who were at Grambling probably lots of them and so but were there any specific mentors or role models that you had that you remember that kind of instilled in you that you've got to like take the time, you got to be able to isolate yourself and focus?
Speaker 1: You know that's a good question, I had a lot of good role models but I always say that the motivation for me--one of things that motivated me is somebody telling me that I can't do something.  Now if I could have played basketball trust me, I would have played basketball.  But I was too little, if I could have done some other sport, I would have done it.  I was just, you know, not big enough, I just don't have it.  I wasn't born with that, the one thing that I found that I was born with was I born with a good memory and the ability to look at something long enough and understand it and that's the only talent I have.  I don't even know if that's a talent but it's the only thing I got; you work with what you got.  Now whether you have to be inspired to do that or not, I don't know.  Who inspired somebody to become LeBron James?  He might have looked at some of the older guys, he probably did. But I, I didn't know how to be the other things, so I became what I knew how to do.
Speaker 2: That's true that some people his size don't do what he does.  I mean they just don't--haven't perfected the skills or studied the game like that.  And so you're saying with what skills level I mean the skills that you had you were able to then, you know, mine them for everything you can get out of them.
Speaker 1: Right.  And I still tell people I am not a very smart person but I know how to work.  In fact, you've heard it said that 99 percent of genius and 98 percent of genius is what is it, 2 percent inspiration and 98 percent perspiration, or something like that I forget, I probably got it all wrong but it's a lot of work to create.  But the motivation for creating is to leave something, to make the world a better place having been here than to make it worst place.  Who wants to leave that legacy behind? Only a madman.  Somebody ought to be blessed by your life, not cursed otherwise, you know, you have wasted your time, you've wasted a life.  Life is precious, we can't replace one single living being who leaves the face of the earth and every day people are blowing people up, you know, just wasting lives.  There is a cure for cancer in one of those lives; there is a cure for AIDS in one of those lives.  Somewhere in the ghetto or somewhere in the furthest reaches of people's, you know, the places where people ignore is a cure for things that ail humankind, but it's a life.  That's your biggest resource, not oil, not gold, it is people.

Speaker 1: So at Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] was there a--now you enrolled in '72 [1972], right? And now--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Right. Graduated in '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Graduated in '76 [1976]. Now what did you do in the summer time?
Speaker 2: Went to school, I went to school year round.  I was determined to finished physics and get to the graduate level stuff as quickly as I could because I had no intentions to stop, none.  Sometime people--I talk to students now and they say, "Are you going to go to graduate school?"  "Well, I'm thinking about it, I'm not sure, I was sure I wasn't stopping."
Speaker 1: Who were some of your professors at Grambling those days if you remember?
Speaker 2: Dr. Cummings was the first because he gave me a full scholarship to college.  What I had done is during the Upward Bound summers somehow I found out about a job for him, I can't remember how it was connected, back then I used to remember.  But I ended up working for him in his research lab and so I was seventeen years old when I started working at that laboratory and I worked with two or three other students, they played the entire time, I worked the entire time and he saw it.  I actually processed some data that was real important to him and so he offered me a scholarship, full, full scholarship.  So I didn't pay a penny for college and, you know, that took me through college and I worked--I took two internships in my junior and senior year.  Junior year I went to Bell Labs [Bell Laboratories] because Dr. Cummings recommended me for the Bell Summer Internship Program.
Speaker 1: This is 1975?
Speaker 2: This would have been '75. 1975.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's talk about that a second.  This is a, this is a big deal.  Bell Laboratory is a remarkable presence-(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: It's a premier--it was a premier laboratory.
Speaker 1: It does not exist anymore.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tales of Bell Labs-- People talk about Bell Laboratory like they talk about, you know, some empire, you know, that doesn't exist anymore.  But what was Bell Labs like? Had you ever, well, tell us, what it was like.
Speaker 2: It was like Oz, I mean that's-to put, to frame it in terms of modern day--when you talk about--it was like going from, you know, Never Never Land, whatever, to Oz.  Because, I mean, it's just wealth, just a wealth of talented people, a wealth of facilities, it was something like nothing I could have imagined.  And getting there, it was the first time I stepped on an airplane.  I didn't know people were flying on jets, I had no idea.  I was looking at TV shows that had propeller planes so-- But the really nice thing about Bell was the people who I made friendships with and other people who are still good friends of mine over the years.
Speaker 1: Was this was your first time out of Louisiana?
Speaker 2: First time out of Louisiana; first time out of Louisiana past Arkansas in a sense.  We took a trip to Mexico but it was like a trip back in, when you couldn't use public places and stuff like that and I was young, I was twelve, but it was my first time actually going somewhere out of the South.  It was a shock, I mean, I had never seen sky--I don't think I had ever seen, like, real sky scrapers, you know; big things, certainly never seen a laboratory, not like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So even what you had at Grambling was no comparison (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh there was no comparison, in fact, when you walked into this dining hall they had this big display and across this display was a number of phone calls in the Bell telephone system and I don't know but they somehow correlated with money and they made the statement that even if Bell didn't make a penny between now and the year 20-something-something they would still have a wealth of money.  I mean it was just that kind of money flowing through because of the Bell system.  My advisor came from Bell too; Arthur Schawlow came from Bell.
Speaker 1: So was he your advisor that summer?
Speaker 2: No, no I didn't know him yet because I hadn't gotten to Stanford yet, I was still in Grambling.
Speaker 1: He had been a Bell associate at one time.
Speaker 2: He was what they called a MTS, member of the technical staff, as far as I know he was a MTS.
Story_ID: 27216
Speaker 1: And so when I saw that [Bell Laboratories] I said this is the kind of place I want to work so that started a new journey.  Part of the new journey that started was not only was the work--working there was just a real privilege, but my advisor there was Dr. Lou [Louis] Lanzerotti and Lou is retired I believe but I just saw him last year.
Speaker 2: This is Lou what's his last name?
Speaker 1: Lanzerotti.
Speaker 2: Okay L-A-N-S-E-R-A-T-T-I?
Speaker 1: I think it's a Z instead of S.
Speaker 2: Okay instead of S.
Speaker 1: And so he picked me up at the airport.  It was funny because I was carrying this big suitcase and it was about seventy five pounds this was back in the day when they would let you bring your house on an airplane and it was full of books, you know, but it was full books the few books I had.  Lou said, "I can't handle that," Lou is cripple in one leg so I had to carry this seventy five pound bag through the airport, I'm seventeen years old and it was just funny.  And then he took me and he said "I want you to meet this guy," this was my first day at Bell and I see this tall guy walking down the street.  I don't know if you know him but it was Earl Shaw.  I mean everybody should know Earl Shaw. 'Cause Earl is famous for real. But Earl has been--
Speaker 2: He is African American?
Speaker 1: He's African American and he was a MTS at Bell. Earl Shaw, Jim West so all these people we met.  So these guys, you know, were inspiring.  Earl attended [University of California at] Berkeley [Berkeley, California]; he got his Ph.D. at Berkeley so he was one of the first African Americans that they hired at Bell.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now we've interviewed James West and some others, you know quite a few others that were at Bell at one time or another. But we haven't interviewed Shaw yet that I-
Speaker 1: You haven't interviewed Shaw yet?
Speaker 2: --I don't think so. I haven't done it, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But he went, he-- When Bell finally shut down, you know, he left just before they shut down, I think.  He went to-- RPI [Rensselear Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York], did he go to RPI? Not Rensselear--I want to say he went to Rensselaer but New Jersey Institute of Technology [Newark, New Jersey], that's where he went. He went to New Jersey Institute of Technology and I think he retired from there.  But Earl and his wife were walking down the road, Earl is very tall. Earl did some of the pioneering work in free electron laser. You know what the free electron laser is?
Speaker 1: Tell us.
Speaker 2: That's the primary system out here at Jefferson Laboratory but basically it's a laser that can laze at any wave length because the electrons are not inbound at atomic states.  But he did some pioneering work on that and I think he invented this thing called spin flip laser which I don't want to try to explain, but--  Earl was just a brilliant guy; he was really very, very smart.  In fact, the way he described it he went to campus in Berkeley and everybody was saying, "I'm going to major in so and so and I'm going major in so and so," and he says--somebody asked him Earl what are you majoring in and he didn't know he had no idea.  He says, "What's really hard?" And somebody said physics he said, "I'm going to major in physics.  I'm going to get my Ph.D. in physics," you know.  He was one of those people who made a perfect score in on the GRE [Graduate Record Examinations] and just very talented.
Speaker 1: Now where is he from?
Speaker 2: I don't know where Earl is from but I think he's from probably Mississippi or somewhere, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay so you met him, you met James West--.
Speaker 2: I met Earl, I met Jim West, I met Carl Spight, who else, Jim [James] Mitchell.
Speaker 1: Right.  We have interviewed Mitchell, Spight.  Now they had formed--had they already formed--they had already formed an organization they were building right, for the black employees?
Speaker 2: Probably, but I wasn't--I was seventeen they not going to talk to me about that.  I wasn't even smart enough to ask.  But having those guys around me made all the difference in the world.  Because I said, "That's what I want to be. I want to be, I want to be-- I want to work in a place just like this," so.
Story_ID: 27217
Speaker 1: So you were working on solar--in the solar physics group, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  I worked-- That was Lou's [Dr. Louis Lanzerroti] specialty. He was solar physics.
Speaker 1: What did you learn about solar storms and how they affect the--?
Speaker 2: Well they were looking at induction due to solar storms.  Solar storms are basically charged particles that bombard the earth that comes from the sun and so they can induce-- Moving charged particles generate fields and so these fields can induce currents in the earth's surface and these currents actually burned out some cable, Bell cable.  And so he was looking at--what they did, they did a mapping they took data and then they knew they could map these storms and their intensity and stuff like that. And so I worked on the topological maps essentially that showed where the intensest, the most intense parts of the storm were.  So it was a lot--it was a tedious kind of thing that you would have a student do.  But the thing about Lou is that-- See, I wasn't interested in space physics, but the thing about Lou is that he was a really good guy, you had a lot of freedom he wanted you to go around and talk to people and see what other people were doing, because at that time I said I'm going to get my Ph.D. in solid state physics because that's a new word--that's a big word for me, solid state physics.  I had taken a little simple course in solid state physics but it wasn't enough to inspire me to do solid state physics, I just thought it was a pretty neat sounding thing to do.  But it was some areas--the one thing I said I would absolutely not do a Ph.D. in was optics, the very thing I did at Bell
Speaker 1: Why did you push optics away?
Speaker 2: Because I had a teacher who taught me optics and he was terrible (laugh) and so I said I wouldn't do it, I didn't want a Ph.D. in something that was this bad.  But I had an undergraduate teacher who taught me optics, I won't give you his name but he was terrible and he really butchered optics.  But optics turns out--optics is probably the most exciting field. It's probably the most exciting
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that summer you got a chance to actually see some black role models were working and you get some in depth physics exposure?
Speaker 2: I got to see some role models, I got to get some in depth physics exposure, probably more in the sense that you know, you get to see that this stuff is real.  This is something that people spend a lot of money to do.  The laboratories were just fantastic, but in addition and the part that I haven't mentioned were they had grad students there and the grad students were probably more important to, you know, us than the actual scientist.  Because they would have like a tutorial class and so one of the tutorial classes was a--they wanted to expose us to what we would be doing the first year we got to grad school.  That's extremely important, you have kids coming from a place where they have no exposure and then you have ones from places where they have, you know, extreme exposure.  People coming from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and all those places knew what they would be walking into whereas we didn't.  And so they did a pre--sort of a pre-exposure course I'm probably using the wrong word, terminology.  One was in classical electrodynamics and so once I knew what I would be doing I got the book when I got back to Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and I started working in the book myself.  There's a book we call it the bible for first year electrodynamics in graduate school and every major school uses this book.  It's by John David Jackson who was a professor emeritus at Berkeley and it is called 'Classical Electrodynamics.'  I was told it took him more than twenty years to write the book if you look at the book and read it you will understand why.  Just to work the problems in it--you can work one problem in it and it could take twenty pages of math to do one problem.  That's how complex it could end up being.  Typically it's not that bad but I mean back in the day when you are just learning the stuff, I mean it's deep, it's very, very deep.  So I did that, I did the first four chapters and so when I went to graduate school I got an "A" in that class, I didn't need a lot of help.
Story_ID: 27218
Speaker 1: Now what about graduation from Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana]?  Now your senior year--you were reading ahead of your senior year for graduate school.  So did you get any special honors at graduation?
Speaker 2: I think I did, I don't remember because my graduation came a year after I had actually finished.  Because what I had done I had went to school year round and I took classes to finish the physics in three years so I did the last year, which was real drudgery, just to get the degree in math, to get the dual degree.  And I remember in the end they didn't announce the dual degree and I was kind of upset about that.  'Cause the whole point of staying there a year-- and then I went to the dean and talked to him about it and he said "You actually could have gotten this degree without staying another year."  And I said, "But when I came to you before you had told me that I needed all these other courses."  I took all of these humanity courses my last year, I got "As" on it but I didn't want to stay another year. So it was really hard.
Speaker 1: Do you feel like they improved you at all, the humanities courses?
Speaker 2: Well I like humanities, now. It's easy for me to memorize them, memorization is simple but I found out that I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed learning about the music from the different periods, I could recognize it back then when I heard it.  And the art, I knew which period the art was from and stuff like that.  Those things are important.  They take just as much discipline as any other field.
Speaker 1: But you were on a track to finish, you were really on science--.
Speaker 2: I was really on that, finish science track to get that done and get on with graduate school.  But it also gave me time to prepare for graduate school too, gave me some time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't lose anything--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't lose anything
Speaker 1: --but you went ahead and got yourself--
Speaker 2: I wasn't picking up new courses like in--I thought would help.  Like I asked a teacher to teach me intensive calculus he says, "Well I know you could learn it but I don't think any of your classmates could."  I got angry about that I said "They will learn whatever you tell them they have to learn."  He just made an excuse because he didn't want to do it.  Which now being a teacher I can almost understand it, because it's hard pulling people through stuff that they don't want to learn.  I wanted to learn it but maybe they wouldn't have, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you play in the band at all at Grambling?
Speaker 2: No, no I didn't have time. I didn't think I had time and I was right. I went to school year round.  I never, I don't think I missed a single summer because I was determined to get out.
Speaker 1: So you really basically stopped playing music?
Speaker 2: I stopped playing music when I got into college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you do anything else extracurricular, did you run, or--?
Speaker 2: I did a little running.  I did one class in weight lifting.  Man, what else did I do? There wasn't a whole lot to do in Grambling.  I don't know if you have ever been there?
Speaker 1: I haven't been there.
Speaker 2: It's a small town, it wasn't a whole lot of things to do.  The next largest town is Ruston [Louisiana], you know.  Yeah I don't remember doing a lot of stuff, I mean we would--I don't remember doing any extracurricular things. There just wasn't any time.  I spent most of my time in the laboratory in the laboratory, in the lab either doing theoretical physics because I said I was going to be a theoretical physicist before I left.  This is after, after Bell [Laboratories] I said, "I want to do theoretical physics." I am pretty good at doing mathematical physics.
Speaker 1: Now, at this juncture, were you-- Did anybody in your family really understand what you were doing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah my father [Patrick Donald Lyons Jr.] did who was still alive, my sisters and brothers they certainly did.  My mom, my Mama [Trillie B. Jones, neighbor who was like a grandmother] did, she didn't understand it completely.  Because she used to ask me when I was growing, "Boy what you going to be when you grow up?"  I said, "I am going to be a scientist." And she said, "What is that, you're not going to be a doctor or a lawyer or something like that?"  I said, "No, I am going to be a scientist."  She said, "What is a scientist?" So I tried to explain that to her she said, "Boy you ain't going to be nothing; I never heard of a scientist."  Because black people never heard--we never heard of any black scientist.  There were some but we didn't know about them.
Speaker 1: There were people with scientific aptitudes they just weren't allowed to do it.
Speaker 2: They just weren't allowed to do it back then.  She didn't mean any harm and I know that but I can understand from her perspective.  It's like saying I'm going to be the president, you know, back then. (laugh)
Speaker 1: Because you thought you were stretching out then too far.
Speaker 2: Not only too far, but you know, that wasn't a career that anybody even thought about at her age, "What's a scientist?"
Story_ID: 27219
Speaker 1: So you went to Argonne National Laboratories out in--?
Speaker 2: In Argonne, Illinois.
Speaker 1: In Illinois.  And so did you stay out there near the facility or did you stay in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Where did we stay? We stayed in--  We stayed in Naperville [Illinois].  I know exactly where we stayed.  Naperville is a really pretty place.  In fact, some of our relatives actually moved to Naperville.  At that time it was a very quiet, very middle class, you know, quiet kind of place.
Speaker 1: This is summer of 1976 and so--.
Speaker 2: We were bussed into Argonne.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you conducted research in solid state physics?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you have the same kind of experience at Argonne as you did at Bell [Laboratories]?
Speaker 2: No, nowhere near.  The laboratory experience was not the best in the world and my roommate was not the best.
Speaker 1: Who was your roommate?
Speaker 2: A guy named Greg Koos, K-O-O-S from [University of] Notre Dame [Notre Dame, Indiana].  He had found out I had gotten into Stanford [University, Stanford, California] and he was really jealous, it was a strange experience.  And then the people weren't as friendly.  The African American students were not as friendly as they were at Bell.  We had a lot of fun at Bell, did a lot of work but we had a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: So they were--the African American students weren't organized in any kind of way they were--.
Speaker 2: Not at all it was just kind of random.  In fact, my best friend there was one of the--was he a postdoc, he must have been a postdoc from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  Ted must be like six foot three or something like that; a big tall guy from MIT, Ted [Theodore] Postal.  He's turn into one of the major conservatives in the U.S. which I'm not conservative, but he was in the Hoover Institute.  Do you know what the Hoover Institute is at Stanford?  That's where Condoleezza Rice and all those people reside.  He was just the opposite; he was the most liberal guy in the universe when I knew him at Argonne and he became the most conservative guy you ever want to know after that, very interesting but a very good physicist from MIT.
Speaker 1: Ted Posten?
Speaker 2: Ted Postal
Speaker 1: Postal?
Speaker 2: P-O-S-T-A-L, I think.
Story_ID: 27220
Speaker 1: So, so you go out to Stanford [University, Stanford, California], now you hadn't gone out there to see it had you?
Speaker 2: No, no I hadn't. In fact, you didn't ask me this questions why Stanford?
Speaker 1: Yes, well why, and how, Stanford?
Speaker 2: Well you know you probably will find this answer amusing.  Because at Bell [Laboratories], being at Bell that's what changed everything because you would ask people where they went to school.  I went to [University of California at] Berkeley [Berkeley, California], I went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I attended Stanford, I attended this place, I attended MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know, you heard a lot of MIT, Harvard.  I tell people when I was growing up in Louisiana I never heard of MIT.  People said, "Why didn't you go to MIT when you came out of high school?" and I said, "What was that?" and they said, "You must have had newspapers." No. I had never heard of MIT. But anyway, the way I picked Stanford was, I had applied to all of these schools and I got into all of these schools.  I got into Rice University [Houston, Texas] because that was my department chair--my department chair was white, Dr. Cummings.  He still to this day is a good friend of mine.  He says that I'm the person he is most proud of that ever graduated back then from Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana].  But anyway I got into Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], they flew me up to Cornell, I got into Rice, they flew me to Rice, and several other places that I don't remember.  I got into Stanford but there was no offer to fly me into Stanford and one of my friends at school says, "Oh, you are going to graduate school." And I said, "Yes, I'm going to graduate school."  He said "What other schools did you get into?" Then he said you got into Stanford, Stanford is in California, you got to go there so that's why I picked Stanford.  It was just that simple, I don't know if I ever told--  I don't know if I ever told my wife that story but that's why I picked it.  It was completely random.  I knew it was a good school but I just assumed to pick Cornell but I was so happy I picked Stanford because it was the best experience in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Stanford is in East Palo Alto, California?
Speaker 2: Stanford is in Stanford, California.  Just like you have St. Louis and East St. Louis, you cross the bridge. St. Louis is a city, used to be very prosperous and still might be.  East St Louis is all black, very poor.  Well Palo Alto is million dollar mansions, I say million dollars I will say millions of dollars mansions.  There is a little bitty tiny bridge; the bridge is no longer than from my front door to the back of my house.  On one side there is no grass, there was cracked up roads and streets and everything and that's where the black people lived. As soon as you crossed that bridge you saw mansions.  I'm not talking about houses I mean mansions like on the Beverly Hill Billy's mansion.  That was Palo Alto, that's where Stanford is.  Stanford is on eight thousand acres of land, that's how big it is, it stretches from Palo Alto all the way out to the ocean.  The biggest campus--I'm not sure it's not the biggest campus in America; it is eight thousand acres, it's huge and very, very rich.
Story_ID: 27221
Speaker 1: So you have, you have a full scholarship at Stanford [University, Stanford, California]?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have a full scholarship.  I had a full scholarship to Cornell and I went to Stanford.  So let me tell you that school story while we are on camera.  But I got to Stanford and they called me in after being there for little while; and they said, "We looked at your record and we see, you know, you have all these books and stuff that you taught yourself." She says, "As a result"-- this is, this is my, I don't know what you call them but he was a man-- he says, "As a result of the work that you have done we sent it to Xerox Corporation, and they've given you, they picked you as their Xerox fellow." Says, "You have a full scholarship to Stanford, you won't have to pay penny for your education. They pay not only your tuition and fees but they will also give you $800 a month in spending money."  I tell you I went outside and I cried.  I said, you know, "This had to be from God." Because I took $500 and sent it home that's how little money I had to live on.  That's how little money I needed, of $800 I would send $500 to my sister.  So I never paid a penny for graduate school, not one cent, not one.  And see the other reason I needed it is because I'm started out at a real disadvantage because I'm in a class, I have a class of twenty-seven people and most of them either went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California], MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], those were my classmates and I'm coming from Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] having to teach myself, you know, try to get caught up myself.  And so this allowed me not to have to TA [be a teaching assistant] because I took Stanford on a TA or RA [Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant], I would have had to teach and grade papers, you know, I had to teach undergraduates and grade papers and all that.  That would have killed me with those courses being as tough as they were, it would have killed me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, so you were already ready for this--now, who-- Now, William Massey was there too, is that correct?
Speaker 2: At that time William Massey might have been there but I didn't know him.  He was the head of Argonne [Laboratory] for awhile but who was there was A.B.C. Walker who I think most people know.  That was Sally Ride's [first American woman in space] advisor.  But A.B.C. Walker was in the, I believe he was in the Applied Physics Department, applied astrophysics or something like that.  And then another guy that was there, I'm trying to remember his name they didn't have many black faculty, I'm not sure that they still don't.  I remember his name after awhile but he left Stanford a few years back he had tenure but he left. And Dr. Walker passed away.
Story_ID: 27222
Speaker 1: So who, who was your advisor--was Schawlow--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Arthur Schawlow.
Speaker 1: Schawlow who goes on to win a Nobel Prize.
Speaker 2: Right who also was co-inventor of the laser.  So the reporters had come to his house to tell him he had gotten the Nobel Prize for inventing the laser and then somehow it was--he was not given that Nobel Prize for inventing the laser but he got it--his brother-in-law who got it for inventing the maser.  The maser is a microwave analog to the laser.  Schawlow and [Charles] Townes were brother-in-laws they both married sisters.
Speaker 1: I think the laser was officially invented in 1960, you think?
Speaker 2: 1964 or '60 [1960] something, I think; that thing with the case where they were talking about the gas system, that wasn't an invention of laser that was something else.  And I know [Theodore] Maiman demonstrated the first laser but Schawlow and Townes invented the first laser.  I don't think that was ever disputed but Townes had already invented the maser so rather than give him the Nobel Prize for the laser they did it for the maser.  [Albert] Einstein did relativity and they gave him the Nobel Prize for a body in motion and the photoelectric effect not for relativity because it was too controversial back then.  Been proven over and over now but back then he didn't get it for it.
Speaker 1: Einstein started the-- laser studies, I guess by talking about explaining the theory of stimulated emission in 1917 and so give us a little bit of history about the laser.
Speaker 2: I wish I could.
Speaker 1: Well, just briefly, nothing detailed.
Speaker 2: Basically the history that I know of in terms of Schawlow is that Schawlow-- I found this fairly recently, he wanted to be just a radio elec-- radio engineer, I think back then they called it a radio engineer. And so he was interested in radio and radio systems and stuff like that.  And so he got recruited by somebody at Bell [Laboratories] and they thought he was a pretty bright guy and so--  The laser system, I think he kind of adapted some of the technology from his radio days.  But basically, laser is pretty simple, it's a cavity where you have basically, in its basic forms, these two mirrors and in these two mirrors you have some medium between these two mirrors and that you can stimulate by pumping it with light, that's one way to stimulate it.  You have to pump it with some type of energy and so you pump electrons up to an excited state. When they fall down they give off light.  Now the light that falls down from that particular excited state, if you set your mirror correctly, it's trapped within the two mirrors so it bounces back and forth and having the right value for its quantum energy stimulates another atom to give off the same light, same frequency, and so that light ends up being in step and so that's called coherence. And so--  The fact that's in step and it's all the same frequency means that you can get a build up, a cascade effect within that cavity and so you have some huge number of photons that bounce back and forth and eventually some of them leak out and so that light that leaks out is only a small percentage of what inside the cavity.  So when you look at the laser even though it looks very bright, even something like a helium neon laser or puts out one milliwatt of power, that one milliwatt is still brighter than the sun.  It's just light that's very coherent very in step in phase, you know.  I don't if that answers part of what you mean.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I am amazed. I'm not a physicist but the light is brighter than the sun actually?
Speaker 2: Brighter than the sun.
Story_ID: 27223
Speaker 1: When you got with Arthur Schawlow, then what aspect of phaser-
Speaker 2: Laser.
Speaker 1: I mean laser technology were you working on?
Speaker 2: Okay, one the thing having a system like that with very bright light and very narrow linewidth, because you can do things to narrow down the amount of lines that are emitting light.  You can throw out the ones you don't want.  It allows you to probe in the atom or probe a molecule and so when you probe with that light you can excite transitions within the molecules that really are characteristic of that one molecule or that one atom and so that leads to something called spectroscopy, where you're actually exciting states within an atomic system in order to characterize the system itself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So spectroscopy begins after the development of the laser?
Speaker 2: Spectroscopy begins before that but it wasn't, it wasn't high resolution, it wasn't like with the laser.  See, the narrower the lines that you can excite the more information you can get about the atomic states.  If the lines are broadening out the broadening of the lines can hide some of the features underneath so with something like the laser you can excite these, you can excite these states to very narrow probings and so that gives you like more information in terms of details of what atomic transitions you are exciting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  From what I understand, this is just my understanding from reading this, is that what you are trying to do is to make the fine tune, I guess, spectroscopy by getting rid of interference.
Speaker 2: By getting rid of all types of interference.  That's where the intermodulation--there is different kinds of spectroscopy, there is absorption spectroscopy, which is pretty easy to understand.  Where you, where send light in and all of it doesn't come out and it's like you sent light in and it has a characteristic spectrum and then when you look at the light that comes out there is a hole somewhere in the spectrum.  But the hole basically represents something didn't absorb.  And depending on the atomic system you get a different absorption spectrum and so you can characterize whole systems of material by looking at what's coming back.  One way, one thing that broadens it and you can imagine this is that if I'm an atom and I emit light and then I'm moving very fast, I shift the frequency of that light.  So this is called a Doppler shift. So I shift the frequency of that light.  If I'm moving toward you I shift the frequency toward the blue and if I'm moving away from you I shift it toward the red.  In other words when I am moving toward you the wavelengths kind of scrunch up you can think of it that way.  And the shorter wavelengths are the higher frequencies or the colors like blue and green.
Speaker 1: So in the spectrum like indigo being the shortest in length that's where the-- it's coming, coming(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right.  It's going to head toward that way--I mean it's going to head toward that part of the spectrum.  If it's moving away it heads toward the red part and so that's called Doppler broadening.  And one way to get rid of Doppler broadening that Dr. Schawlow invented is to use what's called intermodulation.  What he does is he sends two beams in and so one beam is headed this way and one beam is headed that way if an atom is going this way its emitting light that way it doesn't have an effect, if it is emitting light within the capture region of the beams then since I'm going this way and that way and the two beams are both causing the transition, the sum of the two beams or the difference of the two beams is causing the transition then I can get rid of the broadening some of the broadening because these beams here where they intersect going zero velocity, I mean are intersecting that are going zero velocity relative to the beams.  And so those are the only ones that I pick up, the ones that don't have a shift, because one is going this way and one is going that way.  So that's called intermodulation.  The modulation part is that I modulate this one at one frequency, and I modulate this one at another frequency and so I throw out everything except the sum and difference frequency, because the sum and difference frequency are the frequencies of which I am actually causing the transitions to occur.  And so I got rid of the Doppler broadening.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is something that had not been done?
Speaker 2: It hadn't been done.  Schawlow was given the Nobel Prize for this, you know, this and other things that he has developed in conjunction with it.  And then my other advisor, my co-advisor was given the Nobel Prize for coming up with techniques that were even higher resolution that that.  In fact, that polarization modulation was his idea.
Speaker 1: That's Huntsch?
Speaker 2: Hansch
Speaker 1: Okay Theodor W. Hansch.
Speaker 2: Polarization modulation is that he sends in polarized beams but he rotates polarization. You know, he rotates two polarizations and only when the polarizations line up and the beams are going, you know, counter propagating, you get--  So you get rid of the Doppler broadening and you get rid of other extraneous noise affects by modulating the polarization and doing the intermodulation.

Speaker 1: Is 1980 your first talk before the American Physical Society?
Speaker 2: 1980 would have been my first talk and I was scared to death.  Because the room had probably about fifty people, you know back then, and he [Dr. Arthur Schawlow?] told me I was gonna have to give a talk and I had no idea what to expect. But it turned out really well.  The people were really friendly.  I didn't this but he told me this too, "You don't have to be afraid because what you are talking about maybe two people in the room understand.  So you are the expert." So that was the first time I realized that.  If I'm doing research in a laboratory and I'm not reading what somebody else did, you know, and this is something that, that you kind of know when things are new and what things are like, oh this has been done before. Usually you know that.  He says, "You are going to be the expert so never be afraid."
Speaker 1: This sounds really exciting.  I mean to know something and be on the cutting edge of some knowledge that no one else has explored.
Speaker 2: And so I did that and he made me do another one and another one and after that I could stand in front of five hundred people, it didn't make a difference I've done it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this American Physical Society so that kind of really boost your confidence.
Speaker 2: It does and that's why they have students do it.  It really does.  But I didn't believe that statement at first; how am I an expert, I'm barely making it, you know, but you are.  I mean, a laboratory is a nice place to be, because it's open for free thought.  So, I mean there have been problems that I solved since then that just came by just thinking and not being restricted by what somebody else has done.  Sometimes it is really good to know what people have done but sometimes it can be a hindrance because once an idea is implanted and once somebody says, "Oh, it can't be done," then people just stop and they don't try.
Story_ID: 27225
Speaker 1: Tell us like why you picked optics in the first place because it was something that you shied away from before?
Speaker 2: The reason I picked optics is because it was my second choice, maybe my third choice.  What I initially had picked was low-temper-- high-temperature superconductivity.  Now I don't know if you know what that is but there was some major work going on in the '80s [1980s] on trying to come up with a superconductor that worked at room temperature. I mean, if you were to make that break through it would revolutionize the world. Because superconductors have this property that they don't resist the flow of electricity.  They expel magnetic fields, I mean that's what maglev [method of propulsion that uses magnetic levitation] is about.  If you made wires and material out of superconductors you would essentially run on very, very small amounts of energy; you would lose very little in terms of-- What happens now is that when you send current through a regular conductor it heats up and so you would lose power in the form of heat because there is no way for the electrons to flow through without bumping into atoms and losing heat.  But a primary property of a superconductor is that it conducts electricity without any loss of energy.  So there was a professor there, Malcolm Beasley, I don't know if he is still at Stanford he probably is if he still alive, but everybody says, "Mal Beasley is a great guy that's the guy you want to talk to because he is doing high-temperature superconductivity." And so I went in and ask Dr. Beasley to work for him he says, "Well, I have too many students. Why don't you come back in six months."  Well, anyway I went to him I don't know if it was six months later but I went back to him.  He says, "I have too many students and I don't have any money." And I said, "I have my own money, I am a Xerox fellow." But he said, "Well, I still have too many students, why don't you come back."  But what he was doing was he was just putting me off and so he was one of the professors at Stanford who wouldn't take on black students because he didn't think he had anything to contribute.  That's me saying that, he probably won't admit it but I wouldn't be the only one to tell you that, if anybody tells you the truth.  So it was like that with a number of students.  Another member of my class of twenty-seven who was probably one of the smartest people who ever walked the earth, was African American from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and this guy when I met him he was riding around on a bicycle.  I had met him when he came in but I saw him riding around, we had all these problems to do and I said, "Man, when you going to work on your homework." And he said, "I have already done it."  "So how could you do your homework? They gave us homework that was supposed to take us two weeks." He said, "Well, it took me an hour." He wasn't lying.  He had gone to MIT and took all the graduate classes and undergraduate classes at the same time.  And so there were times in our classes where he actually taught, in a sense, taught our teacher because he would do things-- like we had to do two hundred and eight Feynman diagrams to solve this one quantum mechanical problem using--Feynman was also a Nobel Prize winner who came up with these really neat diagrams.
Speaker 1: Richard Feynman, right?
Speaker 2: Richard Feynman.  This guy had invented his own diagrams and done it in twenty diagrams on one sheet of paper and solved the problem. And he did that all the way through grad school.
Speaker 1: Now who is this person?
Speaker 2: This guy is James Lindesay he's at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: James--?
Speaker 2: L-I-N-D-E-S-A-Y
Speaker 1: Now he's at Howard now?
Speaker 2: He's at Howard. This summer he's at Stanford working with his advisor.  They have written a book on quantum gravity or something but he is a theoretical physicist.  When he went in and asked one of the professors who worked for him and he walked in the door and the guy says I don't think you can do the work, you know because he looked at him and saw he was black.  Well when James did his defense there was a guy in the audience who was just acting a fool, he was saying, "This is the greatest thesis I've heard in the last twenty years and I vote that this guy graduates with distinction," and I said "James, who is this guy" and he said "That is the guy who said I couldn't do the work."  So there were about I'm just going to name a number and I think I am pretty accurate there were about three or four professors out of all of the professors we had that we could work for and Dr. Schawlow was one and I went asked him to work for him and he said sure.  I tell this funny story because one of my bosses that I had on the job he says that was racist, what he said.  Dr. Schawlow was probably the largest collector of jazz in North American.  He had a huge jazz collection and so he was a big jazz fan, and he says the first time he heard jazz he just couldn't believe it.  He says, "If black people could come up with something like jazz I know you can do science."  I didn't take that as racist but my boss who was also Caucasian says that sounds racist to me.  When I got my second job--third job out of graduate school. but I didn't take it that way, I knew what he meant but he was a good advisor.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. So--
Speaker 2: That's how I picked optics.
Story_ID: 27226
Speaker 1: Tell us about your dissertation. This is 'Doppler-free Radiofrequency Optogalvanic Spectropscopy using Polarization Intermodulated Excitation,' right?
Speaker 2: I spoke a little bit about it earlier and so the optogalvanic part is that when you excite these atoms, you excite the atoms you change the electron density in the atoms.  You actually change the galvanic properties or you change the conductivity of the system, and so you can read that using electronics.  You can read how much resistance you have or you can read the inductive flow in an oscillator. So you have this thing, you have this tube inside of an oscillator and you excite your gas so that you set off a discharge.  So you have a steady state condition where you have an electronic discharge inside of an oscillator inside the inductor of the oscillator so think about a wire coil, a capacitor, so you have an oscillator system there and some electronics and so you are driving this discharge just like this light bulb and then I come along with a laser and I excite an atomic transition inside.  But when I excite this transition it changes the electron-- changes the atomic state so that the electrons are in different positions, different distribution of electron so the electron density changes; if the electron density changes the conductivity changes, and so now the oscillator sees that and so you can pick the atomic transition effects through the oscillator and read it like a radio and that's what he [Dr. Arthur Schawlow] wanted to do.  He wanted to come up with another technique for doing atomic spectroscopy where you actually use a radio system to pick up those systems and that's what that thesis was about.   The intermodulation once again is where the beams are going in opposite directions so you can get rid of the Doppler broadening and also this polarization in a modulated so the polarization of the beams are being rotated and only when they match up do you get excitation of the atoms.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You other advisor [Dr. Theodor Hansch] improved upon that?
Speaker 2: He improved upon--see all of these--they came up with not just this one technique buy many techniques and many atomic spectroscopy kinds of systems and so what the other advisor did is he improved upon the resolution of a number of these different systems by coming up with other new techniques, including this polarization modulation.  And that, the co-advisor actually came in as a--he probably came into Stanford as a assistant professor under Dr. Schawlow and eventually he left, Dr. Schawlow got older and he left.  Some people said that he left because if he stayed underneath him he would never get a Nobel Prize and sure enough when he left, he did get a Nobel Prize.  Because I think they felt like Dr. Schawlow kind of overshadowed me.  I think he thought of him as a son, it wasn't like it was a negative relationship but sometimes you have to kind of move out.
Speaker 1: Dr. Schawlow received the Nobel Prize in 2005--.
Speaker 2: No, in '81, in 1981 and Theodor Hansch received the Nobel Prize in 2005.
Speaker 1: Okay, so his, his-- right. 2005.  So that's--so you were with Dr. Schawlow when he wins the Nobel Prize.  You are part of the research team then.
Speaker 2: We were then a part of the research team and also some of my work was a part of that.
Story_ID: 27227
Speaker 1: You got your Ph.D. in '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: What were your prospect--?
Speaker 2: Job prospects?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I know you were finished with the work before you probably got your degree, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, about a year, almost a year before and the job market back then was not very good.  The job market in '82 [1982] wasn't, wasn't real good so what I thought--okay so I did my degree in spectroscopy so maybe I would try Bell [Laboratory].  So I applied to Bell and I applied a few other places and still drew a blank.  I interviewed with a guy at Bell and he said, "Yeah, I wanted to hire you but," you know, for whatever reason he didn't.  So what happened I got a job a first job offer came from Lincoln University which is in HBCU [historically black college or university].
Speaker 1: The one in Missouri or Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: I thought it was Nebraska, I don't know.  I'm lost in that.  You might have to look that up.  I thought it was in Lincoln-I thought it was in Nebraska.  But I didn't take it because--what happens is when you come out of graduate school you go to HBCU we already don't have the money and materials and stuff like that.  And so you are just going to end up having to do a lot of teaching.  It would take you forever to get a laboratory if you get one at all and the infrastructure for doing that is not there.  So I think a few months later, I don't know how many, I got a job offer from Corning [Corning, New York].  And Dr. Schawlow talked to me and he says, "I've been to Corning but it is way out in the middle of nowhere."  I had no idea what Corning was, I knew CorningWare, I knew Glass Works, but he says it's way out in the middle of nowhere but they do good work so I thought I would take that.  So I went in and interviewed and I got the job and it was the second best thing that ever happened to me in terms of jobs and positions.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did you do at Corning; what kind of research?
Speaker 2: At Corning I was given the task of building a laboratory to create these 3DB wavelengths selective couplers.  And basically what those are that's an optical wave guide which I had never seen before, by the way, that allows you to split light between different channels.  For example if you are talking, let's say we are on a conference call and you are talking to somebody in California, you are talking to somebody in Missouri, and you are talking to somebody in New York and I wanted to split your signal between those different calls.  I mean this splitter, you know, is one of the things that allow you to split the signals different ways.  That's an exaggeration but essentially it is a way to split a signal.  You know, one single signal and sent it to three or four or ten different places at the same time, simultaneously.  So it takes light and it splits it into a bunch of different channels.  And we wanted to make it wavelength selective so me I wanted the red channel to go to New York, and I wanted the blue channel to go to California and I want the green channel to go somewhere else.  So what I did in that laboratory--first they gave me an empty room they said build a laboratory and I said, "Oh my God I have worked in a laboratory but I never built a laboratory." But what I did do is that I ordered things for the laboratory under Dr. Schawlow.  I knew how the laboratory was set up and so I kind of modeled my lab after that.  I said, "I need filters, I this, I need mounts," and so that's what I did.  My wife and I sat down, I still have the piece of paper and we went to a catalog, you know, back in the day there wasn't an internet to use so much, went to the catalog and I found the components and we built a laboratory.  She sat with me and did it--and helped me and that was the first lab I built.  Since that everywhere I've gone I have built a laboratory myself, same thing at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].  That's a lost art that a lot of students--a lot of people coming out with Ph.D.s don't have.  They walk into these fantastic laboratories that somebody else has built and they don't know how to build them.  They don't know how to design it; they don't know how to think through the design of a laboratory to do a certain task.
Story_ID: 27228
Speaker 1: Your design for a lab comes out of what you think you need, right? Really, to do--
Speaker 2: It comes out of what I think I need, it comes out of an experience that I have in terms of how you build a laboratory, what you need in terms of, you know, the set up the lay out, the power, the components, everything.  So literally, the first three or four laboratories I built I knew every component in it, I mean literally thousands of components.  I knew where everything was, everything, I knew what everything was; I knew what systems went together.  So when I moved a lab from one place to the next I could put that lab back together in a week, from memory, because I built it.  It's different from building something and inheriting something, it's a big difference.
Speaker 1: So why do you think they asked you to build it, I mean, from scratch.  Is it because you came from a Nobel Prize winning laboratory that was doing some of the same work and they wanted to get on the cutting edge or what?
Speaker 2: It was because it was new work that they needed done.  Because coming from Stanford [University, Stanford, California] I should have known how to do it.  I mean, I don't know, I mean, I can't completely answer that question but I didn't question it.  I mean, now you might say, "How am I supposed to build a laboratory, how do I do it?"  This is what students ask me, "Well, how?" I say, well, you know, think. Really.  You know, so you told me to build a lab. I knew we wanted to make these couplers and I also didn't know what it was.  I had never touched a fiber, didn't know what a fiber was, didn't know how it worked, you know.  So I had to learn all of that while I'm building the laboratory.  And so they had a nice library, still do, probably better than they ever had now.  And so I just hit that library and I had to design these things and so I had to hit the library, go in the library, learn the electromagnetic theory behind waveguides, learn electromagnetic theory associated with coupling of waveguides, created computer program that simulated, I did all of that. And I did all of that in six months.  Within six months mine was one of the three major projects that the CEO [Chief Executive Officer] of the company [Corning] called one of the four major products in the company so it was within just six months.  But I had to get up and give a talk on it, people really liked it, I mean there was some fascinating work coming out of it.  In fact, the work that I later on did at Livermore [National Laboratory, Livermore, California] came out of that.  It came from that and it came from a talk that was given by a guy from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] on how you create sensors out of these devices.  Because the sensing of these devices is more important than the wavelength transmission part as far as technology is concerned-new technology.
Speaker 1: Well, so, describe how--what kind of space you need and what kind of atmosphere you need to do the kind of work you were doing with wavelengths.
Speaker 2: The amount of space you need is you need a room maybe fifteen by--if that's what you mean by space--fifteen by twenty minimum.  You need at least two or three optical tables, you know, probably minimum.  You need to have a way to cool your equipment so they have what is called a LCW [low conductivity water].  It's chilled water that comes to a--you need gases particularly nitrogen back in that day.  Nowadays I still need nitrogen because now I use these deep UV [ultraviolet] systems and you have to purge them with nitrogen.  You purge them with nitrogen because if you don't since its UV it starts to eat up everything around it creates ozone and the ozones eat into the material.  For example, you have coatings on your mirrors after a little while if the laser itself doesn't damage the coating the ozone does.  You have to keep the whole thing in a nitrogen environment and inert gas environment.  I don't' know if that answers your question?
Speaker 1: It answers part of it I guess.  I was just asking what, what are the considerations for building your lab, you know?
Speaker 2: The main consideration is to have the infrastructure around that can support it.  So the infrastructure in my understanding and my knowledge of it is power, water, gases and other support material that are relatively inexpensive compared to the equipment that goes inside a laboratory.  And a lot of times, you know, you come to a place where they don't have power, they don't have water, and you are trying to build a laboratory and it's an uphill battle.  When I first came to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] they didn't have power and water.  When they did have water the water was coming in too hot, it has to be cold.  So one of the things I have done I have purchased chillers.  A chiller cost typically a chiller to cool a laser is about $20,000, the laser systems I use.  The laser systems I use what's called high powered gas lasers and those systems can dissipate as much as fifty-five kilowatts, they generate fifty-five kilowatts of heat that has to be dissipated rather than run water in and dump it in the ground which is an ecological nightmare essentially, you want to recirculate the water.  So you send it out to this chiller that has like a big reservoir that may be a one hundred gallon reservoir and that's what I bought.  So that sends the cold water back through the system, the system stays good, you can run it all day, all night.  It doesn't cost the university anything more that the power.  They were spending more money for water than power.  Because you got to dump twelve gallons of water down the drain every minute, twelve gallons a minute, minimum. As much as twenty gallons a minute.
Story_ID: 27229
Speaker 1: Let's, let's go back to Corning.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So you were at Corning for three years, I guess?
Speaker 2: I was at Corning for three years.
Speaker 1: You said it was the best experience that you--the second best experience in life in terms of work, I guess.
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: For a number of reasons.  Number one, you know, this was also my first time living in New York; people in New York is different.  The people are kind of gruffer, abrupt kind of.  The best friends-the closest friends I've made in all the country have been in New York with the exception of being at home, right.  So that was the first reason, the second reason is the experience.  The first boss I had at Corning took me around with him when he would go to meetings and he taught me something that just, you know, nobody else would have taught me and I don't know why he taught me.  If you ask him to this day he will swear that he didn't teach me this but he did.  He taught me how to write patents, he taught me how to write my own patents and one thing that Corning does and you have to be careful on film what you say.  They have a really neat system of patents and how they can see a competitor's device and sort of patent--write a patent that doesn't infringe on that. I'm trying to be careful in my wording.
Speaker 1: So this has to do with-- so are there people on the staff-- scientist on the staff and I guess probably lawyers too trying to figure this out?  How to state a patent or how to describe a patent without infringing on someone else's--?
Speaker 2: Right, that's right. But not only that but I won't name Corning as one of the places but I will say Company X will take you device and reverse engineer it and patent around your patent, I also learned that.  Tear somebody else's stuff apart and then rewrite the patent.
Speaker 1: And write in a way where it doesn't infringe on--.
Speaker 2: And so what I've done, I've never done that but I know how to do that.  I learned that at Corning, I won't tell you how I learned it but I learned it.
Story_ID: 27230
Speaker 1: So when I write a patent, I write a patent around my own patent.  I know how to protect my patent because I know how to patent around it.  Does that kind of make sense?
Speaker 2: It makes sense but can you describe--give us for instance, a simple example?
Speaker 1: Okay I'm going to give you an example.  One of the things we did in graduate school is that every student had to build another invention that Dr. Schawlow came up with called a laser wavemeter.  The reason a wavemeter is really important, we are going build one this summer-I'm going to build one with the-- have some college students build one.  But the reason a laser wavemeter is important, as I told you we probe an atomic system with these lasers. Well, you know, according to quantum theory I have to know the wavelength, otherwise how do I know what laser and what wavelength or what color to probe the system with? And so one way to tell is using a laser wavemeter.  So laser wavemeter is essentially a system where I can send a laser beam in and I can tell you within one part in ten to the six what the frequency of that laser is and so he invented that.  And so what I did was I invented something called a Bragg grating wavemeter and I have a terminology for it, a wavemeter for Bragg gratings and we'll talk about those Bragg gratings later if you have time.
Speaker 2: Well sure we have time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But basically what these Bragg gratings are is they are holographic patterns that you write into optical fibers and that was an offshoot of the work that I did at Corning.  I tried to go back to Corning to work with Corning and they swore they didn't know what I was talking about.  So they didn't necessarily get on the front end of that. But this was an invention that I did when I was thirty years old at Livermore [National Laboratory, Livermore, California].  It was a way to write these patterns into a fiber by doing it without touching the fiber.  You use like--you write these patterns from the side--you write these holographic patterns in there.  And so what these holographic patterns do is you send light down and they strike the pattern it get reflected.  Now that doesn't sound all that exciting.  You send light down it hits these patterns which are interference patterns inside a fiber and it travels through a number of them and gets reflected back because each time it hits one a part of the light gets reflected after a while 100 percent comes back.  The thing that is important about that is if I touch the fiber the light will pass through or the amount that gets reflected back is modulated by my touch. That's a nerve, that's an artificial nerve.  I knew that when I did it and so what I did was I had to come up with a wavemeter that allowed me to write these patterns in the fiber to the density that would mimic the human body. And so that's what the newspaper article and the artificial nerve stuff is all about.  It's based upon these Bragg gratings and this laser wavemeter.  So what I did was I patented that wavemeter and then I wrote patents around that wavemeter because I said, "Okay so this wavemeter works CW [continuous wave] so I need to write some patents around it because suppose somebody comes up with another wavemeter that works in pulse mode." Then this would be two patents.  I would have a patent on the CW [continuous wave] and they would have a patent on the pulse.  So I wrote a patent around that patent.  And then I said, "Suppose somebody comes up with a way to miniaturize it?" So I wrote another patent to miniaturize it that's based upon another principle.  That's what I'm saying, I don't know if that explains it any better but that's how you do it.  You look at it after a few months and you realize, "Wow, I should have put this in it."  Now sometimes you have--there is a window of opportunity where you can modify it but after awhile the modifications become a whole other idea so you write a patent around your patent.  You are protected by surrounding it by patents that somebody else would have come up with if they had thought about it after a while.  I mean that's what I was taught to do.
Speaker 2: This is very important in this competitive business environment because people are trying to make money.
Speaker 1: That's what Corning does, that's what everybody does.  I mean, hopefully everybody who is successful in business do.

Speaker 1: So at Corning--so you were there three years.  The best thing that you got out of there was patent--?
Speaker 2: The best thing I got out of that was the patent [on Braggs grating wavemeter] and fiber optic technology because that's how I supported my family for the last almost thirty years, well more than thirty years.  It's such a broad technology that there is a lot of things that you can do with it.  And even now, what they are doing is quantum computing.  I think some of the new projects at Stanford [University, Stanford, California] involve doing quantum computing.  Looking at polarization entanglement; entanglement is a basic foundational principle of quantum computing where you create two photons or you create two quantum, quantum mechanical particles that are created at the same time so if one is located on the other side of the universe and one is here if I touch this one and do something to it the other one feels it instantaneously.  That's a real effect. It's been demonstrated up at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] it might have been the first place to demonstrate it but it has been demonstrated all around the world.  So those particles exist in a different kind of space it's called Hilbert space.  It's not regular three dimensional, four dimensional space.  So if two particles entangle, no matter what you do to one the other one knows it instantaneously, the other one responds instantaneously.  Speed of light not being a limitation.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is the foundation for your nerve research?
Speaker 2: The entanglement is not but the Bragg gratings and the wavemeter are.  Something not so exotic as entanglement but still profound in terms of the human being.  If you lost an arm you can have an arm that you can feel in your fingers, you can feel it. I mean, that's a big deal.  I've gone to agencies before and they say, "No, this is impossible." And it turns out now in 2013 Vanderbilt just got funded for $5.2 million trying to do the same thing and they are almost fifteen years, twenty years behind what I did.  So they will start over but they will start over in money.  I mean they have done their own, they have some independent stuff going there too but essentially it's the same principle and they don't have the wavemeter, they don't have that.  They don't have the knowledge that I have.
Speaker 1: Now did you have come up with this idea at Corning or back at Stanford?
Speaker 2: No this idea came--Corning was a catalyst because there was a talk I heard.  Optical fibers and splitters and all that all sounds fine and fantastic; you should look at the electromagnetic theory, it is really exciting.  But one day this same boss took me to a talk by this guy at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Larry Domash and he was talking about putting periodic structures in fibers to convert fibers into sensors.  I said, "Sensors, I didn't know a fiber could sense." He says, "Yeah, it can sense."  He said, "Well, all you would have to do is somehow remove this material periodically and you could cause it to couple or decouple according to whether it had some strain or magnetic field, you know, impinge on it."  I said, "Well, I can do that," and my boss said, "No, you can't," and I said, "Yeah I can, I know how to do it." My boss said, "No, you can't do it."  So after the meeting-so I shut up. I got the point. He said, after the meeting he said, "You can't tell people that we can do this, you know."  He said, "We take their ideas, it's a one-way flow of information." And they had paid this guy for his ideas, I guess it's fair.  When I went to Livermore [National Laboratory, Livermore, California] they were working on something that was oddly related but not related.  So I saw the opportunity to take an experiment during a trip that we took to Massachusetts and change the experiment from blowing holes in the fibers to not touching them at all.  Just let the light touch them and not see any change in the material itself but to see if there is a change that occurs that's atomic.  Something happening within the material and not removal of the material or ablation. And sure enough when I tried it worked.  And I videotaped it and hand carried that experiment to Washington [D.C.] because it was done under secret, at that time it was top secret work for what they call a black hat project.  You probably know what that is?  It is one of those project where, you know--this was during the cold war that kinds of links it together for you. The Cold War, the Russians gave us an object that had an eagle on top and a globe and it was a gift to the American Embassy in Russia.  The globe was hollow, the eagle was an American eagle but they were beaming microwaves into the American Embassy and this globe was vibrating according to people's speech.  And so they sent the microwaves back modulating with the voice of everything that was going on in the embassy and people started coming down with cancer.  This was on the news, this is public information.  People came down with cancer because microwaves cause cancer.  So that's, that was a black hat project.
Story_ID: 27232
Speaker 1: So a black hat project, I would guess, using the model of black hats and white hats in western movies and spy versus spy cartoons and the black hat is the evil project or the negative one, I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In the popular (unclear).
Speaker 2: It's one of those things you keep hushed.
Speaker 1: Yeah it's the kind of thing that you are doing where you are cheating or you are doing something to some subterfuge or undermining and that sort of thing.  Okay. So the Government does these things like other governments but these black hat projects are on the--.
Speaker 2: They're closed, you know.  Sometimes through the Freedom of Information Act some of them are declassified, you know, and I don't know which.  But as far as I can tell it turns out that some of the work that I was doing there was also being done by an independent group of people.  'Cause when an agency hires you to do something they don't just hire you they hire other people too 'cause it's just like you have a company, I want you to develop this project, this product for me but I am going to try this group people see if they can develop it.  Whoever develops it first it is fine, I'm invested in both and so I get what I want.
Speaker 1: So you think a parallel laboratory is doing the same thing--?
Speaker 2: A parallel laboratory was doing what I wasn't really asked to do at Livermore [National Laboratory, Livermore, California] in a sense.  But they were doing something so similar that it almost seems as if they were asked to do the same thing that I was asked to do.  That group of people got credit for that technology even though I had done it, at least to my knowledge, I had done it earlier.  They report it later.
Speaker 1: This is at Lawrence Livermore [National Laboratory] now not at Corning [Incorporated, Corning, New York].
Speaker 2: This is Livermore-
Speaker 1: We did not talk about the transition from Corning to Livermore how did that take place?
Speaker 2: Essentially the transition from Corning to Livermore occurred because my wife wanted to go back to school and so we went back to Stanford.  And so I looked for a job in the area and I actually didn't want to work at Livermore.  I knew about Livermore but I didn't want to work there because I knew it was a weapons laboratory. At least, that was how they labeled it.
Speaker 1: That's something that I you really didn't want.
Speaker 2: It was something that I was totally opposed to.  I was opposed to it for a lot of reasons but you know.
Speaker 1: Would you say for humanitarian reasons?
Speaker 2: Well humanitarian reasons, you know, religious reasons, all kind of reasons but that's where I ended up going and once again it was good experience.  Everything happens for a reason because the offshoot of it for me was this artificial nerve.  It wouldn't have happened without going there.
Story_ID: 27233
Speaker 1: There [Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California] you originated the transverse holographic method for wavelength division multiplexity, right? Using (unclear)--- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: And I say that I was one of the originators because I did the experiments, I have them in notebooks, records and everything.  But a few years later that same thing was published or something very similar to it was published it really was the same thing published by Maury Nelson Glenn at United Technologies [Hartford, Connecticut] and so it was so similar that it lead me to believe that United Technologies might have a contract from the same agency, but I don't know.
Speaker 1: So it could even be, I don't know, I guess with two labs working on a similar project then the company that hires them or Livermore in this case has the ability to combine the research to come up with what they want to come up with, right?
Speaker 2: Well see it wasn't Livermore. It wasn't Livermore.  Livermore wasn't the hiring agency, Livermore was just the laboratory. United Technology was another laboratory.  There was an agency of the government that hired.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the agency of the government has the ability to take research and do whatever they want to with it--.
Speaker 2: They do; in fact, they can be cross taught if they want.  We both-- We are government workers so whatever we do belongs to the U.S. government not to us; which is fair this is what you sign off for.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did--how did you feel about that?
Speaker 2: How did I feel about it, terrible because I didn't get anything but resistance inside Livermore.  You know, I was-- I was actually, I said I wasn't going to say anything negative, but I was demoted when I worked on that.  Because the thing in the review says that, "You are doing something that we didn't ask you to do."  I was being creative, they didn't ask me to be creative but I'm a scientist and so I don't know how you separate the two but I was actually demoted.  So that part really bothered me a lot because all you do when you do that is you just stop.  You stop the work you stop the progress you don't even see the value of it.  Even though I tried to explain what could come out of it.  You could create dispersion compensators, you could do all this stuff.  By dispersion, what happens when you talk on an optical fiber there is something that occurs called materials dispersion you can't get rid of it so if I modulate the voices on a fiber after a while the modulation profile, the profile of the beams start to spread out because the material causes it to broaden out.  And so when my broaden signal crosses over your broaden signal we have what we called in the old days when you picked up the telephone, cross talk.  So I can hear, do you remember in the old days when you had the party line you could hear the other people talking that's exactly what it sounds like.  And so what these gradings allowed you to do was it would reshape a beam, after a beam starts to spread out it hits one of these holographic patterns, you write the right pattern it would squash the beam back up real tight for you.  So I wrote all that down and said this is what it could be used for and they said no.  Anyway of course, dispersion compensators have been made since then and all kinds of things that I predicted, but.  I was thirty, I was a kid. So it takes you-- it took me ten years to get over.
Speaker 1: That's kind of a galling experience to see something that you were demoted doing for, now elevated with somebody else's name on it.
Speaker 2: And I've gone through this at least two of those experiences.  I have tough skin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this discovery kind of provided you with a foundation for which you built your career?
Speaker 2: Career, really. Yes. That's right.
Speaker 1: But you've publish, you've published all-- about your work, right?
Speaker 2: I've published about a number of things related to my work.  So I published about this particular concept, the distributed Bragg grating so I not only published but I have gotten funded for different devices.  I created a device for hydrodynamic defense that sensing that the Department of Defense paid for. And what that is it's a way to put a skin on something like a submarine and map out the hydrodynamic flow around the submarine.  I've published the artificial nerve stuff, at least not, really published, I really disclosed it.
Story_ID: 27234
Speaker 1: So you were at Livermore [National Laboratory, Livermore, California] until 1990, is that true?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Anything else significant about Livermore, you want to talk about until--?  You are not too happy there, I guess by this point.
Speaker 2: No I'm not too happy with the management.  Because I'm in a division where it's a top secret division called Z division and some things that happen inside in the Z division you just can't talk about.  So even if they are doing things that probably shouldn't be doing you can't talk about that either.  But, one of the statements that was made was, "We can't make you leave but we can make you miserable while you are here."  And they had--I think there was a total of about three black scientists on the whole base and there was something like ten thousand of us.  So National Laboratories have a record that pretty much runs, you know, in that fashion.  They don't have very many African Americans.
Speaker 1: They can make you miserable.
Speaker 2: They couldn't make me leave, I was permanent, but they could make me miserable.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about Grumman [Aerospace Corporation, Long Island, New York].
Speaker 2: Grumman was the greatest job on earth.  It was really, really good it was a shock though.  I mean the whole Long Island thing was a shock.  When we left Livermore and we went to Long Island the shocking part of it was just the whole New England kind of atmosphere.  Because upstate New York is not like Long Island. Upstate New York is more rural and Long Island is very metropolitan, you know.  A lot of educated people but it was a great job and it was a really, really, really good experience for my children.  The schools there are just second to none, the Long Island Schools ,because the tax base is so good, so great.  I think the taxes there when we there was about $6,000 a year. The property taxes.  But when we left California that was all we had known up to that point.  Mostly we had spent most of our married life in California and we left California, we went to New York.  The first thing we found was that we couldn't find--I think I got a $30,000 increase in salary coming from Livermore to New York that was a big help.  And I got a $15,000 sign on bonus which back in that day those two numbers were very big numbers.  So I was right at--by the time I got there I think was about $87,000 about $90,000 a year which was more money I had ever seen in my life.  Only problem that we--one of the only problems we had we tried to live in a place, we had one child who was born premature so we wanted to live in a place where we could get the best schools for him and that was Huntington, New York.  But when we looked for a place to live nobody would sell us the house and so we lived in the hotel for three months.  So that was unpleasant at first and discouraging but after awhile the company, the company never complained.  Basically what my boss said was--people--my wife would call up and they would say, "We have place," and then we would get there and they would say, "Somebody just got the place."  So it happened over and over again so eventually what my boss said was, "I would go and we will trap them." but I said, "If people don't want us to live in the neighborhood I don't want to live there."  So eventually we found a family from Pakistan and they wanted to rent us their house and we did and we loved it.  It was a great house, the best schools in the world and Grumman was the best job I ever had.  Not second to none, but the best.
Story_ID: 27235
Speaker 1: Now it was at Grumman [Aerospace Corporation] that you patented the optical electronic multiplex reflection sensor system? Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay. You and S.M. S-
Speaker 2: Stan Reich. Stan Reich.
Speaker 1: --Reich, okay. You pronounce--
Speaker 2: They pronounce it Reesh, Stan Reich, Reich I think.
Speaker 1: So tell us about this-
Speaker 2: Okay that system was related to aircraft so what we wanted to do was to build a multi sensing system into composite fiber, because Grumman was like, Grumman was the number one contractor for the U.S. Navy for a long time, Grumman Aerospace was.  And so what we wanted to do-- Grumman had gone into composites and so they wanted to create planes that had a nervous system.  And so once you put these sensors into the airfoils and the wings and the body of the plane you can sense the stress and strains that the plane undergoes.  You can also if you build the sensors right you can sense when there is a fracture, you can sense when there is going to be a failure.  So you can save lives that way.
Speaker 1: Okay. So-
Speaker 2: That's what that patent was for.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are those patents still in use now?
Speaker 2: Well the technology is in use in aircraft.  The technology has been sort of been redeveloped, revamped, you know, here.  I think they said NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] has done it.  But there is a story for that too because NASA, when I first moved here [Hampton, Virginia] I said, "Okay, now I'm moving here, there's NASA there, if I don't like Hampton [University, Hampton, Viginia] there's NASA. And there's is Jefferson Laboratory and I was use to National Labs and places like that but it turns out they were not use to us.  Because NASA, historically at least NASA down where I come from they didn't typically hire blacks.  And NASA is one of those organizations that have not a real positive history in terms of African Americans.  And so this one had some of the old traditions, some of the old people left over, so they didn't work with me like that but what they did do they would come to my laboratory asking a lot questions on how to do this and how to do that.  One day they came to the lab because I wouldn't let them come--because I knew what was coming, I wouldn't allow it and I was gone and my students let them in and taught them some of the techniques, next thing I know those techniques are being published and they get a million dollars for research.
Speaker 1: Now this is--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: This is NASA right here, Langley Research Center.  I said I wasn't going to say anything negative, I don't know who is going to see this but on the other hand it's true.  Couldn't get a penny out of them for my students but they came over and, you know, they just kind of raided.  Had me coming over there giving talks and stuff and at first it was innocent I thought, that's great these guys are really interested in what I do; they were interested in taking it, not what I do.
Story_ID: 27236
Speaker 1: We didn't explain the move from-
Speaker 2: From Livermore [National Laboratory]?
Speaker 1: -- from Grumman [Aerospace Corporation]. No, Grumman to here [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]
Speaker 2: From Grumman to here? Okay, well, that's easy I was laid off.  I wasn't laid off because I was incompetent; I wasn't laid off because they didn't like me at the company.  I was laid off because, essentially the way the story went down and I'm sure that is the truth after knowing what I know now.  Then Secretary of Defense, Dick [Richard] Cheney got into some kind of an argument with the CEO [Chief Executive Officer], with one of the higher ups at Grumman and he said if it was the last thing he did he was going to shut the company down.  We were getting major contracts, I mean the major contractor to the U.S. Navy.  And so that's what happened, he started shutting contracts down, blocking doors and after awhile they start having to let twenty thousand people go and so I was one of the twenty thousand.  That's Dick Cheney, the same Dick Cheney that's still breathing now, Vice President.  So true to character but anyway that's what happened.  But I went to them before I was laid off and I said to my boss' boss, and maybe my boss' boss' boss, you know, "If I'm laid off can I take my laboratory?"  He says, "Before you are laid off the doors of this company will close."  I said, "Ok but I'm just saying hypothetically if I'm laid off can I take it?"  He said, "Sure he said I have no problem with it talk to Phil to make sure it's okay with him."  Phil said absolutely, Phil was my direct boss.  So a few weeks later my wife takes me out to buy some new clothes and I said, "No I'm not buying any new clothes because I'm going to get laid off."  She said, "Well how do you know?" I said I just feel it, I know.  I don't if I saw it in a dream or what.  But I think that same afternoon or near that same afternoon my boss was pacing back and forth because my old boss, my initial boss was gone now because he, they asked him to lay off people and he couldn't do it and so he left and got another job.  But the next boss was pacing and I said, "Come on in. I know you have my pink slip." He said, "How do you know, we just decided." I said, "I just knew," and he said, "You're not mad?" and I said no.  He said, "You're not upset?" "No, I'm not upset."  So I went back to my boss' boss' boss and he says, "Yeah, you can take the lab."
Speaker 1: Now this is the lab that you built right at Grumman?
Speaker 2: The lab I built.  He said, "Well, nobody else can use it; you can take it."
Speaker 1: So nobody else is going to be working on that project?
Speaker 2: No and all my friends who I thought were my friends, not all of them; man you have never seen people turn so fast. It was like, "Why can you take the lab?" You know.
Speaker 1: They weren't-- You were the one who had the deal, right, not anybody else.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: This (work?) represents, this is how many millions of dollars worth?  What would you guess?
Speaker 2: I would say a half to three quarters of a million.  But you were talking about half to three quarters of a millions of fiber optic type of equipment which is not just any equipment; it's small, so it's a lot of-- It took one of those very large flat bed truck, huge thing it was just crate after crate after crate, lasers, optical cable, everything, the whole thing. Everything.
Speaker 1: Now where did you--did you already--before you moved it had you already been hired by Hampton?
Speaker 2: I was hired-well I didn't tell you I was laid off on a Wednesday and the next Wednesday I was still on the job because you had two weeks and a job offer came over the fax machine and I had a job.  Interestingly enough, about the job it pays the same, exactly, identically the same, as I had at Grumman, which is unheard of.  They didn't know I was laid off.  I didn't go and advertise it. But Calvin, Calvin Lowe had tried to get me to come to Alabama A and M [University, Normal, Alabama] when he was there but I didn't want to go at that time to an HBCU [historically black college and university]. I thought, I had graduated from HBCU so I knew what the laboratories and things like that would be like, I thought I knew but he convinced to consider Hampton.  I felt I would be laid off, I don't even think I had gotten laid off when I started talking to him about and that's how I ended up at Hampton, with the same salary oddly enough.  So we came here and we never spent the money for a down payment for a house that Grumman gave us.  Plus we had a huge savings; we left California and started out with a $30,000 increase in pay.  So we had learned to live on $30,000 less and so we didn't spend the difference.  I mean, New York was more expensive but just a little bit more and so we that and we had the down payment and that's when we bought this house, it was new then.  No marks on the walls, brand new paint.  I call it pee wee's playhouse, my wife put up every hand print and drawing the kids had all over the house, so but anyway.
Speaker 1: By that time you had how many children?
Speaker 2: By that time we had three the fourth was born here.  In fact, I thought the three was it no more, we wouldn't have anymore and ten years later we had number four.  And number four is now the eighteen year-old.
Story_ID: 27237
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a chance to build your own lab, I mean you've got your lab with you.
Speaker 2: It was a seed, it was a seed. What I've built down there [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] is much bigger now.  But it was a drop in the bucket compared to what was built after.
Speaker 1: Okay. So are, are you brought in as an endowed professor of physics?
Speaker 2: Absolutely not, in fact, I was brought in as a research professor in physics without tenure and without tenure track.
Speaker 1: Okay, that makes sense.
Speaker 2: Yeah it does in the context of what you think a university might would do but usually when you are travelling with a laboratory it is not done that way.  My white counterparts who were brought in were brought in on tenure track.  So that too is pretty typical of the HBCU [historically black college or university] (laugh).  My department is I think thirty professors and two African Americans.
Speaker 1: At Hampton, really.  Thirty professors--.
Speaker 2: I am saying thirty but its assistant professors, research professors but there are many tenured but two African Americans.  And that's pretty typical of HBCU.  Number one in their defense a lot of us haven't seen black scientist and a lot of times you hear them say well they are not out there.  But then usually what's happening is the salaries, they don't want to pay the salaries.  Hampton is not guilty of that, they're not guilty of that, they pay salaries.
Speaker 1: So Hampton seems to have made a commitment to really making an excellent physics department (unclear), I mean, that's my observation from interviewing a lot of people. Is that how you feel?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess I would agree with that.  The only thing that I would disagree with is how you would do.  But yeah I would agree. And I don't want to get into how you would do it.  So that part of the interview I think we will leave it at that.  I don't agree with the way that you, the way that they think that you have to do it.  There is a better way to do it.
Speaker 1: Ideally though I could ask you how you would build a physics department if you could ideally build one.
Speaker 2: You could ask and I don't know that we would add any information that would be much better any more than it's the people.  It's the kind of people that you hire; there is a certain, you know, class or group of people but I don't want to get into naming classes or saying that somebody is less than them, I'm not saying that.  But there's people of a certain caliber that you hire and you want to always make sure that you support infrastructure for it.  We talked about this earlier because when you build a laboratory is not a room. A laboratory is what goes into the room but really before it's that it is all the stuff that surrounds the room.  It's the power of the water, the you know, the electricity, its' the heating, the cooling, it's what we call infrastructure, and its' support systems that support those systems.  So you start out with that. And so these places haven't gotten, for the last seventy years, they haven't gotten these millions of dollars from the government.  So in their defense they don't know what a lot of that stuff is.  If they want to talk about education or, you know, in fact the historical thing is the agricultural and technical, or agricultural and mechanical and so government was okay with that.  Government is not okay with you doing chemistry, and physics and high level engineering, it wasn't okay with that. And to some extent it still is not. It's still not.  I mean the National Science Foundation disproportionately give money to non HBCU users, I mean disproportionately by far.  So, that's the National Science Foundation the people who pay for you guys; I will say that, nothing they are going to do to me I ain't got no money from them.
Speaker 1: You can't take it back, right?
Speaker 2: You can't take what I don't have.
Speaker 1: So this is--do you think in terms of the HBCU that things are getting any better?
Speaker 2: They are; I mean look things are getting better in time.  People say they are not really getting better but they have to because see time won't let you stand still.  You can try and stand still; you can try and stand still, you can try and hold back it's like holding back the ocean, even worst.  You can't hold back time.
Speaker 1: Would you say that you have to either improve what you are doing or stop doing it?
Speaker 2: You either have to improve or in the case of the human condition you become like the dinosaur, extinct.
Story_ID: 27238
Speaker 1: So we were just kind of talking off camera candidly about the situation in HBCUs, historical black colleges [and universities] in terms of population of those who teach the sciences are so overwhelmingly not black, right?
Speaker 2: Overwhelmingly, I would say not.  And they weren't in my undergraduate institution and I don't know if that number has changed but they are not, and most of them that I know of.
Speaker 1: You said at Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] when you were there your mentors were basic two white professors.  There was one black woman there, Dr. Bessie Booth Foster, in the [physics] department at Grambling.
Speaker 2: I spent most of my time with Dr. Cummings.  Dr. Cummings brought me in and Dr. Cross put me in his office so he put a--he reminded me of a guy when I went to grad school at Stanford [University, Stanford, California] you know a friend of mine, George King.  But he made a desk for me in his office and Dr. Cross is one of the brightest people that I have ever met. He went to UC Irvine [University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California].  But both of them were white, Dr. Cross and Dr. Cummings and so I really didn't have--I was never taught by anybody except Dr. Foster and her class was a good class but it was kind of a minor class.  It was an atomic physics class. The real base classes are like electricity and magnetism, theoretical mechanics, quantum mechanics and all of those were taught by non African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is typical of HBCUs?
Speaker 2: It's typical. This is pretty typical.
Speaker 1: And it speaks to the lack of scientist who are producing, I guess on some level.
Speaker 2: It may. It may. It also could be true that maybe, you know, African Americans are asking for more salary.  Because if somebody from India, the way it works with people from places like India they can come over, they can take less of a salary because on the side they are running a service station or a hotel or they have family members--so it's different.  We don't have those kinds of set ups.  Not that there is anything illegal or wrong about it but.  If for some reason if I was a millionaire I could work for Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] for free.  You know what I mean, that's an exaggeration but if you don't need the money you ask for less salary.  That may be why.
Speaker 1: So is this even true for a school like say Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] or Hampton I am really surprised that they have two out of thirty--.
Speaker 2: I don't think Howard, I'm sure Howard doesn't quite have that balance.  But you have to look at the years as the years come and go. And if you look at it statistically over time you will find that there are fewer African--I would think that an African American school the majority of the faculty would probably be African American but that's not necessarily true; you know, it may not necessarily be true that at some of them if not many of them.
Speaker 1: Yeah-(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: And I would say that fewer numbers are being produced possibly.  Definitely fewer numbers because we are a smaller percentage of the population.  Also fewer numbers in that--if I graduated from Stanford, notice where I went, I went to industry I didn't go to HBC[U].  Suppose I had gone to HBC. I can see a timeline that says that if I had gone I certainly wouldn't have had the laboratory, I certainly wouldn't have been able to the science that I was able to do.  I encourage students a lot of times they say, "What should I do?" And I say, "If I were you, my suggestion would be to go to industry and you can bring a whole lot more back if you want to come back."  You can, that's the truth.  Because look, when you come to HBCU you got to write grants and when the agency sees a grant coming from HBCU it's not put on the top of the stack.  It's like, "Well you know it sounds interesting but I doubt if they can do it."  Like the artificial nerve stuff when I wrote the NIH [National Institute of Health. "Well, yeah it looks interesting but we doubt if he can do it."  I invented the equipment; I invented the devices to do it, now that's, that's a feat.  It's one thing to say you are going to do something and it's another thing to realize that you need something to do it and then turn around and invent the thing you need to do it.  That's not an everyday occurrence, so anyway like I said I won't get into too much, I won't go too far here.
Story_ID: 27239
Speaker 1: There is an article that you showed us before we started about your fund raising capacity.  There is a cartoon picture of you on it and stuff, now tell us about that? This is about your--
Speaker 2: The 'Virginia Business Observer.' when I came to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] I had no idea how to write a proposal, not a clue, totally clueless.  That's the thing about unintelligent people.  It's one thing to be unintelligent, it's another thing to be so arrogant that you don't ask for help.  And so what I did was I got help.  I got help from somebody who I think is one of the best proposal writers in the country, that's Dr. Arlene Maclin. And you probably know Dr. Maclin but she taught me.  I had the science but I didn't have any skills about writing.  She taught me how to write the first proposal, I used her template and I wrote proposal after proposal.  Some years I wrote as many as seven and got five funded on that same year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I think some years after that, maybe three or four year after that, by that time I had maybe ten or twelve proposals funded.  They came and interviewed.
Speaker 1: So you worked on projects for the Department of Defense, NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], NIH [National Institute of Health], and what else, who else, I guess?
Speaker 2: DOE.
Speaker 1: Okay. Department of Energy.
Speaker 2: Department of Energy.
Speaker 1: So--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Now NIH projects doesn't mean I was funded by NIH.  That means--  When you wrote that down there the NIH has never given me any money.  Because, like I said, the stuff may be too controversial.  I went and actually talked to the director of the rehabilitation medical section of the NIH, he was the head of that whole section.  He was fascinated and he said, "Well, send it in."  But I sent it in and I got all these negative comments back about, "We don't think you can do this," and blah, blah, blah.  The other thing is that people told us that you have to have a doctor, but what I tried to do, we have no doctors because we don't have a medical center but you can--I could've connected with a doctor had I known a little bit more and understood that better.  But what they tell me was that, you know, essentially when they send these things back just send them back in, go and find a doctor who will work with you and that would have been the next step.  But the laboratory for doing all of that doesn't exist anymore.
Speaker 1: So this was a laboratory for fiber optic sensors?
Speaker 2: Yes, physically it's there but it's not functional because the laboratory was moved and when they use the laboratory they used it for another project that they had in mind.  Once you move a laboratory like the ones I build, you can't just plug them into the wall, it's not like that.  You need four hundred eighty, seventy amps rephased power, cooling, fifty-five kilowatts of heat dissipation and that kind of stuff.  So and we moved a big laboratory that took ten years to build so right now it's just in a dormant stage, we will put it like that.
Story_ID: 27240
Speaker 1: Who was the chairman at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] when you came?
Speaker 2: At the time that I came, Dr. Demetrius Venable. Let's see, he was chairman I believe. I believe he was chairman at the time.  Now I forget.  Because I think he was chairman and then he was promoted to the provost he was promoted from chairman to provost.
Speaker 1: That's right. That's right.
Speaker 2: But he's good.
Speaker 1: Right. That's right now he is at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Right. He was good for me.  He had wanted me to come for years, very positive, I mean anything I needed. So when I came in I needed--I had been building--at Grumman [Aerospace Corporation, Long Island, New York] I had built the UV [ultraviolet] system for creating the wavelengths I needed to write these holographic patterns, but he bought me one when I came. It was $86 or $87,000 that was a lot of money back then. He just bought. Says if you need it, he just bought it. (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  There have been a number of outstanding people who we have interviewed that were here and I just want to know who else was here when you came.  Dr. Venable--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Keith was here.  Keith Baker was here.
Speaker 1: Keith Bather
Speaker 2: Dr. Venable was here.  I want to say Calvin [Lowe] had just left I think.
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: Oh Dr. [Robert] Bonner, did you interview Dr. Bonner.  He was a very smart man he was the Dean of the School of Science.
Speaker 1: Warren Buck, I think, was he there?
Speaker 2: Warren Buck, yeah, he was here, another friend.  In fact, he was the only dissenting voice that voted with me to bring in the other faculty members, other African Americans.  Everybody else voted against them.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's-- That's just disturbing to hear.  I don't know if I should be giving comments like this, but it is disturbing to hear.
Speaker 2: I would leave it at that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 27241
Speaker 1: So, Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] has--now you're the first one I think we've interviewed, the first physicist that wasn't connected to the Jefferson Accelerator Project.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's probably right.  I kind of came here [Hampton, Virginia] with the intent of not being connected to those things. Although I said, "Okay if I came and things didn't work out there is Jefferson [National] Laboratory which is kind of like a little more for me and then there was NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], which is kind of like, maybe, you know, somewhat like that.  At Jefferson Lab I could have worked with them because there was a director there who really wanted me.  Because I would go out, give talks and he said, "I got to have this guy, I want him to work for me."  I do have projects--at least I have one project that I think would be really good to work with him on but the reason and you didn't' ask me this but I'm going to give it to you anyway.  The reason that I did that is because I thought, "Okay, if there is any contribution that I make inside Hampton, then it's all related to African Americans; if I make some contribution inside Jefferson Laboratory, that is divorced from African Americans."  Because that's the way things were.  Whatever I did at Livermore, Livermore [National Laboratory, Livermore, California] did it; whatever I did at Grumman [Aerospace Corporation, Long Island, New York], Grumman did it, whatever I did at Corning [Inc., Corning, New York], whatever I do at Hampton, that's different.  That is all I need to say about it.  You know, we got all these kids coming up thinking that okay I don't want to be a scientist, I don't see anybody black being a scientist I want to be a basketball player. But how many slots are available to be a great basketball player compared to the number of slots available for you to be a scientist, or be a physicist, chemist or an engineer.  And it is a ridiculous dream to have passed down from generation to generation.  And when they find out they can't they go to drugs or whatever or doing something that's going to get them killed.  So I thought if we can make some kind of contribution and it was all associated with black people, even though the people who worked with me weren't all black and then it would make a difference.  So that was the reason that I didn't jump at--it would have been easy even if [NASA] Langley or those places didn't want me out there I had enough to force myself on them, more than enough.  You didn't ask me that but I thought I should volunteer that.  I don't think that's an insult to anybody, it's just a part of life in America.
Speaker 1: Well I'm glad you said it.
Story_ID: 27242
Speaker 1: You were working on, on the fiber optic sensors to replicate the nervous system for-- How many years did you work on that here [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: How many years did I work on it here as opposed to working on it period?
Speaker 1: Well how many let's do period and then do here.
Speaker 2: I would say I started working on it when I did the first experiment back in 1986.  That demonstrated to me that that could be done so from that time on I'm thinking, "How I can I make a wavemeter?"  That's the reason I wanted to make a wavemeter. And so when I got to Grumman [Aerospace Corporation, Long Island, New York]-- I mean, Grumman was such a good job and they asked me to do things that were just as interesting so I didn't work on it there. But then when I got to Hampton-- Hampton is a university environment, in spite of the fact that maybe that infrastructure and all of that wasn't there, it was still a university environment and those kind--  In a university environment you are free to do a lot different things. All you have to do is to convince an agency that some offshoot of it or something that is the center of it can be used for what they need.  That's easy. That's why I could write so many grants.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you worked on it up to-- and what, can you explain again exactly what it entails?
Speaker 2: Sure.  What it is--you think of an optical fiber. An optical fiber is really typically glass.  It is some composition of glass so this optical fiber is a cylindrical object that has a smaller cylinder at the middle which is called the core of the fiber.  So you have the core surrounded by what's called a cladding.  And so there are two parts to the optical fiber there is the core which is glass and there is the cladding which is also glass.  The difference between the two is that the core is doped with some other material like germanium for example.  So the cladding, which is glass which is made of sand is just SiO2 silicon oxide.  And then the core has germanium dope in it.  So it's germanium doped silicon oxide and so the germanium pushes the index of refraction up so that the index of refraction of the core is higher than the outside.  So what that allows you to do is to trap light on the inside using essentially the principle of total internal reflection.  So if, so when the light tries to come out because the material is higher index it gets trapped on the inside most of it.  So what I did with the Bragg transversal holographic technique is I used light from the side of the fiber to expose--since this light passes through the outside, the silica is the perfect material for transmitting UV [ultraviolet] light but UV light is highly energetic because UV light is in the short end of the electromagnetic spectrum.  And so the UV light changes the material, it changes the electron distribution in the material and so it changes the index of refraction.  Because index of refraction is very closely related to the electron distribution inside of the material. And so when you change the index of refraction you change the way the light interacts with it. So now think of a pattern in space and this pattern has bright and dark regions and there are ten thousands to forty thousand of these and they are just straight up and down bright an dark regions it is like a stripe on a zebra and that stripe comes across the fiber but the unique thing about the stripe is that these patterns are regularly spaced and they hit the fiber they cause regions of the fiber to be either high index or low index periodically. And what that is is that causes what is called distributive feedback, and so when you send light down the fiber when it hits a region of high index part of it gets reflected back, because that's the discontinuity. And then when it hits a low index most of it passes until it hits the next high index region and it comes back.  But the regions are separated in such a way that the wavelength separation between the regions is one-half the wavelength of the light going down and so that causes what is called to-- that causes what is called constructive interference. So that light goes down and it constructively interferes such that the light ends up getting reflected back.  Now if I come along and I touch that pattern, even though I'm talking about ten thousand patterns, they're now spread over the width of my fingertip. So when I touch that pattern then I change the spacing when I change the spacing I change the resonance of the pattern relative to the wavelength that comes down.  So if I have red light coming down, 100 percent coming back and I touch it it drops down so you see a dip that's proportional to how much you touch.  So you turn it into a nerve. And so I made a wave meter that allows me to write as many as four thousand of those patterns in the length of about a meter of fiber that's a lot of patterns.  Way more sensitivity than the human body has, in terms of the length of discrimination within the human body.  Because there is an experiment they do where they take a pen, two pens and they put them side by side and then they spread them out. If they are spread out you can tell that it's two if you bring them closer, closer, closer you reach a point where you only think it's one pen.  And so that's what I was trying to do, I was trying to put these nerves close enough so that I could mimic the discrimination in terms of the human body.  But four thousand is way too many and I estimated some time ago that I would have to redo the calculation but I estimated that it takes about two hundred to make it similar to the human body and I can do as many as four thousand.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Story_ID: 27243
Speaker 1: How, how will these fiber optic nerves interact with human nerves?
Speaker 2: The way that you interface these two, and this is a discussion in my NIH [National Institute of Health] proposal, is that-- you take a trunk portion of the limb--
Speaker 1: [cough] You can go ahead.
Speaker 2: --and you put electrodes on the trunk and so when you get these light signals back you encode the signals according to wavelength by modulation.  So for example, let me say the red wavelength is modulated at forty hertz and the blue wavelength is modulated at sixty hertz and so the body feels two different modulations.  The way the human brain works to some extent, and I don't know a lot about this, it could map out over time, it can map out the difference between the forty hertz and it won't take that long forty hertz and sixty hertz or it may be forty kilohertz I don't think you can distinguish forty kilohertz but it can distinguish maybe four thousand hertz and six thousand hertz.
Speaker 1: So human nerves pick up the signal from the-
Speaker 2: --electr-
Speaker 1: --fiber optic nerves and processes it into the brain--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --just like it would a regular nerve.
Speaker 2: Just like it would in a regular nerve.  So the brain learns the mapping. And I always gave this example, and I'm not sure that it is a great example anymore, there is an experiment that was done way back probably in the eighteenth century, maybe even earlier, this is an experiment that you can do.  You can take a prism and you can put it on your glasses turns everything upside down and so what the brain is doing is it is processing the optical information coming into the optic nerve. So the way we seeing things on the back of the eye is actually upside down so our brain has flipped everything right side up.  So when you put these prisms on there it flips everything upside down. If you wait an hour, two hours or something everything get flipped right side up with the prism.  When you take the glasses off everything looks upside down.  So it's a huge amount of processing going on there, nowhere near the amount of processing you need to map this (arm out?).  So that was the idea. That's probably real crude and people in medicine say that's crazy but they don't say it's crazy anymore because that's exactly what they are trying to do.  They let the brain map it out, just like you go the rehabilitation, when you hit, when you are hurt like I hurt my arm I had to go to rehabilitation.  You go to a type of rehabilitation where you are learning the mapping of where these sensations are coming from because you are mapping modulations, electronic modulations with optical modulations and position.  So this wavemeter not only puts the nerves inside the fiber but it also says where the nerves are, it maps them out, so they have distinct locations and each location corresponds to a distinct wavelength.
Speaker 1: Now, when we discussed when people use the phrase "muscle memory," you know, they use that in terms of sports and other things where your body is used to doing something.  You practice doing something the body just does it, knows how to do it.
Speaker 2: That's a brain mapping function.
Speaker 1: That's what you are talking about basically?  It's able to map the fiber optic artificial nerves over time.
Speaker 2: Right.  Because I have them mechanically mapped this one down here is at location L1 but L1 corresponds to wavelength lambda 1. So I have them already mapped with the wave meter but that has to be that modulation that corresponds to L1 lambda 1 has to be mapped in the brain.  I can look at it that helps the visual part, the visual mapping for people that can see and for people who can't see they have to do total electronic mapping but both are possible.
Story_ID: 27244
Speaker 1: You couldn't get this, get this [artificial fiber optic nerves] funded by anybody?
Speaker 2: No, in fact I tried recently through a friend of ours in California at the California Health Network, he's a big guy.  He sent the idea in and they said, "We don't want to fund this; we want large teams of people working on this."  He says, "I can see why you didn't get funded Dr. Lyons, they don't believe this can be done except for some huge team of people to do it."  So the Vanderbilt Project has Vanderbilt [University, Nashville, Tennessee], it has Lockheed [Martin Corporation], it has I think one or two others working on it $5.2 million and what I suspect is going to happen, they probably will make some headway.  But $5.2 million won't go very far between Vanderbilt, Lockheed and several other people, so I don't know.  I wouldn't count them out but on the other hand it is still interesting to see a science that for me is fifteen, twenty years old now being this big thing.
Speaker 1: Nobody consults with you on this?  They haven't officially asked you--?
Speaker 2: No. No. They may know, they may know the work but nobody says a word.
Speaker 1: Your work has been published.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the patent is in the public domain and the stuff was written up in a local newspaper but I think the patent is probably more the big deal.  I will give you a copy of it.
Speaker 1: It's in the public domain now?
Speaker 2: The patent is yeah.  Anybody--you can go to Google and pull it right down.
Speaker 1: Don't--Isn't the life of a patent--I thought the life of a patent was longer than--?
Speaker 2: It's still patented, I still own the patent but it's still in the public domain which means if I'm a big company I can see that patent. Which means if I can engineer a patent and do it and if nobody complains-- see a patent is not worth--
Speaker 1: I see. You know this, it's a nickel unless somebody contests, you know.  And contesting a patent with a big company could take some resources. It may not, sometimes people would take it--a lawyer will take it on the basis that he is going to get paid, when it all comes out a clear cut case.
Speaker 2: Typically they say it takes a lot of suits--.
Speaker 1: It takes a lot of suits. It takes a lot. It's better to work with them than to fight them if you can.  Once again I was encouraged by a colleague who has some colleagues at Vanderbilt said well maybe you should go and give a talk.  This is just one of those things where I don't know whether to do it or not do it, I've burned so many times, you know.  I might get burned anyway.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Is the 2004 patent the first one that you did for this?
Speaker 1: At Hampton, 2004 is not the oldest patent.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The oldest one is what?
Speaker 1: Is I think 1989. 198-- I have them, I can print it off.
Speaker 2: Okay. There is a 2004 patent that I think took place when you were here?
Speaker 1: Oh when I was here, that's probably the earliest here.
Speaker 2: There are other patents too along the way.  So--.
Speaker 1: You know those patents cost me a lot of money.  Hampton didn't have a patent policy so I ended up having to pay. And each patent ran roughly around $10,000 each. So on top of paying for four children in college.  So even to this day some things have just been moth balled.  I gave them to a lawyer and they just had them all this time because I just couldn't afford it anymore.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So I mean, so now the fiber optic-- you've kind of, that's kind of on hold now.  You've done work that you say has been twenty years ahead of what people are doing now.
Speaker 1: About twenty years ahead.  It happens, I am sure this is not a new story, it happens.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We are going to pause.
Speaker 1: People say, "Well, how can you-" Okay you are telling me to stop?
Speaker 2: Go ahead and finish, finish it.
Speaker 1: "Well, how can you, how can you take that?" Because, you know, my ancestors had to take a lot more than this, this is a cakewalk.  When it gets hard, I'm making it hard but it's, but I can take it.
Speaker 2: You know the other side of that is this has happened to white people too, in some situations.
Speaker 1: It happened to a lot of people
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think of Philo T. Farnsworth and the television, there are a lot of stories like that.
Speaker 1: There are a lot of stories like that and it happens to other people.  And the fact that I said, our ancestors went through a lot more when we think of Jim Crow and then back up a few years later, my Mama was born in 1892 just out of slavery. Essentially.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It's less than three years from slavery.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 27245
Speaker 1: And the world will get better. Just got to go through some stuff though.
Speaker 2: In terms of the world getting better what about mentorship of students, I know you are involved in that.
Speaker 1: I've done a lot of that I mean to the point where it has just about worn me down.  I have mentored over seventy-five students and I have given more than in excess of a million dollars in terms of scholarships and support and stipends and stuff like that from my research grants.  It's one thing to do that and you have educational grants but this money came from research grants.  So I found ways to bring them into what I do in the laboratories and put them on projects and they go and give talks-- they have gone and given talks and so on and so forth and so it's been good.  And they have helped me a lot; I mean I couldn't do any, I couldn't have done any of this without the students because it is just not possible, it's not possible for one person to do everything.
Speaker 2: I don't want to get you in trouble but who are some of your students that--do you have any student stories you can share with us?
Speaker 1: Yeah I got one in particular and you are talking about somebody who is really good.  If you could possibly interview anybody, Dr. Erica Thompson, she is the hardest working student I have ever seen in my life.  She pushed other students to get their Ph.D., when they were about to give up she kept pushing.  I mean keeping them in the lab all night when they wanted to leave and go home.  But yeah, Dr. Thompson, she is one step below a fellow at Intel.  She left Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] and joined Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California] they wanted to hire her as faculty at Cal Tech and she also got an offer from Intel. And she took the Intel offer. But that's where she is.
Speaker 2: And she is just a step below what now?
Speaker 1: A fellow.  A fellow is like an emeritus.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She has a bunch of patents and all kinds of stuff at Intel.
Speaker 2: I don't want that to slip by because people don't necessarily know who are watching this what a fellow is.  If I was in high school watching this, I mean what does that mean to be a fellow at Intel?
Speaker 1: It's like tenure, it's like, you know, set for life that's the easiest way to put it.
Speaker 2: It's like freedom.
Speaker 1: It's like freedom.
Speaker 2: So you are free to create and do--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, just about anything that you can dream up.  But yeah she was really a--I would have to say and I hate to say this because I don't want to offend my other students but I would say she is a top student. And then--
Speaker 2: Does she remind you of yourself in terms of going ahead and reading ahead and doing--?
Speaker 1: She does, she does and that's a good point. She really does.  Because she would take classes that she didn't have to take.  You know, she got to the point where she would take classes at Hampton and they weren't good enough, they weren't taught by the best people who could have taught them.  And I encouraged her to take them at other places and she got into some trouble with the faculty about it but since I had money, I had more money than anybody. They couldn't touch her.  And then she ended up getting a NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] fellowship, there is a name for that fellowship and I've forgotten but it paid for the remainder of her grad school.  I think she started out without the fellowship in about two years in she got the NASA fellowship, it paid entirely for her grad school.
Speaker 2: Now where did she go to graduate school?
Speaker 1: She went to graduate school under me, she was my Ph.D. student and then she left and took her postdoc at Cal Tech.  They loved her at Cal Tech and they made her a job offer.  She got a job offer from Intel and she took the Intel offer.  They wanted her to stay on at Cal Tech.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, my mind keeps going to this being undergraduate, or something, and it's not.
Speaker 1: No, it's okay.
Speaker 2: You've got a Ph.D. program here at Hampton--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because it's something I think that Dr. Venable built it when he was here.  I know it but my mind keeps when I think of Hampton I keep thinking like bachelor's degree.
Speaker 1: But it [physics] is one of the few Ph.D. programs that we have, so it's actually very good.  It's very good that we have it, we need more.
Story_ID: 27246
Speaker 1: Now there are similar programs too with youth that you are involved in?
Speaker 2: There have-- there still are and I didn't mention this but this is something relatively important.  I work as adjunct faculty in engineering and physics so I teach more engineering course than I do physics course.  Initially when I came to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] I only taught graduate physics courses and then some years later they had me teaching undergraduate physics course.  But the ones I enjoy the most are the engineering courses because I teach, you know, microcontrollers and design engineering courses, those are my favorites.
Speaker 1: You basically function more as an applied physicist or engineer.
Speaker 2: Applied.  In fact that was supposed to be a negative point when I came to Hampton, some the faculty member said, "What you do is not really physics it's more like engineering."  I say you can call it anything you want they pay me the same.  The same thing happened at companies sometimes a company hires you and they call you a senior engineer even though you have a Ph.D. in physics, I don't care what they call me, what I care about is can I do something that has meaning, that has some kind of impact on people.  Now it turns out things have done an about face because we just had a colleague who is spending a year off and on out at Stanford [University, Stanford, California] working in the applied physics department.  The main things that they are working with are optical fibers and he says he knows absolutely nothing about optical fibers; whereas I have you know, thirty years of experience in optical fibers.  I mean I have done some things that have never been published.  I mean, I have techniques that I taught people that helped them to finish their Ph.D.s.  He asked me if I would work with him and I said, "Sure I'll work with you."  But when I first came to Hampton it was like, "Optical fibers, what's that? that's not physics." But it's a ton of physics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there a research project that you are working on now at Hampton?
Speaker 2: There is a new research project that is just starting today.  Today is my first official day of working for the summer.  It involves creating nanoparticles.  Boron nitride nanotubes.  It's a project for the air force, AFOSR, Air Force Office [of Scientific] Research, and it just starts today, officially the 20 [of May, 2013] is my first day of work.  So once, you know, when you guys finish up I will probably take a trip down to the campus.  It's not much to do we built a new laboratory out at the National Institute for Aerospace and I have to move equipment out there, small equipment.  So we are building a new lab out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's a Hampton project that you are working on out of the National Institute for Aerospace?
Speaker 2: There is a connection between the National Institute of Aerospace, NIA, and Hampton.  And that is that the provost at Hampton is the chairman of the board at NIA and the vice president for research Dr. Calvin Lowe was a former vice president for research at NIA.  So he actually is one of the people that is instrumental in designing the lab itself.  I mean, when I say the lab I'm talking about a very large building with a number of laboratories in it.  That's the connection.
Speaker 1: Okay it seems to be like the connection to the government projects is really essential for historically black colleges.
Speaker 2: Very essential.  My major funding has come from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], major funding.  And I complained about it for years and I said I am not going to complain about it again but I would have hoped that it had come through NASA local but it's actually come through Glenn [Research Center, Glenn, Ohio] where Julian Earl was, so major, major funding.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My hope is that, one of my hopes is that we continue to an increase in our intensity towards emphasizing education.  I don't want us to lose that, because that's the future.  I don't mean just regular education, like, education is one thing going and getting a degree because I have a lot of kids who say, "I just want a degree, I don't want to do any work to get it but I just want a degree," alright.  What happens is you can actually do that; you can do that at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  You can go to Harvard and party all the time and you can still graduate.  But you just join the league of all the rest of the idiots who do that and someday become president even and be an idiot, but, and I'll leave it at that.  But you could also go to these schools and you can get what really is there.  It's a life changing experience to get an education and gear that education toward bettering humanity itself.  And so I think that would be one thing that I would definitely encourage the community.  So that would be a hope that we grab a hold of that vision.  I also think that we should never leave our spiritual roots and not to emphasize that too much.  'Cause one of the things that we have lost in our families is that, I don't know who is raising our kids but we don't have any of the manners that we used to have.  I think some of it came through the church, some of it came through the community maybe the communities have kind of fragmented because of economics and all other kinds of things that we can't see and forces that are not of our own doing.  But in spite of whatever forces are around you there are things that don't have to change.  If you are in prison, even in prison they got books and they got libraries.  So you take advantage of what's around you and if you've made mistakes in life, you just get up, and you know, when you have fallen down, you just get back up, you try again.  And so even though part of my story is talking about this fantastic thing I thought was really going to make a difference to people and I have just kind of been pushed out of it.  That's not the end of the story because I'm dead yet, you know.  I may not ever accomplish it but somebody will and hopefully, you know, people will grab hold of the fact that you shouldn't give up; you shouldn't feel like the circumstances under which you were born will somehow be the determining factor in what you end up doing in life.

Speaker 1: What today do you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: My professional would be coming from poverty, I mean extreme poverty and getting an education at one of the best institutions in the country.  And being able to walk through the world of science and not let it jade me, you know, 'cause walking through it with the arrows and the bows and the slings being thrown at you and still, you can smile about it, you can laugh about it, and you can raise a family, and try to raise well-balanced kids and have a wife who doesn't hate to see you come home every day. So.
Speaker 1: You take it all in--
Speaker 2: Take it all in stride, I mean, that's a good thing to do.  Because, see, like I said, no story is ended until its ended. So who knows.
Story_ID: 27249
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done at this point is there anything major that you would do differently if you could go back?
Speaker 2: There are some things that I would do differently.  There are some turns that I took that I wouldn't take.  There are some new words that I didn't say that I would say.  There is more words that I would say that I didn't say than words that I did say that I wouldn't say.  If that makes sense.  I mean there were things that I would say to people and there were people who I would thank that I didn't, I didn't know to thank before it was too late.  And when I say thank, I mean I'm sure when people helped me I said thank you but it could have gone further than that because some people really put a, made a big difference.  Probably even no way I could have thanked them but I could have tried more than I did.  So that would be one thing, but as far as the tracks that I've taken, I believe in things being predetermined.  I think the thing that is not predetermined is the choices we make when we come to the crossroads.  Because everybody had a road we can either choose good or we can choose evil and we have that choice.  Nobody is making us make that choice, we have the choice.

Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your family.  Now, you have four children?
Speaker 2: Four children. Two sons, two daughters.  My youngest--let's start with the oldest.  The oldest son was the one who was born premature; he was born three and a half months early.  My wife and I were probably one of the happiest people, you know, when we met each other; we met on January 1, 1979.  I asked her to marry me on January 1, 1980.
Speaker 1: Now where were you--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: We were at Stanford [University, Stanford, California].
Speaker 1: At Stanford, okay.
Speaker 2: We were at Stanford it was right after Christmas break I came back to campus and I was in terrible shape because work, work, work.  I hadn't met anybody.  I think, in fact, I know I prayed and I said I wish I could meet somebody nice.  I bumped into her the same day I came back.  I left home early in fact because I didn't want to be around my mother [Ethel Bell Pearson] being depressed.  Because working all the time will you depress.  I didn't' know when I was going to graduate, I didn't know if my project was going to work and that kind of thing.  But anyway when I went back I met her because I was going off campus since things were closed to get a meal.  And I saw this girl walking and she had really long hair and she was wearing a coat and I couldn't tell, that she, you know, that she was African American and I looked back it didn't matter if she was or wasn't.  But what mattered was this girl walking back to campus alone and there was some things that had happened on campus and so I looked back to tell her that I would walk back.  I had my bicycle so I got off and I turned around and that's when I saw her and so we talked, walked and talked all the way back and I told her she should never walk back to campus after dark like that. You know.  Anyway ever since then, a year later I asked her to marry me and a year later we got married January 1, 1981 so two years after we met we got married.
Speaker 1: And what's her name?
Speaker 2: Theresa.
Speaker 1: Is she from California?
Speaker 2: She's from East St. Louis, Illinois.  Her father was the first black mayor of East Louis. James E. Williams first black mayor of East St. Louis.  He ran a campaign of walking from house to house to get people to vote for him.  And so my oldest was born shortly after we got married, and I say shortly but it was like, was it nine months, it wasn't nine months because I think she was, she became pregnant on our wedding night because she timed it exactly.  She had some type of incontinence, and she still does.  She had this and we didn't know it.  But she can't, once the baby gets so large it falls, her cervix is weak and so we had that with all our children.  But we didn't know it with the first one that she needed a cerclage and to stay on bed rest and he came early and he was in intensive care for three months.  And so that was devastating for young parents.  So he was, he came out of intensive care the time he was supposed to be born which was nine months later.  A little roughly around nine months after we got married. And that was our first and so we had a lot of issues dealing with him.  He didn't have any--you couldn't tell, you could tell that his learning was a little slow but he's gone to college, finished, you know, college and done, you know--so he is actually local and he basically works, you know, odd jobs.  He works, actually, at Burger King and Subway.  He wanted to be a politician so he went to school; I think he studied political science. You know, there aren't many politician jobs, but anyway. But he likes history a lot, so he knows a lot of history.  He talks very fast because of his disability and so unless you know him you would miss what he is saying.  And so I don't think he'd get a job in that. That's our first and he is now thirty one years old and we've been married thirty-two.  And then we have our oldest daughter who went to Stanford, Tonya.  She lives in California now. Her husband is a graduate student of UC Irvine [University of California at Irvine, Irvine, California]; his father is the chancellor of UC Irvine so her father-in-law is the chancellor there.  And then my youngest daughter, Kenya graduated from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] three years ago, I think three years ago, almost four.  She was at Johns Hopkins [Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland] up until-- she still is at Johns Hopkins actually, she's done something like a internship at Johns Hopkins and now she has been admitted to medical school, she's been admitted to [University of] Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], Yale and a number of other places and she got admitted to Stanford and she decided to go there.  She went to Yale undergrad, I guess she wanted to experience the west coast. She is going to Stanford in September.  And then my youngest son, James is the one that never came in but he is going to be a computer scientist, very smart.
Speaker 1: He's in high school now?
Speaker 2: He's in high school.  He makes 99 percentile on the standardized test.  He actually performed in school better than all the rest of them.  But they spent a lot of time with him when he was little.  Kind of like my brothers-- my older brothers and sisters did with me. And that, I think that had a lot to  do with it. And he probably will get into wherever he applies.
Story_ID: 27251
Speaker 1: Is there anything else we haven't covered or anything we need to mention or go into before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I wish I could think of something.  I, I don't know.  That's a lot of questions; we talked a long time even though I said I couldn't talk for three hours.  I can't think of anything right now.  But I would say the one thing I can think of because one of the things when they give you the forms they said put your mother, your father. I've actually had three mothers.  When I say three mothers because they had step mother down there but see mama [Trillie B. Jones] wasn't my stepmother.  My mama helped raise my father she had her own family and her own children and everything but she was sixty so all of her own children were grown, grown and had their own families.  But she wanted to have a child around so I was that child.  And my parents permitted it and it was really good for me, it was a blessing because what happened as a result of that was that I had a place to study, quiet, you know, support.  If I got sick, just the fact that she was just watching over me all the time.  I mean, I feel now, even now, I tell my children that the prayers that she prayed over me are still taking me through, and I believe that.  So I have done and do the same thing over my children.  So she was my second mother and then I had mommy who was my third mother.
Speaker 1: That's her daughter?
Speaker 2: That's her daughter who also gave me a place because she lived in town and after awhile I was spending so much time doing chemistry and physics and math and I was staying up all night and mommy had a nice library and so I would just stay in that library all night.
Speaker 1: She was the school teacher.
Speaker 2: She was the school teacher and when I graduated from Stanford [University, Stanford, California] she had the diploma, she had everything.  Because by that time mama was pretty old and she had gotten I don't want to say senile but she had started not remembering.  She remembered me but she had started forgetting a lot.  And also my own mother [Ethel Bell Pearson] dead by that time, when I went to Stanford when I got off the plane my third living mother met me and that's Virgie Rentie, who is in California, I mean I got a thousand pictures with Virgie.  And my children when they were little and my wife when we got tired of being on campus we would go stay at her house.  She was just like a mother to me and to this day I can call her up on Face Time and you know, she was just, just like a mother.  My mommy put me on a plane to go to California she cried when I got on that plane and I got there and Virgie was there, made all the difference in the world.
Speaker 1: Was that a friend of hers?
Speaker 2: Just-- they were classmates. They were classmates.  Both of them graduated from Webster High School [Minden, Louisiana], both of them went to, attended Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  But-- they were classmates.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So mother's day has significance for you that it doesn't have for a lot of people, spans four people.
Speaker 2: The people say how could you have been raised by three--in fact people say you were half-raised; I raised all my children.  But you don't understand the richness of having three positive personalities to help you, you know, and to watch over you.  'Cause in California if I ever got in trouble which I didn't but if I ever got stuck somewhere or if I ever got so down doing all that work, 'cause it was a ton of work to get through Stanford.  I would just go to Virgie; it was like I was on a different planet, a different world, relaxed, she just had a way of making people very comfortable around her.  And it did the same thing for my wife. If my wife and I were fussing before we went up to Virgie's house we got there and everything was perfect, calmed down. She was like a mother to us.  When we went to Louisiana to visit my family, Virgie flew to Louisiana, we all flew together.  Or we would meet up down there and then we would come back to California.  I didn't say that in the video before, but, you know, you don't forget the people who played a major influence in your life.
Story_ID: 27252
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Hopefully as a good father, first, as a good husband and father I should say first because my wife would get me if I say it the other way.  And as a human being, as a good human being, somebody who tried to make life better for everybody else, who had any kind of contact with.  So, that's enough. I mean, people worry about whether we go to heaven or hell but we have one purpose in life as human beings and that's to serve.  And if we serve humanity the way we are supposed to it means you leave it in a better shape than it was when you started out, when you came in.  So.  That's enough, that's more than enough.  If I could do any of that I think I'm doing pretty good.

Speaker 1: Ok, I'm guessing this photograph is in elementary school, in fact I don't have to guess too hard, I'm sure it is  That was me probably at age seven, I'm guessing.  And that one is probably at--it looks even earlier than the previous one.  So it may have been as early as first grade.
Speaker 2: [OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 1: Describe the photo.
Speaker 2: Okay the small photo is a picture of my father, Pat [Patrick] Lyons and he's in his, in that picture I believe he is probably in his late--probably his early 70s, mid to early 70s, something like that.
Speaker 1: And the large picture.
Speaker 2: The large picture is my Mama.  They called her big mama she is no blood relative of mine but she also was a very close friend of my grandmothers so she helped my grandmother with her children.  And she helped, my grandmother helped her with her children so my father would have been one of those children.
Speaker 1: Can you give her real name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Trillie B. Jones that's T-R-I-L-L-I-E Jones and in that picture--
Speaker 1: [OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 2: And in that picture I'm guessing she is about eighty five.  This picture is from the 'Virginia Business Observer' and it's one of the articles that was written on the fiber optic research laboratory at Hampton University that I built.  It's talking about me.  The title is 'Fiscal Physics' and they are talking about me in terms of writing research grants.  It kind of places me as being one of the regions big technology players in terms of new technology and grantsmanship.  This one is an article from the 'Dailey Press' the dates on that are written in my bio.  But the 'Dailey Press' article is on a system that I created for creating artificial nerves for prosthetic limbs for human beings and so in the picture you can see wave lengths, Lambda 1, Lambda 2, Lambda 3 written down and what those are is those are regions along the arm where if a person touches the region in red, blue and green then the arm will respond by sending different signatures from those regions to let the person know how hard the press was on the region and what location it is.  This is a photograph of my father, Pat Lyons, his whole name is Patrick Donald Lyons Jr.,  It looks like it is a photograph from maybe 1930s, 1940s probably 1930s.  And this is a picture of my mother who I believe at the time was in her mid 40s.  She died in, she died at age forty-eight in 1971 and so this the only picture I have of her.
Speaker 1: Her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Ethel B. Lyons.
