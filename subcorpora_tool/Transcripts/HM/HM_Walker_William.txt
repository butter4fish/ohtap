Speaker 1: Your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born on December 13th, 1933 in a town in Arkansas named Pine Bluff.  Pine Bluff, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Currently I am the founder and principal of the Sonny Walker Group, which is a strategic planning consulting firm dealing with a number of arenas: political, campaign management, fundraising, and dealing with the enhancement of workforce, the workforce and persons in the workforce.

Speaker 1: No, we're fine.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Probably so.  I love crimson.  And, of course, cream goes with the crimson.
Speaker 1: What about a favorite food.  What do you like to eat?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I love seafood.  And I think it tends to digest well where I am concerned.  I have a tremendous love for green vegetables, but because it is Vitamin K, and I have to be careful about the blood flow, I have to use it and eat it with caution.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a number of years where I was assigned by the United States state department [U.S. Department of State] to the West Indies, and I have certainly loved going to those areas, like Jamaica.  I love Port of Spain [Trinidad and Tobago].  Those are areas that I'm fascinated by--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I've been able to share some of the civil rights arena with people in that area who are quite interested in it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: West Indies, I love very much.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: You know I like it when I don't need heat and I don't need air.  That's my favorite, when the artificial infusion is not as vital or as necessary and when we just depend on and rely on what the Maker provides.  Those are my favorite times of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay. And do you have a favorite phrase?
Speaker 2: I, I do.  And it's the final stage or phrase of 'Invictus' [William Ernest Henley], and it goes something like this.  "Out of the night that covers me / Black as the pit from pole to pole / I thank whatever gods might be / For my unconquerable soul."  That's my favorite.
Story_ID: 641937
Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about your, your family.  And I want to start on your father's side.  Tell me your father's name, when and where he was born.
Speaker 2: My father was James David Walker [James Walker, Sr.].  He later on became Reverend James David Walker.  He was born in a town called Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  He was the son of a woman named Mary Blackwell [sic. Annie Blackwell (ph.)].  And his dad was a man named J.O. Walker [ph.].  They were not married, but those were my grandparents.  But James David Walker was my dad (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year was he born?
Speaker 2: Dad would have been born in 1913, 1913.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did your father share any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: My dad shared many, many stories about growing up.  Much of it was biblical, and he tried to compare and link the biblical with the secular.  He used to teach me about the talents that we were given by God, and he linked those with the senses that men talk about.  Dad told me that if you want to have a good relationship with a lady that you've got to be sensitive to the senses.  He says, "She spends lots of money to make her skin soft, so you've got to tell her that she feels and looks good.  She certainly works to get a fragrance that's consistent with her body chemistry, so you need to tell her you really, really smell good.  They go out of their way to look good to see that people are looking at them, and so you've got to reinforce the fact that they are succeeding."  And that was really what my dad taught me.  He said, "It's important that we, especially African American men, show our absolute admiration for and appreciation for African American women."  And you use God's talents that He gave us to reinforce that.
Speaker 1: Do you know much about your father's education?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): If you don't mind turning just a little bit.
Speaker 1: I know quite a bit about my father's education, because many of the teachers that I had in school taught my father.  My father went to Missouri Street School [Pine Bluff, Arkansas] as an elementary student.  I went to Missouri Street.  My father went to Merrill High School [Pine Bluff, Arkansas], both in junior high and senior high.  They didn't call it middle school then.  When you went to the seventh grade, you were considered to be in junior high--seventh, eighth, and ninth.  And then when you were promoted to the tenth grade, you were in senior high school.  My dad went to Merrill High School and graduated from Merrill High School.  I went to Merrill High School.  And again, many of the teachers: Mr. Palmer [ph.], Ms. Myrtle Jones, a whole--Mr. Chaney [R.N. Chaney]--a whole array of individuals that had influenced my dad and helped in the development of dad, came on to me, which meant that I could get away with nothing, because they compared me with my dad.  And if I didn't do what they thought I should do, they would tell my dad.  So, yes, I knew a little bit about--and a good deal about his schooling and how well he did, and especially as I was compared to him.
Speaker 2: Well, tell me how well he did.
Speaker 1: My dad was a tremendous scholar, and I was always reaching, trying to at least be equal to my dad.  I'm not sure I made it, because he thought, for example, that I should be valedictorian of my class, and I ranked a low five, fifth, in the class.  I wasn't valedictorian, I wasn't salutatorian.  I did graduate with honors, and I told my dad, "Dad, they have, they have smarter people now than they did when you were there.  That's why you, that's why you're disappointed in the fact that I'm not the valedictorian."  This is what I said to him.
Story_ID: 641938
Speaker 1: After your father left high school, what occupation was he in?
Speaker 2: My dad first went into insurance, and became, for more than forty years, an insurance agent [for the Universal Life Insurance Company].  He was the kind of agent that would go by and collect fifteen cents or a quarter every week.  And people had their policy and payment schedule kind of behind the door.  And Dad used to share with me little stories that he'd encounter when he'd go collect.  He said many times the kids would come to the door and say, "Mr. Walker [James Walker, Sr.], mama say she ain't here." (Laughter) So if they didn't have money to pay for the policy that was due at that time, they had ways of avoiding, and Dad used to tell me those stories.  I used to call, go with him on a Wednesday night and help him call on the accounts, and that's how I kind of became acclimated to mathematics and to calculations and insurance.  But my dad was involved in that.  He later became a minister.  He decided to go into the ministry, and in addition to pastoring several wonderful churches, my dad became the moderator of the association.  I used to ask my daddy, because I was fascinated by bishops in the A.M.E. church [African Methodist Episcopal], and I said, "Daddy, why aren't you a bishop?"  And he said, "Because I'm not an A.M.E., but I am the moderator, and the moderator has just as much authority as the bishop."  So I started, stopped questioning my dad about why he wasn't a bishop, because he considered himself to be in charge, although he was a Baptist.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. When your father was growing up, did he live in the city, or did he live on a farm or in the country?
Speaker 2: Well, Pine Bluff, which is in Jefferson County in Arkansas, was a very small town.  When my dad was growing up, I suggest that the population was about twenty thousand.  When I became aware of population figures, Pine Bluff had a population of about thirty-eight thousand.  It was always the third or fourth largest city in the state behind towns like Little Rock [Arkansas], North Little Rock [Arkansas], and Fort Smith [Arkansas].  But Pine Bluff was also known for having a high percentage of African Americans living in the community, and especially African American professionals.  And a reason for that is that the one state assisted, or state supported black school, HBCU, was in Pine Bluff at that time.  And my dad had gone to school there as well.  As a matter of fact, my dad was the classmate of the person who was president when I went to the school, a man named Dr. Lawrence Davis [Lawrence A. Davis, Sr.].  But that school was located in Pine Bluff.
Speaker 1: What school?  What's the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Arkansas AM&N--Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  Now, I don't know what the normal stood for, but it is now part of the university system, and it, the name currently is the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.  And again, it's one of the 106 HBCUs in the country--historically black colleges and universities.  It's one of those.
Speaker 1: So, after your father--well, no, we didn't answer the question.  Did he live in the city, or did he live on a farm?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess we thought of it as a city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because there were a number of rural areas adjacent to it--places like Grady [Arkansas] and Gould [Arkansas], and Wabbaseka [Arkansas] and Altheimer [Arkansas], but Pine Bluff was where folks went to shop.  So, Pine Bluff was considered the city.  And, again, it was where black professionals were: doctors, lawyers, dentists, people of that nature.  So, I would have to say it was in the city.  It was not rural to a great extent, but it was within reach of the rural.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when your father became a minister, what church did he pastor?
Speaker 2: My dad pastored a number of churches--Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church [Pine Bluff, Arkansas], and then St. Olive Missionary Baptist Church.  And he was interim pastor of the church that I was baptized in, called St. Paul Baptist Church [St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  Those were some of the churches that he had active involvement with, and was either long term or interim minister.
Story_ID: 641939
Speaker 1: Now let's talk a little bit about your grandparents.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You've told us that they were not married.  Did you have a relationship with both or either of them?
Speaker 2: I had a strong relationship with my grandmother, who was my dad's mother.  I did not have very much of a relationship at all with his father [J.O. Walker (ph.)].  As I said, they were not married.  I don't believe that his father had an awful lot to do with his growing up or his nourishment or development.  And so it kind of flowed to my grandmother.  Her name was Mrs. Annie Blackwell [ph.], and what a marvelous lady, a business lady.  She sold cosmetics, and what a marvelous businessperson.  She also took in washing and ironing.  And I got my first little red wagon because I helped my grandmother take Ms. Peck [ph.] her clothes.  Once she washed them and ironed them, we took Ms. Peck her clothes.  And Ms. Peck was a marvelous lady.  She wanted me to have nice things.  And she had a grandson who had very small feet, but anytime he stopped wearing shoes, she thought that I ought to have those shoes.  They were mostly too small, but Ms. Peck wanted me to wear those shoes.  And Grandma Rachel--I mean my grandmamma, is Annie Blackwell.  Whenever we'd go take the clothes, she'd say, "Put the shoes on."  (Laughter) So, I had to put my feet--they were too large for the shoes, in those shoes.   But it made my grandmother happy and it made Miss Peck happy that I was wearing those shoes, but I couldn't wait to get back home and take those shoes off.
Speaker 1: What else do you remember about time spent with your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Well, again, she was somebody who believed in business.  And I think if I have an appreciation for the culture of business, it really came from my grandmamma, Mrs. Annie Blackwell.  She had another son, and his name was L.C. Ross [Levi C. Ross], and his father was a Mr. Ross [ph.].  So the two sons that she had, had different fathers, but she loved them both.  And my Uncle L.C., whom I have part of his name--as a matter of fact I don't share this with many folks, but my name is William Levi, and my mother's brother was named William [William Coleman (ph.)].  And my father's brother was named Levi, and they called him L.C.  And my name is William Levi Walker [HistoryMaker William "Sonny" Walker].  That's why I say Sonny, because I did not really like the Levi, and so I grew up with that.  He was quite a musician, though.  He played the saxophone, he played drums, he played the trumpet.  He was quite a musician.  And I didn't have a lot of contact with my mother's [Mary Coleman] family until I grew a little older, because she and my father [James Walker, Sr.] had divorced, and she moved to be near her family members in Chicago [Illinois].  And so in the summer months, I had an opportunity to visit relatives on my mother's side.
Story_ID: 641940
Speaker 1: Is there any other information about your father's [James Walker, Sr.] side of the family that you want to share?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There is a young lady that I will love until I am expired, and she was my grandmother's mother, and her name was Grandma Rachel.  Grandma Rachel had a husband whose name was Dummy.  Well, his name was Richard, but she called him Dummy.  And because Dummy was not able to talk--Dummy could not hear, Dummy had very little sight, but she could communicate with him.  She knew when he was ready to eat, she knew when he was ready to go and be alone by himself for a while, or when he just wanted to take a walk.  I'd never seen anybody that had the capacity to communicate so effectively with someone who was not able to speak, could not hear and had very limited vision.  But Grandma Rachel took in washing and ironing and she taught me how to build a fire around the pot.  And you build the fire around the pot and you put the clothes in there and let them boil.  And then you would take them out and put them in the various tubs.  You had number one, number two, number three.  You had the washtub with the washboard, and then you would put it in some rinsing water, clear water, to rinse some of the soap and detergent out of it, and then you had another tub with the bluing in it.  And you'd take that out of the rinse water and put it in there with the bluing.  I don't know what the bluing did.  And then, of course, you would iron them.  And ironing in those times was unique, because you had charcoal, and you'd put the iron in charcoal.  And you had to go out and get cedar off the tree so that you could get the charcoal off the iron before you iron those beautiful white shirts with it, after starching them, of course.  But, that's the environment in which I grew up.  It was about work, it was about productivity, it was about reality.  And so, yes, I remember vividly Grandma Rachel and her husband, Dummy.
Speaker 1: And tell me again what his real name was?
Speaker 2: Richard Collins.  His name was Richard Collins.
Speaker 1: And so she was Rachel Collins?
Speaker 2: And she was Rachel Collins.
Story_ID: 641941
Speaker 1: Is there a story about him, and how she and he got together?
Speaker 2: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, was he always that way?  Was he always--
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: --handicapped?
Speaker 2: I think he was someone that kind of grew up in the family, you know.  This was kind of post-slavery, and I think he was probably a person whose parents or grandparents had been slaves.  And she had some of the same heritage, and they probably started talking and decided to get married.  And my grandmother--[paternal] great-grandmother--had two sisters, and they lived--each house was next to each other.  They had three homes.  Grandma Rachel [Rachel Collins] lived on the corner, Aunt Edith [ph.] lived in the middle, and Aunt Fannie [ph.] lived in the next house.  And there was an interesting relationship between Grandma Rachel and Aunt Fannie.  Aunt Fannie was considered to have some mental shortages.  In other words, in those days they called them crazy.  And Aunt Fannie did not like the lady that lived across the street from her.  Her name was Ms. Banks [ph.].  And she told--although she was upset with Ms. Banks, she didn't go across the street.  She walked down to her sister's house, Grandma Rachel, and said, "Rachel?"  She said, "What, Fannie?"  She said, "I'm going to go over to Ms. Fannie's house and give her a piece of my mind."  She said, "What, Fannie?"  She said, "I'm going over to--I'm upset with Ms. Banks, and I'm going to give her a piece of my mind."  And she said, "Don't do that, Fannie, don't do that."  And she said, "Why come?"  She said, "Because Fannie, you ain't got enough mind to give nobody." (Laughter) So that was logic and wisdom, and again, I learned from that, that you've got to have an awful lot of mind to give somebody a piece of it.  So those are some of the things I remembered about that extended family that I was privileged to grow up in--Uncle L.C. [Levi C. Ross] and his music; my dad's brother, his mother [Annie Blackwell (ph.)]; the lady who sold the cosmetics and who always had money who always believed in work, doing the clothes for the folks who had the resources; her mother, Grandma Rachel and her husband Mr. Richard Collins, Dummy; then Aunt Edith who was the lady that always went to prayer meeting; and Aunt Fannie who was trying to give somebody a piece of her mind (laughter).  That's what I recall so very much.
Speaker 1: Do you know whether your family, whether they owned the property that they lived on?
Speaker 2: They owned the property.  Their father had started the sand and gravel company in the City of Pine Bluff [Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Whose father?
Speaker 2: The father of those three daughters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Aunt Edith, Aunt Fannie, and Grandma Rachel.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Mr. Alf Williams [ph.], and he had resources and he acquired property.  And when he was getting ready to expire--I guess he anticipated that he wasn't going to live forever--and he gave all of his daughters a piece of property and a home, and built a home on it.  So they all had their individual homes as a result of their father conveying it to them.
Speaker 1: So their father, was he a slave?
Speaker 2: He was not a slave.  But he was certainly--I think his parents had to have been slaves, so their grandparents were slaves, because she would make up songs about slavery. And--
Speaker 1: When you say she, who--?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, my great-grandmother, Rachel (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Grandmother, Rachel, okay.
Speaker 2: She had little songs.  One of them I will always remember.  She'd sing it to me.  She said she used to sing it to the folks as she was distancing herself, and she was talking about white people.  And she'd say (singing), "Sorry, sorry to leave you.  Sorry, sorry to my heart.  Sorry, sorry, to leave you, but the best of friends have to part."  That was her favorite song, and she would sing it to me and sometimes when I was going off, she would sing that same song.  "Sonny Boy, I'm sorry, sorry to leave you.  Sorry, sorry to my heart.  Sorry, sorry to leave you, but the best of friends have to part."  I'll never forget that lady.  She gave me my name.  She called me Sonny Boy, and as I got older, I didn't want to be called a boy, and so I called myself Sonny [HistoryMaker William "Sonny" Walker].  But that came from Grandma Rachel, from her label of Sonny Boy.
Story_ID: 641942
Speaker 1: Talk to me a little bit more about Mr. Williams [Alf Williams (ph.)], your [paternal] great-grandmother's father, and the sand and gravel company.
Speaker 2: Well, he was a very hard working man.  He knew how to use the horse and the wagon to get things done, to plow.  So he did some light farming to the extent that he could, where he lived.  But he hauled the sand and the gravel to construction sites, and, but he was not able to compute figures.  He could not read or write or compute, and so he had to depend on others, including whites that he did business with to do that for him.  And in doing so, most of his earnings and most of his savings were stripped from him.  But they did allow him to have enough resources that he could leave property and a home to his three daughters.  That was something he insisted on, and that was granted.
Speaker 1: Do you know who his wife was?
Speaker 2: He married a lady named Ms. Susie [ph.].  And I got to see Ms. Susie because she lived beyond his years.  And she lived in a house facing 15th Street [15th Avenue, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  My great-grandmother [Rachel Collins] and her sisters had a home facing 16th Street [16th Avenue], but back to back was the home that my great-great-grandfather lived in with his wife, Miss Susie.  And so I got an opportunity to get to meet her, although he was passed on when I was born.  So, I never had an opportunity to meet him.  But I did know Miss Susie, but I didn't know the mother of his children.  I never, she had passed on, I think, before he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Miss Susie was his second wife.
Story_ID: 641943
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother.  Tell me her name and where and when she was born.
Speaker 2: My mother was born about 1915, and she was born in Shaw, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Mary Coleman, Mary Coleman.  She was a Coleman.  And she had several sisters--Annie Mae [Annie Mae Cook], Ardella [ph.] were her sisters, and she had a brother named Bill.  Annie Mae was the mother of about six children.  One of those children was a noted singer named Sam Cooke.  She married a Reverend Cook, Reverend Charles Cook, and they had about three or four daughters and also sons.  Charles, Jr. [Charles Cook, Jr.] died just months ago.  She had another son named L.C. [L.C. Cooke] who wrote Sam's first hit, called 'You Send Me.'  And then the younger son was David [David Cook].  And I became very close to them as I grew older, because I would spend my summers in the Chicago [Illinois] area with my mother's side of the family, but I hadn't really known them a great deal.  And she had an uncle named Uncle Nehemiah [ph.] that worked in the dining car.  He was a dining car porter, and I got a chance to see him because he would come to Arkansas on occasions, and he would always look in on me.  But I was very fond of the entire Cook family.  Aunt Annie Mae, and then Aunt Ardella, and her daughter Gerri [ph.] lived in Ohio in a small town called Newark, near Columbus [Ohio], and I would have an opportunity to visit them as I would move around.  I would go anywhere the bus would go.  I would get on the bus and go see my relatives.  I wanted to know my family and I got a chance to do that in many instances during the summer months when school was out.  Dad [James Walker, Sr.] would let me go.
Speaker 1: And there was a brother also.  Bill?
Speaker 2: No, I had no brothers.
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking about--
Speaker 2: Oh, she ha- her brother.
Speaker 1: Her brother, Bill.
Speaker 2: The one I was named for, William [William Coleman (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Right, William.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bill, yeah.  And he worked for a company on Cottage Grove [Avenue] in Chicago.  He worked at a poultry place where they would process chickens.  And this man knew how to cut up chickens, and I'd go to Uncle Bill's job and watch him sell those chickens.  And he was quite a guy.  And I liked that part of the name, because William was a good name.  But my dad's brother, L.C., his first name was Levi, Levi Clifton Ross [Levi C. Ross], and they named me William Levi (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did not like the Levi, so I captured the name Sonny, [HistoryMaker] William "Sonny" Walker (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did your--
Story_ID: 641944
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did your mother [Mary Coleman] talk to you about her growing up in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: She did.  She talked with me about that, and she talked to me about the early years with my dad [James Walker, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, she always wanted to go to the city, because most of her relatives--her sisters and her brother [William Coleman (ph.)] had left and gone to the city, gone north, let me put it that way.  And my dad wanted to stay in the South.  He wanted to stay near his relatives, and so they had a difference there.  And so she decided that he would probably be the better parent for rearing me, and she made me know.  She said, "I did not abandon you because I didn't love you.  I left you there because I did love you.  And I figured your dad and his mom [Annie Blackwell (ph.)] and his family would do a better job of providing the family situation.  At that time, I didn't have the stability, so I went on to Chicago [Illinois] to be near my relatives where I could get a job, and hopefully send you some resources."  And Mom did.  She would write me occasion, send me Christmas gifts and Christmas presents, and tried to stay in touch with me.  But I was in junior high school [Merrill High School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] before I ever really met her.  I had received letters, but I had not had the opportunity to truly get to know her, until one day, she and her husband, Mr. Ford [ph.], came.  And they called me at school and said, "Come home immediately, you need to come home."  And I used to ride bicycle to school.  And so I got on my bicycle and I rode home and I saw this car in front of the house with an Illinois tag on it.  And I said, "What in the world is this--Illinois?"  I dropped my bicycle and I ran in the house and I saw four people there, two of whom, of course, I knew--my father and my stepmother, Mama Nettie [Nettie Harris Walker].   And the other two, I did not know.  That happened to be my mother and her husband, Mr. Ford.  And so Dad said, "Do you know this lady?"  And I said, "No sir."  He said, "Look at her, now."  So, I looked at her.  He said, "You know her?"  I said, "No sir."  He said, "That's your mother."  And, Lord have mercy.  I grabbed her, she grabbed me and I just, what a marvelous event, to get to know and meet your mom, and know her for the very first time.  That's how I met my mama.
Speaker 1: How old were you when she left?
Speaker 2: I must have been eighteen months, two years or something.  I was very small, very small.  Less than two years old.
Speaker 1: Did you have any feelings about her not being there?
Speaker 2: Oh, I always wanted--you know, I'd go to school with kids and in the neighborhood with kids who had a mama and a daddy.  And I guess for a while I felt kind of sorry for myself until Mama Nettie came into my life.  And Mama Nettie was Daddy's new wife.
Story_ID: 641945
Speaker 1: How old were you when your father [James Walker, Sr.] married?
Speaker 2: Five.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was five years old.  So Mama Nettie [Nettie Harris Walker] raised me from a baby.
Speaker 1: Tell me about her, and your relationship with her (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was born in St. Joe, Missouri [St. Joseph, Missouri], and her name was Nettie Harris, and she was a practical nurse.  And I don't know how my dad met her, but she was a marvelous woman and she did not take any crap from me.  I used to tell her, "You ain't my mama."  She said, "But I'm all you got." So (laughter) I reflect on it today, and I used to tell her, I'd say, "I'm going to run away."  And she'd say, "Go ahead and run.  You'll be running away from more than you're running to."  She was a classic.  She had those kind of sayings.  But Mama Nettie was a marvelous lady, and she cared about me, she loved me, she cooked the meals, she made me do my homework, clean up my room.  She made me get my schoolwork at night, the work that I, assignments that I got from school.  She was a mom, she was a real mom.  And I didn't realize what it was then, but as I grew older I knew that it was love, that she not only loved my dad, she loved my dad's son, and she gave me plenty of love.  I always had to sit and eat after blessings.  You did not eat without doing the blessings in my home.  Sometimes on Sunday the prayer over the food was a little extensive.  Daddy used to do it so long, sometimes the food had gotten a little cold (laughter) after he got through.  But my family folks believed in prayer.  They believed in God, and they believed in blessings.  And so I grew up in that environment.
Speaker 1: Did your father go to a seminary?
Speaker 2: He did.  He went to a seminary in Chicago [Illinois].  I cannot recall the name of the school, but he would talk about it all the time, going to Chicago to seminary--the bible college, they called it, the bible college.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But he also went to college in the hometown school that I went to as an undergrad [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Do you know what school Mama Nettie went to?
Speaker 2: Ah, Mama Nettie went to a special school to train to be a practical nurse.  I'm not sure of the name of the school that she went to, but Mama Nettie had dropped out of high school very early.  Her father was a farmer, and so she dropped out of school to help with the farm.  But later on, the opportunity presented itself for her to go to school to become a practical nurse.  She didn't have the educational background to be a registered nurse, but she was a practical nurse, and that was her occupation.
Speaker 1: Do you know where she worked?
Speaker 2: Well, she tended to work around hospitals or with families.  Now, one of the families that my mom worked for, for a long time were the Ford dealers [Ford Motor Company] in Pine Bluff [Arkansas], the Trotters, and she helped to rear the Trotter children.  She not only did the practical nurse work, but she did the cleaning.  She did the food service, or food preparation.  They were just--she was like a mother to them.  As a matter of fact, I still hear from the Trotter children.  They say, "We really miss Mama Nettie."  They called her Mama Nettie, too.  And these were white kids, of course.  But she was part of their life and part of their family, just as she was with mine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She had that talent.
Story_ID: 641946
Speaker 1: So, you were an only child?
Speaker 2: I was the only child that I was aware of growing up.  Now, when my father [James Walker, Sr.] became very ill, shortly before his death, he chose to introduce me to a young lady whose name is Gloria.  And Gloria, he said, "This is your sister."  Gloria was born to a lady that had kept me when my dad would go on the insurance route [for the Universal Life Insurance Company] and I had to be kept by somebody.  Mama Nettie [Walker's stepmother, Nettie Harris Walker] was working and so my dad had a second child, named Gloria, and Gloria and I still communicate today.  But I did not meet her until shortly before my father's death.
Speaker 1: Was she named Williams, or something else?
Speaker 2: No, Gloria Epperson [ph.].  She was not a Williams, she was an Epperson.  She kept her mother's name.
Story_ID: 641947
Speaker 1: When you think about that time when you're five through elementary school, and you think of a sound, a sight, or a smell, what takes you back to that time?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, most of the smell was from the kitchen.  Now, Mama Nettie [Walker's stepmother, Nettie Harris Walker] was one tremendous cook.  You know, today I like fried pies.  I love fried pies.  And I go to a place in Atlanta [Georgia] called the Varsity, trying to get fried pies who are good as my mama's, Mama Nettie's, fried pies were.  But they can't touch them.  She knew how to take that, those dried peaches and apples and make fried pies that would just make you salivate at the mouth, and I remember that so very, very well.  And as far as the sound, Mama Nettie used to try to sing (laughter).  Now, she didn't have the greatest voice in the world, but she sure liked them Christian biblical songs, you know.  She loved to try to raise a hymn.  They, in that church, you know, you would have the deacons, they would say the words to the--they call it lining a hymn, and they'd say the words, and then you would come up behind them and try to sing what they said.  And Mama Nettie used to do that back home, and I used to try to chime in as she would line the hymn and repeat what she said.  But that's again, the kind of environment that--.  And then, again, the other sound that I would hear was if she and Daddy [James Walker, Sr.] disagreed on something, and especially about me.  My daddy was a disciplinarian.  Daddy used to give me pretty solid whippings when I didn't do right, and Mama Nettie thought he was hitting me too hard.  And I never will forget, I used to hear them in there debating over how hard I should be hit.  And Daddy said, "I got to teach him a lesson."  She said, "Well, don't teach him a lesson that makes him think that you don't care about him."  And so, I used to love Mama Nettie, because you know, speaking up for me, and getting on Daddy because he was hitting me too hard, you know.  But those were great days.
Speaker 1: What about a sight, something that you would see there?
Speaker 2: Well, I always liked the sight of cleanliness.  Mama Nettie was a very neat, clean woman.  And if I would go to the home of a neighbor or one of my friends and the house wasn't clean--if the bed was not made up, if the floors had not been cleaned up, if the grass had not been cut out front, I just thought it was the worse thing in the world.  Because Mama Nettie believed that you had to be neat, and you had to be clean.  And so, for me, that's what looking meant.  And looking also meant that you dressed properly when you went out, especially when you'd go to church.  That's when you saved your best.  You had your shoes shined, you had your hair fixed up, and everything was in order.  And so, that's what I got accustomed to looking at.  And I just thought you ought to look good, you ought to smell good, and you ought to sound good, and all those things.  And again, going back to my daddy's senses and the Lord's talents that he gave us.  The Lord gives you that, you need to preserve it.  You need to value what the Lord has given you, and take good care of it.

Speaker 1: Let's go on to your elementary school days.  And, do you walk to school?
Speaker 2: I did, I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about--
Speaker 2: I went to two elementary schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about the first one, but as you're telling me about the school, tell me about the neighborhood in which you lived--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and who lives around in your area--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and, as you walked to school.
Speaker 2: Well, let me just say that growing up as a small child, my daddy [James Walker, Sr.] was asserting himself to be independent, so he rented a room on the west side of town from a lady called Ms. Butts, Ms. Frieda Butts [ph.].  Ms. Butts had a big home, and she was a widow.  And so, in order to gain income, she rented to families.  And so Daddy rented a room from Miss Butts, and that was in the neighborhood of a school called Greenville.  I never will forget.  My address was 2402 West 10th [Avenue].  And Greenville was just across the railroad track from us.  And the principal was Mrs. Douglas [ph.], she was my first principal.  And I did my first grade there and I had been promoted to the second grade when my daddy and Miss Butts fell out, and we had to move back to the east side of town.  And when we moved to the east side of town, I went to Missouri Street School [Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  It was also one to six, or one through six.  The principal of Missouri Street was Mr. Douglas [ph.].  Mr. Douglas was the husband of Mrs. Douglas.  So, I went from one Douglas to another, from Greenville Elementary School [Pine Bluff, Arkansas] to Missouri Street.  Missouri Street was on Missouri Street, and I lived one block from Missouri on Virginia.  But the school was around between 6th [Avenue] and 7th [Avenue], and I lived at 16th hundred block, and we had something called the bottom.  And when it would rain real hard, the bottom would fill up, and the water would cross the street, and you couldn't walk through the bottom to get to school.  So, you had to go--circumvent and go around and go down Main Street downtown and then come back to Missouri Street between 6th and 7th on Missouri.  So it was a long walk when it rained and when the weather was bad, because you had--you couldn't get through the bottom.  And all the houses in the bottom were on stilts, very high, you know, off the ground, because that was the way the water was at the time, I guess, very low ground.  So, getting to school--yes, I walked to school.  And on the way I would pass by buddies, and sometimes if me and the buddies fell out, I really had to go another way, because I couldn't go by their house because some of them had big brothers.  I'll never forget the Ross boys.  Ray Ross was my classmate, and he had an older brother named Maurice [Maurice Ross].  And I could whip Ray, but I couldn't do very much with Maurice.  And so Ray told Maurice that I had jumped on him, and so Maurice was going to settle the matters with me.  So, I had to circumvent and go way around, because I was afraid of Maurice.  I did--when I grew up and became a football player, Maurice went to the [U.S. military] service and he came back on leave.  By that time, I outweighed Maurice and I said, "Man, I owe you something."  (Laughter) And he said, "What are you talking about?"  I said, "You know you jumped on me, and I was a little fellow then."  "But" I said, "I got something for you now."  And I did strike him, and he looked at me and said, "Well, let's just forget about it man, let's forget about it."  So, we kind of settled that, that was a part of it.
Story_ID: 641949
Speaker 1: Who else lived in your neighborhood [in Pine Bluff, Arkansas]?  What were the occupations of some of your, your friends that lived in the neighborhood's parents?
Speaker 2: Well, I, the May [ph.] brothers lived with us, and the Smyricks [ph.] lived in the neighborhood.  It was a very integrated neighborhood at the time, and so many of my friends, early friends, were whites.  And neither of us could understand why we didn't go to the same school.  We were going to different schools, but we played ball together in the evening.  We played hide and seek, and other kinds of little games that kids play.  But my next door neighbors were the Mays, and they owned the grocery store in the community.  And I'm not sure what the Smyricks did, but Ray Smyrick [ph.] was my buddy.  And so when you would choose your team and who was going to play with you, if Ray was playing he would choose me.  If I was choosing, I'd choose Ray.  And so, it was a great neighborhood.  And then there were very prominent individuals that lived in the neighborhood.  And there was a black dentist, Dr. Phipps [Harold Phipps]. There was a lady who was a supervisor in the school system.  And she was the sister of my coach, Dr. Foster [Henry Foster, Sr.].  Buddy Lee [ph.] was a good buddy of mine.  And the Halstons [ph.] lived on the corner, and it was just a--everybody knew everybody in the neighborhood.  So, that's the kind of neighborhood I grew up with.  But it was very integrated, and I will always value the relationships that I had with kids growing up and their families.
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell me more about your school.  Were there any teachers who you remember that were influential in your life at that time?
Speaker 2: I think I remember all of them.  Now, my fourth grade teacher was Mr. Williams [ph.], and Mr. Williams taught geography.  And, but he had a technique.  You know, most times you would go to teachers and they would have you read silently, you know, "Read page twelve through fifteen," and you would read it.  And Mr. Williams said, "When you read this silently I don't know whether you're calling these words right or not.  Read aloud."  And Mr. Williams would always make us stand up and read and then he wanted us to put emphasis where it needed to be.  And the thing that I remember most that Mr. Williams taught me, he said, "Reading makes a full man."  Now, this was before we became aware of gender sensitivity.  We wouldn't say man then, he wouldn't say man these days, but in those days he said, "Reading makes a full man, conversation a ready man, writing, an exact man, and thinking, a super man.  I want you all to be super men."  So, I will always remember Mr. Williams and that saying.  "Reading makes a full man. Conversation a ready man.  Writing an exact man, and thinking a super man.  Be a super man."  And I suppose today if you were teaching, he'd say, be super men and women, you know.  But I remember him very, very well.  I remember teachers in high school [Merrill High School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], my, especially my English teachers, and why I chose to major in an undergrad major in English [at Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  So, those were some of the teachers (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Well I want to still stay in elementary school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Where there--that was the teacher that, that you remember the most.
Story_ID: 641950
Speaker 1: Of course you grew up during the Depression [Great Depression] and during World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I just remember a number of my friends' parents who had been drafted and had gone off to the [U.S.] military.  And these guys used to get letters from their dads and they would share them with us, and they would be in Europe or they would be in Japan or they would--they were going to places in the world that we never had explored very much.  And so we learned a lot about the culture in those areas that we weren't accustomed to being familiar with.  So those were good days.  I also remember some other lessons I learned.  They would take prisoners of war, and prisoners of war used to come into our neighborhoods and work on the streets and mow the grass and those kinds of things.  They were doing public works stuff, and they had the prisoners of war doing that.  And the thing that stands out with me was that in many instances they had black guards guarding them, some black guards.  And they had toilets for the whites, including the prisoners, and they had toilets for the blacks that the black guards had to use.  So, even though the prisoners were in a prison mode, they still used the restroom with the white guards, and the black guards could not use the restrooms that the prisoners used, because the prisoners were--they were German prisoners--that were in my neighborhood, and they used the same white bathrooms, the same white water fountains that the guards did, but you couldn't do that if you were a black guard.
Speaker 1: So were these [U.S.] Army guards that you're talking about?
Speaker 2: These were Army guards, that's right.
Speaker 1: Like MPs or something?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if they called them--now that was a military policeman.  I imagine they had, there was some similarity.  I just remember that they had some black guards guarding the prisoners sometimes, and what their restrictions were.
Speaker 1: And was there an army base near where you lived?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We, well, we had an arsenal.
Speaker 1: Arsenal?
Speaker 2: It was called the Pine Bluff Arsenal [Arkansas].  It was not a base, but there were military people assigned to that arsenal.  The nearest base was in Little Rock [Arkansas].  It was, or, North Little Rock [Arkansas], and it was called Camp Robinson [Camp Joseph T. Robinson].  And then there was another one in Fort Smith [Arkansas] called Fort Chaffee [Camp Chaffee; Fort Chaffee Joint Maneuver Training Center], but those were the two bases.  Later on, after I had become an adult, they established an [U.S.] Air Force base in Jacksonville [Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas], and that became the third military base, but by that time, Fort Chaffee was not--Camp Robinson was closing down.  But my dad [James Walker, Sr.] also worked--although he was in ministry and insurance--during the war he worked at the arsenal.  He was a supervisor at the arsenal.  They were making bombs there in Pine Bluff.  So he had that opportunity and vocation as well.
Story_ID: 641951
Speaker 1: Being that you grew up during the Depression [Great Depression] time, did your--you or your family--well, did you as a child understand what that meant?  Did you lack anything--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --or did you know the difference?
Speaker 2: I don't think I really knew the difference, because I'd never been used to a lot of luxury.  My--we grew food, we didn't go out to eat.  Number one, there weren't very many places you could go to eat.  I was, keep in mind I was in an era of segregation, so you weren't even able to eat at the lunch counters.  You could go to the five and dime store and you could purchase merchandise in there, and objects, but you couldn't sit and have a cup of coffee, and you couldn't have a hamburger.  That was before the sit-in movement occurred.  And so you didn't need a whole lot of money.  If you had a store where they would allow you to charge--and most of the neighborhood stores at that time let you charge, and if your mom and dad had taken you in there, and said, "This is my child, and sometimes he may come and pick up stuff for me, so let him do it."  Well, we'd go to the May brothers store [ph.] or we'd go to the Gordon Chavis [ph.] store, and we had a bill there and we could charge, we had a charge account.  And when Daddy [James Walker, Sr.] and Mama [Walker's stepmother, Nettie Harris Walker] got paid, they went and paid for it, but you could charge.  We didn't have charge cards--wasn't no Master Charge [Mastercard] then, wasn't no Visa, but you had a charge account, and it enabled you to go and get food.  But I also remember the rationing.  I remember when you had to have stamps to get sugar.  And there were other things during the war [World War II, WWII] that there was a shortage of.  So, there were certain things you couldn't get, certain things you couldn't buy.  You had to have stamps to get them, and there was an allocation, and when you ran out of stamps, you were unable to buy that product.  So, those were the war days that I remember.  And--
Speaker 1: Do you remember going to, to use the stamps?  Where did you go to acquire these things?
Speaker 2: You would apply for those stamps through some form of government, and they would allocate it based on the size of your family and based on your ability to utilize them.  But it was, there were just certain things that were rationed, and I do remember sugar was--
Speaker 1: Was one of them?
Speaker 2: --was one of the things that was rationed.
Story_ID: 641952
Speaker 1: You also said you remember V-E Day?
Speaker 2: I remember V-E Day, the whistles blowing and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Tell me about it, tell me what happened.
Speaker 2: Well, when the Germans surrendered, that became V-E Day, Victory in Europe [Victory in Europe Day].  Our country and our military declared victory in Europe.  And then following that [sic.], after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii], then we retaliated and redoubled the military efforts of our country to take over and force Japan to surrender.  That was V-J Day, victory in Japan [Victory over Japan Day].  And the whistles were blowing and let me tell you, the parades were--people were down the street yelling and screaming and just happy that we had won the war [World War II, WWII].  Now, it was going to mean some things for the economy, because it means that you would start closing down the [U.S.] military.  You didn't need as many bombs, and you didn't have as many jobs connected to the military, but you were glad that men were coming home.  Sometimes your uncles and your brother, big older brothers, were coming home, and so peace was in the offing.
Speaker 1: Did it affect your father's [James Walker, Sr.] job at the arsenal [Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: It did affect my father's job at the arsenal, it certainly did.  He was still there for a while because he was a supervisor.  Well, he wasn't--he was a line foreman.  He actually supervised a group of workers that were on the assembly line.  But he did--I think he must have been there five or six months after the war ended, and then he had to go back to the ministry and to insurance to sustain the family (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 641953
Speaker 1: Were you involved in extracurricular activities, like sports or music?
Speaker 2: I was involved in any and everything they would do.  Now, I really liked the minstrels and the plays, and that kind of thing, and repeating great speeches.  When I was in elementary school, I loved the words of Patrick Henry.  And, when he said, "I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death."  I loved that, until I found out that when he made that speech, he was a slave owner.  Then I never repeated Patrick Henry again, until now (laughter).   But I thought that was a speech, quite a speech, because it was about liberty, and if you didn't have liberty, you weren't fit to live.  And then later on, I heard another one that reminded me of Patrick Henry, and I believe Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] articulated this.  He said, "If a man has not found something for which he's willing to die, he's not fit to live."  Now, that I loved, and I could say that one, so I replaced Patrick Henry with that.  "If a man has not found something for which he's willing to die, he is not fit to live."
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: Now, you want to know what else I was involved with?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, sports, music?
Speaker 2: I loved sports, absolutely loved sports.  Never thought I was much of a musician.  I took some courses in trying to play the trumpet, but I never learned how to play the trumpet, and I didn't go close to the piano.  I would try to sing.  I will never forget it.  They had talent show.  I was the first one.  I said, "Let me do, 'I Love You for Sentimental Reasons'."  "I love you for sentimental reasons, and my heart goes out for you," or something like that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  And what about sports?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was all sports.  I played basketball, I played football, I ran track and I played baseball.  As a high school student, I didn't make the basketball team.  I was too short, and we had tall boys that played basketball.  But I played football, and I was the kicker for the team.  I kicked off and I kicked field goals.  And I was a left footed kicker, and we had a stadium behind the school [Merrill High School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  It was in the neighborhood, and there was a lady named Ms. Bradley [ph.] that lived right beyond the goal post.  And she complained because I was kicking balls on top of her house, and when I was recruited to college on a football scholarship, one of the reasons that I was recruited is for my kicking.  And on the baseball team, I was a pitcher, a left handed pitcher.  I continued in drama, in oratorical contests, and always loved to try to make speeches and try to be in plays.  So I majored in English and drama with a minor in history [at Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], because I felt that I was going to go to law school, but caught up in something called marriage and fatherhood and couldn't go to law school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's go back to, let's go on to junior high school and high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Are some of the things that we just talked about included in junior high school and high school?
Speaker 2: Yes. As a matter of fact--
Speaker 1: As far as your activities?
Speaker 2: Matter of fact, seventh through twelfth was high school, so there was not--the junior high was not separated from senior high.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What they now call middle school, they were all together.  When you left elementary school and went into the seventh grade, you were all in the same building.  You could sing in the choir, you could be in the plays, you could play on the teams, and that kind of thing.  So, I started playing high school football when I was in the eighth grade, and I continued to play on through graduation.
Story_ID: 641954
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me what high school you attended?
Speaker 2: I went to Merrill High School [Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  Merrill, M-E-R-R-I-L-L.
Speaker 1: Who was the principal at that time?
Speaker 2: Mr. R.N. Chaney.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: R.N. Chaney.
Speaker 1: And this is in 1947 that you began Merrill? You were fourteen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Had a little before that.  I finished in 1951, so I must have gone into Merrill a little sooner than '47 [1947] because that would be just four years.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So it must have been '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: All right. Okay.  All right, and you told me about a teacher in elementary school.  Was there a teacher in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  Mrs. Hamilton [ph.], Mrs. Hinson [ph.], they were English teachers.  I loved English, because I loved literature.  I loved Shakespeare [William Shakespeare].  Poetry captured me and captivated me.  And so I remember Mrs. Hinson and I remember Mrs. Hamilton, both of my English teachers, and then Mrs. Bennett [ph.] who was a history teacher.  Mrs. McPhearson [ph.] was the senior class person.  You had to always look to her, because if you planned to graduate, if you planned to march, you better be on the good side of Mrs. McPhearson.  She was there to do that.  And Ms.--who else was it?  Mrs. Long [ph.] was the choir director.  I was in the choir, but I joined the choir because Mrs. Long was young and pretty, and I wanted to be in the choir because of the fact that she was such an attractive lovely teacher.
Speaker 1: When you're in high school, you get to meet Mary McLeod Bethune.  Can you tell me about that?
Speaker 2: I surely did.  There was a woman named Ms. Anna P. Strong who was the principal of Moton High School [Robert R. Moton High School] in Marianna, Arkansas.  And she not only had a passion for enhancing the knowledge and skills of students in her school, but throughout the state, because she was well known and highly respected.  And at that time, they separated the black and white schools.  We had a man named Mr. Charles Hicks [Charles A. Hicks] who worked for the state department of education, and he was the director of colored education, colored education, because they hadn't graduated to Negro, but colored education.  And Dr. Hicks used to visit, and he brought Mrs. Anna P. Strong and Ms. Mary McLeod Bethune to Merrill High School, and my, what a day.  We just cancelled all classes and we went to the assembly so we could listen to this lady who was a counselor to the president.  She had counseled President Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] and Mrs. Roosevelt [Eleanor Roosevelt], and we knew about that, because we'd read about her in a book called 'Thirteen Against the Odds' [Edwin R. Embree].  And Ms. Bethune was awesome.  We later found out that there was a school in Florida that was named for her, called Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida].  And so I was just fascinated by the opportunity to meet her, but also Ms. Anna Strong.  And when I got to college [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] later on--I'm jumping ahead.  When I got to college I met a lot of the students in college who had gone to high school where Mrs. Anna P. Strong was the principal.  And some of the prettiest girls in the school came from that school, Moton.
Story_ID: 641955
Speaker 1: Now that you're in high school [Merrill High School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], how do you begin to prepare for college?  What is it that you think that you want to become?
Speaker 2: Well, again, I had jobs cleaning up offices at the Masonic Temple [Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  I sold papers, so I knew a little bit about journalism.  And I kind of had a little of that in my mind, that it would be nice if I could do some writing and do some of these articles, and own this publishing company that had this paper, because I thought we needed to have some means of communicating with each other.  And so I sold the Arkansas State Press, I sold the Chicago Defender, and I sold the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier].  I also had a shine stand that I worked on.  And so I would stack my papers at the end of the shine stand, and when you got through getting your shoes shined, then you bought a paper.  So I guess I was kind of a, you know, a little businessman in those days.  But what I really wanted to be was a lawyer, because I saw the offices of these lawyers and I saw how cool they were, and what heroes they were.  We had a man named Attorney Flowers, Harold Flowers [William Harold Flowers], who was, I think through history, was the first African American lawyer in Arkansas to represent a black man who had killed a white man.  You know, that was something special, to be representing somebody in the courts in a case involving the death penalty, because the prosecutors had asked for the death penalty because he had killed a white man.  A black guy killed a white man.  And so Harold Flowers became my hero.  His brother was Dr. Flowers [Cleon Flowers], who was our family doctor.  And he was everybody's lawyer, and I used to clean both of their offices when I was a little boy, empty the waste baskets and take out the trash, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: Well, like I said, I was not valedictorian.  I ranked fifth in my graduating class (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh that's right, you said.
Speaker 2: But, I was good in some--I made all A's in English.  Now sometimes I would falter in math, I wasn't the greatest math student that there was.  History, I was pretty good in that, if I did my homework and stuff.  But English was it.  Literature I loved.  I loved Shakespeare [William Shakespeare], I loved Browning [Robert Browning], and Chaucer [Geoffrey Chaucer], and you know, courses like that.
Story_ID: 641956
Speaker 1: How did you decide what colleges you would apply to?
Speaker 2: Well, I was looking at the colleges that were offering me scholarships.  I knew that in order to go to college I was going to have to get some form of scholarship.  Since I wasn't the valedictorian or the salutatorian [of Merrill High School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], I wasn't going to get it for academics.  And so I started wondering who might be interested in me becoming the kicker for the football team, or the pitcher for the baseball team.  I also ran track, and, but I didn't run well enough to get a scholarship.  So, football became my cash cow.  And there was a school called Philander Smith in Little Rock [Philander Smith College, Little Rock, Arkansas].  It was a smaller school, and they didn't have the quality of football team that we had.  Then there was, everybody knew about Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], and they knew about Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  And they had me around quoting Jake Gaither, "Agile, hostile, and mobile."  And Florida A&M had some great teams, so I thought about them.  And then the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] used to pick a black All-American team.   And I never made the first team, but I was the honorable mention.  And so if you were mentioned, you had a chance of somebody looking at you and offering you a scholarship.  So those were the days that you kind of looked at what your options were.  Well, it turned out that my best option was right there in my hometown, at Arkansas AM&N, Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal, now UAPB [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  And UAPB has gotten some notoriety lately, because last year, not this year, but last year they played Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] in the NCAA tournament [National Collegiate Athletic Association], and Duke defeated them.  But like I was saying, the only team in the tournament that beat my school was the team that won the national championship, and that was Duke.  So we lost to the national champions.

Speaker 1: So, you go to A&M, Arkansas A&M [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what subjects are you taking there?  What do you think?  You thought about being an attorney--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but what happens once you go to school?
Speaker 2: Well, you know you have to take your freshman courses first.  And so you're thinking of doing well, because if you're going to be interested in joining a fraternity, then you have to have a certain GPA [grade point average].  And so, I was looking at the fraternities, and they were all kind of looking at me.  And so a lot of my buddies I'd gone to school with went Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].  And then I had some friends who were Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] and I didn't know many Sigmas [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity] at the time, but let me tell you, I loved to see the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] come out with the canes and do the double spin to the rear, and shucks, the girls would just scream when the Kappas would hit the campus.  So I said, Kappa it's going to have to be.  And so I decided early on, I wanted to be a Kappa.  And so I kept those grades up, so I could qualify to be able or eligible to be a Kappa.   And so I made good grades, I made very good grades and especially in those subjects that I liked.  I liked literature, I liked English, and I tended to make A's.  I liked history, and I figured if I could somehow nail history and English together, the ability and the capacity to write and to know law, that maybe I could be a lawyer some day.  But that was want I wanted.  I wanted to be a lawyer or an actor, because I was president of the thespian society, called the Spotlighters.  And so everybody thought I was a pretty good little actor, too, you know.
Speaker 1: And who were some of your classmates, and who was the president at the time?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  I'm trying to think.  Was it Truman [President Harry S. Truman]?
Speaker 1: The president of the college.
Speaker 2: Oh, the president of the college.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Oh, Dr. Lawrence Davis [Lawrence A. Davis, Sr.], whose son [Lawrence A. Davis, Jr.] is the current chancellor of the school.  And Dr. Lawrence Davis and my father [James Walker, Sr.] were classmates in high school [Merrill High School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] and college.  So, he was a legend.  And later on after I got involved in public service, they did a poll at Ouachita State University [sic. Ouachita Baptist University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas] to determine who the most influential African Americans in the state were, and I was chosen over my college president.  So that made me feel real sassy, since more people tended to admire me or rank me as the most influential African American in the state.  And I got more votes than my college president.  Do you think that won't make you sassy?  But he was a man I admired and respected and tried to pattern much of my life after.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your classmates during that time?  You were there from '51 [1951] to '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: I was there from '51 [1951] and graduated in '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Fifty-five [1955], okay.
Speaker 2: I remember Almarine Leon Randolph.  And Randolph became a major principal and superintendent of schools in a small town in Arkansas, and he led the line that I was in.  I was in a group of Kappa initiatives called the Courageous Ten [ph.], and I remembered him very well.  Then I had another friend called Malcolm Hemphill [HistoryMaker Malcolm Hemphill, Jr.] from Chicago [Illinois].  And Malcolm's claim to fame was he married Jesse Owens' daughter [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill].  And so, like, he was on line with me.  We had them from all over.  We had guys from Middletown, Ohio, all over the place that were teammates.
Story_ID: 641958
Speaker 1: We were talking about some of your classmates, and do you remember Gloria Long Anderson [HistoryMaker Gloria Anderson]?
Speaker 2: I remember Dr. Anderson quite vividly.  Dr. Anderson was not a classmate of mine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dr. Anderson was a schoolmate, but I was ahead of Dr. Anderson.  But I was ahead of her in terms of the years I had been there.  Nobody was ahead of Dr. Anderson when it came to the GPA [grade point average].  And she was a Long at that time, Gloria Long, and later she married an Anderson.  But she wasn't at the top of the list because her first initial was A, she was at the top of the list because she had the highest GPA in the school, and she was majoring in chemistry.  She was from a little town called Altheimer, Arkansas, and just a marvelous person.  And I would get angry about Dr. Anderson, because I'd look and try to find my name, but I always knew Dr. Anderson's name was going to be at the top.  Sometimes I got in the top ten and that kind of thing, but Dr. Anderson was always number one.  And it was my privilege to resurrect the relationship with her. When I came to Atlanta [Georgia], she was on the staff at Morris Brown College.  She was on two occasions the interim president of Morris Brown College.  And I was instrumental in being chair of the local public broadcasting agency [Atlanta Educational Telecommunications Collaborative, Inc.], and we were invited to nominate folks for the national board, and I nominated her and she was elected, and one of the first African American women to serve on the national board for public broadcasting [Corporation for Public Broadcasting].  And, so, and currently, it is my privilege to serve as vice chair on the board of trustees for Morris Brown College, and once again, I have the opportunity to work with Dr. Anderson.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So let's go back to that time at Arkansas A&M [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  Was there anybody else that you remember that you'd like to talk about at that time?
Speaker 2: Ah, there is--a number of individuals in various ways.  They were either persons I knew and interacted with in the fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] or as athletes, or just on the campus.  I mentioned Almarine Leon Randolph.  There was a young man named Donald Meyers [ph.], and another one named Alexander McCarthy [ph.], and they were from Middletown, Ohio, and they were stellar athletes that had come from, all the way from Ohio.  They had been recruited by Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] and other schools, but they came there.  And then I had another teammate named Darwin Davis [HistoryMaker Darwin N. Davis, Sr.].  Darwin Davis was from Flint, Michigan.  But he went on to become one of the highest ranking African Americans in Corporate America, because he was the senior vice president of the Equitable company, Equitable insurance company [Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial].  Darwin was on the football team with--I was on the football team with him.  So I will never forget Darwin Davis.  There were a number of persons in school at the same time.  Some of them were not my classmates, but they were my schoolmates, and I've had a wonderful time trying to stay in touch with them subsequently.  I mentioned Malcolm Hemphill [HistoryMaker Malcolm Hemphill, Jr.], who was married to Jesse Owens' daughter [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill], and so that gave him a little notoriety and that kind of thing.  We had a lot of students from St. Louis [Missouri], a lot of students from Chicago [Illinois], a lot of students from Mississippi.  Some went on to become all-pros in football: L.C. Greenwood [L.C. Henderson Greenwood], who was with the Pittsburgh Steelers--just a cadre of folks who were athletes or entertainers or scientists.  One person in school with me, ahead of me, was Dr. Samuel Kountz [Samuel L. Kountz], who was from Lexa, Arkansas, and he was responsible for enabling us to do transplants, because of the contributions he had made in the field of medicine.  He was a person who had to take remedial courses when he came to college, and went on to become one of the world's outstanding surgeons.
Story_ID: 641959
Speaker 1: Talk to me a little bit about what was going on as far as civil rights.  We're coming up on--let's talk about the year 1954, Brown v. the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  What did that mean to you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, it meant a lot to me.  I, I didn't know at the time, but I had been an office boy for an attorney named Wiley Branton [Wiley A. Branton, Sr.].  Wiley Branton was the co-counsel with Thurgood Marshall in representing the Little Rock Nine.  So, me being an office boy with Wiley put me that close to the first African American to serve on the [U.S.] Supreme Court, Thurgood Marshall.  I later enrolled in a program called the human rights institute at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: When was this?
Speaker 2: Ah, this was in '60s [1960s], the '60s [1960s], '60 [1960], '62 [1962].  Thurgood Marshall was head of the Race Relations Institute, and he was my professor in the summer courses at Fisk University, so I got a chance to be taught by Thurgood Marshall.  And my relationship as Wiley's runner and office boy, who was co-counsel with him for Little Rock Nine, just truly made it a very special opportunity for me to be a part of.
Story_ID: 641960
Speaker 1: Well we'll talk more about that when we get to the '60s [1960s], but also in 1954, you find a love of your life?
Speaker 2: I certainly did.  As a matter of fact, she had--her brother was my classmate.  His name was Lewis [ph.].
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Lorraine, Lorraine Tate [ph.].  And we went to elementary school together and we just had evidenced a lot of hostility toward each other.  I thought she was the cutest little girl, but I thought she was stuck up, and I was the hall monitor.  And she would come dashing down the hall without her hall pass.  And I would say, "Little girl, I'm going to turn your name in for not having your hall pass."  She'd say, "Well, turn it in, turn it in, nothing's going to happen."  And so, I don't know, we just had a little rivalry.  So I guess at some point I thought that maybe I'd better try to see if I can't have a better relationship with this cute little girl.  And so we wind up seeing each other in college [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], and got married.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. And, tell me about what she accomplishes.  And then, you have three children, is that right?
Speaker 2: Four, four children.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your children.  Just tell me, tell me when they were born and what they're doing today.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Cheryl [Cheryl Walker] is the oldest.  Cheryl was born in 1955.  She has been in the field of restaurant management and is number one and the senior.  She's also very, very close to her mom, and they both still live in Little Rock [Arkansas].  Then the second one is Jimmy, James David II [James Walker II].  Now why is the oldest one named James David and not William?  Because Daddy [James Walker] paid the hospital bill when he was born, my daddy.  So--and my dad didn't have a junior, so I said, "Daddy, I'm going to name Jimmy for you."  So, he's named for my dad.  And he was born in '56 [1956].  At the time I was living, or we were living, and I was coaching at Lincoln High School in Camden, Arkansas.  And so Jimmy was born in Camden.  The third--
Speaker 1: What does he do today?
Speaker 2: Jimmy works as head of highway maintenance for South Bend, Indiana.  He moved to South Bend to be near his son [Darius Walker] who was playing football, had been recruited and was playing football for Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana]--one of Georgia's outstanding athletes, and was recruited by Notre Dame and he went on there and became a graduate but spent four years in the NFL [National Football League].
Speaker 1: Your grandson?
Speaker 2: My grandson and son.  My son played in the NFL as well.
Speaker 1: What team did your son play for?
Speaker 2: He played with the Minnesota Vikings.  He played in the Canadian Football League, and was on three Grey Cup championship teams with all pro quarterback Warren Moon, who was his teammate.  And then he played in the United States Football League and that enabled him to play with the Birmingham Stallions and the Memphis Showboats.   But he was a two-time All-American tackle for the University of Arkansas Razorbacks [University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Arkansas].  Now keep in mind, when I was growing up, they didn't recruit us for the Razorbacks, and he became the first African American defensive player to make All-American as a Razorback.  And then he went on to help direct and guide his son to a stellar football career as well.  And, then the third one of the siblings is Bill, William Jr. [William Walker, Jr.].  I finally got to a junior.  This young man is a current cabinet member in the State of Arkansas.  He heads workforce education for the State of Arkansas [Arkansas Department of Workforce Education; Arkansas Department of Career Education], one of the senior executives doing this in the country, dealing with jobs for American graduates and jobs for Arkansas graduates, trying to prepare people for the world of work.  And he formerly spent eighteen years in the Arkansas General Assembly as a member of both the House [Arkansas House of Representatives] and the Senate [Arkansas Senate].  He also waged a strong campaign to become mayor of the City of Little Rock, but not successfully, but he's still there and still working with the governor [Mike Beebe] as part of his team.  That's my younger son, William, Jr. And the youngest is Leslie Patricia [Leslie Walker].  Leslie was born in '62 [1962].  Bill was born in '60 [1960] and Leslie was born in 1962.  And Leslie is still charting her course.  She was here [Atlanta, Georgia] for a number of years.  She's back in Little Rock now, still working on deciding what her future's going to be.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those are my, the youngsters that came as a result of the marriage.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Which lasted thirty-seven years, I should say, prior to my being fired.
Story_ID: 641961
Speaker 1: All right, so--and this was in 1954 when you married and then you have your children.  Tell me a little bit about civil rights.  What's going on in 1954 in Little Rock [Arkansas] and even on the campus [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: Well, in the days that I was in college, we were very sensitive to civil rights matters, because at that time we were having sit-ins, demonstrations, reacting to the kind of social restraints and restrictions that African Americans had.  Of course, this was prior to what occurred in '57 [1957] in Little Rock with the Little Rock Nine.  This was earlier, but I was still in college at the time, and we were still dealing with a man named Faubus. Orval Faubus was the governor.  And of course, going to a state school, a state assisted, I used to say supported, but I know that they weren't supported, they were assisted, we had to depend on the legislature [Arkansas General Assembly] and the governor for the quality of education, or the type of education that we would get.  And of course we had a segregated system.  And you couldn't go to the University of Arkansas [Fayetteville, Arkansas] and you couldn't go to Arkansas State [Arkansas State College; Arkansas State University, Jonesboro, Arkansas], which was the second largest school in there, and then they had a bunch of other schools: Hendrix College [Conway, Arkansas]; Henderson State [Henderson State Teachers College; Henderson State University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas]; Ouachita [Ouachita Baptist College; Ouachita Baptist University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas]; Southern Arkansas [Southern State College; Southern Arkansas University, Magnolia, Arkansas]; Central Arkansas [Arkansas State Teachers College; University of Central Arkansas, Conway, Arkansas], a number of schools.  Then you had the law school [University of Arkansas School of Law, Fayetteville, Arkansas] and you had the medical school [University of Arkansas Medical School; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas], and most of them were off limits to us.  But I was coming along at a time when we were beginning to take legal action to gain entry into those institutions, especially in the postgraduate work, as well as specialty in law and medicine and those kinds of courses that weren't offered in an African American school [HBCU].  But in the early days, they would pay your way, if you went away.  "Just go away, and don't cause us this problem.  If you want to go to med school, then go to Howard in D.C. [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. We'll pay your way.  Or go to Meharry [Meharry Medical College] in Nashville, Tennessee and we'll pay your way."  So that's where we went, and that's how a lot of our African American youngsters and students were able to go to grad school, or to go to medical school or law school, because it was denied at home, you know.  So that's kind of what I was going through at the time.  But I saw a lot of court cases beginning to take shape, a lot of litigation occurring in order to gain some of the rights and privileges that others had.  I remember when I was getting out of college and thinking of going to law school prior to getting married, and giving up on that idea.  I was hoping that I'd be able to go to law school right there in Arkansas.  They had a law school in the state, but it wasn't something that a bevy of blacks could look forward to going to.  As a matter of fact I remember a guy named Jackie Shropshire, who was one of the early law school persons.  He had to have a speaker and a video camera in the basement.  He couldn't sit in the same classroom with the other law school students.  He was downstairs listening, and in many instances could not even see the expressions on the face of his professor.  He protested, and so they said, "We'll bring him up."  So they brought him upstairs and put him in the same room, but they built a barrier between he and the other students.  He was inside a little barrier, but he could at least see the students, and his professors as well.  But those were the days, those were the days of assertion, of determination, that in spite of all of this, I'm going to be what I want to be.  I'm going to get a quality education, I'm going to make a contribution to society.  Those were the days.  Those were truly the days.
Story_ID: 641962
Speaker 1: You finished in 1955 [at Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].
Speaker 2: Finished in '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: And what happens next?  Do you get a job?
Speaker 2: I was recruited to become a coach.  I had been a football player.   And there was a town called Camden, Arkansas, a school called Lincoln High School.  Again, the black school in Camden.  Camden was a fairly busy town because they had paper mills in Camden and they recruited me to come there to be a coach.  Now, I can't say a football coach, because when you were a coach then at the black school, you coached everything.  You coached track, you coached baseball, you coached basketball, you coached football, you coached girls, you coached boys, you coached senior high and you coached junior high.  You coached everything, plus you had a full schedule of classes that you taught.  So, I was the teacher and coach at Lincoln High School.  And the second year that I was there we defeated the largest black school in the state, and it was called Horace Mann [Horace Mann High School; Horace Mann Magnet Middle School], it had been called Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School], in Little Rock [Arkansas].   And after we defeated them--I had done my student teaching at that school, at Dunbar.  And so they knew that I was at Camden and they knew that Camden had become a major school with a fabulous program in athletics, so they recruited me to come back.  And I left Camden in January of '57 [1957] to go to Horace Mann High School.  Dunbar had become Horace Mann.  And, now keep in mind, '57 [1957], January of '57 [1957].  So I got a chance to teach five of the nine students that were in the Little Rock Nine, at the black school.  And that fall of 1957 was when we attempted to get the Little Rock--the nine kids--to go to Little Rock Central [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].  The governor, named Orval Faubus, called out the National Guard and said "Don't let them in."  And so the guard was there to turn the Little Rock Nine back, in front of the jeers of thousands of white people, who were saying, "We don't want to integrate. Two, four, six, eight, we don't want to integrate."  That's what you could hear.  And you got a governor who bought into that.  Fortunately we had a president named Eisenhower.  Dwight Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] federalized those same troops and said, "Escort the kids in."  And so they got, the nine students, as a result of the president of the United States, got a chance to be escorted in.  Now once they got in there, a few things happened.
Story_ID: 641963
Speaker 1: Well, let's go back--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) before they actually get in, because you get to teach them [at Horace Mann High School; Horace Mann Magnet Middle School, Little Rock, Arkansas].  You said four of the nine?
Speaker 2: I taught five of the nine.
Speaker 1: Five of the nine.  Tell me who they were, and how you were instrumental in preparing them to transfer to go to Central [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was more than just--the preparation was more than just what was occurring in the classroom, because the students were identified based on their academic excellence.  So we tried to take the best, because we wanted them to succeed.  A woman named Daisy Bates, who was head of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], was the guiding force behind that, and a number of persons in the community, including [HistoryMaker] Ozell Sutton who was working with the Arkansas human relations commission [Arkansas Council on Human Relations].  I had been working as a sports writer for Mrs. Bates' newspaper, the State Press [Arkansas State Press], so she brought me into the process to a great extent.  They had a number of other folks, especially NAACP related persons that helped in trying to chart a course for these nine kids.  We also had to involve their families, because much of what was going on resulted in reparations, re- repercussions and resistance to the rights of those families.  In other words, sometimes the father would lose his job.  Sometimes the mother would lose her job, and that kind of thing, as a result of integrating the schools.  So, those were the kinds of things that we had to deal with in addition to preparing them academically, mentally and emotionally, for going there.  We tried to tell them, we were going to try to instill some of the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] principles of nonviolence in them.  Now, because they hit you, don't hit them back.  But we didn't get across to Minnijean Brown [Minnijean Brown Trickey] very well, because some guy put some chili, threw some chili on Minnijean, and Minnijean took, threw chili back.  And so, there were some who didn't accept well being abused and intimidated by some of the students who didn't want them there.  So, it was quite a time in '57 [1957].  The crowds were jeering the students as they would come in.  And I'm sure you saw the--I taught Elizabeth Eckford, and I'm sure you saw when she was isolated by herself, and there was this crowd jeering this young girl.  She was frightened, didn't know what to do, she was isolated from the others.  They usually tried to go in together, but somehow she got separated from the other eight, and was alone, and it wasn't a very pleasant kind of experience for her.  But, Little Rock [Arkansas] in '57 [1957] was really something.  But the thing that I think is unknown, or not, with very little emphasis placed on it, was not '57 [1957], '58 [1958], which was the first year that black students left to go to Little Rock Central, but the really tumultuous year was '58 [1958], '59 [1959], the school year of '58 [1958], '59 [959].  Do you realize that there is no such thing as a '59 [1959] graduate of a Little Rock public school?  The high schools did not open in '58 [1958].  Rather than continue the integration that they had in '57 [1957], the board decided to close the high schools--close, which affected not just African American kids, but all students.  And this is what really brought out white parents, especially mothers, who said, "We're paying the price for all this discrimination and resistance to integration."  And they had a panel of American women that were formed, and they went around and spoke to audiences about the fact that they needed to go on and accept the fact that integration is real, it's here, it's the order of the court, and there's no point in us trying to further resist it.  Let's just be supportive of it, and hope that we have the best environment for all of our children in the school system.  But no graduate-- can you imagine, I want to reiterate it.  I repeat it for emphasis.  No graduate of the public schools in Little Rock in 1959 because the schools, high schools, did not open in the fall of '58 [1958].  So [HistoryMaker] Ernest Green, who was the first graduate, was in the graduating class of '58 [1958], because he was the only senior that was with the nine, the only one of the nine who was in the senior class, so he graduated and the others were put on hold.  They had to go other places, go to parochial schools, go to the county schools, go to St. Louis [Missouri], Chicago [Illinois]--somewhere where there was a relative so they could continue to be in school.  But they couldn't go to high school in their own home towns.  What a crime, what a shame, but that was the case.
Story_ID: 641964
Speaker 1: Talk to me about, about some of the students.  You mentioned Elizabeth [Elizabeth Eckford] and--
Speaker 2: Melba Pattillo [Melba Pattillo Beals].
Speaker 1: And Melba had incidents that happened.  You talked about Brown [Minnijean Brown Trickey] with the chili.  But Pattillo, didn't she have dynamite thrown or sprayed in the face, or something?  I don't remember.
Speaker 2: No, I'm not familiar with all the things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, that happened? Okay.
Speaker 2: That were occurring.  They were happening so often.  But most of them had some encounter that was not something you would expect in a school environment.  Because students ne- they were tripped on the stairs and steps and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --with an arm of books and they were, they had inscriptions on their locker, "Go home nigger," things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So it was not the best environment.  Comager--not Comager Roberts--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Terrence Roberts.
Speaker 2: He was another student that had challenges, but all of them did.
Speaker 1: Right. I wanted to just make sure I had the names of the students that you taught.  And you said there was Minnijean, Elizabeth--
Speaker 2: Melba Pattillo.
Speaker 1: Melba.  Who else?  Was Terrence one?
Speaker 2: Terrence was one of my students, yes.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Ernest Green?
Speaker 2: Ernest Green.
Speaker 1: Two, three, four, so, that's five.
Speaker 2: Okay, those were the ones.
Story_ID: 641965
Speaker 1: You mentioned [HistoryMaker] Ozell Sutton.  And he, I know that he also wrote for one of the newspapers, as you did as well.  Is he a friend of yours?
Speaker 2: Ozell I consider to be my longest existing and best friend.  We are very, very close.  We worked together in Little Rock [Arkansas].  He was with the Arkansas Council on Human Relations.  But we also attended the same church, so we got a chance to see--and then with me working with Mrs. Bates [Daisy Bates] as a staff writer for her paper [Arkansas State Press].  And Ozell was on the staff of the Democrat [Arkansas Democrat-Gazette], which was the major white paper.  Ozell was the first journalist to be hired by them.  And together, we worked to integrate the television and radio industry.  We almost singlehandedly, the two of us, working with the assistance of a guy named Lonnie King [Lonnie C. King, Jr.] from Atlanta [Georgia] who was under contract with the Community Relations Service, and who helped us to chart a course to get public, to get public television stations as well as radio stations to hire African Americans.  And this required a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of energy, a lot of convincing, a lot of cajoling, and whatever.  So Ozell and I worked very closely together.  And Ozell became employed as a special assistant to Governor Winthrop Rockefeller.  As a matter of fact, although I was designated as the first black cabinet appointee, Ozell was on the governor's staff when I was appointed, so he got there first, before I did.  And Ozell was, of course, was an advocate for me because there was opposition.  Some folks thought I was too militant to be part of the governor's cabinet, but the governor didn't buy into that, and Ozell, of course, was one of the strong advocates inside on my behalf.  When we chose to come to Atlanta, we came at the same time.  He came with the Community Relations Service in the [U.S.] Department of Justice, and I came with the Office of Economic Opportunity for the eight southeastern states.  And we were offered the opportunity to occupy the home of a guy named T.M. Alexander, Jr., who was being assigned to HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] in Washington [D.C.], and so because he and Janis [Janis Alexander] had this home and they didn't want to sell it, because they didn't know how long they'd be gone.  They asked Ozell and myself to occupy their residence for them.  And so we moved into their home when we came.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: This was '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So we'll talk more about that when we get to the 1970s, okay (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 641966
Speaker 1: Let's go back to, after '57 [1957], '58 [1958], '59 [1959], are you still teaching in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--
Speaker 1: --nineteen sixty [1960]?
Speaker 2: Well, in '50 [1950], yes, I was still teaching in the '50s [1950s], and as a matter of fact I taught all the way up until '65 [1965].   And it was during that time that I became president of the black teachers association, both in Little Rock [Arkansas] and the State of Arkansas [Arkansas Teachers Association Department of Classroom Teachers], and was thrust in the position of having to make some statements regarding how the integration of the students as well as teachers was occurring.  And I made--well, in the, in the testimony before the federal court, both the superintendent of schools in Little Rock [Floyd W. Parsons] and the chair of the school board indicated that they should not be required to integrate faculty, because black teachers were inferior, and didn't, shouldn't be teaching white children.  Well, we'd been teaching black children, and we had degrees from many of the same institutions that whites did, some of the best institutions in the country.  So, how could they deem us, or label us, as being inferior and not capable of teaching white students?  And so as the president of the black teachers association, I asked for a retraction of those statements, and they refused to retract.  And the paper, the newspaper, kept hounding me saying, "What did the superintendent say about the retraction?  What did the board chair say?"  I said, "Well, I haven't heard anything."  They said, "Well, how long do you plan to wait?"  I said, "Well, I need to give them reasonable time."   I didn't want a confrontation with them.  I worked for the superintendent and the chair of the school board.  My livelihood was at stake.  But I was also president of the teachers association and I had an obligation to that.  Anyway, after about six weeks, the paper, the reporters kept calling and they said, "Well, what do you think about them not responding to you, or not at least acknowledging the fact that you've asked for a retraction?"  And I said, "I think it impugns the integrity of every black teacher in this system, and it also impugns their integrity, and I think it is an absolute tragedy that they don't realize the damage they've done to education and to the students as well as teachers in the Little Rock school system."  I got front page--I don't know if they'd had many black folks on the front page of the Little Rock paper, but they had me front page: "Black Teachers Association Attacks Superintendent."  (Laughter) That's what was in the paper.  And the board chair, superintendent and board chair.  Well, from then on, it was a rocky road for me.  They decided that I had tenure as a teacher, but I didn't have tenure as an administrator.  By that time I'd gone to grad school [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona], become certified in guidance and counseling, so I had an administrator's contract, not just a teacher contract.  And so they decided to put me back to a nine month contract, not twelve, cut my salary.  I had a young family, a wife and children, and I could not afford to do that.  I appealed to the Professional Rights and Responsibilities Committee [Professional Rights and Responsibilities Committee on Civil and Human Rights of Educators] of the NEA [National Education Association], and wanted the NEA to provide some support for me.  They said they were not in a position to do that, because the superintendent was a major person in the NEA hierarchy.  And so, then they decided, "Well, why don't you come to work for the NEA?"  Well, I didn't want to work for the NEA.  And it was then that a friend of mine who had lived in Little Rock, but who was a native of Syracuse, told me about an opportunity with the Crusade for Opportunity in Syracuse, New York.  And this was after the school year of 1965.
Story_ID: 641967
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit, just--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so that we can put some dates in here.  Where did you get your, earn your certificate--
Speaker 2: Counseling and guidance?
Speaker 1: Counseling and guidance.
Speaker 2: Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-two [1962], '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went there in '62 [1962] and finished in '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, I wanted to ask you about your position as, with the teachers association.  What other obligations did you fulfill with that organization?  Did it have anything to do with, I guess I want to ask, was it, did it have anything to do with the teachers' salaries?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  We, the organization, before I became president, had filed an action against the district for salary equalization.  They had a different salary scale for black teachers and white teachers.  And a woman named Sue Cowan Williams was the plaintiff, primary plaintiff, in this case.  It was the, when she was president.  But that was prior to me becoming president of the black--and this was a black teachers association.  The associations were segregated and separated.  So, we weren't integrated with--we had a state association called the ATA, the Arkansas Teachers Association [Arkansas Teachers Association Department of Classroom Teachers].  And the white organization was the AEA, the Arkansas Education Association.  So, we were separated.  And, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes. We had situations dealing with that, with the evaluation process, because we wanted to be sure that we were evaluated based on the same criteria in black and white schools.  We wanted to be sure that we had opportunities to seek graduate level credit, that we could have leaves, and those kinds of things.  Those were the kinds of things that as an association we negotiated with the district, with the board, and with the superintendent.  Those were the kinds of things that I had the primary lead responsibility for, and somehow helping to define the image of African American educators, especially in a situation where we had gone through what we did at Central High School [Little Rock, Arkansas]. (Background noise) What is that, a phone or something?
Speaker 1: What was the difference in the pay scale?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure--
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, wait a minute, we got--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): We're good.
Speaker 1: Oh, you're fine? Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure what the var- I just know that there was a variance, that white teachers were paid on one scale and African American teachers on another.  And I'm not sure exactly what the figures were, I just knew they were paid more, and that was the basis for the legal action and the litigation that black teachers initiated.
Speaker 1: Before we go to your move to go to Syracuse [New York], in 1963 you managed a campaign for T.E. Patterson?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was the executive director of the Arkansas Teachers Association, which was the black state association.  And T.E. decided to run for the school board in Little Rock [Arkansas], and I was asked to chair and direct his campaign.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so it was the first time that any black had run for the board.  We thought that the only way we were going to get fairness and equity from the board of education and the superintendent was to have some black participation on the board of education; and so I was asked to manage that campaign, and it was successful.
Story_ID: 641968
Speaker 1: Also this year, Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] is, is assassinated and Lyndon B. Johnson [Lyndon Baines Johnson] becomes president.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about that, what sticks in your mind about that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember it so vividly, because I had followed some of the acts and activities of the Kennedys, and the fact that they had so many ideas.  They had gone to Appalachia to try to delineate and describe some of the inequities, inadequacies and inequities in America.  I just don't think the Kennedys had the kind of political muscle that LBJ brought to the process.  But, of course, he was--especially Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy]--was, as attorney general, was trying to mediate things in the South dealing with the Civil Rights Movement that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had become very active in.  There were a lot of demonstrations.  African American civil rights advocates were being jailed, they were being beaten, water hosed, dogs--nothing was too bad to subject these demonstrators to.  And so the Kennedys attempted to intercede, and I think that probably led to both the deaths of John Kennedy as well as Bobby Kennedy, and certainly Dr. King in Memphis [Tennessee].  We were just dealing with a society and a feeling that, we aren't going to let this happen.  You know, these folks are coming out of slavery, they're coming out of a system of limitations, segregation--and now they think they're going to take over things, and we're not going to let them.  And so they reacted in a very violent manner.  And not only was this violence taking place in the minds and actions of individuals who didn't wear uniforms, but it carried over into the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].  It carried over into the local police departments.  It was designed to frighten and intimidate African Americans, so that we would not seek equality and justice.  That's the way I viewed it, and I was a young professional at the time that it was occurring, and was kind of right in the middle of it.
Story_ID: 641969
Speaker 1: The Clintons are from Arkansas.  Did you know the, Bill Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] family?
Speaker 2: I did not.  I knew Bill because I--when I was appointed as the first African American member of the governor's cabinet in Arkansas and the South, Bill was a law professor at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville [University of Arkansas School of Law, Fayetteville, Arkansas].  He had been to law school [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], he had married Hillary [Hillary Rodham Clinton], and she was from Illinois and from the Rodham family, a very prominent Republican family.  And Bill, of course, was a Democrat.  He had gotten some fame because he went to Boys State [Arkansas Boys State] at Camp Robinson [Camp Joseph T. Robinson, North Little Rock, Arkansas] and was elected head of Boys State, and went on to Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.] and got a law degree and came with fervor, and was on the faculty at the university in the law school.  He thought that it would be an enhancing experience if his law students could hear from Arkansas' first black cabinet member, so he invited to Fayetteville to address his class, and that's when I first met Bill Clinton.  Later on, and maybe I'm jumping the years, my son, as a member of the both the House [Arkansas House of Representatives] and the Senate in Arkansas, my youngest son, became Bill Clinton's floor leader, because the governor's mansion as well as the capitol [Arkansas State Capitol, Little Rock, Arkansas] were both located in my son's House and Senate district.  And so he was given the responsibility by Governor Clinton to be his floor leader in both houses, in the House of Representatives and the Arkansas Senate.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  All right, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the way I got to know Hillary--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is that we had something called the Dunbar Community Center [Little Rock, Arkansas], which was the voting precinct where the Clintons lived and where we lived.  And so I'd be out campaigning for my son, and Hillary would be at the same poll campaigning for Bill.  So she was telling me, she said, "Are you working for Bill?"  And I said, "Yes, I'm working for Bill."  So I was working for Bill Clinton and I was working for Bill Walker [William Walker, Jr.].  And I said, "Are you working for the Bills?"  She said, "I'm working for Clinton and I'm working for Walker."  So we worked together handing out the campaign material and urging people to vote for our candidates.  So that's how I got to meet Hillary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that transposed into when she ran for president.  I was kind of in an awkward situation, because here's an African American running for president, and here is someone that I'd known for years and worked with.  So I became part of Hillary Clinton's campaign committee for the State of Georgia, and I was not with President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] at the time.  Now, when Hillary dropped out of the race and chose to throw her support behind Obama, then I became an Obama supporter (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) His supporter.
Story_ID: 641970
Speaker 1: So now we can move on to you being a part of the Crusade for Opportunity and Head Start program in Syracuse, New York, and we're in 1965.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-five [1965] was, of course, the year I wrapped up my difficulties with the school board chair and the superintendent [Floyd W. Parsons].  So since they were not going to extend my, continue my contract on a twelve month basis, I could not afford that sort of reduction in income.  So I had this job opportunity to go to Syracuse and work for the crusade, since I had been involved in teacher education, and as a teacher, they wanted to launch one of the early Head Start programs.  And so that was part of something called the education division.  They hired me to be the education division director for the Crusade for Opportunity, with study centers and after school enhancement as well as Head Start.  And Head Start was part of the unit that I was responsible for, and as I said, one of the first organized Head Start programs in the country.  And I might add, two of my children were in the Head Start program, because I was able to get, since I was working there, my oldest son [James Walker II] and older daughter [Cheryl Walker] were both enrolled in the Head Start program in Syracuse.
Speaker 1: So, this was a new initiative of President Johnson's [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] War on Poverty?
Speaker 2: This was part of the Great Society, the Economic Opportunity Act [Economic Opportunity Act of 1964], and they called it the War on Poverty.  And of course, the first director was the guy who just died a short while ago named Sargent Shriver [R. Sargent Shriver].  And a guy named Ted Berry [Theodore M. Berry] who was from Cincinnati, Ohio was head of what they called the Community Action Program, and that was programs that were formed at the local level to be the grantee for programs like Head Start and community development, rural development, job training and development.  All those came out of the Economic Opportunity Act and the Great Society that was launched by President Johnson.  Most of these were ideas that the Kennedys had, but the Kennedys never had the political muscle, especially in the South, to get this legislation passed.  And it required a Lyndon Johnson, a lanky boy from Texas, to get that legislation passed.  And we're talking about the Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965], we're talking about the--
Speaker 1: Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Civil Rights Act, and we're talking about the Economic Opportunity Act.  Three of them, '64 [1964] and '65 [1965], is when those occurred.
Story_ID: 641971
Speaker 1: You actually went ahead to lead the team that developed the strategic plan for the National Head Start Association, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ah, well, what happened was as Head Start was being demonstrated--and they really didn't--they had a piece of legislation, but as far as implementing it and how it had to be done, and how you interacted with local elected officials and local educators and people, you had to decide just how it would be done.  And so it was kind of a trial and reaction, or trial and response kind of program.  And I was there during that time, in the early days.  We had to demonstrate it in terms of how would it work, and how would we give guidance to it, how would we regulate it, how would we provide oversight for it.  And so I was there at that time, so it was my opportunity to be part of reacting, responding with those who were making the decisions, the policy decisions, in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, how long did you work in that position?
Speaker 2: I worked for a year and a half at the Crusade for Opportunity [Syracuse, New York], and they had just formed a similar program in Little Rock [Arkansas], where I had just left--the teaching, the school system.  When they formed that agency [Economic Opportunity Agency of Pulaski County], they said this organization needs to have some black leadership at the top.  Now, they didn't have the blacks as head of the agency, but they tried, if there was a significant black population, they tried to at least recruit somebody at the senior level.  If not the deputy director, some of the program director, director, positions, such as what I had had in Syracuse [New York].  Well, they asked me to come down and be interviewed for the deputy director job.  There was a guy named Victor Ray that was already in the director's position, but they wanted an African American who they felt could do that job to come and interview.  So I went down and interviewed.  And it just so happened it was at a time when we'd had a snowstorm in Syracuse that you would not believe.  We'd also had the blackout on the eastern seaboard where they didn't have heat, didn't have lights.  And my son, my youngest son [William Walker, Jr.], had left his baseball glove out in the yard on the night before it snowed, and he didn't find that glove for three months.  And they were ready to leave Syracuse--too much snow and too much cold weather.  And so when I got the opportunity to interview, they said, "Daddy, please take the job so we can go home."  (Laughter) And so I went back for the interview.  Ironically, one of the other persons in the po- line for the position was Daisy Bates, whom I'd worked with with the Little Rock Nine.  And they chose, because of my work experience in Syracuse, they chose to offer me the opportunity to be the deputy director.  And I was there for a very short term before the director decided to go into labor union work, and so I was given the opportunity to become the executive director.
Story_ID: 641972
Speaker 1: I want to get it on tape.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: It's no sense in you just telling me.  I want the world to know about this (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I'm just trying to make a distinction--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --between EOA [Economic Opportunity Agency of Pulaski County] and the governor's appointees.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, the governor's appointee is state--
Speaker 1: Okay, let's (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that was in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Go ahead and tell me the progression.  From 1967, you go--
Speaker 2: I came back to Arkansas--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as director of, deputy director of EOA.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And a very short time later I became director of EOA, which was for Little Rock [Arkansas] and Pulaski County [Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In late '68 [1968], the governor [Winthrop Rockefeller] appointed me to head the state Office of Economic Opportunity, and as a member of his cabinet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I stayed there in '69 [1969] and '70 [1970].  And then in '70 [1970] the--
Speaker 1: Before we go to '70 [1970], let's finish out the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When you come back to Arkansas in '67 [1967], I think you talked a little bit about, is this the time that you helped integrate the television stations and personalities, and bank tellers and stuff.
Speaker 2: Well, this happened--
Speaker 1: Or is that something separate?
Speaker 2: I may have very well been at the state when I was doing that.  I think--now, I was very active in the community.  I was a community activist when I was with the local program in the county.  But that was kind of some overlap in terms of working in the community to accomplish things like getting persons to be cashiers in grocery stores, car salespeople.  We were trying to integrate every aspect of the economy, Ozell [HistoryMaker Ozell Sutton] and I, on this kind of thing.  But I think the television part of this, anchor part of this, occurred while I was at the state, on the Rockefeller cabinet.
Story_ID: 641973
Speaker 1: Tell me, what is the Kerner Commission [National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders]?
Speaker 2: Kerner? Hm (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is that how you say it?  Do you know what that is?  In, it was some kind of commission--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or report, I guess it was, that had to do with the race riots in '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They were evaluating what was causing the riots, and especially out of the thing in California that occurred in Los Angeles.  That's really what brought the nation's attention, was the riots, race riots in California, and the burnings and so forth.  And then they had a thing in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] that occurred, in Newark [New Jersey], many of the urban cities all over the place.  But much of it came as a result of Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] killing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was killed in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Talk to me about that time.  And what, where you were and what you were thinking about those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was with the community action agency in Little Rock [Arkansas] when Dr. King was killed.  I was working for EOA [Economic Opportunity Agency of Pulaski County].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I will never forget.  I was at the regional office in Austin, Texas having dinner with Barbara Jordan when he was killed, that's where I was.  A woman named Barbara Jordan who was one of the first congresspeople from Texas.  We were having dinner together on a street called San Jacinto [Boulevard].  In a restaurant--we were both staying at the same hotel, and I met her down in the dining room and we decided to have dinner together, and we got the word on Dr. King.
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts?  What were your feelings about this?
Speaker 2: This was an awfully gray day in America and in the world.  I just couldn't think of anything that could have been worse for the movement and for the mood of the country, than to take away the nonviolent champion, you know, and we were certainly trying to avoid violence.  You know, the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] movement, the sit-in movement, the bus routes to various places, all were--and the registration efforts, people like Fannie Lou Hamer who was going down trying to get folks registered to vote and being subjected to violence, put in jail, and that kind of thing.   We were trying to avoid violence.  We were trying to practice the philosophy of Dr. King.  And it was dark, it was difficult, because we were being subjected to violence--beaten, bitten by dogs, and had water thrown on us by fire hoses and those kind of things.
Speaker 1: You and [HistoryMaker] Ozell Sutton were very good friends.  And what did he tell you about when King was killed, because actually he was there at the Lorraine hotel [Lorraine Motel, Memphis, Tennessee] when the assassination occurred.  Did you talk to him soon after that, or?
Speaker 2: I talked to him soon after that, but not the same day.  Ozell was not available for several days after the killing.  I'm sure he was being debriefed by his agency, 'cause by that time Ozell was with the justice department Community Relations Service [for the U.S. Department of Justice].  So he was traveling in his official capacity to be in areas where there would likely be some violence, you know.  And because they were demonstrating with the sanitation workers, and that's why Dr. King was there, Ozell was on site because of the potential of something occurring was certainly there.
Speaker 1: What was your conversation like with him about this situation?
Speaker 2: Just how bad it's going to be for the country, and they've taken away the nonviolent crusader, and you know we still had Malcolm alive [sic.] and others who didn't necessarily embrace nonviolence, you know.  You're supposed to do to them what they do to us.  And so many of us thought that the philosophy of Malcolm X would begin to become the order of the day, and Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] and others who were part of a movement that was not nearly as nonviolent focused as Dr. King's.  So we were concerned about violence becoming the order of the day for us.  And the only vehicle--if they're going to kill the nonviolent champion, where does that leave us, except to respond with like violence, an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
Story_ID: 641974
Speaker 1: I want to talk a little bit about Governor Rockefeller [Winthrop Rockefeller].  Tell me about your relationship with him, working in his administration.  What was it like?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, he probably describes it in books about us as well as anybody.  He's quoted as saying when he first appointed me that we didn't agree on everything but he was impressed with the fact that whatever I worked on I was able to get it done, and I was a person who would do what I said I would do.  And that he felt that in spite of the fact that many of his advisors and aides had encouraged him not to appoint me, he felt that it was an appointment that he could live with and be proud of.  So, I remember I was in New Orleans [Louisiana] at a meeting, and they had a semi-riot in Little Rock [Arkansas].  And Governor Rockefeller sent a plane, a jet plane, to pick me up and bring me back because he thought that Sonny Walker [HistoryMaker William "Sonny" Walker] was the only one that could quell the violence that was occurring, because some of the young blacks had gotten a cache of guns.  A guy [James Leonard] came through there from Oklahoma [sic. Missouri] and he knew about the racial tensions in Little Rock, so he figured they could use some guns.  And so he stopped by a service station and asked the guy how to get in touch with Bobby Brown and Bobby Broadwater [Bob Broadwater], and some others who were part of the Black United Youth, BUY, they called it, Black United Youth.  And they were able to get several hundred guns.  And so when the word got out about those guns--by the way, when the guy met them to sell them the guns, they took the guns from him and so he didn't get his money, but they got the guns.  So everybody was upset, because these youngsters had all those guns.  And that's why the governor sent the plane for me.  He said, "I don't know anybody that can reason with these guys but you, and I need you to get to it."  I was able to get every gun but one, every single gun, but one.  And we confiscated those guns and turned them over to the authorities.  And so the riot--a National Guardsman had been, had his heel shot off on his feet, on his shoes, had his heel shot off.  They were really frightened.  And, so, we got back and quelled the tension and restored order.   And most of these youngsters are the youngsters I had worked with and, were in the community, and they responded to me, and the governor appreciated that.   And so did Ozell [HistoryMaker Ozell Sutton], because he didn't have the same level of communications with them that I had because I was working with them in the trenches.  Ozell's broader, had a broader reach.  I was just there in the county, he had the entire state.  And so, no, I guess by that time I was at the state, too, as well.
Story_ID: 641975
Speaker 1: So, you're in that position until 1970.  And what happens next?  What happens in 1970?
Speaker 2: Governor Rockefeller [Winthrop Rockefeller] was defeated by Dale Bumpers.  Dale Bumpers was a lawyer who was a Democrat, and Arkansas was a Democrat state.  We just hadn't had a decent Democrat to run since Faubus [Orval Faubus] and there were a bunch of others, White Citizens' Council people, all kind of terrible folks running as Democrats.  And Dale Bumpers was a reasonable person running for governor, and he defeated Rockefeller.  And he defeated him because a lot of his opposition had pictures of him standing on the capitol steps when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed singing 'We Shall Overcome,' with the blacks.  So they painted him as being a black--a person who embraced and loved black folks and wanted black folks to take over the state.  So that's the kind of stuff they put out there about Rockefeller.  Anyway, he was defeated.  And Bumpers became--Bumpers invited me to remain in the cabinet, in his administration, but I chose to decline.  And I chose to decline because by staying--he reorganized state government and he had what is called the super cabinet.  And the persons in the cabinet reported to one of these super people.  And I was not going to be a super person.  And so I didn't have direct access to the governor.  And I had chose to--although I'd had that with Rockefeller--and I chose to leave.  So I resigned, and was recruited to come to head the, a division of the HUD office in [U.S.] Department of Housing and Urban Development in Arkansas.
Story_ID: 641976
Speaker 1: In Arkansas?
Speaker 2: In Arkansas.  That was not in Atlanta [Georgia].  This was the department--not housing and urban renewal, but housing and urban development, HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development].  And I was in the Little Rock [Arkansas] office, which had responsibility for all of Arkansas and East Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what specific programs was HUD running at that time?
Speaker 2: Ah, all kind of 3D [ph.], 325 [ph.], all kinds of programs to help people with ownership of homes.  It had public housing at that time as part of its portfolio.  Economic--equal opportunity, non-discrimination, in terms of housing and rental as well as purchasing and that kind of thing.  So HUD was in the housing business in a non-discriminatory kind of way to help folks not only acquire homes under HHA, I mean FHA [Federal Housing Administration], but also to teach people how to treat homes.  There were folk who had never been in a place with running water.  You had to train those folks how to flush toilets, how to turn on water and turn water off, and those kind of things.  So that's what HUD was doing at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And now they have something called the FHH--the--what is it, it--they deal with community development--CDBG.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: CDBG, Community Development Block Grant.  They make block grants to cities and states to help with development, to create a more positive environment for things to occur.  Recreation centers, things that cities want to do to create a better environment, to go green, for example.   That's what the HUD focus is now, community development.  Rather than making grants to particular programs, they make them to the local communities and then they sub-grant it for the various programs.
Speaker 1: Right. Well, I see in, at that time public housing was something that they were, were doing, and now, they're actually tearing down all the public housing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What's--
Speaker 2: They're trying to eliminate the disparity between the income levels of people in public housing and others, so they, they're trying now to mix folks of different and varying income levels staying together rather than having the Techwood type homes [Techwood Homes, Atlanta, Georgia] or the Grady Homes [Atlanta, Georgia] where you have just poor folks in public housing.  They want a mixed group of folk in HUD assisted or federally assisted housing in the community.  And they have varying rates that you have to pay, in the same area.  You know, you, you, you, you'll have one group, somebody may pay one hundred dollars a month, somebody else might pay twelve hundred dollars a month, and they can be next door to each other.  That's the philosophy now, of having the residents mixed in terms of income and all other areas.
Speaker 1: So, you stay at HUD until when?
Speaker 2: I stayed at HUD until 1972--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that's when I was asked to come to Atlanta to become regional director of OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity].
Story_ID: 641977
Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is William, W-I-L-L-I-A-M, Sonny, S-O-N-N-Y, in quotes.  The last name is Walker, W-A-L-K-E-R [HistoryMaker William "Sonny" Walker].
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Twelve, thirteen, thirty-three, December 13th, 1933.
Speaker 1: And where?
Speaker 2: I was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, I am now a full time consultant.  I am spending most of my time now with the Center for Civil and Human Rights [Atlanta, Georgia], which is under development, or construction; not quite construction yet.  We will break ground in June in the Centennial Olympic Park [Atlanta, Georgia], on property that was donated by The Coca-Cola Company [Atlanta, Georgia].  One of the things that will be featured will be the papers and works of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And it is really what I'm spending most of my time doing these days, other than being on volunteer boards, including being vice chair of the Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] board of directors.  And I'm also working with FACAA, the Fulton Atlanta Community Action Authority [Atlanta, Georgia], as a consultant.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is the, is this the 17th or 18th?  I believe this is the 18th of March, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are at 710 Peachtree Street at the Solace building [Solace on Peachtree], which is my residence.  And we're here in one of the rooms on the lobby level.
Speaker 1: All right.  And we're continuing an interview that we started over a year ago I guess, in 2011.  And we're starting on roll seven.
Story_ID: 641978
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-two [1972], now, you, you--tell us about your move from Arkansas to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: I had, after leaving state government after having been appointed by Governor Winthrop Rockefeller as the first African American to serve in a southern governor's cabinet--and this was in the State of Arkansas--I then left after he was not reelected.  I left state government and joined the federal system in Little Rock [Arkansas] with the [U.S.] Department of Housing and Urban Development.  Ironically, the secretary of HUD at the time was former Michigan governor George Romney [George W. Romney], who is the father of the person who is vying for the president's seat now, Mitt Romney.  But his father was my secretary at the time.  So, I worked at the HUD office, the area office of HUD in Little Rock, until I was extended an opportunity to come to Atlanta as a federal regional administrator.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how was that transition?  Was it easy to make the transition from Little Rock to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Well, it required some adjustments, because I'd spent most of my life in Arkansas except for a stint in Syracuse, New York.  I went up to Upstate New York where I was trying to adjust to the cold weather.  But that was really about the only time.  Other than being away in school, it was the only time that I had been away from the State of Arkansas, and coming--leaving my family.  Because my children were in school, most of them, all of them at the time.  So, it was an adjustment to come to another city where I had to kind of do an assessment of what the schools were like, what housing was like, and what living here was like.  But I was able to make the adjustment okay.  And so I got here, and at the time, the office, the regional office was in the building next door.  This is 710 Peachtree [Street], and my office was 730 Peachtree.  And I chose to live in this building because of its proximity to the office.
Story_ID: 641979
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-two [1972], and correct me if I'm wrong, but it's the beginning of like a boom in Atlanta [Georgia], in a lot of ways.  Atlanta starts really to make a national impact as a national city in a lot of ways.
Speaker 2: Well, Atlanta, of course, was beginning to feel the benefits of Hartsfield International Airport [William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport], which is now Hartsfield-Jackson [Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia].  It had been vying with southern communities like Charlotte [North Carolina] and Birmingham [Alabama].  But because of the airport, and because of the trucking facilities and highways that Atlanta had, it began to kind of move ahead of other southern cities, but primarily because of the Hartsfield International Airport.  Lots of folks from, throughout the Southeast of course, would come here to fly not only to other places nationally, but internationally.  So, Atlanta started becoming an international city.
Speaker 1: And I think also a lot of the people who were, who worked in the Civil Rights Movement, you know, seemed to converge on Atlanta (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, that's very true.  And I think that that's attributable to the Atlanta University Center schools.  That truly has made a difference with the existence of Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia], which was a graduate school, and one of the few African American graduate schools in the South.  And later it was merged with Clark College [Atlanta, Georgia], and became CAU [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  But there was the Morehouse school, Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] at that time.  Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], Clark College, Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia], all of those were part of the Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia].  And yes, that drew a lot of talent to this city.  Lots of students came here to go to school, and many of them chose to try to stay here.  So it gave this city a tremendous source of talent to grow.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.  Those are the days I think at Atlanta U, with [HistoryMaker] Vincent Harding and the Center for the Black World [sic. Institute of the Black World].
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: A lot of the former organizers were coming to Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: From the North.
Speaker 2: They certainly did.  And of course you had the student movement at Atlanta, you had kind of coming on the basis of the Greensboro Four episode, and SNCC, the formation of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  It was a place of real civil rights activity.  And of course I had been accustomed to that as well, because I had been in Little Rock [Arkansas] during the time of the integration of Little Rock Central [Central High School] and the Little Rock Nine.  So, I was a bit acclimated to civil rights issues, and so I felt right at home here.  They had a regional office of the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] headed by a man named Donald Hollowell, and the office of civil rights [U.S. Commission on Civil Rights] headed by a gentleman named Bobby Doctor.  They were the two black regional administrators prior to my coming.  And I had the opportunity to be the initial black regional administrator with budget money to award to states and to local governments, as well as private sector organizations.
Story_ID: 641980
Speaker 1: This is a time of a lot of growth and development.  And so you came here with HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development], but (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I came from HUD.
Speaker 1: Yeah, from HUD to OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity].
Speaker 2: OEO, exactly.
Speaker 1: OEO, all right.
Speaker 2: Sure did.
Speaker 1: From HUD to OEO.
Speaker 2: Sure did.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And then the other thing that was going here was the voter education program [Voter Education Project].  There was a lot of efforts to register African Americans to vote.  And people like Wiley Branton [Wiley A. Branton, Sr.] and Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], high profile, great Americans, were part of that initiative.  And so it became kind of the cradle of the voter registration issue in the South.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, so what did you do with OEO?  I mean what were some of the issues that you had to deal with, in terms of being the regional director of OEO?
Speaker 2: Well, I assumed responsibility for staff with substantial federal dollars available to award, based on applications submitted or proposals submitted from the eight southeastern states.  The office here was responsible for the granting of awards to the states of Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky--and did I say Kentucky?  Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Florida, those were the eight states that were part of what they called Region IV or the Southeast region.
Story_ID: 641981
Speaker 1: Now this is during the days of the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] administration (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And there have been I know authors and historians looking back at that era find there was, there seemed to be--this is the area, the era when affirmative action--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --started.  Black capitalism programs under the Nixon administration funded, and other things.
Speaker 2: It was called the Office of Minority Business Enterprise, MBDA [Minority Business Development Agency].
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And of course, affirmative action started out during that administration headed by a young man named Art Fletcher [HistoryMaker Arthur Fletcher].  And he launched it in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and they called it the Philadelphia Plan.  But it was also assistant secretaries with HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development], people like Sam Jackson [Samuel C. Jackson] and Sam Simmons [Samuel J. Simmons] and folk like that, that really reached out to the African American businesspeople and others and said, "Let's have a partnership with the government.  And let's try to see if we can't affect some change in the way things are going on in the country."  And John Jenkins was appointed to be the head of the Office of Minority Business Enterprise.  Also, at the same time, Ben Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks] was appointed to be head of the television and radio awarding of those opportunities, to have radio stations and be involved with television stations.  But that was prior to the time that he went to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Ben had been a practicing lawyer in Memphis [Tennessee], and was attracted to come here [Atlanta, Georgia] as well, or come to Washington [D.C.].  Then we had folks like Stan Scott [Stanley S. Scott], who went to the White House, and T.M. Alexander, Jr., who also went to HUD in Washington.  Sam Sparks [Samuel Sparks] with the Department of Treasury [U.S. Department of the Treasury].  A young man named Bob Brown [Robert J. Brown] from High Point, North Carolina was on the president's staff.  It was a good time for things to go on, and a good time for African Americans to have the opportunity to serve and to grow.
Speaker 1: I know Nixon doesn't get a lot of love from the black community normally, but during that part of the administration the--it's like the economics were really coming together and--
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: --especially in this part of the country.
Story_ID: 641982
Speaker 1: Well there's, there's just no doubt about it, that those things were beginning to happen.  And at that time, I think the actual image of the various political parties were different.  The Democrats at that time were, tended to be southerners, in terms of southern governors, southern members of the [U.S.] Congress who really stood to try to retard the progress of African Americans.  And what happened is a guy named Strom Thurmond from the State of South Carolina started a turnaround, and advocated that those Democrats move over and take over the Republican Party.  And that's when the Republican Party, as it is today, kind of took over the South and just did not welcome the involvement or participation of African Americans and women.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now that was in reaction I guess to the northern Democrats, Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] and the Kennedys and so forth, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lyndon Johnson wasn't a northerner.  But he was a good Texas guy.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: But certainly they had some Democrats.  They had the meeting in Chicago [Illinois] where Fannie Lou Hamer and others went and crashed the Democratic Convention in Chicago, with--
Speaker 2: No, you're talking about Atlantic City [New Jersey] in '87 [1987]--'64 [1964], '64 [1964], yeah [1964 Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Well, Chicago [1968 Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois] and Atlantic City.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was the time that Fannie Lou ushered the comment, "I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.  And we've got to turn things around."  And so a lot of emphasis--LBJ had helped pass the Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965], the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964], the Economic Opportunity Act [Economic Opportunity Act of 1964].  And that was the Great Society that helped to revolutionize the country.
Speaker 2: So I guess at a certain point the leadership of both major political parties was somewhat moderate.  And the Dixiecrats, or the southern Democrats, felt left out of the picture.
Speaker 1: Well, it certainly was causing change.  They were accustomed to being in charge.  They were accustomed to blacks staying in their place, and their place was not to grow and flourish and to move up to be mayors and commissioners and governors, and that kind of thing.  And then here comes Virginia with Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder], a southern state, and they elect a southern governor.  Here comes Leroy Johnson [Leroy R. Johnson], who was elected to the Georgia Senate [Georgia State Senate], and used that power to restore the boxing career of Muhammad Ali.  Muhammad Ali would not have achieved the greatness label if Leroy Johnson, Senator Leroy Johnson of Georgia, had not sponsored and promoted the flight--the fight between he and Jerry Quarry here in Atlanta [Georgia] that enabled him to come back to the ring after he had been barred.
Speaker 2: This was like 1971, '72 [1972]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, somewhere in there, yes.
Speaker 2: Seventy-one [1971].
Speaker 1: Sure was.
Story_ID: 641983
Speaker 1: When you look back at it historically, it seems astounding that in '68 [1968] King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is killed--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and then in 1973, Maynard Jackson's mayor of Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, how does--tell us about what happened in that interim as far as--because you're just coming to Atlanta yourself in '72 [1972].  But--
Speaker 2: I was coming in '72 [1972]--
Speaker 1: But the campaign, was the campaign already started for mayor?
Speaker 2: The campaigns were started, underway.  Maynard had first attempted to run for governor.  And later, Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] tried to run for governor.  And both of them missed the first time around.  But then they huddled with people like Jesse Hill, who was a real strategist for those things, and Dr. Clarence Bacote [Dr. Clarence A. Bacote], who was out at the Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] in public affairs and government kinds of issues.  And those folks sat down with Andy and with Maynard, and said, "Here's what you're going to have to do if you're going to be successful.  And one of the things you're going to have to do is get people registered to vote.  We cannot win elections if we're not eligible to vote."  And that's why much of what occurred in the South, starting in Atlanta, was initiated by the increased number of African Americans who became registered voters.
Speaker 1: Now, did African Americans traditionally over the years have the right to vote in Atlanta like they did in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Well, not greatly.  Let me tell you.  There was a time, and I remember it vividly, when if you were going to vote in a primary in the South, you had to vote Republican, because you couldn't vote as a Democrat.  The Democrats did not allow blacks--they had all kinds of prohibitions.  They would call you in and give you a test, "How many bubbles in a bar of soap?"  They'd have a jar of beans and ask you, "How many beans are in there?"  And you'd have to do--guessing things.  Or, you had a poll tax, like we had in Arkansas.  And on occasions, those who owned the farms and the plantations would pay the poll tax for African Americans and then vote for them.  And so, you didn't have your own vote.  Those were the kinds of things that were happening.  And the Democrats were in charge of the politics of the South.  And then, as I said, those same Democrats decided to switch over and become parts of the Republican Party, and that's why even today the South is primarily Republican.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So did that move by the Dixiecrats to the Republican Party make it possible for African Americans to register to vote in increasing numbers?  Or was it the opposite way?
Speaker 2: Well, because many blacks went to jail, because many blacks were beaten, because of things like the--what happened on the Edmund Pettus Bridge over in Selma [Alabama], and Rosa Parks, and Birmingham [Alabama], and the work of Dr. King and Reverend Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy] and Joseph Lowery [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph Lowery], and those people who were part of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]--but especially because of Dr. King's efforts--working at it nonviolently to achieve nonviolent change--young people got involved.  It just made a difference.  And we then were on television, so the whole world could see what was going on as we were bitten by dogs, as police officers would club us down, as dogs would bite us; just trying to vote, just trying to be part of the political system.  Those were the things that were going on.  Somebody said the other day, and I thought it was very classic, that [President] Abraham Lincoln would not qualify today to be in the Republican Party.  I thought that was pretty classic.
Speaker 1: Okay, because of what? What were they saying?
Speaker 2: Well, he just was, his views were inconsistent with--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --the current policies and practices.
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean it's so conservative these days.
Speaker 2: That's it, that is it.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: And they, and they don't embrace people without means.  It seems to, that most of it is about supporting those who have means.  And those that don't, just don't get very much consideration.
Story_ID: 641984
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-two [1972] then, a lot of the voting restrictions had been pulled away, and black people could register to vote here in Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: They were beginning to.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: This was transitional.  This didn't all just happen overnight.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, but--
Speaker 2: This was transitional.  But because of the AVEP, Atlanta Voter Education Program [sic. Voter Education Project], and the work of people like Wiley Branton [Wiley A. Branton, Sr.] and Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], they really started registering African Americans to vote.  They talked about the importance of voting, and the fact that you weren't going to be a full citizen unless you got involved in the voting process.  And then at the same time, they were working to eradicate the barriers to them being able to register and vote.  And the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] got involved and it, as I said, SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], all of those organizations were kind of working in the same arena to create greater opportunities for African Americans and women.  They always carried that along with them.  It's not, it has never been just a race issue.  It's also been a gender issue.  Because women have traditionally been discriminated against as well, just like African Americans.  Women had a place to stay in, and so did blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, in 1972, what were the demographics of Atlanta like?  I mean did black people stand a chance, in terms of numbers?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you had people that had--because of Dr. King and this being his birthplace, people like Mayor Ivan Allen [Ivan Allen, Jr.] was elected.  And these were reasonable individuals who didn't want to preserve the old past and the way it was.  And then the young fellow, a Jewish man named Sam Massell was elected mayor.  He appointed blacks to--and women to his cabinet.  And so, because of those high profile kind of appointments, blacks started getting involved.  And they started believing that maybe I do have certain rights; maybe I can be involved; maybe I can get a job; maybe I can vote; and maybe I can run for office.  And those things started happening.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But I was asking were blacks the majority of the population in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: Did they stand a chance--
Speaker 2: Not at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They weren't blacks.  As a matter of fact, as I said, the first time that both Andy, and--Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young], and Maynard Jackson ran they were defeated, they did not win.  And of course, Maynard became the first African American mayor to win an election in this city.  And then Andy actually went to [U.S.] Congress in the seat that [HistoryMaker] John Lewis now holds, before he then came back and ran for mayor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So at the time, you're saying there were more white people in Atlanta than black?
Speaker 2: More whites in Atlanta (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) in '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: --than, in '72 [1972] than blacks, yes.
Story_ID: 641985
Speaker 1: So what was the strategy to get the white vote, or I mean to get a portion of the white vote to?
Speaker 2: Well, there, there again, a lot of persons had been influenced by Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] way of doing things: nonviolent social change.  We had labor unions that believed in it, and supported those kinds of things.  And we had a national kind of presence.  We had folk who were convinced by Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] that the only way America was going to be a great nation is that we utilize the talents of all Americans.  And so, whites started voting for things that helped and supported African Americans.  The state legislature started having some, enacting some laws that were favorable to blacks.  Then you had the Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965] that was, you know, affected by, certain things they could not do in the South unless they were able to get confirmation from the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] or from the court.  And so lots of things began happening, much of it because of favorable [U.S.] Supreme Court decisions, because of some favorable legislation coming down from Washington [D.C.], and then it created an environment where even change was occurring in the Georgia legislature [Georgia General Assembly] and other southern legislatures.  We still had the Wallace era.  George Wallace was hanging on in the State of Alabama.  But even he started to make some changes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, were you involved in the camp- the Jackson campaign at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, absolutely.  Anytime any African American had the courage to run for office, I thought I at least needed to have the courage to support him or her.  Absolutely, I sure did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I later was appointed by both Mayor Jackson and Mayor Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] to represent Atlanta [Georgia] on the metropolitan rapid transit board, it's called MARTA [Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority].  So, I was one of Atlanta's representatives on the MARTA board during both the Jackson and the Young administration.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was the election of Maynard Jackson a surprise to most people here?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it was a surprise to everybody.  But it came about as a result of a lot of hard work, a lot of planning, a lot of unity, and some biracial support from whites.
Story_ID: 641986
Speaker 1: How long were you the head of the OEO (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I, from 1972 until Richard, I'm sorry, Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] became president.  And when--
Speaker 1: That was 1980, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when he became president, into his administration I chose to go into the private sector.  And I left and moved over to what is called the National Alliance of Business, or NAB, which was a creative new approach to helping African Americans and women access new and different positions in the workforce.  The National Alliance of Business believed in training and preparing the workforce in the way that it was needed, in order to succeed in that workforce and be productive.  And so, I went over to the--I had the same geographic area, the eight southeastern states.  And I became the vice president, regional vice president of the National Alliance of Business, and that's when I left.  Of course, the fate of OEO and CSA at that time was being threatened, because--
Speaker 1: Now, what is CSA?
Speaker 2: CSA was the Community Services Administration.  That was the subsequent naming for the Office of Economic Opportunity.  As you know, when Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] was--well, when he left office, he was impeached.  And when he left, then Lyndon--not Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], Gerald Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Gerald Ford.
Speaker 2: Gerald Ford had been made vice president.  He wasn't elected, but he moved into that position.  And during the time that Gerald Ford was president, the name of OEO was changed from the Office of Economic Opportunity to the Community Services Administration, and that was when they were attempting to abolish it.  They appointed a guy named Howard Phillips [Howard J. Phillips], and his primary objective was to eliminate the Community Services Administration, or the former OEO.  I saw that coming, and I chose to leave and go another place when I had the opportunity, where I could continue to do things that I felt were in keeping with the progress that the blacks and women were beginning to make.
Story_ID: 641987
Speaker 1: When you look back at that time that you served, what were I guess the highlights or the major issues you had to deal with?
Speaker 2: Well, economic parity was key.  Now, one of the things I had started when I was with OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity] is, they were beginning to have black banks crop up, the Citizens Trust Bank in Atlanta [Georgia].  We had a bank in Augusta [Georgia] that was created by a man named President Walker [ph.].  And you had a Memphis [Tennessee] bank that Ben Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks] and the Walker family there, Maceo Walker [A. Maceo Walker] and the Universal Life Insurance Company folks started, called the Tri-State Bank.  They had started banks in North Carolina, in places like Durham.  And so, blacks were beginning to want to be involved with economic kinds of things, so that they would have some degree of economic independence.  And so I wanted to be a part of that movement.  And so I started encouraging--while I was in the government--encouraging local communities and agencies to invest money or deposit money into the African American banks.  And that started to make a difference.  And then of course with job barriers beginning to come down, it meant that black families had more money.  We started getting more support for HBCUs, and of course, HBCUs are historically black colleges [historically black colleges and universities].  And if blacks are going to do anything economically, and in government, they're going to have to be better educated.  And we felt the way for blacks to be better educated was for us to have better historically black colleges, because that's where most of us were going, and Atlanta was a cradle for that, with the Atlanta university system [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia].  And of course, most of the HBCUs were in the State of North Carolina.  They have more in North Carolina than they do in Georgia.  They had schools like A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] that had engineering programs.  You had Shaw [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], you had--
Speaker 1: Winston-Salem.
Speaker 2: Winston-Salem State [Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina].  You had Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina] for girls there, Voorhees College in South Carolina [Denmark, South Carolina], South Carolina State [South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  And then in (unclear) Columbia [South Carolina] you had Benedict [Benedict College] and Allen [Allen University].  So you had schools all over the place, and we were beginning to get some aid with which to pay that tuition.  And so, we started getting degrees.  We started being better trained.  Our young folk had greater ambition, and they started trying to prepare themselves in high school and earlier grades to go to college, to be admitted to college.  And then we started trying to break barriers down at other schools like the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia], like Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], like North Carolina Central [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina], like Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina], like Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee], schools of that nature in the South that we were beginning to say, "You've got to lower those barriers, because we have a right to apply for these schools as well."  These are public schools, many of them.  Some were private schools, but they were getting public dollars to support them.  So, barriers just kind of started coming down all over the place, and enhanced opportunities were making itself available.
Story_ID: 641988
Speaker 1: I was asking you about NAB [National Alliance of Business].  So, that was a natural transition from what you were doing at OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity] I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, certainly, except it was focused on the workforce and access to the workforce, and better jobs.  You know, there was a time when there were certain jobs that were categorized as black folk's jobs.  They tended to require a lot of muscle and backbreaking work, not ideas, not thoughts, not knowledge, not intelligence.  And the same thing was that women were kind of classified to be in certain jobs.  "That's a woman's job, not a man's job."  I mean we didn't have CEOs that were women at the time.  That was just tradition, and especially in the South.  But, really nationally, you didn't have an awful lot of women CEOs anywhere, I don't care how far north you went or how far west you went.  You had job categories: black folk's jobs, women's jobs, white folk's jobs, and men's jobs.  And so we had to break down those barriers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay. So how long were you with NAB?
Speaker 2: I was with NAB for eight years, I believe, eight years.
Story_ID: 641989
Speaker 1: I want to go back to, I guess 1976 I guess.  You're still at OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity] then, but you became involved as a member of the board of directors of The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: I certainly did, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King] was launching an initiative to try to create something in memory of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And she wanted a place where his papers could be made available, where archives could be there, and where students could go in and learn.  And most of those things had been in the basement of her home.  And so she started an initiative with some federal support to build a center.  We first started when we created the observance of King Week and things.  We were over on the Atlanta University campus [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And from there, we started working out of some homes down on Auburn Avenue, which was near where Dr. King was born.  And we would plan King Week in some of those houses down on Auburn Avenue until we were able to begin to get some support from Corporate America, from individuals, as well as from the government to build the Martin Luther King Center for Nonviolent Social Change.
Speaker 1: Now, was there, what kind of discussion was it?  I know over the years there's been debate about what the center was going to actually be like, and be for.  And the name implies that it's a center for nonviolent change.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, what was the discussion on the board in terms of what the direction of the center would be?  Would it be more of a museum or action oriented?
Speaker 2: Well, we wanted to have a little bit of both.  We wanted it to be something that people who visited Atlanta [Georgia] could come to and learn about Dr. King and his philosophy, to learn about nonviolence.  We were able to sell books and pamphlets, and all kinds of speeches and copies of speeches, and those kind of things, so that the word of Dr. King, the philosophy of Dr. King, could be disseminated and shared with people not only around the country but around the world.  At that time, Atlanta was beginning to draw tourists from around the world.  And as folk would come to Atlanta, we would encourage them to come to The King Center.  Some of us became board members of the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, which helps to lure visitors to the city, and which attempts to lure conventions to the city.  And so, Mrs. King was very visionary about those kind of things, and that's what she wanted the center to be.  But she also wanted it to reach out.  So, we had training teams that went around to various cities and other countries to talk about nonviolent social change, to really train folk how to effect social change nonviolently.  And those teams still exist today, and they go to other countries and they go to other states.  And you have King commissions around the country.  As you know, when we were able to enact the holiday [Martin Luther King Jr. Day], there were a number of states who were slow in adopting the holiday, but we kept working at it, kept working with those states and working with those governors, and working with those communities until they all kind of started embracing the philosophy that Dr. King's birthday should be observed and celebrated.  And that happened.
Story_ID: 641990
Speaker 1: I have a note here that you were, became a speechwriter for Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King].
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  Now, Mrs. King always had a basic speechwriter, a young fellow named Steve Klein.  But I kind of was a fireball.  (Laughter) Steve was kind of low key.  And so when Mrs. King was doing the State of the Dream--she would be expected every year during King Week to do the State of the Dream, and it became my responsibility to assist Mrs. King in the actual delivery of the speech.  And sometimes I would put little phrases in there that would help her to truly get the attention of the listeners.  I also worked with Mrs. King on adopting her use of the teleprompter.  There we noticed that Mrs. King had some difficulty turning pages, and sometimes if the wind would blow the pages would be blown off of the podium, and that was a problem.  So what we did is we got Mrs. King acclimated to learning how to use that little gadget, and it made a tremendous difference.  Her speeches really became penetrating and effective.  She was able to concentrate more because of the teleprompter.  Because the ideas and the words were flowing in front of her, she didn't have to turn pages, she didn't have to lose where she was, and she became a much more effective deliverer of the speeches.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I'm proud that I was able to contribute a little bit to that.
Story_ID: 641991
Speaker 1: In those early days of the development of The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia], this is prior to the holiday [Martin Luther King Jr. Day] being established and all that.  Then, the, I guess one of the goals would be to actually secure a permanent place for The King Center, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was, that's what I was saying.  The King Center and the construction of The King Center came about as a result of a partnership with the federal government, as well as Corporate America and individuals who wanted to see that center constructed.  And Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King] traveled around the country and around the world raising money, and raising interest in the construction of The King Center in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's how it happened.  The [U.S.] Forest Service was part of that, and they were able to provide the security and the guides.  As people would come, the park service [National Park Service] would give us a little grant each month to help with sustaining and maintaining the center.  We wanted a pool out there behind it, where the crypts are right now.  And if you visit The King Center--all of that was part of her vision as the way the center needed to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Okay.  So, who were some of the other board members who were on the board with you?
Speaker 2: Well, a man named Jesse Hill was chair of the board for many, many, many, many years; [HistoryMaker] Herman Russell, who's a very prominent construction mogul in the city; a woman named Carole Hoover from Cleveland, Ohio, the Greater Cleveland Growth Association [Greater Cleveland Partnership]; and Bob Brown [Robert J. Brown], the guy I was talking about who went to Washington [D.C.] with President Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] was a part of that board.  We had [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young, of course, who was on that board.  Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was always very supportive of Mrs. King and The King Center.  And a guy named John Cox [John W. Cox], who was with Delta Airlines, and worked almost around the clock to help King Week become a reality.  There were many, many others that I could call, if I gave greater thought to it.  But we had a tremendous board of directors, including members of the family.  Mrs. Farris, Christine Farris [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris], who was Dr. King's sister, was always active on the board and on the executive committee.  Reverend Joseph Lowery [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph Lowery], one of the cohorts of Dr. King, was a part of that board.  We had governors, we had mayors, we had representatives from organized labor.  We had business leaders from various corporations around the country that came and served on the board with Mrs. King.  It was, it was a marvelous thing.  University presidents were there.
Story_ID: 641992
Speaker 1: There were--like, international visitors were coming to Atlanta [Georgia] already, looking for something.  And so the idea of The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] seemed like a natural idea to try to do something to commemorate a figure of international scope already, you know, to draw people in.  So from what I understand, the National Park Service got involved in 1980?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And now, how did--did they initially just deal with like the Auburn Avenue site?
Speaker 2: Yes, primarily the park service was the King area, area, which was a little broader than just The King Center.  They began to establish a presence, which included the birth home and other areas in and around the birth home and The King Center, where the park service set up headquarters and provided security and provided the assistance with tourists being guided through the area.  So, the park service made a tremendous difference there.  And then we had a loan executive there, a guy named Lloyd Davis, who was full time, assigned to The King Center to help with the administrative operations of the center.  And he was the one that first launched the initiative to get states to observe King Week around the country.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the initiative came from The King Center?
Speaker 2: The initiative came from The King Center.  It was taken on by the park service, and then King commissions in as many states as possible.  They had them all over the place; in New York, in Illinois, in Arkansas.  There, almost every state has a King commission now.  And that of course started small, and then grew.  And they would all often want Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King] to come and speak to them in order to build momentum, and build enthusiasm for what it was all about.
Story_ID: 641993
Speaker 1: Now, most of us who were not living in Atlanta [Georgia] or wasn't--weren't on the board of The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia], we got our information from Stevie Wonder--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --about the holiday [Martin Luther King Jr. Day].
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Were there discussions with the board and Stevie Wonder about how that was going to roll out?  And, 'cause the disc jockeys all over the country on the urban black stations were playing, you know, the song, 'Happy Birthday to You,' and--
Speaker 2: 'Happy Birthday to You.'
Speaker 1: --and, which accompanied like a movement.
Speaker 2: Well, Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King] really was very fond of Stevie.  And Stevie was certainly someone who admired Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and who really appreciated what Dr. King and Mrs. King was about.  And he would come to the center often to let Mrs. King know that he was supporting it, along with folks like [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte as well.  So, we had a lot of individuals who were persons that were in the entertainment arena, black and white, that would come to say, "Mrs. King, how can I help in what it is you're trying to do?"  And Mrs. King always had an answer for them.  She could always tell them something that was needed by The King Center, and so I think these folk always felt utilized.  We used to get heads of state from many, many countries that would come visit The King Center.  And of course, we always tried to have Miss King available to host them.  I remember the first time, during my time as executive director of the center, was the first time that Nelson Mandela and Winnie [Winnie Mandela], his wife, visited the country and The King Center.  And we hosted them and talked about how The King Center could help in the free elections coming up in South Africa where he was going to be running for president.  And we sent a team of trainers in nonviolence to go to South Africa to help with that process and to try to share of the things we had done in this country to make it happen.  [HistoryMaker] Randall Robinson who, of TransAfrica was also part of that.  So it was a, it was a great time, lots of great things happening.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is about 19--the, Nelson Mandela's visit would be 1991 or '2 [1992]?  (Unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The early '90s [1990s], about '92 [1992], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 641994
Speaker 1: So you were at the National Alliance of Business through what time?
Speaker 2: About '95 [1995] or '96 [1996], I believe.
Speaker 1: And then what did you do?
Speaker 2: When I left the National Alliance of Business, I went to The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia].  Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King] lured me there to be executive director, the full-time executive director of The King Center.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is also in '96 [1996] or so, '96 [1996]?  Okay, all right, we have a note here that in '94 [1994], you served first in '94 [1994] as interim director?
Speaker 2: Might have been '94 [1994].  Sometimes I confuse those dates.
Speaker 1: Ninety-four [1994], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But Mrs. King was on the board of the National Alliance of Business, and so I had had an opportunity to work with her and to kind of operate under her guidance and supervision, since she was a board member here in the city where I was the regional director for the National Alliance of Business.  And so because of that working relationship, when I decided to leave the National Alliance of Business, Mrs. King asked me to come.  It was at that time that the director, John Quincy [ph.], went to work for the Black Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus.  And when he left to do that, then that offered an opportunity for me to move over to The King Center.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how long were you director of The King Center?
Speaker 2: I was there about three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when Mrs. King stepped down in favor of her son Dexter [Dexter King], I thought that he needed to have the opportunity to name his own director.  And so that's when I stepped down as director of the center.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what were some of the things you were able to accomplish in those three years?  What were you, you know, trying to do?
Speaker 2: Well, again, I think we fully established The King Center's outreach efforts to share the nonviolence training with police departments, with states, and with communities around the country and around the world.  As I said, I was there when we worked with President--or Mr. Mandela [Nelson Mandela], who then became President Mandela, and we loaned our team there to do training.  But it occurred in Haiti, and we had folks go to Central America, South America, all over the country to spread the word of nonviolence and social change.  We thought that Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] philosophy could serve other countries and other areas well.  And it did, and that was the role Mrs. King asked me to play, in addition to trying to be sure that the operations of The King Center were solid and that we had adequate budgets to do the job.  And we worked with her itinerary, her speech- speaking schedule, and those kind of things, as well as continuing to draw as many people as possible as tourists to The King Center, to the bookstore.  We had a restaurant on the site where folks could come and have lunch or have breakfast.  We had activities in Freedom Hall, so we encouraged people to come and have activities at The King Center and utilizing those facilities.  It kind of became the spot, the place, the central point for a lot of activities that were going on.  And we wanted folks to come and view Dr. King's personal belongings; some of the shoes he wore, watches that he wore, suits that he wore.  At that time, the 'Letter from Birmingham Jail' [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was on exhibit there at The King Center.  It was a glorious place to be.  We had a Gandhi Room.  We had a room for the bus lady--
Speaker 1: Rosa Parks.
Speaker 2: Mrs. Rosa Parks.  We had a Rosa Parks Room at The King Center.  So, it reflected a broad base of the Civil Rights Movement, it certainly did.  And then we tried to continue to forge a relationship with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].  Hosea [Hosea Williams] was getting started with Hosea Feed the Hungry [Hosea Feed the Hungry and Homeless], and we attempted to be supportive of that.  You know, it was kind of the cradle of where the Civil Rights Movement was, not just in the South, but in the country.
Story_ID: 641995
Speaker 1: We were just talking off camera about the different aspects of The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And as you, I mean, first of all it's on Auburn Avenue, which is a historic avenue--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --for business.
Speaker 2: Sweet Auburn, they call it, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, the home of so many black businesses, and a thriving community that was going on before the civil rights era (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, absolutely, because in the era of segregation, the social network for African Americans tended to be focused down on Auburn Avenue, as well as business.  This is where you had the savings and loan association, the black bank.  Citizens Trust Bank was down there.  Atlanta Life Insurance Company [Atlanta Life Financial Group] was down there.  The Atlanta Daily World, which was a black newspaper, was down there.  When the 100 Black Men of America [100 Black Men of America, Inc.] was formed, it established its office down there.  It, Ebenezer Church [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] was down there.  So, and the Butler Street YMCA, the historic Butler Street YMCA, was down on Auburn Avenue.  Big Bethel A.M.E. Church [Atlanta, Georgia], on, in whose basement the Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] was founded, these are the kinds of things that were in the Auburn Avenue corridor.  A lot of the entertainers that would come here, people like Sam Cooke and others, would always do their concerts down on Auburn Avenue.  So, it was, it was Sweet Auburn.  It was the place to go, and especially if you were an African American visitor and you wanted to have fun.  You know, blacks could not stay in the Holiday Inn or the Hyatt Regency.  They had to stay at the Butler Street Y.  If they were coming here to stay overnight, this is where you stayed.  The black police officers could not change with, in the precinct with white officers.  So the precinct for black policemen in Atlanta [Georgia] was the Butler Street YMCA. That was the place.  So, Auburn Avenue was the cradle of things.  Reverend Borders [William Holmes Borders] and his church was down there on Auburn Avenue (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was Wheat Street [Wheat Street Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Wheat Street Church was there on Auburn Avenue.  So, the history was there.  And so when the park service [National Park Service] came in to establish what its boundaries would be, all of that kind of became a part of it, and they helped with the development of the King area, the entire King area, so that it would be an inducing kind of place for visitors and tourists to come.
Speaker 1: So it appears, I guess the park service like federalized a lot of land?
Speaker 2: They did.
Speaker 1: On Auburn going, you know, up Auburn from Ebenezer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Primarily it was focused around the birth home, and in that area, from Ebenezer on back--
Speaker 1: On up the street?
Speaker 2: --on up the street, on Boulevard street and places like that.  They kind of focused on being supportive of those kind of things, and renovating and renewing the areas.  Many of those homes had become dilapidated and needed restoration, and they helped with that.  And then they built the visitors center right next to Ebenezer church, which is where many of the visitors are encouraged to go.  And when they conduct the tours, they conduct the tours through that.  And they have put there a lot of African American history, including the works of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] as oth- and other civil rights leaders.
Speaker 1: There's a big, modern, interactive museum facility right across the street from the old Ebenezer church, next door to the new one.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, next door to the--
Speaker 1: Surrounded by parkland and--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: The King Center itself is across the street I guess from that, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The King Center, the original King Center itself is across the street from the one that is truly managed by the park service, and that's where Dr. and Mrs. King's [Coretta Scott King] crypts are.  The reflecting pool is there, the bookstore is there, the places where people can have meetings.  Freedom Hall is there.  The Rosa Parks Room is there.  The Gandhi Room is there on that side.  There are, there's a place where people have a lot of weddings on that side.  People like to take vows at The King Center.  That's over on the side with the reflecting pool and with the crypt of Dr. and Mrs. King.
Story_ID: 641996
Speaker 1: So, you've got the non-for-profit King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] on one hand, you've got the National Park Service.  And, but over the years there's been some friction between these two, the federal government on one side, and The King Center.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, as the changes have occurred in the generations, there are some different kind of views.  When the park service first aligned with The King Center, Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King] was at the helm of the center.  When Mrs. King relinquished the leadership of the center to Derek--Dexter King, Mrs. King's youngest son, Dexter had a lot of different ideas and different thoughts.  And one of the philosophies that Dexter had is, "My daddy [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] did not die a rich man, but he left a rich legacy.  And we got to use that legacy to be sure that we're not paupers, that we always have the ability and the capacity to keep the dream alive.  And in order to keep that dream alive, we need a flow of resources and dollars."  And so, and then he had another ambition, and that was an acting ambition.  So, he moved out to Malibu, California.  And at that time Dexter really was still the top person in terms of the center, but he was doing it from a distance.  And soon his cousin, Isaac Farris [Isaac Farris, Jr.], became the executive director of the center on site, but Dexter was still the chair.  That is what led to the very visible conflicts, I suppose, that got out into the public and ultimately resulted in a court case between the King children.  I think they have been working hard to resolve that.  In the meantime Yolanda King, the older sister, passed away, and that left the three of them, Bernice [HistoryMaker Bernice Albertine King], Dexter, and Martin [Martin Luther King III].  And at one time Martin was--became the CEO of the center.  Bernice was vying to be the executive director of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], chose not to accept that position, and then Isaac stepped in and became--who had been at the center, he went over to the SCLC to become their executive director.  And then Bernice, who had been putting much of her time into her ministry, chose to come back and play a greater role at The King Center.  She's now the CEO.  And Martin has gone on to establish another initiative that will enable him to spread the nonviolence philosophy broader and around the world, and not just based at The King Center.
Story_ID: 641997
Speaker 1: Did you think it's--what do you envision for the future of The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] in terms of the management?  Do you always see the family being involved in this, at the level that they--
Speaker 2: I, I'm hearing that there's some consideration that's underway for persons outside of the family might again be invited to become part of the governing structure of The King Center.  I think that would certainly bring a broader base of support and involvement, if that could be the case.  I thought that when Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King] lived and was alive, she always sought to have a broad based board, and it later went to, on to become a family matter.  But I think the discussion is underway now to once again reach out to others.  I'm hoping that some young folk might be able to serve on the board so that they can get a feel for what it was like and what it can be, and bring some of their thoughts and ideas to the process, so that the Civil Rights Movement can continue to be something that is relevant for generations current and generations to come.  That's what we're hoping will happen.  And I'm hoping that the leadership of Bernice [HistoryMaker Bernice Albertine King], with the help of the others who are advisors and family members will--people like Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] who has a lot of--who the family has a lot of confidence in him, even the youngsters and all generations.  I think he can be an advisor, since he worked so closely with their dad.  Those are the kinds of things that I think will move The King Center on to the future and the next generation.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did you play any specific role in trying to mediate any of the conflict that, you know?
Speaker 2: I have served on something that Martin [Martin Luther King III] created called an advisory board, The King Center advisory board, to help them identify activities and events, and that kind of thing, that, and how we, how The King Center would interact with the celebration of the museum [National Museum of African American History and Culture] in Washington [D.C.] and the monument [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial] there.  So I have, subsequent to having been there on the staff, I have been in kind of in an advisory capacity, and offering some ideas and suggestions on what The King Center might do, and how it might interact with other agencies and organizations around the country and around the world.  So, and I am often called upon to speak at various King commission activities in other states.  And so I consider that quite a wonderful opportunity for me to have a recall, and for me to keep myself sharp about, reasonably sharp about what's going on with regard to the legacy of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  You know, I really used to always look forward to Mrs. King and her address called, the State of the Dream.  You know, Dr. King's main speech, I Have a Dream, she continued it after he was gone by saying, "We have to understand the state of the dream.  How are we coming with regard to the dream?"  And I think we have to continue to do that.  How are we coming?  I think the election of Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] was probably part of the dream.  And I don't, that had to be a far fetched dream, because I think so many of us never believed that we'd see the day when we had a black president, but it came.  And I think some of the environment that Dr. King helped to create, especially with young non-African Americans feeling that, you know, I am not disenfranchised if we have a black president, you know, and black people too, may have something to bring to the process.  That's what I think the future holds.  And I think as young people begin to fall into place and take responsibility for where we will head in the future; we might be in for some good things.
Story_ID: 641998
Speaker 1: In 2008, though, you at least started off campaigning for Hillary [Hillary Rodham Clinton], right?
Speaker 2: Well, let me just say that I'm from Arkansas.  My son [William Walker, Jr.] was Bill Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] floor leader in the House [Arkansas House of Representatives] and Senate [Arkansas Senate].  When my son's daughter was born, the Clintons took that into becoming a personal thing with Allison [ph.].  So, Allison was pictured around the country with President Bill Clinton.  And when she was able to first say president it was President Clinton.  So, when--I did not know Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  I, of course, didn't grow up in Chicago [Illinois].  I didn't live in Chicago, although I had relatives in Chicago.  When I was asked to be part of the Georgia committee for Hillary Clinton, I had no choice but to pledge my support for someone that I had known, worked with--we used to work the same precinct in Little Rock [Arkansas].  She was working for her Bill.  My son's name is Bill.  She was working for her Bill, and I was working for my Bill.  And my Bill's Senate district happened to be, include the capitol [Arkansas State Capitol, Little Rock, Arkansas] and the governor's mansion.  And so Hillary and I were thrown into the same place, out there working the polls.  So, I knew her well.  And when I was working with the Clinton campaign for president, Hillary was a part of that.  And so I was very comfortable with Hillary Clinton, and I had yet to get to know Barack Obama.
Story_ID: 641999
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the--well, you talked about it in general, I guess, but you, do you, I guess--are you satisfied with the Obama administration, as president (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, I don't want to say that I am totally satisfied.  I would like to have seen African Americans become greater beneficiaries to a black president; I had hoped that it would happen.  Maybe he felt that his best chance of being able to have another four years to work at it was if he didn't do too much for African Americans.  I was disappointed that we didn't get at least one black appointed by him to the Supreme Court, as he's had two appointments.  And I knew that the Hispanics certainly needed to have some representation, but given what we have now, I don't think we feel that we have a black on the Supreme Court.  I don't think we feel we have one.  And so, we were hoping that President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] would give us at least one person who acted black on the U.S. Supreme Court.  I wish that had happened.  Now, I know the attorney general.  I have had a chance to interact with him, Attorney General Holder [HistoryMaker Eric H. Holder, Jr.].  I think he's a good appointment.  I'd just like to see African Americans have a little greater level of involvement in the Obama administration.  I think had Obama been white and we got the same level of appointments and recognition with a white president, we would have been protesting very loudly.  I think he's getting a pass because he is African American.  I would hope that once he is reelected that he's going to do better.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know it's often felt that if he were quote too black unquote, and made too many appointments, he would jeopardize his chance of reelection.  That's the popular notion these days.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but my point though, the other side of that, is if he, if he doesn't do enough for African Americans, that the enthusiasm there is lost.  And see, it was the fantastic 90 plus percent of the African American turnout in votes for him that made a difference, in addition to some other things.  And if that enthusiasm is not maintained and retained, and if African Americans don't go out enthusiastically in great numbers as they did in the prior election, then he's going to be in trouble anyway.

Speaker 1: Tell us about some of--now, you've been involved in--you're almost a quintessential black Atlanta [Georgia] man of the community I guess in so many ways.  You've done so many things that have been--you're a member of the 100 Black Men [100 Black Men of Atlanta, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia].  The list probably, I could have a stack of papers this high with all the things you've been a part of.  So, what are some of your favorite activities now, and well, in the past too, here in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Well, let me say this.  When you're cheap labor, you can get a lot of jobs.  And (laughter) I consider myself a prolific volunteer.  I love volunteering, I love to be involved.  I was a couple of years ago inducted into the business league hall of fame [Atlanta Business League Business Hall of Fame].  Now, you almost have to be a legend to be inducted into the hall of fame.  Dr. Kimbrough [Walter L. Kimbrough] was there and Nate Goldston [HistoryMaker Nathaniel R. Goldston, III] was there.  And Nate, of course, has a history of being involved in contributing to black colleges [HBCUs] and supporting them, and providing food services for them.  And of course, Dr. Kimbrough talked about the lives that he had saved.  And so when I got up, I just talked about all the non-paying jobs I'd had, and the fact that I had probably had held more non-paying jobs than anybody else in history, because I enjoy volunteering.  One of the things I take great pride in is having been at the helm of the historic Butler Street YMCA [Atlanta, Georgia].  I was one of the early presidents of the 100 Black Men, and one who helped form the 100 Black Men of America [100 Black Men of America, Inc.].  I have served three terms as the chairman of the Victim Assistance Program.  I've served on five African American college boards.  I've served three presidents on the president's advisory board for historically black colleges [President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs].  I've served on the MARTA [Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority] board, and I mentioned that.  I'm involved in my church, the historic Friendship Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia], and working with the Friendship Forum.  Friendship is where Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] had its first classes when they moved from Augusta [Georgia], where Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] was founded, and it was started in a boxcar with Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  So, Friendship keeps you busy, keeps you involved, keeps you reaching out.  I enjoy what I'm doing with the Fulton Atlanta Community Action Authority, which is the agency that continues to do the things that OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity] started to do.  So, I just love being involved.  And right now I have the privilege of working with the Center for Civil and Human Rights [Atlanta, Georgia], which I think is a great thing, and the vision of former mayor Shirley Franklin, where she was able to raise the money to purchase Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] papers from Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] to donate to Morehouse College here, and now this center will help expose those papers and share those papers with tourists that come.  And it will be out in the Centennial Olympic Park area, and then with that train running from Centennial Park over to the Auburn Avenue corridor, I think it's just going to be a fantastic day in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: So, the center is going to be a museum of sorts?
Speaker 2: Well, it's not a museum, because a museum never changes.  And this is the way Doug Shipman, who heads it, describes it.  It will not be a museum, because it won't just be something for people to go there and look at.  This will be a center for interaction, for exchange, for sharing, and I agree with that.  It's a center that will enable people to touch things, to share with things, to talk to things, to bring things.  It's a continuing thing.  I think young folks are going to really be excited about the Center for Civil and Human Rights.  And the ground is going to be broken in June of 2012, and I think it's going to just raise Atlanta to another level when it comes to being the place to go to and the place to visit, and the place to learn.  I'm excited about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So that's scheduled to, that's scheduled to break ground soon, you say?
Speaker 2: Yes, in June.
Speaker 1: In June, okay.
Speaker 2: End of June.
Speaker 1: End of June, all right.

Speaker 1: Now, what about your consulting business [Sonny Walker Group] now?  Is there, you're still a consultant with (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm still doing things.  There have been places where I have been going for years, helping them structure their strategic plan and helping them to somehow come up with fundraising strategies that will enable them to be successful and to do--
Speaker 1: Primarily for not-for-profits?  Or--
Speaker 2: Primarily not-for-profits, and for some for-profits.  I've over the years done a lot of strategic planning work for major for-profit organizations.  I've done training for Federal Express [FedEx] over in Memphis [Tennessee].  I have done a variety of things for them.  I am on the circuit for Black History Month, and for twenty-five years I've done the Black History Teleconference for the State of South Carolina in educational television [South Carolina Educational Television].  But I get a lot of opportunities to do keynote speeches, to head and kick off opportunities for trainings--weeks and training initiatives for non-profit agencies.  I do a lot of the SWOC stuff.  You know, it used to be called SWOT, but now in the non-profit arena we call it strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges; not threats, but challenges.  And so, I'm dealing with those kinds of things.  The Victim Assistance Program is something I take a lot of pride in.  There're a lot of folk who are victims of crime and don't have the resources to somehow come back after they have been victimized by crime.  And so, I'm, I'm working on that board.  I have chaired for eighteen years almost the board to ed- called EduPAC, that elects the members of the board of education [Atlanta Board of Education], and I think we've done a pretty good job there.  But I like situations where I can help the non-profit community and the business community come together to decide what they share in common and what they can do to help each other; I enjoy that.  I'm on the national board assembly of the YMCA of America.  I will be going the first week in April to a meeting where I'm chairing the nominating committee for the national assembly of the Y-USA [YMCA of the USA].  So I'm, I'm always going to meetings.  Like I said, when you're cheap labor, you get a lot of job offers.
Story_ID: 642002
Speaker 1: What are your con- hopes and concerns for the black community in Atlanta [Georgia] today?
Speaker 2: Well, again, I don't think that anybody issued us a greater charge and a more realistic charge than Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  Most of us are ambitious, most of us want to establish a reputation.  Most of us want to leave a legacy, and most of us, quote, want to be viewed as having done something.  Dr. King said, "We can all be great, but we can all serve."  If God will continue to allow me to have the physical capacity and the mental capacity to continue to do things, I want to see if I can follow Dr. King's challenge and somehow serve and continue to serve, and make my service, have my service make a difference.  That's what I want to do.  I think my deceased parents [Mary Coleman and James Walker, Sr.] would look down from where I think they are, in heaven, and say, "That's our boy."  And that's what I want to do.  I want to be a boy that my parents and those that look to me, even my children, for that matter--and I have children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  I want them all to say, "Daddy, granddaddy, big daddy, thank you so much."  I visited a school in Little Rock [Arkansas] called the Rockefeller School [Rockefeller Elementary School and Early Childhood Center].  I had three great-grandchildren there.  They had posted my picture on every wall in every room in that school, because I was there to help celebrate the Win Rockefeller [Winthrop Rockefeller] legacy.  And they brought me back as a history maker coming home, and I felt good that I was exposed to my children, my grandchildren, and my great-grandchildren, and I was projected in a way where I was trying to serve.  If we can do that, then I think God would have blessed me with what I would hope I pray for.
Story_ID: 642003
Speaker 1: I just want to maybe go back over Atlanta [Georgia] history and ask you just, some reactions about a couple of things that happened here.  I don't know--I was thinking about the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics].  That was such a big activity here in 1996.  The Olympics comes, this international event comes to Atlanta.  You say you weren't on the committee [Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games], but you did--
Speaker 2: I was not on the committee, but I was out there; I wore every pin, I was always over at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], which was really where the center of the Olympic Village, it was called.  And I was constantly there meeting people from around the world and welcoming them to Atlanta.  I went to all of the activities and events, for the most part.  I went in debt trying to go to everything that was made available for us during the Olympics.  It was a great time for Atlanta.  It was a great period for Atlanta.  I think it helped us show off in ways that we wanted to show off that we are a beautiful city.  And I think during that period we showed off our beauty as a city.  We were proud that we got it.  We were proud of the work of Maynard Jackson and [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young and others, who, who truly made a difference in us getting the Olympics to come to Atlanta.  And we were just proud.  We were truly proud Atlantans, that we had the Olympics here where we could touch it, and feel it, and see it, and enjoy it, and to see Muhammad Ali light the torch and things of that nature.  It was history making.  And I am just proud as somebody now who's referred to as a HistoryMaker that I saw history in the making.
Story_ID: 642004
Speaker 1: The other thing is not so upbeat, and that's the Atlanta Child Murders [Atlanta Missing and Murdered Children cases] of the '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, which mystified the entire nation.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, so you had a black city administration and a black police chief--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a community trying to solve this dilemma.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, let me say that I think it is still something that has been unresolved.  There is a young man [Wayne Williams] who's serving a life term for some of those murders.  I'm not sure, as many people are not sure, that we've got the right person.  And maybe we did not get the right person because we didn't work at it long enough.  But I think a preponderance of those of us in Atlanta [Georgia] who were here and who witnessed it feel that there's something about it that is yet really unresolved.  And I think it's probably one of the real blurs on the image of Atlanta.  And I would hope that someday for the families of those who were affected; and for the city as a whole, I would hope that that could somehow be resolved.
Story_ID: 642005
Speaker 1: What today, when you look back on all the things that you've done, all your volunteer activities and work activities, what today would you consider to be your legacy?  What are you proudest of?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I think of several things.  I'm proud of my family; my sons, my grandsons.  I have a son [William Walker, Jr.] who spent, has spent more than twenty years in government in Arkansas.  He bears my name.  He has brought a little bit of history to it, in that it's the first time in Arkansas history that a father and son have both served in the Arkansas cabinet, and he currently serves in the cabinet.  My oldest son [James Walker II], his older brother, was a Razorback All-American, the first defensive player in Razorback history to ever make All-American.  And he was recently inducted into the Razorback hall of fame [at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Arkansas].  His son at one time owned all the scoring records in the State of Georgia, broke the records of the famed Herschel Walker.  He, too, had the name Walker, Darius Walker, and went on to Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana] and became a freshman starting running back, and then went into the business of being a sportscaster.  So, I take tremendous--and then I've got another grandson who is a principal in the Little Rock public schools [Little Rock School District].  This is the same school district I worked in and, when I had the privilege of teaching five of the Little Rock Nine.  And now I've got a grandson that's a principal and administrator in that system.  But I guess if I would identify the thing that has meant most to me, it was the opportunity that gave me the position to do some of the things that I have been able to do, and to be an example for my children and other children, and my neighbor's children.  And that is that one day as a result of the governor and his wife [Jeannette Edris Rockefeller] feeling that I had made a difference in my state--Governor Winthrop Rockefeller, a New York Rockefeller, one of the Rockefeller brothers, decided that he was going to take a chance and do something that had never been done before.  And that was to have a southern governor appoint an African American to his cabinet.  He appointed me, and I had the opportunity to try to make a difference.  When I was appointed, we did not have a single African American on television as a reporter or an anchor.  Within one year, every single television station had an African American anchor on the TV station.  I was back there a month ago, and these same stations interviewed me and recognized and honored me for breaking that barrier.  We had no bank tellers.  When I went to the president of the bank [First National Bank] to say, "We have no black bank tellers in this city, but we have our little money in here," he said to me, he issued a challenge.  He said, "You find me somebody that can count, and I'll hire them."  Well, there was a young lady who was with a credit union in a place called College Station [College Station Community Credit Union, College Station, Arkansas].  Her name was [HistoryMaker] Linda Torrence.  And so I went to Linda and said, "Linda, we need somebody who can break the barrier and become a bank teller."  And she said yes.  And so, she was the first black bank teller.  When I decided that the Jaycees needed to be integrated and not all white, I applied to be a Jaycee and I was the first African American Jaycee.  We had no black state patrolmen.  We had no women on the state patrol.  And we integrated the state patrol.  We had no blacks on commissions and boards in the state.  And when I left there, that position, every single commission in the state had at least an African American, at least one serving.  And so my legacy and the thing I'm proudest of, is that Winthrop Rockefeller, the governor of Arkansas, a native of New York, somehow decided because of the influence of an [U.S.] Army buddy, or a couple of Army buddies, decided to relocate to Arkansas, he came there and opened the door for me, and he challenged me to not be satisfied just being somebody who could enter the door that was opened to me, but to open doors for others.  And I believe if I have a legacy, it's the fact that I helped open doors for others who never had been inside those doors before.  I think that's what history makers ought to be about.  I'm just proud that God has given me the time, the opportunity, and the privilege to open some doors.

Speaker 1: When you look back again, is there anything that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I wished that I could have spent more time with my daughters [Cheryl Walker and Leslie Walker].  I had two daughters that were always challenged, because somehow they never met the right man that they could stand at the altar and say, "I do," to, and somehow have happy families.  Now, one of the daughters is the mother of that grandson who's the principal.  But I just know just from talking with them and having an exchange with them, that they have not been happy with their relationship with a significant man or father in their lives.  I wished I'd spent more time with my daughters, so that they could have somehow been able to identify the kind of man that could have been a mate or a companion for them.  That's my one regret.
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we haven't discussed before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I'm ready for the last one.
Story_ID: 642007
Speaker 1: Well the last one is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Again, I mentioned earlier that when I was inducted into the business league hall of fame [Atlanta Business League Business Hall of Fame], what I thought my legacy was and what I wanted to be remembered by--I want to be remembered as the person who came to Atlanta [Georgia] from Arkansas in 1972, and I believe that during the tenure that I've been here, and it's almost about forty years, that I have been able to make some contributions, that somehow I have made a legacy.  And through my 100 Black Men [100 Black Men of America, Inc.]; through the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity that I've been a member of for sixty years; through other opportunities with the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)]; with Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia]; with Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]; with Bennett College [Greensboro, North Carolina]; and with UAPB in Pine Bluff [University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], I've been a major part of being involved with trying to keep established institutions that can train the future for us.  But if there's anything that I'd like to be truly remembered for, it's that I believe that I have set the record for occupying and filling more unpaid jobs than any other person around.  I've been able to do those jobs without pay.  But God has blessed me with what I need to feel blessed by.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
