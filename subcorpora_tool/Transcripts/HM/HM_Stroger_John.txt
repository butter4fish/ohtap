Story_ID: 192593
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [John Stroger, Sr.] side of the family, but we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give me your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Ella, E-L-L-A, Jones, J-O-N-E-S, and married name is Stroger, Ella Jones Stroger.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1900 in July.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1900?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Phillips County, Arkansas in a place called Marvell, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: M-A-R-V-E-L-L, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about her side of the family, how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Well, her mother name was Laura Jones and they originally, Laura's family, they came from Moscow, Tennessee and right after slavery they came over across the Mississippi River into Phillips County, Arkansas, looking for land.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, okay, so that's immediately after the Civil War and slavery?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother had a lot of brothers were born in 1870s and all around at that period and one of 'em my uncles, I never knew him, obviously was killed in--during World War I [WWI].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now are there any stories that they tell about the Civil War, or reconstruction, or of those days right after, you know,--
Speaker 2: No, I dealt closely with my mother's side of the family, I never knew my mother's father personally, but I dealt with her oldest sister who raised my mother after her mother died and her name was Susie Jones Manse [ph.], and she was a farmer in Phillips County, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your ancestors, when they moved, from Tennessee to Arkansas, did they acquire land, were they able to purchase land?
Speaker 2: I don't know whether my mother's family acquired land, but they farmed land, but I do know that they farmed a lot of land.  They had my mother, it was 13 of them and I've heard her tell stories about how they--her brothers had to work in the fields all the time before they left home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of crop did they grow in those days?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: What kind of food did they grow, or what did they grow?
Speaker 2: Cotton, cotton was king in that part of the country, that's part of the Delta and they referred to king cotton in that part.  That's why they needed so many people to work for practically nothing, cheap labor, carryover from the slave period when they didn't have to pay for the people necessarily to do the crops and fields and cotton for crops and fields.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so are ther--there any other stories from your mother's side of the family, from people that--
Speaker 2: Other than the fact that my Aunt Susie [ph.] raised my mother and her two young brothers, both who pre-deceased her.  And, my mother always looked forward to wanting to be a school teacher, but she never got that opportunity after her mother died.  She went to about 11th grade I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so there were some schools close by that they could go to and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she, my mother I think attended a school called Tate [High School], in Marvell, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what was the name?
Speaker 2: T-A-T-E.  Tate--Tate High School.
Speaker 1: Oh, Okay.  Okay--
Speaker 2: Should see the books that she used, boy the reading books that they had to read and develop and the vocabulary that they used in those days were much stronger than the ones they use in high school now, especially for reading.
Story_ID: 192594
Speaker 1: Well tell me about your father's side of the family, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Did I give you my [grand]mother's name?  Laura [Jones]?
Speaker 1: Your mother's name is Ella Jones Stroger?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but her mother was--
Speaker 1: Her mother was Laura, right.
Speaker 2: --Laura, okay.  My father's name was John Stroger, S-T-R-O-G-E-R, and he was born in Phillips County, Arkansas, outside of Helena, on a plantation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, he had three brothers, one brother was called Major Stroger [ph.], and he had a brother, Isom [ph.] and Luke Stroger [ph.].  Luke Kirby [ph.], and the reason their names are different, because my father's father died and his mother married someone whose name was Kirby, and they had two kids, so my father had three siblings.  And, my father left home when he was nine years old, as he told me, he did not wanna work in the fields and so he ran away and went to work in Helena, Arkansas, at a, what they call a bucket factory.  He later learned how to alter clothes and clean and press clothes and that's what he did most of his life thereafter.
Speaker 1: So he was a tailor basically and a--
Speaker 2: Well, he wasn't a formal tailor, he didn't make suits, he just altered clothes, repaired clothes and cleaned and press clothes, and he did that in Helena, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what year was he born?
Speaker 2: My father told me he was born in 1885, and he was born in April, of 1885.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father told me and--his mother was Rilla, R-I-L-L-A, that was his mother's name and I think her family came from somewhere off the border of Louisiana and Arkansas, and my father's father came from, after slavery, somewhere out of Georgia, near Rome, Georgia or from some form of plantation.  And as my father told me, that his father and his father's father, left that area when [William Tecumseh] Sherman's troops marched Atlanta [Georgia] and they were a part of that group who followed Sherman's troops through Atlanta into South Carolina, and eventually my father said that his father and 'em, came to Helena, Arkansas looking for land to farm.  Some way they--that's the only thing they knew was farming obviously in those days, or working the fields.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they followed Sherman during the Civil War?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 192595
Speaker 1: Tell me something about your parents [Ella Jones Stroger and John Stroger, Sr.].  Let's start with your mother. What was her personality like and what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: She worked mostly as a domestic, practically all of her life.  But, my mother told me and my siblings that she always wanted to be a school teacher and when we were growing up, she used to read to us continuously and recite poetry and poems that she had learned.  The kids used to refer to my mother as a radio, 'cause she used such good English in the neighborhood and she wanted us to have a real education and she pushed that most of her life.  I mean, she--we, we didn't have to worry about doing nothing but going to school, we all worked but, that wasn't the number one thing in our lives, it was trying to get an education and we were successful in going through schools. We never lived too far from the schools, so we had no excuse for not being in attendance.
Story_ID: 192596
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: Well I had.
Speaker 1: Had, okay.
Speaker 2: It was four of us, my sister Cleo Stroger who later became a school teacher, she graduated from the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff [Pine Bluff, Arkansas] and from Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] she got a master's in business education, my brother Earl who pre-deceased most of us and I have a brother now in a nursing home his name is James Stroger.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's three--three of you?  I mean that's one, two--
Speaker 2: It's four
Speaker 1: It was four, it's four--four--
Speaker 2: Yeah, four with me yeah
Speaker 1: --Counting you, yes okay.  All right, so your mother had a strong personality?
Speaker 2: She really did, and my brother Earl died as a young man, he contacted some kind of fever that couldn't be abated at that time and he died.  My sister, I told you about her, my brother Jimmy [ph.] did not graduate from college, but he did go to college and he retired from the City of Chicago Water Department [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 192597
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father [John H. Stroger, Sr.]; what kind of personality did your father have and what did he do?
Speaker 2: My father told me he only went to school one or two years and he was not a learned man in terms of writing, but based on my discussions with him, he was a worldly person and he had an opportunity to meet a lot of people because in those days people would sit around cleaning establishments, barber shops and talk.  And, that's one of the reasons that he used so motivated in terms of wanting us to have an education because he had a chance to meet people on a daily base who he would clean their clothes or talk to them or met 'em in the shops and he was impressed with the trainings that many of 'em had and he wanted us to be better.  So, we were well motivated in terms of trying a get an education and he was what you call a disciplinarian, if he had been living in these days and--they'd probably have him before the Department of Children and Family Service, 'cause he would put that leather on you if you didn't do what he thought was the right thing to do at that particular time.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that's--was that typical of the days--of those days?
Speaker 2: It was typical of most of the people who grow up in that community, families they were strict disciplinarians, they wanted you to go to church, they wanted you to do the very best you can.  All of my friends were not as fortunate as I was to get a--the kind of education I got, but I can truly tell you based on now reflection, that their families always wanted them to be solid citizens.
Story_ID: 192598
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents [Ella Jones Stroger and John Stroger, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: No, but my mother had once been married.  She came to Chicago [Illinois] right after she left school and was up here for sometimes and she married one of her high school sweethearts and he went to service from way I've been told, when he came back, there marriage didn't work to well, excuse me, and she came back to Helena [Arkansas] and married my father and I was born in Helena, '29 [1929].
Speaker 1: Okay, so the war he went to is World War I [WWI], I guess?
Speaker 2: That is correct, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I never knew the gentleman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 192599
Speaker 1: Well tell me, what's your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Going to New Light Missionary Baptist Church [Helena, Arkansas] (laughter), and participating in Easter programs.  As a matter of fact, I was just talking with Gloster Richardson, about one of my experiences with a fellow named Rudolph Polk who works for the City of Chicago [Illinois], when we were three years old, we had to be on an Easter program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did--
Speaker 2: Yeah, days when you go say, "I'm [HistoryMaker] John Stroger, I just came here to tell you today is Easter day and happy Easter."  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Right, and all the parents [Ella Jones Stroger and John Stroger, Sr.] applaud for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: You have on a little new suit (laughter) those were some of the early memories and when I went to school I met people who are st--my friends today that are still living, so it was a close community, and church at that time when I was very small meant a lot to all of our families.
Story_ID: 192600
Speaker 1: Okay, now--well tell me about growing up in Helena [Arkansas].  How was the city stratified, I mean did you have a black side of town, a white side of town, or what was it like?
Speaker 2: Well, social economics, the whites controlled Helena and Phillips County [Arkansas], all of the farms and farm related industry was obviously controlled by the white community.  The blacks provided the basic labor force for the farming industry as well as, salt mills that existed in Helena.  Helena was a thriving community when I was a small kid, in the Delta region, we had some of the finest stores for people and many of the people from Mississippi.  Helena is a place located on the Mississippi River and many of the communities across the river into Mississippi, used to come into Helena to shop when I was a kid.  I had an occasion when I was a young man to work for Crescent Jewelry in Helena which is located on Cherry Street in those days, they sold fine jewelry and chinaware to people from Mississippi and all surrounding communities near Helena, Arkansas.  So, I got a chance to get som--that type of exposure, I worked for a gentleman named Victor Solomon [ph.] and he gave me an opportunity to run the tapes, to go to the bank and do the things that most young people didn't get an occas--chance to do and my primary job was hired to keep the place clean, I'd come there before I went to school and clean up and sweep the front and then rush off to school and then after school, come back there and work until they closed around five or five-thirty in the day.
Story_ID: 192601
Speaker 1: What were some of the--we always ask this question that's why I'm asking it because you told me some of it already but, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was growing up, I considered Helena's [Arkansas] really an immaculate clean city or town, we had a population base of roughly between seventy-five hundred and eight thousand in Helena, Arkansas, but throughout the county of Phillips [Arkansas] there were many more people obviously.
Speaker 1: What was the ratio of black people too, and--
Speaker 2: Well, the population ratio was probably during my day in Phillips County, more blacks then there were white, but the social economic class that rule Helena was--at Phillips County was all white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So you said the city was clean basically and--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was very clean.
Speaker 1: --Well kept?
Speaker 2: Well-kept place, now so--even in the very poor areas they may had dilapidated homes and what we called shacks, but everybody emphasized cleanness.
Speaker 1: Okay, so nobody's place actually was--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Ever--things were in order in Helena and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  We had--we lived most of the time, until I was practically an adult, in a three room place, but man, my mother [Ella Jones Stroger] as well as other mother's would scrub their floors and keep their sheets and everything that's immaculately clean.  They emphasized having clean sheets, your clothes had to be clean, your under clothing had to be clean, so yes, cleanness meant a lot to all of the people in my community, excuse me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was some of the other sights and sounds and smells of--
Speaker 2: Well, in Helena we had, and I used to think that we had a building called Solomon Building which was a five story building.  I used to think that was the largest building in the world, as a matter of fact, that was my Empire State Building when I was growing up in Helena.
Speaker 1: The Solomon Building, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had many of the named stores down Cherry Street like J.C. Penny's, Montgomery Ward, and many local stores, Henry's Drug Store, and Kings Drug Store, that to me and during my childhood was the epitome of economic success in Helena.
Story_ID: 192602
Speaker 1: Now, when you were a little boy, who did you take after and what was your personality like?
Speaker 2: Well, I am a witness that you don't violate your father too much in my day.  I would do devilish things like most kids in my day and my father [John Stroger, Sr.] would try to set me straight, I recall, I played hooky from school, that's when I found out that Helena [Arkansas] was really small and I wanted to learn to swim and the teacher who had known my father, her name was Geneva Harris [ph.], unbeknownst to me, when I was a kid, they had known each other from the time when they were children and she thought I was sick and went to find out what happened to me and my father said he's at school, she said no he's not at school and when I came in he said to me, "Where you been"?  I said, at school, he said, "At school?  Geneva Harris was here and she said you were not at school," and he decided to admonish me.  First I got a whooping for lying and he went through the whole ritual, if you're a liar you're a cheat, you're a thief, you'll murder and all those type things and after he'd given me that whooping, I thought everything was okay.  Then he said, "I never had a chance to go to school", and he started talking to me about the opportunities he wanted me to have and go to school and so forth and then he started whooping me again for not wanting an education, so that was the way he looked at things and as years went on, even when I got to college, I really had a great appreciation from the conversations and things that he used to discuss with me about his life and what he'd seen in terms of some of his peers who had an opportunity to get an education and the difference it made in their lives at that particular time.
Speaker 1: And did you have any black professionals in town?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, as a matter of fact, Dr. Robert Miller, Sr. [ph.] whose son and daughters were my classmates all through my school years and the son and daughter both graduated with me at Xavier University [New Orleans, Louisiana] and Dr. Miller, who was a medical doctor, had been a great football player in his day, out to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] in the CIAA [Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association] Conference.  That was one of the big athletic conference from black schools in those days and he was a role model for us and Dr. Prophet, Jose Prophet [ph.] and they both were Alpha [Phi Alpha fraternity] men and before I knew what Greeks were, we wanted to be like them and Dr. Conner who was one of my father's contemporaries in Helena, Arkansas, he was a medical doctor and those are some of the people from a professional point we looked up too.  But, there were a lot of other men in the community who pushed and promoted us and some never had too much formal education, but they really wanted us to be better people.  Take a fellow like W. J. Brown, who ran the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and had a cleaning and tailor shop in my hometown, but I had a chance when I was a kid to travel to Phillips County [Arkansas] with Mr. Brown, trying to get people, in particular, African Americans as--to pay their poll tax, when I was--even in high school.  So, I got an exposure about civil rights type of activities and all though they wasn't talking civil rights, but the fairness of trying to make life much better for African Americans.  I had a chance to see guys like Thurgood Marshall, who would come through Helena and other places surrounding, because I would travel with Mr. Brown.
Story_ID: 192603
Speaker 1: You were talking about a riot that occurred in that area [Helena, Arkansas] before you were born in 1919.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father [John Stroger, Sr.] would tell me about the riot, the Elaine Riot that took place in Helena and it was a result of the farming whites who controlled cotton, the sale of cotton, trying to force the blacks to sell their cotton in Helena and the blacks were trying to organize to try to sell their cotton either in Louisiana in the New Orleans [Louisiana] area or in Memphis [Tennessee] where they could get more money for the sale of their cotton, these people who or was involved in the riot were mostly blacks who owned land.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you say it was suppressed by the [U.S.] National Guard and--
Speaker 2: Well, in the end, in order to squeal the riot, the National Guard was called in.  If you ever go to Helena at the American Legion Post they had a, when I was a kid, a lot of history on, on that situation.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you mentioned Scipio Jones who's an attorney?
Speaker 2: He was an attorney, I never knew him, I read about him and I used to play football against a team in North Little Rock [Arkansas], it was named after him, the school was Scipio Jones High School [North Little Rock, Arkansas], but the story goes that he--and then I've read this myself, he was an outstanding lawyer who fought for many of the people who was--couldn't--sentence as a result of their participation in the riot, and he, over a period of time, was able to save their lives.
Story_ID: 192604
Speaker 1: In terms of sports, did you play sports when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was on the basketball team and I was on the football team, I was not one of the great football players, I was one of the guys the courts used to say, boy if--if you had any athletic ability, you'd be great.  (Laughter)  But I had a lot of fun, I enjoyed it, I met a lot of good people.
Speaker 1: This is in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I played briefly on--on the Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], on the fr--freshman tea--basketball team.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let me go back to grade school, what was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: Grade school and high school bared the same name, Eliza Miller High [School, West Helena, Arkansas] and--
Speaker 1: Eliza?
Speaker 2: E-L-I-Z-A Miller High School, elementary and high school.  The school was donated to the people of Helena by Mrs. Eliza Miller, who owned a lot of land and her family owned the theater and other business activities and when the--
Speaker 1: Now is that a white lady?
Speaker 2: No, this was a black lady.
Speaker 1: Oh, black woman, okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) in early I was telling you about my friend Robert Miller, Jr. and his father, Dr. [Robert] Miller [Sr.], well that was Robert Miller, Jr.'s grandmother and Dr. Miller's mother who gav--donated to the land and helped build that school, it was a three story brick building.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now what--tell me about Eliza Miller and elementary school, I mean,--
Speaker 2: We were--I never knew the difference until I go outta there, we--I knew kids I saw in the neighborhood who were juniors and seniors when I was second and third grade so I know 'em all our lives and when they had the assembly and they used to have assemblies every Friday singing the (unclear).  We used to have some beautiful voices of--of not only our teachers, but some of the students and we'd go through a religious ceremonies during those days and a lot of us, and particularly my sister, took advantage of that to help develop her adult life in terms of how she would express herself and her involvement in community activities.  I was there, I worked, I was on the school paper when I got in high school and--but I never participated the way my sister participated in the activities of school other than, football, basketball and we used to have intramural softball, I was on those teams and everything like that, I was involved.
Story_ID: 192605
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of your teachers at Eliza Miller [High School, West Helena, Arkansas] that stand out now that you remember that--?
Speaker 2: Well, I just went back to a ceremony that was celebrating all the people who had left the school where I went, Eliza Miller, which no longer exists.  Now they have a school called Central High School [West Helena, Arkansas] and I saw one of the best teachers and I guess I ever had, was a guy named Nexton P. Marshall, who's in his nineties now and he was there and he lives in Little Rock, Arkansas and I was--and not only was I, but all of my peers who are now in their seventies were surprised to see how active he was at ninety and he was a science teacher, he taught biology and he taught general science and even today, if you meet any of his students, they'll start to quoting something Marshall told them.  He was a graduate of Tennessee State [Nashville, Tennessee], he had also been a graduate of a high school in Helena, so we were impressed with him.  And then, the principal of our school was a fellow named J.H. White, John H. White, he was a guy about 250-60 pounds and he ran that school with an iron fist, and that was no joke, and he used to teach a course when the kids get ready to graduate, mathematics for life, and he said to most of the girls and fellows, most of you are not gonna go any further than this high school, but you got to know how to figure and use your money properly and he would go all through what you do when you go to the grocery store, how to make choices, how to compute what you--your money, budget making for your home and--but this was not even a course that he had designed for credit, this was a course for life and many of the girls and fellows, they didn't get a chance to go to college like a few of us did and--and I looked back on it and so many of those kids who didn't go to school, went to work for post offices and (unclear) and they raised tremendous families right here in Chicago [Illinois].  So, I was just visiting a fellow who came back from service and graduated from high school with me, who just made eighty, but he had gone to the [U.S.] Navy and then came back and decided to finish high school, but he and his wife has one of the most wonderful families in the city.  All of his kids went off to college, got training, had wonderful families, wonderful careers, so that's the type of people I came up with and grew up with and--and some of the guys came up here or went to other cities, went to work in civil--just more recently, I saw a guys who is a chi--was a Chicago policeman, but a retiree, but I remember him when I was down in what you call seventh or eighth grade, and he was graduated from Miller High School.  So, it was a solid school and there was a guy named Leonard McCree [ph.] who was a sociologist and--and he would talk about all aspects of just general life and, and all the young men and women enjoyed being in his class and then we had Mrs. Mattie Woodridge [ph.] and to us, she was a fabulous person because she had graduated from Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] in the old days and, and then she had gone out to Columbia University in New York  [New York] and that was something big for our community, for someone to have gone to Columbia University or any of the big schools that you would read about in those days or heard about.  So, those are some--and, some of the very impressive people in terms of growing up and one of the people I worked with was G.K. Coleman [ph.] who ran the shop.  We used to have--everybody who went there had to take four years of shop, and we took agriculture and those things broaden your knowledge base and your, just your total life in general.  I never told my wife, Yonnie [Stroger] that I had taken all those carpenter courses, she'd had me out there trying to do things around the house, but all of us had a well-rounded education, good math instructors, I mean good math, and when I went to Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], one of the--on the entrance exam that was one of the real things I felt very comfortable on was the math exam.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'll just tell you this, during my day they didn't have the standardized test.  One of the first standardized tests I took, I took was when I got to Xavier University.

Speaker 1: When you were a senior in high school [at Eliza Miller High School, West Helena, Arkansas], how did you make the decision to go to Xavier University [of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: I was on the school paper, I was one of the business managers of the school paper and Mrs. Mattie May Woodridge [ph.], who was the moderator of the Miller Spectator Newspaper and took us on a field trip to New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one of the institutions we visited while we were in New Orleans was Xavier University of New Orleans which wa--is located at Washington Pine Street in the City of New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that was--is that the only campus you had a chance to visit in those days?
Speaker 2: No, I--I, while I was here on that particular place I went to Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana] which was a beautiful school, one of the finest campus I'd ever seen, but for some reason, all of my friends, who made that trip, decided, that is the ones who were graduating, decided they wanted to go to Xavier and when I went to Xavier, seven people from my high school went down to Xavier in '48 [1948], at the same time I went down.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was Xavier like when you got there?  Now wer--were you a Catholic at this point?
Speaker 2: By that time I was Catholic, I never been anything else, but I used to attend the Baptist--
Speaker 1: Right, because you mentioned Fellowship, yeah Baptist Church--
Speaker 2: By that time I was a member of the Catholic Church.
Speaker 1: Now, was your family Catholic?
Speaker 2: No, they were Baptist and--but my father [John Stroger, Sr.] gave me the freedom of choice and this friend of mines Robert Miller, his sister Doris Ann Miller, and all of us joined the Catholic Church and it was because of Father Joseph Hannicik [ph.] used to work with the young people in our community and he was a good acolyte and he knew how--he was the psychology of young people, he'd give you--he'd give you a book to read and you'd think that you were doing something big, but it was in terms of he wanted you to be well rounded so.  And, he'd give you things interesting like, I recall I read a book called 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' (laughter) it was given to me by Father Hannicik, I--I--, you know, you've seen stories of 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' [D.H. Lawrence] but it was just something to read and we got into it and you'd read those type of things and then he would talk about the right and wrong, eventually of what you had read, yeah.
Story_ID: 192607
Speaker 1: What were some of the--well your fellow stud--you said that [HistoryMaker] Dr. Norman Francis whose now the president of Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], was one of your fellow students, right?
Speaker 2: I met Dr. Francis in the fall of 1948, we were freshmen at Xavier and Norman and I lived in the same Dormitory, [St. Martin] De Porres Hall and we developed immediately, along with a few other guys, a friendship and I became Norman's campaign manager when he ran for president of our class.  I was offered to be on that slate as a treasurer, but I declined I--I really don't think I had the inner drive to want to be out there trying to run for an office, but I did work with Norman and I continued to work with Norman even to the day.  Norman and I and a lot of--several other fellows who was in that dormitory with us were able to continue to function, still work together for the benefit of Xavier University where Norman is the president.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you said you played basketball your freshman year and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was on the team and--but it, I recognize right off that I was not gonna be a star basketball player, although I had a good set shot, I used to enjoy competing with the coach when I was in high school, we would shoot for a penny (laughter) and he had been an outstanding basketball player when he was in college and he had a good set shot.  That's when guys were using the two hand set shot, most of the plays you worked, you worked the ball in, if you couldn't break the zone, they used to play a lot of zones, they'd shoot the ball back out to one of the guards and you'd try to break the zone by affectively shooting a two hand set shot.  As I was going out of high school, particularly around my neighborhood, we had--was picking up on the one hand jump shot and I think my first real experience of the one hand jump shot was when I worked at Culver in the (unclear) Culver Military Academy [Culver, Indiana] in the summer, seeing the young men from Kentucky and Indiana, who at that time was perfecting the jump shot, the one hand jump shot.
Speaker 1: That was about 1952, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Well, the time I used to notice it, I would say from about '49 [1949] to--in the early '50s [1950s], that--there were kids at Culver Military Academy and in that community around Culver, they were shooting the jump shot.  I recall our coach used to train us to use a two hand jump shot, mostly it within say three or four feet from the rim and you would jump as high as you could and arch the ball behind you and try to shoot over some taller guy which was usually very successful because the guy couldn't block it unless he really got in on you to--too closely, so--but by the time I started coaching and got to Mildred Jackson High School [Hughes, Arkansas], they were able--those young guys and everybody, and even guys like me were perfecting the one hand jump shot.
Story_ID: 192608
Speaker 1: Well tell me about your senior year at Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Did you--you got a degree in business administration, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is really a story.  I went to Xavier, and you asked me some of my instructors who impressed me, but there was that guy, I told you Leonard McCree [ph.] who used to talk about all the social conditions and so forth and could I articulate this?  So when I got in the registrars line to determine what I was gonna major in, the only thing I could think about is Mr. McCree in sociology, so I got in the line and filled out papers to major in sociology but there was a fellow behind me named Karl Ali McAdams [ph.] I think he came from South Carolina, who had been in World War II [WWII], but prior to World War II, he was a teacher in South Carolina and--and he looked at my (unclear)and said "You gonna major in sociology?"  And I said yes, he said, "You can't ma--do anything with that, you need to get into something where you can make a living."  Now Karl Ali was back on the G.I. Bill and he was majoring in pharmacy so, I stood up there and then I looked at the different choices you could--and I had decided I would major in business administration and that's what I did, I got a degree in business administration.  But, during that time, I met some real outstanding guys in business, Ernest Nathan Morial, who later became known to the national public and the world as Dutch Morial, the Gumbel--
Speaker 1: It's spelled M-O-R-I-A--
Speaker 2: M-O-R-I-A-L, you've heard of Dutch Morial, former Mayor of New Orleans [Louisiana]?  First African American to graduate from the Uni--Louisiana State University Law School [Paul M. Hebert Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], was one of my friends, Richard Gumbel, G-U-M-B-E-L, he has two sons, Brian and Greg was one of my classmates.  I was just talking with another one whose classmates, who spent thirty years in the [U.S.] Army as an army officer and administration and so forth, but we were there we had a lot of fun and we met a lot of people but in th--my spare courses, I took a lot of history, 'cause I always enjoyed history and I used to work in the library at my high school, Miller under Mrs. Adelia Bowman [ph.] and I wor--took that job in the library, no pay, but just to help her so that I'd have a chance to read these books in history and when I was at Xavier, I did the same thing, I worked in the library in the stacks and when I wasn't doing anything, I had a chance to do a lot of reading and I took a lot of extra courses and most of 'em was dealing with history and political science.
Speaker 1: Now, were they teaching African American history then?
Speaker 2: No, I don't recall taking a cla--a special course in African American history, but we had some instructors who would--who was just wanted--we had a lot of--a lot of Irish Catholics who really wanted us to be at the top and they would discuss all aspects of life with us, the good and bad, tell us about their history and their families history and what we need to try to do and it helped us so, I think it made us broader in our outlook in terms of not only just being African American, but understanding what had happened to other people who had come into the United States under difficult circumstances, they didn't have the color situation but economically and socially, they had some of the same problems, you know.
Story_ID: 192609
Speaker 1: Now did--what kind of student were you?  Were you a good student [at Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: I wasn't a summa cum laude or a magna cum laude, like my niece, summa cum laude, but when I started I was just an average student and I think as I got there my grades continued to go up and, and--but I don't think I was in school a semester where I worked less than forty hours a week, as well as, one who took a full course.  I was able to graduate in four years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were working full time and going to school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked at the university [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] more than forty hours a week to help pay my bills.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you became an Alpha [Phi Alpha fraternity] man on campus too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was an Alpha.  And that's a story, Don Collins and Chester Johnson, I had no extra money and a group of Alphas decided they wanted me to be in this fraternity and they got out and paid all the dues that I needed and other activities that I needed to perform helped me to become a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, that was in 1951.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now, is there any particular thing about graduation you want to tell us or, that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, only thing that--that I always tell the guys when I graduated, we had a tremendous graduation ceremony that they was passing out the sheep skin they--and they had--they were in a folder, beautiful Xavier written on the folder and they hand me my so called, sheep skin in my folder and when I opened it up it said see  bursar, balance due, (laughter) I had to--I didn't get my actual degree until I went back that summer and worked and sent the money to pay off the balance that I owed the university. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: So they--they sent you in to work with some business administration problem skills.
Speaker 2: It said--a beautiful folder on the outside in gold 'cause the school color was gold and white and I opened it up, it said see bursar, balance due and stated what the balance I owed the university.  So, I went back in--to Helena [Arkansas] and worked that summer in a compress and sent the money to pay off the balance and they sent me, ultimately, my degree.
Story_ID: 192610
Speaker 1: Right after Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] you taught and coached basketball, right?
Speaker 2: I taught at Mildred Jackson High School in Hughes, Arkansas and I also taught some courses.  I'm proud of what I did in that school year there, I got young people there interested in going to college who had never thought of college and I--working with some of the other teachers, we took kids to--from Hughes, Arkansas up to Nashville [Tennessee], allowed them to spend a weekend at Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and out and around Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and dealing with kids at Meharry Medical School [sic Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] so that they could see that they, if they apply themselves have the same opportunities that these children who are now exercising at these universities.  And, one of the things I used to do is order the Jet magazine, particularly the Ebony, Defender so they could read about other people who had come from rural areas like ours, cotton-dominated communities and went on to become super doctors and top people throughout life and try to motivate these kids so, I see some of those young people who are not young anymore, here--here in Chicago [Illinois], yeah.  As a matter of fact, a young man who works for the forest preserve district, his mother's a nurse in the Gary [Indiana] school system, but she came from Hughes and she was one of the young ladies that I convinced the importance of going to college and she went to Arkansas for a while and then transferred and get in a nursing program up here in Gary, Indiana, her name is Mar--in those days Mary Dale Fultz, F-U-L-T-Z, but she married a gentleman named Mayberry so she's Mary Dale Mayberry now.  But that's--those are some of the pleasant experiences I've had particularly before I moved to Chicago.
Story_ID: 192611
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about the move to Chicago [Illinois], 'cause it kinda, from what we discussed off camera, it was kind of a surprise to you that you were--
Speaker 2: Well, I had not planned to do anything but teach school the next year, and I came to Chicago in '53 [1953], May of '53 [1953], and it was Ella [Jones] Stroger, my mother who had set the machinery for me to leave Helena and I told her, well, momma, I don't wanna leave, I wanna go back and teach, I'm gonna have a good team next year and she says, no, you won't have a good team here, you may have it in Chicago or something like that.  And she had made arrangements for a gentleman to drive me up to Chicago and talk with Mrs. Digsby [ph.], Cora Digsby about me living with her and I came up, got off at a Mr--no, his car broke down in Joliet and I got a ride with some people and got off in front of DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois] and walked through that alley to 4855 Federal to Mrs. Digsby's house and I stayed with Mrs. Digby until I decided I should be out on my own and Mrs. Digby and my initial day, she would not take any money, all I had to do--she insisted that I bring her a money order stub to show that I had sent some money back to my mother so, I started off getting a lot of support.  And I had told you earlier that my mother had come here when she was a young lady, so I met a lot of her childhood friends who were living here in Chicago and many Xavier [University, New Orleans, Louisiana] people later who was--had come to Xavier University from Chicago, and I assimilated and I've had a good experience here.  I've enjoyed Chicago.
Story_ID: 192612
Speaker 1: What I've heard is that your mother [Ella Jones Stroger] had your bags packed for you, when you got home and you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in May of 1953, she had packed my bags and worked out a deal with the gentleman for me to ride with him to Chicago [Illinois] and I was to live with Mrs. Cora Digby [ph.] and she lived at 4855 Federal Street, right around from DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, now were the--the big high rise projects up then?
Speaker 2: No.  No, that was prior to the high rise.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was just prior to 'em right?  Or just a couple years away 'cause they--
Speaker 2: Well, quite a few before we got that far up, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so wh--what was Chicago like?  Now, you were in what we now consider, I guess Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I was living at 4855 Federal, and in the days when I came up, you wasn't nobody unless you went down on 47th Street and I went to 47th Street and met a lot of people that I knew from Helena, Arkansas over a period of time, just standing around 47th and what was called in those days South Parkway which is now called King Drive.  And I also went to 366 E. 47th Street, and met Ralph Metcalfe who at that time was a Democratic committeeman of the Eighth Ward [sic.] and who had, before I got down to Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], had been an instructor at Xavier and a track coach and talked with him and joined his political organization.
Speaker 1: Now, that was the Eight Ward then where Metcalfe--?
Speaker 2: No that was the Third Ward.
Speaker 1: Third ward, okay, that's what I thought Third Ward.
Speaker 2: And at the--during the per--early days of my entering into Chicago, I also met Harold Washington, whose father had an office in the same building where Mr. Metcalfe's office was.
Speaker 1: That's right, Roy Washington.
Speaker 2: Roy Washington, correct.
Story_ID: 192613
Speaker 1: Now did you have any inclination towards politics when you were--
Speaker 2: Yes, I did--
Speaker 1: --in Helena [Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, I wanted--
Speaker 1: --I mean, before you came to [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had not looked at it like I later professed to be, but I've always had some appreciation for politics and I told you I worked with this gentleman, J.W. Brown and he once took me over to Little Rock [Arkansas] to hear [U.S. Congressman] William [L.] Dawson speak, I think that was in the '48 [1948] campaign.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I did have an interest but there were no blacks holding elected offices in Helena when I grew up, now--
Speaker 1: And Dawson, of course, I mean, Dawson was a (unclear) for [President] Harry [S.] Truman I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes he was, '48 [1948], and--but now Robert Miller [Jr.] who was my classmate and went to Xavier [University, New Orleans, Louisiana] with me is the Mayor of Helena, Arkansas and my sister before she died, was the vice mayor of Helena and the chairman of their finance committee.
Speaker 1: Now, but when you were there, black people couldn't vote in Helena, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I told you I went around with Mr. Brown to get people to pay their poll tax, but one of the jokes was whether or not their votes really counted, they don't know and it was hard to get people to pay poll taxes because most of the people were farmers and they wasn't making that much money.
Speaker 1: So now, that's illegal now isn't it to make a person pay a poll tax?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes, Civil Rights Act [1964] and the Voting Rights Act [1965] changed, that's why you find in the southern communities so many blacks in local office because they now have an opportunity to participate in the electoral process.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now when you were in Helena, growing up in Helena, black people could vote but they were unlikely to because of the poll tax and--
Speaker 2: Well some paid there poll tax and, and those who did pay used to say, they didn't know whether or not their vote was being counted.  Now, we don't know whether you can quantify that or not but--
Speaker 1: --So, they actually could go to (unclear) the polls and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I can truly--
Speaker 1: --Unlike some places where they actually would physically drive you away or give you a chance to--
Speaker 2: --Yeah, I could truly tell you that there were no black elected officials.  (Laughter), Now another thing I did before I came up here, I worked with Shepherdson Wilbourne [ph.] who was a lawyer, I was not a lawyer but I was a graduate from Xavier University, who was preparing a suit against the Helena School Board under the theory that our schools were not equal to the white schools, separate but equal, doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson [1896], was the controlling factor and I went on behalf of Shepherds and Wilbourne to the county building to copy data for him to send to Little Rock [Arkansas] to Philander Smith [College], that turned the--well they used it to make the determination as to whether or not there was equality in the school system.  And, and I went over before I left, one of the things I did with Shepherdson Wilbourne was, when he went over to file the suit, I rode over to Little Rock with him and, to file that suit, I was just a bystander, but what I did was, would go up to the courthouse and copy data, we didn't have the copy machines at that time, what was being spent for the white schools and what was being spent for the black schools and the differences became that disparity showed that there was no equality in the system.  And that case was not decided immediately, because the judge told Shepherds and Wilbourne and another lawyer named Jack (unclear) who was also filing cases, that he would wait to see what the Supreme Court was gonna say about what we later learned in '54 [1954], was Brown versus the Board of Education [of Topeka, 1954].
Speaker 1: Okay, and all that changed in '54 [1954], when--with the decision, well--
Speaker 2: In '54[1954], that was the beginning of the change--
Speaker 1: --Yeah, the beginning of the change--
Speaker 2: --it took some time--
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: --To try to eventually get that implemented and some of the--even now in my home town, they have some kind--a white school, but it's not financed by tax payers' money, there are some of the farmers and big people who don't want their kids integrated and they have a private setting, you know.
Story_ID: 192614
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what did you--what kind of employment did you find here in Chicago [Illinois] when you got here?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the first jobs I had was working at Alden mail order [Aldens, Inc.] and I stayed there only a short time 'cause I got homesick and went home, but when I came back I went to work for the government and I worked, my first government job was with the old municipal court of the City of Chicago under a gentleman whose name was Joseph L. Gill, G-I-L-L, and I was one of the many assistant auditors in the old municipal court and the auditor of the court was a fellow named John Madigan, M-A-D-I-G-A-N, he was the auditor of the Municipal Court of the City of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now is he related to the, to the John Madigan that--
Speaker 2: If so, I'm not aware of that.
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Not the State Senator Madigan we have now.
Speaker 2: You talking about the speaker?
Speaker 1: Mike Madigan [Michael Madigan], yeah Mike Madigan.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how--how long did you work for them, the Municipal Court?
Speaker 2: I worked for them I think in '54 [1954], or the early part of '55[1955], somewhere between to '54 [1954], to '55 [1955].  I got an offer from Joseph Lohman, who was the sheriff of Cook County, to be the personnel person at the county jail, so I was an assistant to the warden at the county jail up from '54 [1954] or, the latter of '54 [1954], the beginning of '55 [1955], to the warden who was named Jack Johnson, a former police captain in the sheriff's police, who was the assistant warden.  And I worked with the late Hans Madick [ph.], one of the top criminologist in this country and John Gannon, Hammond Frankel [ph.] at the jail and then I left the jail I think in '60 [1960], or '61 [1961]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Around in that period, now that I can't give you a--and then I went back to the courts for a short period of time and ultimately I decided to go to night law school and I just did some other things and eventually, I graduated from law school and in '67 [1967], I was admitted to the bar.
Story_ID: 192615
Speaker 1: Okay, now let me backtrack a little bit, because, now getting a job for the--in those days and, you know, even today to some extent, but I know especially then, we had like a democratic machine and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was recommended for my job by Ralph Metcalfe.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  So that's how you got the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That was my recognition, yeah.
Speaker 1: --'Cause that's a pretty good job, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't much money in that day but, they played it up, a big thing, Stroger first black to be this or something like that, but it wasn't know real money.  (Laughter).  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and so you were--but in turn you worked for the Metcalfe--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) political organization.
Speaker 1: --Organization, yes.
Speaker 2: And that's where I met Harold Washington, who later became mayor, and [HistoryMaker] Justice [Charles] Freeman, Charles Freeman and Kenneth Wilson, who was appellate court judge at the time of his death and a host of other young men and women, Bishop Charles Ford, who was one of the bishops in the Church of God in Christ, so he was all--we were all young Democrats under Ralph Metcalfe.
Story_ID: 192616
Speaker 1: You worked for the county jail [Cook County Jail, Chicago, Illinois] as a personnel assistant (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Assistant to the warden there.
Speaker 1: To the warden, yeah, from '55 [1955] to '61 [1961]? And you went to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, possibly '61 [1961], I don't know, whether it was '60 [1960] or '61 [1961], yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: So, did you work while you were going to law school too?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I worked--I later went to work for a fellow named Joseph, not Joseph Knight, Mr. Knight, Joe Knight, Joe Knight, who was the Director of Financial Institution for the State of Illinois during the Connor [sic. Timothy J. O'Connor] era and I stayed there and I worked a short time as a part-time investigator for the Department of Investigation for the City of Chicago [Illinois], under Thomas--well my immediate boss was the Honorable Russell Dubois, and I investigated things for the mayor's office and other activities dealing with city programs and projects.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the title of that job was again, you were at?
Speaker 2: I was just a part-time investigator.
Speaker 1: Okay, an investigator for the mayor's office?
Speaker 2: Department of Investigation is what they called it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: I think the commissioner was Thomas McInery [ph.], who had been an FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigations] agent, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so this is between '61[1961] and '67[1967], right?
Speaker 2: No, part--I think after I left there, I went to work for Joseph Knight and I stayed there until '67 [1967], I worked in that department until I got my law license.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now, well, tell me about--
Speaker 2: And when I worked there I was dealing with what we now call abandoned property, you see 'em always publishing in the newspaper that people have money, well I was there when we started that program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 192617
Speaker 1: Well, so much has been said about Chicago [Illinois] politics. From your perspective, coming here from Helena, Arkansas, and getting involved in it, how did it work?  How did things work?  How do you really think things work in the democratic organization?
Speaker 2: Well, as I reflect on this, my meeting Mr. [Ralph] Metcalfe and Mr. Metcalfe really taking a personal concern with me, and also meeting his wife [Madalynne Metcalfe] who was from Arkansas, but at that time, I didn't know she was from Arkansas, I just got deeply involved with the political process and I got involved with the Young Democrats and I went all around meeting people.  I have friends, who--Caucasian friends that I met back, oh, I hadn't been in Chicago over a year, before I started going all over meeting people and dealing with them through what they call a Cook County [Illinois] Young Democrat.  Many of those people are now retired or they, over the years held key offices and positions in Chicago and Cook County, so I developed relationships and I told you my mother had lived here and she had a lot of friends and as time went on, I got to meeting and to interact with those friends, as well as, many Xavierites who had moved here and I developed just a friendship and a wide range, a social network, it was more social then it was, at that time political here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and many of the pharmacists at that time, you couldn't go into a pharmacist on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] without running into a Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] guy in those days, 'cause we--
Speaker 1: Right, 'cause that school of pharmacy is very strong,--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a pharmacy school.  They still have a pharmacy school.
Story_ID: 192618
Speaker 1: Tell me about Ralph Metcalfe, what was he like? He's, you know, he's now passed.  There's a building named after him [Ralph H. Metcalfe Federal Building] here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Federal building, yeah.
Speaker 1: Federal building, yeah, but what was Ralph Metcalfe like?
Speaker 2: To me?  I thought he was a dynamic person, he was--he was obviously a teacher, he had taught and was a track coach at Xavier, he had been successful as an athlete in his own rights, and as a political leader he was dynamite--
Speaker 1: Now was Ralph Metcalfe at Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] when you were there?
Speaker 2: No, I said he was--had been the track coach--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he had been a--
Speaker 2: --Before I got there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so he had a connection with--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Xavier was a, one of the great track teams in the '30s [1930s] and the very early '40s [1940s], they rivaled anybody in the United States in those days, during the time that Ralph Metcalfe and the Wright Brothers were coaching there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so--well go on about Metcalfe.
Speaker 2: Well, politically he believed in trying to have a very disciplined political organization, he brought some of the same principals and philosophies that he had used as a coach and as an athlete into his political organization, we had training programs to try to make our captains more sophisticated in terms of their political approach, and he conducted himself in such a way that most of us held him in a high esteem and I was included in that most of us.

Speaker 1: Okay, now you say you met Harold Washington too, what was his,--
Speaker 2: Well, Harold--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I met Harold, one of the first individuals I met when I got here [Chicago, Illinois], in particular when I went to 366 East 47th Street, and one of the first times I went out socially, I think Harold Washington invited me to go with him to a party at the Belvedere Hotel one Friday evening, they were being sponsored by a guy named Leroy Vetal [ph.], and, and I so often tell my friends, Harold was at this party and was partying and talking stuff, he looked around and I was sitting on the coach as if I was afraid to be present, he says, "Get up horse, dance with one these girls, talk with 'em, say something sweet to 'em," (laughter) and everybody started laughing at me like I was a country hick.  I guess I may have been looking the part.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So he called you hoss?
Speaker 2: Horse.
Speaker 1: Horse, horse.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I worked with him with the Young Democrats there, although he was older than I was, as a matter of fact, I learned practically all my, what we call procedure of conducting meetings, Harold Washington used to con--hold those seminars and teach parliamentary procedure and I learned it from him.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: You know you if you a fraternity man, you gon' know some parliamentary procedure.
Speaker 1: Right, 'cause he's--he was an Alpha [Phi Alpha Fraternity] too?
Speaker 2: No he wasn't--
Speaker 1: No he wasn't?  Okay.
Speaker 2: --But, then if you go to an Alpha meeting or any of those meetings, these guys want to play parliamentary law with you all the time.  But, Harold Washington had been the president and everybody knows the history of the student body at Roosevelt, he was a master at that parliamentary procedure and we would have those seminars through the Young Democrats of the Third Ward and then when we would go to other organizations, particularly the county and state, and national, we would have these big debates with people and we could usually out maneuver them for this we--most of us understood parliamentary procedure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 192620
Speaker 1: Well tell me about DePaul Law School [DePaul University College of Law, Chicago, Illinois] too, was there anything significant about DePaul Law School?
Speaker 2: No, I was just a student, I wasn't a spectacular student and I went at night and the funny thing about it, by this time I'm married with two kids and my wife [Yonnie Stroger] is pregnant and I go in and tell her that I'm in law school and she's jumps up screaming and hollering, "I married a crazy man", (laughter) I never told her I was going to law school (laughter) but it worked out for us all,--
Speaker 1: Now, how did--
Speaker 2: She's happy that I did what I did and I hope that I tried to be faithful and tried to have a good life for her also, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, wh--when did you all meet and how did you meet?
Speaker 2: Met her at the Third Ward Democratic Organization, she came up with a precinct captain who had been working in her community and because she had lived in that community all of her life, and her father owned property and the uncles and all lived in that neighborhood, he hired her to be a watcher or something and she came up and she was walking up the steps and I was coming in and I saw her and I turned to one of guys who was with me and said, "Boy look at that girl with those pretty legs, wonder who is she?" (laughter) but when I got up there, I don't know how we start talking but, I started talking with her and I said, "I'm gonna call you", you know how fellows sound and she said a few words, she gave me her number and I gave her my number and eventually we start talking and one of the ladies who lived in her building was someone who had lived next to me in Helena, Arkansas, and so this lady said, "Boy that John Stroger is a nice kid, he was a nice kid when we lived in Helena" and that was the beginning, (laughter) so lucky I was nice to that lady (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well Helena comes in handy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it did in this case. Her name is Antoinette Thomas [ph.], she lives in Evergreen Park [Illinois] now. She's an elderly lady but she told Yonnie what a nice guy I was (laughter).
Story_ID: 192621
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well when you graduated from law school [DePaul University College of Law, Chicago, Illinois] did you change careers at all?  Did you start--did you begin to practice law (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was still deeply in politics and after I graduated, and my wife [Yonnie Stroger] didn't want to live in her father's building, she said, "I didn't marry you to move upstairs in my daddy's building", so we moved to--over in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] for a brief time and then my wife found a location at 7915 Langley and we moved out there.  But, the interesting thing about that was, when I moved out there I went and met a young man who I'd met in the Cook County Young Democrats, whose name was Joseph McMahon who was acting the committeeman of that particular ward and I started to working with him, as well as, working with Ralph Metcalfe and Joseph McMahon moved out the neighborhood 'cause--hood, the neighborhood was changing and they were looking for a committeeman, they weren't looking for me, but the guy that ultimately they--Joe was trying to push as a guy who unfortunately was killed and all the older guys, the black guys out there knew of my relationship with the Third Ward [Chicago, Illinois] and these guys knew of me through the Young Democrats and that was my first opportunity to get the role that I later became, which was a committeeman.  And they were trying to get somebody who was much older than me and probably had more money, but when they approached Mayor Daley, and they told him about my background and I told you I had once worked as an investigator and I had to deal with Mayor [Richard J.] Daley, Mayor Daley suggest why not use that young man, if any man can have a family, go through law school and still work within the political arena, he should be a good leader, and that's the way I got in there and I've been there ever since 19, as the committeemen, since 1967, first by appointment and then in '68 [1968], elected.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is in the Eighth Ward [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: So that's where you used to live.
Speaker 1: You're right, exactly. Exactly.
Story_ID: 192622
Speaker 1: So now, Eighth Ward [Chicago, Illinois], now what characterized the Eighth Ward when you moved there?  What was it like?
Speaker 2: Well, right now (unclear) it was in a state of racial transition when I moved out there, everybody out there seemed to been moving to Beverly, 19th Ward, 18th Ward--
Speaker 1: These are the white residents?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the white residents, some were moving out to South Holland [Illinois] and Dolton [Illinois] and some others were moving to Orlando Park [Orland Park, Illinois], there's just a state of racial transition but when I first became the committeemen, I guess half the organization was still Caucasians.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--all right so half, but it was changing?
Speaker 2: But it was a state of--
Speaker 1: It's becoming black--
Speaker 2: --Racial transition, yeah.  As a matter of fact, when I ran for president, the fact that I worked with so many of those people and been in and out of their communities and churches, I met a lot of those people when I was campaigning for, to be President of the County Board and many of those families opened their doors for me to help me meet their neighbors when I was running for president of the county board.
Speaker 1: Okay, now the Eighth Ward has a reputation that's similar to the Sixth Ward in that, you know, a lot of black homeowners had--
Speaker 2: Well, it's the same composition, if you look at the census report, they have good educational backgrounds for the people, many stable family situations and well-kept neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so they depend on an alderman in the Eighth Ward and the organization in the Eighth Ward to provide services on time and proper--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they help the organizations also because they demand that you have a good organization and that you, in many instances, represent their interest.  You know, that if you're a committeeman in the Eighth Ward or alderman, if you don't do what is in the best interest of the people, they gon' vote you out, so in terms, our organizational structure reflects what our community expect from us in terms of good government.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now you were a committeeman, who--who was alderman when you were--when you--
Speaker 2: Bill Cousins [HistoryMaker William Cousins, Jr.] when I first came in, he was an independent and I was considered the regular organization guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Bill Cousins is a person that I've always had great respect for and he seemed to have shown mutually that he respect me and our real concern was to try to make certain that the people of the Eighth Ward enjoyed the fruits of whatever politics offered.  Yes, during certain elections, he may be with certain individuals that I'd be against, but the general philosophy was to try to bring as much to the constituency of the Eighth Ward as we possibly could bring.
Story_ID: 192623
Speaker 1: Now in the '60s [1960s] here in Chicago [Illinois], [Mayor] Richard J. Daley's the mayor of the town, it's a strong Democratic organization in town, the Civil Rights Movement is going on too, now did you have any interaction with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] when he came in town in '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: No I didn't, but I can tell you about what I did in conjunction with Mr. [Ralph] Metcalfe and Harold Washington in the '50s [1950s], when first in '54 [1954], Mr. Metcalfe ran for Democratic committeeman of the Third Ward, Harold Washington and I worked for Mr. Metcalfe and at the same time we were working for to elect a Democratic slate that Richard Daley, who was not the mayor then, was a chairman of the Democratic Party, that they called a blue ribbon slate which included Joseph Lohman who was the sheriff that I later went to work for at the jail.  But, during that period, Harold Washington and a group of others, the young fellows, Bill Harris and others, we worked hard for Mr. Metcalfe's election, in '55 [1955], Mr. Metcalfe ran for alderman against Archibald Carey [Jr.] who was one of the outstanding Americans, not just black, he was at the United Nations, he--boy he was a very articulate man, he spoke for the United States at the United Nations, but Metcalfe won that race, but during that period, Richard J. Daley, was running to be mayor of the City of Chicago and Harold and I, working with others and the Third Ward, brought our votes in for Richard J. Daley, and he became the mayor of the City of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--now, what about in '66 [1966], now did--when King came to town, I know there was kind of a--
Speaker 2: No, I was never, I was never involved in a big way with Martin Luther King, I had respect for Martin Luther King, but during '66 [1966], I was still trying to pass the bar and I did occasionally used to go over to [Operation] Breadbasket meeting that they used to have over on Halsted but I was not--I was all political and all trying to pass the bar and do some other activities to try to support my family at that particular time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there was--I heard there was like tension between some of the black aldermen and the activists.
Speaker 2: Well, I was not in anywhere I had any tension with King, I was not a leader at that caliber like I was not an alderman, I was not an elected official.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I think Harold and myself and some others, we would occasionally go to certain meetings, but we would not identify with anyone other than--the, in my case the Third Ward Democratic Organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I used to go sometimes to the meetings, because some of the people were my personal friends who were involved.
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of those, those people?
Speaker 2: Well, [HistoryMaker] Gus Savage, I knew and I recall even later I went to a convention with Mayor Daley and I knew a lot of those guys 'cause they were either Alpha [Phi Alpha Fraternity] men, many of them had gone to Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  I remember Lloyd Jackson who came from Rhode Island to play football for Xavier, but he was the chairman of Racine County democrat, but they were not in the same political framework that the democratic party of Cook County was, so they were the outsiders so to speak, but they were my personal friends from college.  [Ernest Nathan] "Dutch" Morial, whose married and later became mayor of New Orleans [Louisiana], was one of those individuals, Maynard Jackson, who did become the mayor of Atlanta [Georgia], those were people I knew and notwithstanding, I was a regular democratic political leader, I was also a friend personally of those individuals.  And I recall when they had a meeting over in Gary [Indiana] for all blacks, I went over to that meeting, and I was not one of the leaders but, I went over there, one, to see what their agenda was and then also to be with my friends.
Story_ID: 192624
Speaker 1: Now what was your perspective in 1968, when the riots took place here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't in no top row, my real experience was that it was--I witness some of the chaotic situation, I got a firsthand account through my brother-in-law who was a Chicago policeman and who was stationed in front of the Hilton Hotel, who told me that people actually threw human waste in his face and that's serious, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is the Democratic National Convention, right, you're talking about?
Speaker 2: In '68 [1968], that's what you're talking about isn't?
Speaker 1: Well, I was talking about '68 [1968] too, the riots on the West Side when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated too, right?
Speaker 2: No, King wasn't assassinated at the riots over on the west side but there were riots when he marched in certain parts of the city.
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying that there were--after he was assassinated in April of '68[1968], there were riots on the West Side.
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't over on the West Side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I--I to have a pers--personal eye witness, no I wasn't there, but I did go over after the riots and even today, there are certain remnants of what occurred over there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That place used to be very beautiful, it used to be very active business communities over there and after those riots and the burnings on Madison [Street] and some of the other streets over there, it left the place barren, you know.
Speaker 1: So just a turbulent time for the city and, that's what--I guess that's what I--the point I was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a bad time.  It was the frustration of the people who lived over there and I think that sometimes some of the people did some of the, I guess, illegal activities never understood the total scope of what Martin Luther King was all about.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I believe riots were erupting all over the country, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: It was, and that's the same thing, it was a state of frustration, people had been held back, and misused and they were venting their frustrations and I'm saying that if they could have understood the totality of the situation, I doubt if they would've burned buildings and burned some of their own homes and--because that just set us back just that much farther in terms of--you think burning down all those stores and things that service our community was not in the best interest of the community--
Story_ID: 192625
Speaker 1: You said you attended occasional meetings of Operation PUSH [People United to Serve Humanity, later, Rainbow PUSH Coalition]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I'm a very, it wasn't PUSH then it was [Operation] Breadbasket then, but I'm still very active with PUSH, I mean, I--I feel like that there's a role for Push to play in our community and there's a role that I have to play as a Democratic party leader and as a public servant, and I don't see where it's incongruent.  I may not agree with every strategy that's implemented by PUSH, whereas they may not agree with everything that I have to do, but I know the importance of PUSH to our community and I do think [HistoryMaker] Reverend [Jesse L.] Jackson recognize what we people in the political arena must do--also do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're saying there's a role that you play?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a role that I play, and there's a role that Jackson plays, and we--the whole concern is to end with a product that's gonna be beneficial to our community and to the people of the city in general.  You can't have total isolation from the total community and there are things Jackson can see and articulate that politically sometimes I don't see or I'm in a different position, 'cause I'm a part of the establishment, but if they call it to my attention and I'm in a leadership role, I try to make certain that I do the things that's gonna be in the best interest of everybody.
Story_ID: 192626
Speaker 1: Now, what were you doing in the late '60s [1960s], I mean after law school [DePaul University College of Law, Chicago, Illinois], I mean what positions were you holding?  You were, you said you just became the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was practicing law.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I practiced law up until I was elected, well I practiced law up until I was elected president of the county board, but in the--in the early years, I was practicing law exclusively and then when--1970, I was elected a member of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County [Illinois] and I've been on the board continuously since 1970, and in 1994, I was elected president of this board.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now in the early '70s [1970s], what would you have seen or what did you see there that's the biggest issues facing the--the
Speaker 2: Well, I was concerned in 1970, and what I put a lot of emphasis on, was try to have a better healthcare delivery system in Cook County and I made it my business to articulate and talk about the importance of having a new Cook County Hospital [later John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois].  I was out there pushing also to have what is now called single member districts.  All the commissioners used to be elected just from two districts, Chicago at large and a suburban at large, I thought that was not equal representation, and I fought to try to get what we now have as a single district representation.  I fought continuously to try to get a new hospital, the old building was archaic, it was not in keeping with what we thought should be a modern type of healthcare delivery system and we fought for that.  I also, after the new Provident Hospital [Chicago, Illinois] was eventually built in the '80s [1980s], and they lost the hospital, I tried to get that building and ultimately working with Mr. [George] Dunne, did get that building and under the failing administration we opened it up as one of the county facilities so, that was some of things that I was concerned with politically.  I--I one time was promoting and voted for, but I was initially out front trying to get the change from the old coroner system in the county government to what we now have is the medical examiner, which I think gave that office a broader scope of authority in determining the cause of death in this area.  So, those are the things that I've always been out front.  I was just trying to make county government different and bring it up to date and make it more modern.
Story_ID: 192627
Speaker 1: Okay, now in the early '70s [1970s], well, you probably know the exact year better than I do now, but if recollection serves me, in the early '70s [1970s], maybe '73 [1973], '74 [1974], or I guess, it's when Ralph Metcalfe sort of--sort of change the--his attitude towards Mayor [Richard J.] Daley, it had to do with an incident--
Speaker 2: Well, I was obviously a part of the Democratic Party and I told you that I had worked with Mr. Metcalfe, but by that time, I was the committeeman in my own rights, similar to what Ralph was, and I was out in the Eighth Ward, but I know what occurred.  Mr. Metcalfe was trying to get the late Mayor Daley to understand that the police officers were a little over brutal to the black constituency and it was spelled out with Dr. [Herbert] Odom, who was stopped and misused by the police, Metcalfe was trying to get something done and between the debating and the discussion with the mayor at the time, who was Richard J. Daley, there was a breakdown and Metcalfe eventually decided to carry that communities fight.  And, it was all about trying to reform the police department in a manner in which they would be more respectable to the black citizens of, in this case on the south side, and ultimately throughout the City of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did that effect you in any way?  I mean in terms of your posture and--
Speaker 2: Well, it affects me, I was a black and just a--and I was a pro-law enforcement type guy, because you--I had been in law enforcement through the sheriff's office and the county jail, but I wouldn't wanna to see anybody and particularly, black community to be mistreated by the police department.  And even the police have now ultimately tried to reform itself to make certain that they try to reduce the incidence of racial problems as it relates to blacks and Hispanic and other people who don't have any means of protection from the police department.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have an assessment--now, now, during this period of time you got Ralph Metcalfe, is a--is a--well I guess it starts--you start with the--we can go back to, it's the murder of Fred Hampton, we got the African American Patrolmen's League founded and they sue the city over police brutality and you have Doc Odom's case, being--suffering at the hands of officers in a simple traffic stop--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --And--and through it all, you know, it seems in a black community, Mayor Daley seems like he's on the wrong side of what's going on, and how did you--did you have an assessment of how he really felt about--
Speaker 2: Well, I think--I think--I think that not only Mayor Daley, but I think that, that anybody who is the mayor of the City of Chicago, would most likely, don't want unfair treatments to any citizen, but when things develop, the mayor going back to, going back to [Martin H.] Kennelly who's before Daley, always would protect the police.  I think that's nearly a natural thing, but what later happened was, that these people sometimes get so far out of line that even the Mayor, 'cuz Daley had to reform the police during his period, it wasn't about the Odom situation but because of the situation of those Summerdale police officers going in, burglarizing homes and doing things of that nature, lead to the mayor bringing in O.W. Wilson, from the California University to reform the police department and many of the reforms that he instituted even helped the black community.  And also, opened the doors for more blacks to be in top positions in the police force that have carried on over to the day, until the point, that we had superintendents who were black, and among them was Sam--Sam Nolan in a temporary base and then Fred Rice and LeRoy Martin and then the last young man who was a police superintendent, who did a very good job.  But, it's something about the police in a big urban area that they get so many guys, and many of them come from the same basis, that they sometimes misuse their authority, and this is not reflective of all, but you don't need but one or two people to do something to cause the problems that we have.
Story_ID: 192628
Speaker 1: When [Mayor] Richard J. Daley dies in 19-, I think it's '76 [1976], right?  And, I guess the Democratic Party is kinda shaken up a little bit, but the--one of the strongest, I guess, hold over is from the days when it was very, very strong, was George Dunne of the County Commission [Cook County Board of Commissioners, Cook County, Illinois], now what's your--do you have an assessment of George Dunne and--
Speaker 2: I enjoyed working with Mr. Dunne, I found him to be a very fair person, I think some of his early experiences as he related to me and not just talking about politics, he had, had some earlier contacts with blacks, he told me at one time, that his family rented from a black gentleman over on the north side and he got a chance to interact with that family and people and they had a lot of people in his organization, when he was a young man, who was from the black community, so when I dealt with him in this role over here with the county board, I found him to be very fair.  I didn't always agree with him on every issue, but I found him to be fair and when I ran for president of the county board, he offered his support and he gave me his support and along with Thomas Hines and a few other guys that I had worked with over here on the county side, I was able to marshal a force to support me for president of the county board that helped carry me over the--the line.  So, Mr. Dunne, I went in asking for single member districts, he didn't originally agreement with me, but later he came to me and told me he thought I was right and we passed the ordinance that created the district representation form that we now have.  And, I was always trying to make certain that the county hospital was a bible institution that takes care of medical indigent in the county and Mr. Dunne felt the same way, when I was not able to get a full support at that time for the building of a new hospital.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this is a protracted struggle that you said begins in 1970, trying to--
Speaker 2: Well, that's when--I get--there were people before me, but I--I really got out and talked about building a new hospital, generating as much enthusiasm within the community and among groups to build a new hospital.  It was only when Phelan came in that the momentum really took off in a big way.
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of people think that you really are the impetus behind the--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm the person that kept talking it up.
Speaker 1: --And that's why it's named (laughter) after you, 'cause you pushed it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that's what [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson said, yeah, that I should--and I heard even my arch political but not enemy, Carl Hanson, even said that I had, this going back in '70s [1970s], he remember me as the chairman of the public service committee as promoting the concept of a new county hospital.
Story_ID: 192629
Speaker 1: What was the condition of County Hospital [Cook County Hospital, later John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois] in 1970, that really--
Speaker 2: It was taking care of a lot of people who needed it, but it was costing the county a lot of money 'cause the building was in bad repair and it wasn't up to date like it is today with all the modern convenience that had--I think it should have to deliver the quality of service that people need in this century.
Speaker 1: So was it--you don't think it was worth of a city like Chicago [Illinois] to have a--
Speaker 2: No, I thought we needed a new hospital years ago, even before I got on the board.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what was--what are some of the highlights and the struggles to get the new county hospital?
Speaker 2: Well, we continued to spend an astronomical amount of money just for maintenance, physical maintenance of the plant, and then we couldn't bring some of the high tech in and every time we had to bring high tech in to keep our accreditation, it cost us a fortune because, the layout of the old physical structure, so those were some of the things.  Right now, the hospital has all the modern convenience you need, but we could use more beds, but the state only gave us the authority to build the number of beds that we built and--and I'm in a debate with some of the commissioners to try to demolish the old hospital so we can get the land to use it for the preservation of future projects that we need for our healthcare system over there.
Speaker 1: Now what's the argument on the other side for keeping the old structure?
Speaker 2: They want the facade, the historical significance of having that facade.
Speaker 1: Okay so, more basically historical and sentimental I guess, I don't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what they're saying and they're saying that we should have a mixed use type of--of facility, it would route residential and shopping areas and things of that nature, but that land was dedicated for the purpose of healthcare facility and all the things that they're suggesting doesn't fall within taking care of our patients.
Speaker 1: Do you think, is there is any way to compromise on this at all?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I have letters that was written to--by Christopher Hill, who was in charge of planning for the City of Chicago, saying they were issuing us the permit to build because we would demolish the old building, the medical district was also advocating that's what we need to do and the state always thought that that's what we were gonna do, demolish the building, have their open space that they considered that we needed and necessary, and it was only after we had built the new hospital that the debate ensued about saving the old building.
Story_ID: 192630
Speaker 1: What was your, I guess, your role in the Harold Washington era, you know, when Harold Washington ran?
Speaker 2: Well, when Harold Washington ran for mayor, I had already endorsed Richard M. Daley, and I stayed with Richard M. Daley, although Harold Washington and I were friends.  A lot of people couldn't understand that, and Harold defeated Daley, and after Harold won, we still worked together, that is, Washington and I on a lot of things and as a matter of fact, Harold Washington introduced me to a form of law practice that I had never been accustomed too, I got a chance to do public finance law.  But, as I said, whereas--and I guess that's just the nature I am, I am committed to people who--I don't just change and go with wherever the wind--I think things through, I'd like to think that I honor friendships and commitments and that's the way I've always been since I was a kid, my--I have the same friends, if they're still alive, that I had when I was a kid.
Story_ID: 192631
Speaker 1: Okay, let me go back to some of the other mayors that we had from the death of [Mayor] Richard J. Daley, what was your relationship like with [Mayor] Michael Bilandic?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew him, but I didn't have the same intimacy with Michael Bilandic, although I knew him and respected him, that I had with Mayor Richard J. Daley, and that I had with [Mayor] Harold Washington, although I was with Richard M. Daley, but Harold Washington discussed issues with me because he knew that I was gonna be candid and frank with him, as I'd always been.
Speaker 1: So you knew how to work together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  You know, I personally don't think that you should develop enmity over a political issue because political issues are changing all the time.
Speaker 1: Now, a lot of what--now Jane Byrne was also in that race in '83 [1983],--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I wasn't for Jane Byrne, and she definitely wasn't for me, politically speaking, she--during her regime, a lot of people who lived in the Eighth Ward [Chicago, Illinois] was fired.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So there wasn't any love lost with Jane Byrne, I guess?
Speaker 2: Politically, there wasn't, (laughter), no.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: We were talking about the [Mayor] Harold Washington era on a level and, you know, what you were doing during that period of time and--well Harold Washington of course wins twice in '83rd--'83 [1983] and '87 [1987], you know did--how did his administration interact with county government and how did it--how did you play a role in that?
Speaker 2: I think Harold Washington did a very good job under the conditions in which he came in, in '83 [1983], the confrontation between him and the twenty-nine versus the twenty-one, but one of things I'm certain of he tried to be fair to all citizens of Chicago [Illinois].  In the first term, and in '87 [1987], even the citizens of Chicago had recognized that Harold was trying to be the mayor for all of the people and in '83 [1983], in the primaries I told you I was for Richard [M.] Daley, but in the general election, I was very active for Harold Washington, and so was Mr. George Dunne.
Speaker 1: You know that was a surprise, sort of to a--to a lot of people.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't.  When the primary was over that night, that morning I was right in this office talking with Mr. Dunne and he told me that, "John, I have always been for whomever wins the primary, I will be for Harold Washington."  And we tried to reach the Harold Washington group as well as Harold Washington that morning, but it was later on in the day or the next day that Mr. Dunne got a chance to talk with some of the leaders and he along with some others who had known Harold Washington either in law school or through the Young Democrats, joined with Mr. Berry from the Urban League to help sponsor the--they (unclear) a fundraiser for Harold Washington at the Hilton Hotel.
Speaker 1: Okay, did--did you--
Speaker 2: Excuse me, I'm getting a backdraft, I don't know why?
Speaker 1: Yeah, did--did you see yourself as someone who could ease communications between, you know, the Mayor's office and county government?
Speaker 2: Well, Harold Washington could work with anybody, you know, he had been at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois], he was the president of the student body, so he had a lot of friends, I can tell you, he knew people in every walk of life, and he tried to get that to work for his administration.

Speaker 1: Now when did you become [Cook] County commissioner?
Speaker 2: I was elected in 1970.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay and when did you become president of the Cook County Board [of Commissioners]?
Speaker 2: I was elected in 1994, sworn in first Monday of December of '94 [1994].
Speaker 1: Okay, and how--did you--did you have any inkling in 1970, that you would be--become the--
Speaker 2: No, I did not.
Speaker 1: --president of?--
Speaker 2: No, I did not, I remember when I was in Mr. [Ralph] Metcalfe's organization, when Dan Ryan would come to the organization to make a speech, we had to jump up and practically salute him.  But, when I married my wife, Yonnie [Stroger], I got to know more about the county and particular the Ryan family, 'cause for thirty-something years, my wife's grand aunt worked for Dan Ryan, or the Ryan family, two generations of Ryans so to--
Speaker 1: Dan Ryan, was--was a county commissioner at one time?
Speaker 2: He used to be the President of the County Board and his father also was president.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, president of the County Board.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now we hear his name, we--we associate it with an expressway and a lot of people don't know, you know, when you come to Chicago, most people ask who is Dan Ry--
Speaker 2: Well, the Dan Ryan Woods is probably the named after his father and the Dan Ryan Express [Expressway] is named after Dan Ryan, the young Dan Ryan, Jr. which was an old man, but he was the junior to the first Dan Ryan, who was the president.
Story_ID: 192634
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, how did it happen?  How did you become president of the Cook County Board, I mean, what was the process?
Speaker 2: Well, I served on the county board in practically every position as a chairman and then Mr. [George] Dunne, engineered me to be chairman of the finance committee and historically, most of the chairmen of the finance committee, had always ascended to--to be president of the county board, and then [Richard] Phelan broke that, and when I--when the next term came around and Phelan was running for governor, I ran for president of the county board, and with the support of Tom Hines and even Mayor [Richard J.] Daley, and a host of--and Joe Dunn and many, practically the whole black community, I ran and I was nominated over two people who were running at that time, Aurelia Pucinski, I think was my number one opponent and I won, and I won the general election and I--four years later, I was re-elected and then just (unclear) recently, I was elected to my third term.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Would you say that the hospital [Cook County Hospital, later John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois] is a highlight of your service, or what would you?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I've done a lot of things.  I've been very concerned about making our county [Cook County, Illinois] government fiscally sound and responsible, and right now, with even a fight in the 2004, with some of the new commissioners, we enjoy a higher bond rating than we have done in twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: Now, you were--
Speaker 2: And all because of the way I've conducted the financial and physical affairs of this county government.  We have even hel--held the real estate taxes, we have not increased the real estate taxes, we've even, in the last five years, reduced the levy and the only reason now in 2004, that we're asking for new tax revenue, is because we entered into some contracts with the unions to increase the--the--give the cost of living increases to our employees, and at the same time, the healthcare cost, healthcare cost for our employees went up about 15 percent and, and just the total cost of government went up about 4 percent and we can't alleviate that without some form of new revenue and that's what we're trying to get.  And, if we successfully get it, it will help us retain the image that we have in the nation and as a fiscally responsible local government.  They say at the National Association of Counties, in their new--news articles, that 70 percent of county governments in the country were having trouble and we have not, we're not in that 70 percent.
Story_ID: 192636
Speaker 1: What are some of the challenges facing our county [Cook County, Illinois] government in the near future?
Speaker 2: Well, as the economy gets worse, and as the number of medically indigents in the nation increases, as well as here in Cook County, county government, being the last resort type of government will have to take care of those people who don't have any healthcare, that's one, as the number of people continue to go into the criminal justice system, the county government will have to take care of those people in the jails, we will have to have a larger staff of state's attorneys who are the prosecutors, we'll have to have more people in the public defender's office to defend those people who are legally indigent, the--we'll continue to expand our court system.  We have the largest court system, now consolidated court system, probably of any county, that means we'll have to have more judges, staff to support the judges and (unclear), and the juvenile area, our juvenile court is constantly expanding 'cause we're having more delinquents come through the system and all those things that the county government has to take care of.  And then on top of that, we're the service government for all of the other governments.  We determine the assessment, we extend the taxes, we collect the money and we send it out to the other governments, and the county highway system connects most of the little villages and towns and we run the county highway, so we have a service oriented government and then we're the last resort type of government for people who can't do things for themselves.  And the city doesn't have to worry about a jail, years ago they had to have a jail, but when we consolidated all that stuff and put it under the county, the City of Evanston [Illinois] and all other of the cities in the county, they don't have to worry about jails, they don't have to worry about courts, but we're the ones who have to provide those services.
Story_ID: 192637
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to see our young men stay out of the criminal justice system, take care of their health, I'm definitely concerned that they look out for their families, and when I said take care of their health, I mean, their mental health as well as their physical health, don't want to see our young men continue to use narcotics and harmful drugs that ruin their lives and I've always said, I'd say this when I talk with 'em, if they get into the criminal justice system and make 'em difficult--make it difficult for them to get decent jobs, because these records follow 'em now all over the world.  Computers have made whatever's done in one community, everybody is--has accessible, well, knowledge of what goes on, so it used to be when I was a kid, sometimes people would get--do things in Mississippi or Arkansas and come up here or go to some other state and people didn't know about it, but that's not true anymore.  So these are the things I'm concerned about right now, as to where our future generation is going, and wherever I get a chance to talk with young men in particular, because it seem like our women, young women are a little more solid right now as a group and--but the young men, I think people like me and others should spend more time talking with them and interacting with them.
Story_ID: 192638
Speaker 1: What would you see at this juncture as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to think that as a public official that my legacy is to show that I will do everything within my power to try to make the government really work for all of the people in a fair and just manner, and that's what I've tried to do.
Story_ID: 192639
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Ella Jones Stroger and John H. Stroger, Sr.] get a chance to see you, you know, rise in politics here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: My father got a chance to see me graduate from law school [DePaul University College of Law, Chicago, Illinois] and just before I passed the bar, he died.  My mother had a chance to see me function as a member of the [Cook] County Board [of Commissioners] and then as a matter of fact, she used to like to come out to my annual picnic so she could shake hands with all the kids and on several occasions when I would get awards and--I would take her with me when she was visiting here in Chicago.  So, she got a chance to see me as an elected official, but she never had a chance to see me as the president under the county board.
Speaker 1: Okay, now your--your son, [HistoryMaker] Todd Stroger is the alderman from the Eight Ward [Chicago, Illinois] now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Todd was a member of the legislature and he was elected, first he was appointed to succeed Lorraine [L. Dixon] upon her untimely death and he was just elected to be in his own right, the alderman of the Eighth Ward.
Speaker 1: In that regard, do you see black people in--from your community following you into high positions in government?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm very happy you--obviously I'm happy that Todd is an elected official and I hope that he will service the people and do everything he can to make life better for the people of the Eight Ward, but we have Marlow Colvin who's a state representative and one of the leaders, and the leader of the black caucus down in the House of Representatives in Illinois, he grew up in our community, as a matter of fact, I think he spent about as much time in my house as he did in his own house and there is another one of the young men who is not an elected official, Kim Latapon [ph.], and Kim grew up around in our community and he went on to get a master's degree in business and he works for the county.  And Eugene Mullins, another one of the young guys who was around in my community and a friend of Todd's, he's just been made a police sergeant, but he's working on a Ph.D. at the same time.  So there're a host of other young men who are not as close to me politically as the ones I mentioned but I do know and I'm very proud of in our community and wherever we can help them, we will continue to do so.
Story_ID: 192640
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would do differently, if you had it to do it again?
Speaker 2: Well, I think frankly, I would--probably should have spent a little more time at home (laughter) and working with my kids.  I think in politics you can get so busy working with people outside of our home that you don't spend as much time with your own kids as you should.  I had a lot of activities going on for young people, but now, and fortunately all my kids turned out to be beautiful, but I could have been there more than I was and, but my wife [Yonnie Stroger] was always there, she only worked three years out of all the times that we were married, as a school teacher, and by time she was working, my kids were in high school and either in college, and she only worked three years.  But, I was there, I went to the basketball games, and took them to activities but, I should--I--I now look at my life, I see I could have spent a little more time and fortunate, things worked out for us very well.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there--is there anything that we haven't asked you that you would like to address?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to say that I spent and will continue to spend a lot of my time trying to assist and support Xavier University [New Orleans, Louisiana] and the mission of Dr. Francis [HistoryMaker Norman Francis], to make that school a class act in the academic arena, and particularly to help those young men and women of, particular of African descent, who need support to go to the university, not only to Xavier, but to assist others.  I have a foundation and we use money that we generate from a golf outing that we hold annually to try to give scholarships and to help some of the other causes for young African Americans in the City of Chicago [Illinois], and I will continue to work with the United Negro College Fund [UNCF] as I've done from the day that I first came out of Xavier and in particular since I've been in Chicago.
Story_ID: 192641
Speaker 1: One thing we didn't mention that we were talking about it during the break, was your travel schedule and how the business of accounting stretches into other parts of the world.
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of the things now is you--I--I didn't tell you that I was the President of the National Association of Counties, an organization was created similar to the conference of mayors to look out for county government and I served in that position in the early '90s [1990s], but even before I became the president, I was on the executive committee of that association advocating the causes of county government in America.
Story_ID: 192642
Speaker 1: I know you have, in regards to your family, you have a new grandchild right?
Speaker 2: Oh boy, now I have a grandson. The guy's gonna be four years old on February the 17th, and he has a little sister who's now four months old and her name is Clara, and I was just told that she is now able to raise up and turn her head and look around to try to protect herself from her little brother, (laughter) but I'm very happy to be a grandparent.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I was gonna ask you about--about your hometown too, and what--what is it about your hometown that makes it--that seems to affect so many people here in the City of Chicago [Illinois]?  I always hear about--I hear about Mound Bayou, Mississippi, and, and about your hometown, I mean, are those are the two places--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I know for about my hometown, in a direct way, that those people, even people who my father's generation, you didn't get the same type of training and education we had, they were committed to try to make us better and--and I know that the teachers, and if John were to one day share with you one of his father's books, who would explain what happened in his life, which is similar to what happened in my life, you could graphically see it through the book reading that those people really tried to make our lives better.  The churches, the people who lived in our community and, and we were close together and John's father who's a Ph.D., now retired from the school system, would also use to teach at Loyola, education, it's just reflective of what was happening when we grew up in the late '30s [1930s] and early '40s [1940s], in Helena [Arkansas].  And my sister who taught at Mound Bayou, she was telling me girls who used to, unfortunately get pregnant while they were in high school, she would work with these kids at home, after school and make certain that they would have those kids and get back into school and many of them went on to become successful, although they had a brief interruption with the pregnancy.  So, it's just the closeness and what people are willing to do outside, it's just that old concept, it takes a whole village to raise a kid and that was practiced in Helena and I presume in Mound Bayou.  But, I know what my sister used to do, she would take time out and work with young ladies and she just wouldn't let 'em fall by the wayside.
Story_ID: 192643
Speaker 1: Last question is, this is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to be remembered as a person who really cared about people and tried to make certain that my life would be dedicated to improving the quality of life for the people that I grew up with and the people that I served as a public servant here in Chicago [Illinois].
