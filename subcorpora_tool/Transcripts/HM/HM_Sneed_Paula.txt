Story_ID: 611531
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Thomas Sneed] side, but I'm going to start with your mother's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: Furman, F-U-R-M-A-N, Mary, Turner, T-U-R-N-E-R, Sneed, S-N-E-E-D [Furman Turner Sneed].
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story behind the name Furman?  That's an unusual name for a woman?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, my mother was the middle of seven and her siblings all have interesting names.  Her oldest brother was named Vinton [Vinton Turner], her second brother was Jacques [Jacques Turner], J-A-Q-U-E-S [sic.] her--the third child was Constance [Constance Turner], my mother was Furman, then there was Lawrence [Lawrence Turner], Edith [Edith Turner] and Arlene [Arlene Turner].  I guess they got more common as time went on.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this--yeah 'cause it sounds like the last name was the first name you know.
Speaker 2: And interestingly her birth certificate didn't have the Mary on it but her family always called her Mary and she just presumed that was her name at birth and she found out much later in life that it wasn't her name so she changed her name to Furman Mary Sneed.  She always signed her name F. Mary Sneed.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was June 25, 1921 and her place of birth was Everett, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: All right, now what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: Her mother was born in Olin, North Carolina and it was probably somewhere in the 1890s.  She--it was rumored that her father was German.  Her name was Hattie Feimster [Hattie Feimster Turner] and from her pictures she looks like she could've had some sort of mixed background, but she didn't talk a lot supposedly according to my aunts, and my mother and my uncles, she didn't talk a lot about her background, but she did have cousins who lived in North Carolina whose last name was Feimster.  My mother's father, who was Lawrence Turner, he was born in the 1880s and there's a lot of question about exactly where he was born.  On my mother's birth certificate it says Newark, New Jersey.  On my uncle's birth certificate he, and he's ninety-five now, it says Missouri, and so on each, almost on every single child's birth certificate there was a different location of his birth.  So they don't know where he was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother's father worked on the railroad.  He was a cook and in those days a lot of wealthy people traveled by rail and he would travel with these wealthy people and he would--and as I understand he was gone a lot you know traveling all the country with these wealthy people.  Her mother was at home raising the children and the children were pretty wide spanned in years like my uncle who's still alive is ninety-five and I think the diff- the difference between his age, he was born in 1912 I guess, or 19--yeah, and the youngest child, she was probably born close, close to 1930 so my mother was born in '21 [1921], so there was a wide range of years and these--amongst these children.  They're all gone now except for my uncle ninety-five and my Aunt Connie, who's ninety-three.
Story_ID: 611532
Speaker 1: Are there any, any stories about you know why the family moved I guess or--was it your [maternal] grandmother [Hattie Feimster Turner] who moved to Everett [Massachusetts] and met your grandfather [Lawrence Turner] or?
Speaker 2: I think they came, they, they--they were married and moved to Massachusetts from, we think, North Carolina, and they originally lived in Boston [Massachusetts] where my uncle, my older uncle was born and then they ultimately moved to Everett, which was a reasonably integrated community.  There were black families but it was primarily first generation American families, Irish, Italian and they moved on a street where they were probably one of few black families and but from what I can tell all of the kids had close friends in--that they went to school with who were both black and white.  All of them graduated from Everett High School [Everett, Massachusetts] except maybe for one, but my grandmother as I--and I never met her.  She passed away before I was born, but as I understand it really valued education and although none of the children went to college, it was important for her for the kids to, to finish high school.  The story is because my grandfather was away a lot she was really the person responsible for raising the children and was you know your classic probably mother of the time, hardworking, focused, you know keeping--a good disciplinarian, she got sick when my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] was probably right out high school or in high school and as a result my mother who was the middle of the seven, the first three--there's distance between my mother and her next sister [Constance Turner] was seven years, and so she was already married and left when my mother, grandmother got sick.  So my mother was sort of like the responsible one for the family. But the family, the younger siblings were, I know, home through World War II [WWII].  My mother got married, my mother and dad [Thomas Sneed] got married in think in '43 [1943] and her father was still working on the railroad.  Her mother was ill and she was you know helping out with the younger sisters.
Story_ID: 611533
Speaker 1: Did your mother have any stories about growing up that she told, or?
Speaker 2: You know it's interesting, she had her--one of her, or several of her books from elementary school that she used to--I used to look at as a kid.  And they used to have ink pens in those days and they used to--you know she used to have to write everything.  She had fabulous penmanship because there was no room for error, there was no erasers on pencils. And she had, she had a spelling book and a math book. And she loved math and she was very good at math.  My--she tells the story and her sister, who's seven years older, tells the story about how my Aunt Connie [Constance Sneed] took my mother to school one day with her, because the kids use to always come home at lunch time.  So every day when my aunt would come home my mother would beg her to take her to school, and she of course wouldn't.  So one day she snuck my mother out of the house and brought her back after lunch and sat her in the back of the room and she said to my mother, "So and So didn't come to school today so there's an empty seat in the back. So you- I'll bring you back to school but you have to be there, you have to be very, very quiet because I'll get into trouble."  And so they both told the story of how my mother was fine for a while and then she started to talk, call my aunt and the teacher discovered my mother and let her stay for the rest of the day, but my mother was so excited to go to school with her sister.  So that story (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well what a story, that's--I can imagine.
Speaker 2: It's a fun, it's, it was a funny story and she would tell me that as a child and my aunt told the story recently at a family event.  She said, "You know I remember taking your mother to school when I got--I almost got into big trouble," but because it was so much distance between my mother's age and her older brothers.
Speaker 1: Well she was a little kid too; your aunt was a little kid too I would guess you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was probably, let's say she was probably ten, nine or ten. And my mother was probably three you know and begged to go to school and she brought her to school.  In that part of Massachusetts everybody was hard working.  I mean these were lower middle class families probably and immigrant families and people just worked hard and they all had a lot of kids and I'm sure my grandmother [Hattie Feimster Turner]--wow, (unclear) I don't even know if the other children were born, but who knows why she didn't miss my mother.  Maybe she, maybe my aunt said--I think my aunt did say that she told my grandmother that the teacher said she could bring Mary to school, or Furman [Furman Turner Sneed] they called her, and she brought her to school and she wasn't supposed to.  My mother [Furman Turner Sneed] also tells stories about--I have my mother's high school [Everett High School, Everett, Massachusetts] yearbook, and when I was a kid I used to always look at the yearbook and ask stories about the kids in the yearbook, and they were--my mother had great memories of, "I went to elementary school, and this one lived down the street from me."  So I always felt like my mother was a great storyteller about her youth and although she didn't know a lot about her parents' [Hattie Feimster Turner and Lawrence Turner] history, she would talk about her siblings and what they did and so I had an appreciation of my grandparents even though I had never met them.  They both passed away.  I guess my grandfather passed away right after I was born, but I didn't remember him.
Story_ID: 611534
Speaker 1: So your mother [Furman Turner Sneed] finished high school [Everett High School] in Everett [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: She finished high school in 1939 and she graduated in a commercial course, which was the business course and that was an interesting story because most African Americans at that point took something called the general course, which was just basic reading, writing, but not necessarily skill oriented because there was a sense that what are you gonna do, you aren't going to college and you're not go in and work in an office?  So she came out with this commercial degree, she could type, she could take shorthand and she trotted into Boston [Massachusetts], which was you know ten miles away by streetcar you know ten miles away physically and an hour away by streetcar and she basically went around looking for jobs and this is 1939, so it, we were, they were out of the Depression [Great Depression].  Times were probably okay, but of course nobody would hire her and so she would go into an office building and they would tell her, "Well you could run the elevator," or you, "You could be a ladies' room attendant," and you know my mother was pretty feisty and she said, "I wasn't gonna be a ladies' room attendant," you know, "I was gonna get a job." And she tells the story about how she went into a place that was looking for people and it was a photographer and he hired her, but then at lunch time when, when they broke for lunch, and I don't know why it sounded as if there were a number of people who worked in this photography studio.  Everybody was going to eat, everybody--the whites were going to eat in one place and they, she said they put her in this closet to eat her lunch and she just said, "I'm not gonna eat my lunch there," and she quit and went home.  So, she, she--her attitude around justice and what was right and wrong and what she would and wouldn't accept as an African American woman was just very strong and well articulated at that point, based on what she told me.  And then based on her behavior as I was growing up I believe that that was true.
Story_ID: 611535
Speaker 1: She met--I don't know exactly when she [Sneed's mother, Furman Turner Sneed] met my dad, but she met my dad probably around the time she graduated from high school [Everett High School, Everett, Massachusetts] and they were married in '43 [1943].
Speaker 2: Okay well let me--(cough)--is there a story about how your parents met that?
Speaker 1: Interestingly, my father who was born in North Carolina moved to Malden, Massachusetts which is the town next to Everett [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Now let me get his full name and spell it here.
Speaker 1: His name is Thomas Edwin E-D-W-I-N, Sneed, S-N-E-E-D [Thomas Sneed], and he was born on December 23, 1922.
Speaker 2: All right and was he born in?
Speaker 1: He was born in Goldsboro, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And his parents were James M. Sneed [James Sneed] and there, there's--nobody knows what the M stands for, but there was an M there later in life so, and my grandmother's name was Pearl, P-E-R, P-E-A-R-L Moses [Pearl Moses Sneed].
Speaker 2: Peal Moses (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Moses Sneed, and she was probably born around 19--between 1900 and 1905, I'm not exactly sure what.
Speaker 2: Was she born in Golds- Goldsboro as well?
Speaker 1: No, I'm not exactly sure where she was born, but they lived--my grandmother lived in Goldsboro, my grand--one of them lived in Goldsboro and the story that my grandfather told was that when he met my grandmother at church she was just so beautiful that he wanted to date her and he then used to travel like miles, walk miles from wherever he lived to wherever she lived to, to take her out.  And my sense was that she was probably about eighteen when my father was born in '22 [1922] so that then you know, do the math.  She was probably born 1904 but they got married and they moved to--and they lived in North Carolina a short period of time, but my grandfather's half brother was living in Massachusetts, so he came to Massachusetts looking for work and because he had a brother in Massachusetts and there were several other family members on the Sneed side who had migrated from North Carolina to the Malden-Everett area in Massachusetts and so my grandfather followed them and they settled in Malden.  I don't think that they spent any time in Boston [Massachusetts] before they moved to the Malden, to Malden.
Speaker 2: Okay now are there any stories from that side of the family from the--?
Speaker 1: Well, my dad was the oldest of five.  His father was a carpenter and worked when my dad was probably younger and in middle school and high school in a furniture factory, but he was, his real, his real love was the ministry and he was a Pentecostal minister in the United Holiness Church [United Holy Church of America, Inc.] and was a bishop in, in that church.  Founded a church in Boston and in those days many of the churches really didn't have paid pastors and so my grandfather worked in the furniture factory.  He did odd carpentry jobs for people and he was the pastor of this church.  My father as I said was the oldest of five.  There--they were four boys and a girl.  My grandmother stayed at home and you know she was the first lady of the church.  She was--and I did know both of those grandparents because they, I grew up with those grandparents.  They were a lot younger, maybe not a lot younger but young enough for them to still be young, probably my age now when I was growing up and spent a lot of time with them.
Story_ID: 611536
Speaker 1: The stories from my father's [Thomas Sneed] youth is that they didn't really have a whole lot of money.  My father and his brothers worked through high school and to help you know pay for things that the family needed.  My dad, when he was drafted into the [U.S. military] service took an exam and was smart enough to go into an officer's training program.  They put him in the officer's training program and then they looked at his curriculum and they said you know--when they looked at his background they said, "You don't have any college," but then he said, "No," but he had passed this test but he could've gone to college but he--they just had no money and he knew there was no way that he could've afforded it, so my father's brothers and sisters are the ones that I'm very close--I'm close with all of them except for one who has passed away, but he didn't live in the same area.  Most of them stayed pretty close to the Malden [Massachusetts]-Everett [Massachusetts] area and--because my grandparents [Pearl Moses Sneed and James Sneed] were alive, I'm sure you know the family just was very close, so.  My mother [Furman Turner Sneed] and father tells--the stories that I know other than the fact that you know life sort of rough growing up.  My father used to--they used to shoot cans on the railroad tracks.  You know and I, I'm like what?  They used to say they had BB guns, and they'd line up these, these cans, empty cans and they would shoot the cans on the railroad tracks, and I always found that like why would anybody do that?  But you know my mother said that was what boys did.
Story_ID: 611537
Speaker 1: I don't know how my parents met but they were in the next town to each other and one would think that they would know each other because there really weren't that many African American families.  But somehow they met and my mother and father started dating. And very recently I found some of their love--some love letters that they had written to each other back in the late '30s [1930].  Now my dad was a year younger, he graduated from high school, Malden High [Malden High School, Malden, Massachusetts] in 1940, so one of these love letters said, "Dear Tommy [Thomas Sneed], thank you so much for the lovely present, but you know you shouldn't buy me things you should be saving your money, although I loved the present."  You know it was just so, it was just so comical.  Here's an eighteen year old woman writing to a seventeen year-old boy. And then she said, "You have to promise me that you won't go out without finishing your homework."  I mean it was, and I literally just found these letters within the last six months and it was so touching to be able to read into that side of their lives.  They were married fifty years before my dad died, and they had such a wonderful marriage and to see the core of it and to see how it started.  I had all kinds of photographs and there's--some of them have been lost now, but they use to go to church together.  My mother really didn't go to church much when she was growing up but my dad had joined a church in Malden [Massachusetts] despite the fact that his father's church [Holy Temple Church, Boston, Massachusetts] was in Boston [Massachusetts].  Just because you know a lot of the friends were in this Baptist church.  So there would be all these pictures, there must've been hundreds of them of the two of them after church standing around with their friends, all dressed up, just hanging out after church, right in front of the church and of course in those days the men would--had cigarettes, the women had on these fabulous hats and I think at, at one point there was this picnic every year at this place called Salem Willows [Salem, Massachusetts] where all the black churches would go. And my mother tells the story about how my grandfather--and took the family.  I don't know how they all fit in the car, but they did and they went to pick up my mother.  So my father was driving and he was gonna drive the family home first and drop off my mother after he dropped off his parents [Pearl Moses Sneed and James Sneed] and his siblings.  And my grandfather, who was not a very tall man said, "Tommy, you take Mary [Furman Turner Sneed] home first."  And you know we laughed about that.  My grandfather said, "Yeah your father tied to pull a fast one and drive us home first.  He probably wanted to kiss your mother," (laughter) you know, it's like so cute.
Story_ID: 611538
Speaker 1: But they got married I think in '43 [1943] and they got married, actually this is their anniversary which is why I was excited about doing this interview today.  They were married February 19, 1943, and immediately after my father was drafted into World War II [WWII]. And my mother was now--she went back to live with her parents [Hattie Feimster Turner and Lawrence Turner], her mother and help raise her siblings and she went to work for the Arsenal [Watertown Arsenal].  And they--it was a place in place in Watertown [Massachusetts] that made munitions for the war, and when I was a kid she use to talk about working in the arsenal and I never--I didn't understand what the arsenal was, but she worked there while my dad was, was in the service.  He was in Ger- he was in Europe, he was assigned to Europe and he was in Germany and other places.  I don't know how much combat he saw, if any.  He didn't talk about it, what he did talk about was he was in an all-African American male choir and they sang all over Europe and we have pictures of him in, in the choir in some of the cathedrals and we have programs where, I don't even, I can't tell you the, the military whatever the unit was but he sang in this choir all over Europe.  So, that's pretty much the early stages of the--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Mary [Furman Turner Sneed]-Tommy Sneed [Thomas Sneed] love and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now he was in a--he served in a black--in a choir during most of his--did he get a chance to officer's training school at all?
Speaker 1: No, he did not.
Speaker 2: He never did?
Speaker 1: No, what happened was when they determined that he didn't have a--
Speaker 2: The college training (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) college background they just put him in an infantry unit, so it was in an infantry unit that he was in. And he came out, I guess he was released or--in, discharged in '46 [1946] and I was born in '47 [1947].
Story_ID: 611539
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' personalities, and their gifts and their, their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my mother [Furman Turner Sneed], she was very outgoing, very determined, very focused.  She was a re- an incredibly hard worker and very goal oriented.  On the other had my father [Thomas Sneed] had a lot of--he had--he was very thoughtful.  He read insatiably, he was less--my mother was--she'd get mad in a minute.  My father was like much more laid back and so I probably am more like my mother but I'm not as volatile as my mother.  My mother was--she had a temper, you know, but not, not such that--it was a temper around injustice.  She was a fighter, for example when I was in elementary school [Charles A. Daniels School, Malden, Massachusetts] she had joined the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] when I was, before I even went to school because she wanted to be engaged.  She really valued education, she really believed that if blacks were going to achieve, that education was the doorway to achievement.  So she joined the PTA and I remember being in elementary school and a number of the blacks who were in the town were going down to speak with the superintendent of schools because they were reading 'Huck Finn' ['The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,' Mark Twain] in middle school, and every time they said the word nigger the white kids would point at the black kids and the teacher would laugh and it was a big mess, and so it was a problem.  So my mother was like we are not gonna put up with this, and we're gonna go there and we're gonna get this book taken out of the school. And she was, she was just very focused, very organized.  She just had so much passion about the things that she believed in and I'm the same way.  Last night I wrote an email to someone about something that I just thought--my daughter [Courtney Bass] said to me, "Mom, you're sixty. You know, time to like lay back a little bit."  And I'm like, "Why, this is not right," you know.  So I think I have a lot of her passions and a lot of her, her energies.
Story_ID: 611540
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I can describe my dad's personality, a little bit. Do you--more? Less?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure go ahead, go ahead yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 1: So I'll do it a little from a historical standpoint.  My--when my dad came back from the war [World War II, WWII] he went to work back at that same furniture company that he worked with his father [James Sneed] at.  And my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] worked for a short time in, before I was born and I think she got a job in some--in an office and then when I was born she stayed home with me for the first couple of years and then she got pregnant with a brother who was born with a rare genetic disease and they didn't really know what this disease was.  It was a skin condition, so he only lived a month.  He was born on Christmas Day and he passed away almost, he passed away a month later and my parents had incredible, incredible medical bills and my mother went back to work, I was three.  And in those days a working mother was not something that people had.  Most people's mother stayed home with them, but they had such medical bills and my dad was working in this furniture factory and it wasn't going to work with paying off these medical bills.  So she just said, "I'll go back to work," and I think it was a tribute to him that his ego wasn't you know like, "Well, I don't want my wife to work, you know wives stay home."  And they both worked together, my mother then went back to work and never stopped working until she retired at sixty-two. And they both worked together in ways that just made a great life for us.  For example my dad worked on the Transit [Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority]--eventually.  The furniture factory was gonna move to Connecticut, and my mother did not want to leave Massachusetts.  One other time supposedly they were gonna move right after he came out of the war.  There was supposedly greater opportunities for African Americans in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  I, I did find a letter about that too. So my dad went down to D.C. to try to find a job.  So mother went down and she hated D.C. so he came back home and he was looking for a job.  He was thinking about the post office and other things and she wrote him this letter and she said, "Tommy [Thomas Sneed], I do not want to move to Washington."  You know like, "I want, I want to live in Massachusetts.  If we're gonna have a marriage, we're gonna live in Massachusetts" and (laughter) and my dad came back, and he went back to work in the factory, and if he had gone to D.C. he might have had a better job, but the furniture factory was gonna move down to Connecticut at a later point.  I was in elementary school [Charles A. Daniels School, Malden, Massachusetts], I must've been about eight or nine and a friend of his said, "Tommy there, there is going to be a test to get on the Transit and you should go take that test because this is a great job.  It's got good pay, good benefits, good retirement, go take the test."  And my father I think was probably (makes sound).  My mother said, "You know I think you should take the test."  He did, passed it and then joined the Transit and at that point there weren't very many African Americans.
Story_ID: 611541
Speaker 1: So my dad [Thomas Sneed] took the transit exam and passed and joined the Mos- I guess it's Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority [sic. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority], MBTA, at a time when there really weren't very many African Americans who were on the--they call it on the T, and he became a bus driver and the way the system worked was you were assigned by seniority.  So the youngest and the newest guys on the Transit were the guys that got the night shift and they drove buses like from four [o'clock] until the buses stopped at midnight and they never had weekends off.  They never had holidays off, they had Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so my dad took that job.  My mother [Furman Turner Sneed] at that point was working in Malden City Hall [Malden, Massachusetts].  She had taken a civil service exam, had passed and had gotten a civil service assignment in our local town.  So it was a very interesting situation.  My mother was working days.  She'd get out, she'd work from eight to four.  My dad would go into work about one o'clock in the afternoon or three o'clock in the afternoon, have a couple of hours off and then go back and work until midnight.  He'd have off Tuesdays and Wednesdays, typically he'd work part of Sundays, part of Saturdays.  So my mother took her vacations when I was little, she'd take every Tuesday and Wednesday off and we would travel throughout--around New England.  We didn't have a lot of money but the family would get in the car and I'd bring a friend, as an only child, you know they'd always let me bring a friend and we would go to New Hampshire, go to Maine, go to Cape Cod and that was how we spent you know a lot of the vacations, but because my dad was working nights, he did a lot of the, he did the washing, he would do the food shopping.  He would always leave food, you know cooked dinner and leave it for my mother.  My mother was always a great seamstress and so she would make the clothes for us.  She and I, and sometimes she'd even venture to make my dad a suit jacket or something.  She was a joiner, she was in the PTA [Parent Teacher Association], she was in the Red Cross [American Red Cross], she was very actively involved in the church, was--taught Sunday school, so almost every night my mother had something that she was doing, you know some committee that she was involved in.  My dad sang in the choir, but they had a very, very loving, supportive relationship that was somewhat atypical because she was a working person and if she wanted a room painted, she'd go buy paint and paint the room.  If the iron broke she would take the plug off, fiddle around and fix the electrical and put it back in the wall.  You know and so it wasn't that they had a role reversal, it was just that there weren't traditional roles in that family.
Speaker 2: That is unusual for those days (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's, it's very unusual for those days and 'cause most of her fam- most of her friends, many of them were at home, but what I saw as a little kid was if two parents worked the kids had more stuff.  So I had lessons, I had piano lessons and dancing lessons, wasn't very good but I had the lessons.  I always went to camp, day camp in the summer, part of it was because my mother worked.  So you know you go to day care, but it was camp.  We had money to take vacations.  We were--by no means were we wealthy.  Towards the end of--both of them got paid every two weeks so towards the end of the pay cycle my mother was walking to work as opposed to taking the bus you know, but my--because my dad drove the bus sometimes I would get on the bus and just ride with him.  You know I'd get on, and particularly if he had the route near our house I would go, put my nickel in and I'd sit there and I would ride with my dad, which you know was sort of fun as a kid to--the good news was I could ride with my dad.  The bad news was that I couldn't cut up on the bus ever because everybody, "Are you Tommy Sneed's kid?"  So, and in those days it was all Irish and mostly Irish and Italians that were bus drivers, because what happened was people knew about the benefits, they knew about the pensions and all that and they knew when the tests were going to be given.  So they would tell their cousins and their brothers, "Hey go take this test," just like that guy did with my father, so the---I had a great childhood growing up.

Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sunday dinner was a smell and a sound. After church [Emmanuel Baptist Church, Malden, Massachusetts], we went to church every Sunday.  Sunday school first and then church, so we were there by nine o'clock and we left between twelve and one depending on whether it was communion.  And then after church on Sunday there was a classic black Sunday dinner, and typically it was just the three of us, my parents [Furman Turner Sneed and Thomas Sneed] and me but that was the routine and the ritual.
Story_ID: 611543
Speaker 1: Church was a big, important part of my life and I--there was a, most of the black families in, in Malden [Massachusetts] or Everett [Massachusetts] belonged to one or, or two black churches and ours was one of the bigger ones, Emmanuel Baptist Church [Malden, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And there was a pastor named Reverend Earl Lawson.  The church itself had an interesting history.  There were two black churches in Malden that dated back to the 1800s and I, I did some work looking at the history of these two churches and they were both tied into the white Baptist church in the town.  Of course churches were segregated but the white church was happy to help the black church buy a property.  As early as the 1930s the two churches wanted to combine but for a whole host of reasons probably much of which were political and you know people don't wanna be, they didn't want--the churches didn't combine, and there were a group of younger people who were in their early twenties who were pushing for the merger of the churches.  After World War II [WWII] one of the pastors of one the churches was called to another, to Connecticut and so that was a perfect time for the churches to come together and my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] was one of the founders, she was like twenty-five but when they have the people who signed as the founders, she was one of the people who were involved in the church.  So she and my dad [Thomas Sneed] were both really very engaged and very involved in this church and this Reverend Lawson who was a young pastor when he joined, was very smart, Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] graduate.  I'm not sure where he went to theological school but in addition to--
Speaker 2: Is it Earl Lawson you said?
Speaker 1: Earl Wesley Lawson, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In addition to being a really good theological student and therefore a teaching minister he was very engaged and involved socially and politically.  So he encouraged members of the church during the civil rights era to get engaged, get involved and he brought a lot of the, the civil rights rhetoric to the pulpit as a, as a young person growing up.  So if you think about the '50s [1950s] and you know school desegregation and that kind of thing, that was very much a part of the, the press landscape but it was very much a part of the conversations in our home and in our church.  What was going on and what we had to do as blacks and--
Story_ID: 611544
Speaker 1: Sounds--so church [Emmanuel Baptist Church, Malden, Massachusetts] was a sounds--sights.  There weren't very many blacks in this town of six--I grew--and grew up in Malden [Massachusetts].  There weren't very many blacks in this town of sixty thousand and one experience I had when I was in nursery school [Hilltop Nursery School, Malden, Massachusetts], my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] was working 'cause my brother had died.  So she put me in this private nursery school, which was probably pretty expensive, and when I started, they immediately put me in from nursery school into kindergarten because I could read already and I could write.  My mother used to teach me.  So my mother went to our pediatrician and the pediatrician said, "Oh don't move her ahead," 'cause I was probably three and they put me in, so I was really pushed ahead.  "So don't put her ahead, she should be with her own age group."  But I, so I remember being annoyed--I remember--a little kid crying because I didn't want to go back to baby class, I remember that, but what I really remember is kids not wanting to hold my hand 'cause the chocolate would come off and I remember coming home and telling my mother that and my mother stomping to the private school, going up to the private school telling the teacher, "My daughter will not be insulted," and you know just--I, I don't know that my--that was my first negative recollection of race.  My mother says that I first noticed race when I was a lot younger because I used to--we had a black mailman and I use to call him the green mailman.  She said I'd say, "When is the green mailman gonna come?"  And she'd say, "Why is," you know, she'd ask me, "why is the mailman green?" But I, I remember that as a, as sort of a negative memory that whole being taken out of kindergarten putting back in baby class and the kids not wanting to hold my hand because the chocolate would come off.
Speaker 2: Were the only blacks--were you the only black student in your class?
Speaker 1: I probably was. 'Cause I remember my graduation from [Hilltop Nursery School, Malden, Massachusetts]--I have picture of graduating from that kindergarten ultimately, a private kindergarten and I was the only black kid in the class.  I was a--another recollection was I was always tall and bigger than most kids in my class and we used to go into Boston [Massachusetts] as a kid on the train and all the mothers use to let the kids kneel on the train and look out the window.  My mother [Furman Turner Sneed] would never let me do that 'cause she says, "Oh, you're too big to do that," and I'm like--and these kids were older than me but I looked a lot older.  So I remember that as a--not liking the fact that I was taller and bigger than most of the kids.  That I didn't like.
Story_ID: 611545
Speaker 1: Other memories--we had a great, we had a great backyard.  My parents lived on the second floor of a house that was owned by another black--by a black family, and this family owned a business in Malden [Massachusetts].  They, they did concrete, they made steps, they made little urns to put flowers in, they made benches and they sold them to families and they sold them to public--like the schools and other things.  The man's name was Lucius Cotter [ph.] and his wife's name was Sarah Jefferson Cotter [ph.] and she was like a grandmother to me, and she was like a mother to my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] and they were like parents to my parents who lived--the young couple who lived in their house, and my mother would--I would go to Mrs. Cotter's house and she would make baked macaroni and she would tell me stories.  You know stories about growing up in Virginia, stories about her children and she had these children who were very accomplished and so the people at the church [Emmanuel Baptist Church, Malden, Massachusetts] when I was a little use to talk about the Cotter boys.  One was a policeman, one was a surgeon in New York, another one had some fancy job and I remember as a kid thinking that, boy the Cotters were a pretty impressive family.  My mother was always being (gesture) mentored by Mrs. Cotter and my mother always said, "I wanna be like Mrs. Cotter when I grow older, I want to mentor younger people." And she in fact did go on to do that.  But I remember being with Mrs. Cotter and she had a piano and she used to let me bang on this piano, and she use to make me baked macaroni and she use to let me eat chocolates from this little crystal chocolate dish and it, I just, I, I did other than the fact that people didn't wanna hold my hand in nursery school, I had a pretty nice elementary--I only have good memories of a happy family.  I remember my mother telling me that Mrs. Cotter sometimes would give her money for medicine when I would get sick and I--my, my parents--like she'd take me to the doctor and they wouldn't have money to buy medicine, and Mrs. Cotter would say, "You know Mary [Furman Turner Sneed] do you have money for medicine?" And she'd say, "No, Tommy [Thomas Sneed] gets paid on Friday, I'll get it then."  And she would give her money and my mother would talk about how generous she was and how kind--she used to counsel her about, "You know if you wanna keep your marriage good, dear this is--," you know she'd give her a little advice. And when I watched my mother when I was, maybe an elementary school child, with younger couples, my parents were both very involved. And there's a couple who's my age who I'm now the mentor of their daughter who's my daughter's [Courtney Bass] age you know and it's sort of this notion of you have an obligation to be helpful to others who, who can benefit from your wisdom because you've benefitted from somebody else's.
Story_ID: 611546
Speaker 1: Where did you start school, what--
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: Yes, what was the name of your first school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hilltop Kinde- Hilltop Nursery School [Malden, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Hilltop Nursery, okay.
Speaker 2: That was the first, that's my--that was my nursery school, and then I went to Charles A. Daniels elementary school [Charles A. Daniels School, Malden, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Charles A. Daniels.
Speaker 2: Which was right across the street from where I lived. It's now a condo.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, did you like school?
Speaker 2: I did, I loved school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I loved school, I was smart and you know my mother [Furman Turner Sneed]--and I'd, I'd bring home good grades and you know there was a big celebration and you know you gotta work hard and it was always, don't let yourself down.  They, they--she never said get an A, 'cause I want you to get an A.  She'd say, "Do your best, you know what your best is," and, "don't let yourself down.  Don't--if, if you can get an A you should get an A, and if you can only get a B then you should get a B, but if you can get a A and you get a B then you've let yourself down."  And so this whole notion of letting myself down, not letting myself down was sort of an imprinted memory.  The other thing is, the school I went to, the town [Malden, Massachusetts] was lower middle class and most of the people in the town who were my age, their grandparents had come from Russia, Poland, Italy, Germany and the friends that I began to associate with in elementary school were the black kids from my church [Emmanuel Baptist Church, Massachusetts] and Jewish kids who were in my class and the Jewish kids were smart and you know my mother used to say to me at times, "You know you gotta work as hard as the Jewish kids and you gotta be as smart as the Jewish kids."  And she was friendly with a number of our neighbors who were Jewish and they had an incredible sense of value around education and they wanted their kids to go to college and if there was something that the school had, something special like a special program or you know an enrichment program, their kids would be in that and then they would say to her, "You should Paula [HistoryMaker Paula Ann Sneed] in that.  Paula should get, Paula's smart.  Paula should get involved in that." And so one of the most important things beyond church for me as a young person was work hard in school, study, do your best.  Do the best you can because eventually you will go to college.  And I used to always say I wanted to go to Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts].  Wasn't even--they didn't even have girls in Boston College at that point but I just said--my mother used to say, she said, "You know you were three years old and one time," she said, "you started arguing with me saying, 'One day I'm gonna go to Boston College.'"  I guess she told me, "You can't because there's no girls there," and I started to cry saying, "I'm gonna go, I will go," you know.  I don't remember that story but she would tell that story, but I didn't go to Boston College.
Story_ID: 611547
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite course of study in school or a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: I just liked school in elementary school [Charles A. Daniels School, Malden, Massachusetts] you know I just, I was involved in--I loved the Brownies, I was a Brownie and I joined in second grade and was probably active all the way through. Because my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] was a joiner and active in things, I was you know, I just got involved in stuff and I always wanted, if was gonna be in it I always wanted to be president (laughter), you know so I was the leader of the Brownie group and you know I, the things that I was involved in--there was a little community center and we'd go after school, 'cause since my mother worked every day I had an activity.  So I went to the Y [Young Men's Christian Association] and swam one day.  I went to Brownies another day, I went to piano lessons another day, every day she needed to have something for me to do because when school came home--was out I had to go home, change my clothes, my dad [Thomas Sneed] a lot of times was working so I was a latchkey kid before that was a term.  You know the key was underneath the, the mat, 'cause you didn't have a key of your own, you just took the key out from underneath the mat, opened the door, went upstairs and changed your clothes and then you went to what you had to do and in those days I'd go down to the Y.  Sometimes I'd take the bus but a lot of times I'd walk and it was like a couple of miles you know and I was eight years old, I'd go with a friend.  You know we'd both go swimming one day a week.  I had another racial situation at the Y where my knees had darker color than my skin, and you know the teacher told me, "Your knees are dirty, go wash them."  And so I said, "They're not dirty, that's, that's the way they look."  "No they're not, go wash them." So I came home and told my mother, of course she stomped to the Y and told the lady (laughter), "Her knees aren't dirty, you know that's the way black children's knees look," or Negro children's knees look and, "don't you ever say that to my child again."  So I was always feeling defended by my mother in these situations.  On the other hand my mother was quick to you know point out the stuff I did wrong, but in these situations she was always very much my advocate.
Story_ID: 611548
Speaker 1: Now did you cha- sing in a church choir that sort of thing or did you?
Speaker 2: I was in the children's choir but I didn't, I don't have a great voice.  I love singing, I love it. But I, took after my mother [Furman Turner Sneed].  She had a terrible voice.  So you know that was (laughter) not a person they were gonna choose to sing in the choir although I was in the glee club in high school [Malden High School, Malden, Massachusetts] and that type of thing, but they had something called the writing committee at my church [Emmanuel Baptist Church, Malden, Massachusetts] and what you did was you sat there and you, you basically summarized the church service.  So--and they would take these letters, you wrote a letter to the sick and shut in.  "Dear, Dear Sick and Shut In, the choir is now coming in and the organist is playing," and you'd name the song, "and Reverend Lawson [Earl Wesley Lawson] has gone to the pulpit and the church is now singing such and such."  So basically you would do an accounting of what was going on and during the church service. And then when he would start to preach because you knew the topic, it was written in the church program.  You had to summarize his sermon.  It was probably the best experience I had a young person.  I probably started doing it around nine and did it until I probably graduated from high school and left home, because that was my role in the Church.  There was a bunch of us who did this, a lot of older women and a lot of the kids who could, who were smart enough to listen and write. And but what it taught me was two things.  It taught me how to take good notes and to be able to listen and interpret and summarize, but Reverend Lawson was a fabulous, fabulous speaker.  He was prepared every single Sunday and his sermons were really well constructed and it taught me how to write speeches and I've done a ton of speeches in my life but I really learned from him the fine art of, of, of constructing a speech, his sermons and making sure that people understood the points you're trying to make.  Giving examples to express those points, and then having a good summary so that people had takeaways you know.
Speaker 1: Now was Reverend Lawson at all related to Reverend James Lawson of the Civil Rights Movement who was in Nashville [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, I think he came from Louisiana, I'm not exactly sure but he's still alive and he lives down in Connecticut.  I think he lives somewhere near Hartford [Connecticut]. But he was really brilliant.  I mean I think that like a lot of that generation, people born in the '20s [1920] and '30s [1930], had other opportunities been available to them--you know it's, it's you would, it would, you know--you don't what they would've done.
Story_ID: 611549
Speaker 1: Now where'd you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to First Lincoln Junior High School [sic. Lincoln Junior High School], in th- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) First Lincoln Junior High, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. And that was in Malden, Mass [Massachusetts]. That was seven through nine and I was very active in school.  I was president of the class, my--in the ninth grade which was a big thing, I mean I don't know if there'd ever been a black female president of the class.  I was a majorette, I was a hall monitor, I mean I was one of the you know, the lead, I was on the yearbook.  It was the classic, like smart, active kid set of activities. And most of my friends were Jewish kids who were--I'd gone to elementary school [Charles A. Daniels School, Malden, Massachusetts] with.  Many of whom I'm still friends with today.  I mean we get together once a year at Thanksgiving, you know Thanksgiving weekend we have a little get together and--but we were, we were sort of the, the school leadership and it was you know it was great.  When I ran--decided to run for president my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] said you know, "We'll make little posters for you," and she made the posters 'cause she was really artistic.  I am not at all artistic, can't sing and I'm not artistic, and her mic slogan was 'We Need Sneed.' You know my mother says, "We got a good slogan, 'We Need Sneed.'" and she had little 'We Need Sneed' posters and she'd pass--made little flyers for me they had--she went to work and ran them off on mimeograph.  The other thing was my mother was also--I, I was a--I told you I was a Brownie, so because she worked I would always win the, the prize to sell, sell the most cookies. 'Cause she would bring the Brownie paper with the cookies into work, and she worked in Malden City Hall [Malden, Massachusetts] and she would just go to every office in Malden City Hall and people would buy cookies from me.  So I would always sell the most cookies and so I would win the prize every year.  Now I always buy cookies from kids who sell cookies (laughter), 'cause--
Speaker 1: That's a good (laughter)--so this is in junior high school, this is?
Speaker 2: Well the cookie story was earlier--
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but in junior high school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was, yeah.
Story_ID: 611550
Speaker 1: And then I went to Malden High.  I went to Malden High School [Malden, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Okay, Malden (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I started in 1962 and--I graduated from Lincoln [Lincoln Junior High School, Malden, Massachusetts] in 1962, started Malden High School in the fall and graduated in 1965, and at Malden High it was a sort of a continuation. I was involved in you know all the right clubs and you know was a school leader my senior year, was on student council and ran the English Honor Society [National English Honor Society], was in Future Teachers of America, I mean you sort of got in those days that if you were going to be successful, leadership started then.  I was in the band. I worked, I worked from the time I was fourteen.  I worked part-time after school in the library.  I worked in the summers as a park instructor, I tutored Latin because my--even though my parents [Furman Turner Sneed and Thomas Sneed] were both working, we were, we didn't have a lot of money and so if I wanted stuff like to buy the yearbook and my class ring--my parents didn't say, "Go get a job," but I just felt like I would have money if I got a job.  I was also independent you know, and I was feisty as a kid and I would get into trouble and my mother would take my allowance away, you know.  I talked back or whatever. So I thought, well if I had my own money you know, she can't take it away.
Story_ID: 611551
Speaker 1: So my--it was interesting 'cause my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] was always very encouraging, study hard, join clubs do that kind of thing.  My dad [Thomas Sneed] would say, "This girl needs to do, she needs to be doing housework," you know, he--you know.  Not housework like--but he, he really felt like my mother let me slide on a lot of those things you know.  When I was a lot younger I had chores to do and I couldn't go out and play until I finished my chores.  Every Saturday she would rip the house apart and clean, and I hated that and she, she worked all week and so on, come Saturday the house had to be cleaned.  And so I had my chores and I couldn't go out until I finished my chores.  So what I would do is I wouldn't care about going out.  I would just go in my room and read, and I had to clean the bathroom, clean my room, sweep down the stairs and you know it'd take me all day to do (laughter) those things, 'cause half the time I'd be in there reading a book, and she said, "Paula [HistoryMaker Paula Ann Sneed] you won't go out until you finish your chores, you'd better get, get going," and my dad use to think that she should be tougher on me on that but she said, "You know we really want her to study, we want her to do all these other things," and I use to say to her, "When I grow up I'm gonna have a maid."  My mother thought you're nuts, there's no way that'll happen you know 'cause she--and I didn't want a maid to want a maid, I just didn't like housework.  I just felt like it was a waste of a Saturday. So.
Story_ID: 611552
Speaker 1: Did you go to the prom and all that sort of thing in, in high school [Malden High School, Malden, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.  I went to the social in ninth grade. You didn't have dates in those days, but one of the guys--since I was class president I had to dance with the class vice president and it was a white Jewish guy that I'm still friendly with, and he always like says, "Remember we had that first dance in the ninth grade social?"  "Stewart [ph.], yes I remember we had the first dance at the ninth grade social.  I also remember you couldn't dance," you know.  In high school there were only of my class of about 650 about--there must've been like eight blacks who graduated. And I was, I wasn't the ideal prom date for the one or two black guys in the class.  They were all, other girls were a lot cuter, a lot thinner, whatever and so my prom date was a guy that had graduated a year ahead of me who had joined the [U.S.] military and he was more like a brother and he came--I called him up and said, "You know, can you get a leave and come take me, you know be my date for the prom?"  And he did, and so we went to the prom, but it was like going to the prom with your brother you know so. But it was fun.
Story_ID: 611553
Speaker 1: Malden High School [Malden, Massachusetts] was a great experience for me because the town at that point, if you think about it, the, the parents of my classmates were all a part of that World War II [WWII], World War II, Depression [Great Depression] generation and their aspirations for us were--my generation were, you kids can do whatever.  And as a black kid growing up and seeing all the civil rights stuff, I really believed I could do anything.  I remember I was babysitting for my cousin when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] did the speech on Lincoln Memorial [Washington, D.C.], at the Lincoln Memorial.  I thought he was talking about me. You know I thought that someday I could do--you couldn't have convinced me that I couldn't do anything that I put my mind to, and my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] really reinforced that. She use to say all the time, "Get it in your head they can't take it away from you."  From when I was a little kid she'd say that. I didn't even know what it meant and ultimate--she said you know, "If you are ready, if you are prepared and ready and the opportunity shows up, you can take it.  If you're not prepared, if you're not ready if you don't have it in your head you're not smart enough, you won't be able to take advantage of it and it will be your fault, so get it in your head."  And I didn't know what it had to be but I figured, be prepared to do something, and it would be to my advantage ultimately.
Story_ID: 611554
Speaker 1: Now, did you graduate from--with honors from high school [Malden High School, Malden, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was not in the National Honor Society but I graduated with honors.  I'd been on the honor roll most of the terms in high school if not all of the terms in high school.  I knew I was gonna go to college.  I chose Simmons College in Boston [Massachusetts] for a couple of reasons.  One, I wanted to go to a private school, but the trade-off was that I wouldn't be able to live in, I could only afford tuition in a private school, so rather than going to one of the state schools, I choose to go to a school in- a private school in Boston.  Simmons was my first choice, it was a woman's college. A number of women from my high school had gone to Simmons.  It had a school of social work and at that point I thought that I would become a social worker immediately after high- after college.  So my plan was to go to Simmons for four years as an undergrad and then to go two more years and get a degree in social work.  So I was thrilled to be able to go, I was accepted to my first choice and I began in the fall of 1965.
Speaker 1: So the school is located in Boston, it's--
Speaker 2: It's located in Boston in an area that has a number of other colleges, Northeastern [Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts], Wentworth [Wentworth Institute; Wentworth Institute of Technology, Boston, Massachusetts], Harvard Medical School [Boston, Massachusetts], Mass College of Pharmacy [Massachusetts College of Pharmacy; Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Boston, Massachusetts], Mass College of Art [Massachusetts College of Art; Massachusetts College of Art and Design, Boston, Massachusetts], so it was a, an area of Boston, it was in walking distance to BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] that had numbers of colleges and, it was--but it was a small women's college, only 350 or so women in my class.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 1965?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Started there were, of the 350 women in my class there were five black women.  We all met each other the first day, and became friends immediately.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Said, "We all met each other the first day."
Speaker 2: We all met each other the first day, it wasn't hard to see each other.  We and my friend, Coleen Jones [ph.], who's here in Chicago [Illinois] said you know we just immediately gravitated to each other, our parents gravitated to each other, to them--you know to--and the kids did too.
Story_ID: 611555
Speaker 1: Were there any black instructors at, on campus?
Speaker 2: Interestingly no, I mean not when--and that became an issue later.  We--the school was founded in the late, in ninetee- or 1899 and the premise of the school was to give women an opportunity to have careers after they left college.  So unlike many women's schools that were liberal arts oriented, this was really training for the professions.  So there was a school of education, a school of retailing, a school of nursing, a school of nutrition and all of these programs allowed women to graduate with--first, they originally just offered bachelors of science degrees and you could work immediately.  They changed it while I was there and began to get more liberal arts in orientation but the intent of the school was to train women for work.  The founder--the person who donated the money was a rich industrialist in, in Boston [Massachusetts] and he--
Speaker 1: Now this is a good--it's probably a good point to make here that you're making a distinction between what Simmons [Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts] was founded to do and what some of the other.  So like the Seven Sisters colleges--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --were created to provide this fine education and/or may not even end in a graduation, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it ended graduation--
Speaker 1: Or, or or--
Speaker 2: --but the intention wasn't for necessarily for the women to work.
Speaker 1: Because they--
Speaker 2: Many of them ended up working obviously. But you got a fine liberal arts training, you were training in humanities and arts, and sciences and music.  Simmons--the first year was a basic core year of you took English, math, bi- sciences, but then at the end of your first year you had to declare an area that you wanted to specialize in.  So you either specialized in education or social, the school of social science because you were interested in becoming a social worker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there was very goal oriented, the women--there was no business program at that point but there was something called the Prince School of Retailing [Prince School Program in Retailing, Boston, Massachusetts] because most women who went into business, other than if you were at the, on the administrative level, buying or retailing was an area that women had begun to excel in and so that's why I was very interested 'cause it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I, I guess the implication of what you said if I'm not misunderstanding, is that some of the other schools, women's schools, the, the goal was not a career or a job so much as it was this full rounded education.
Speaker 2: Exactly. Yes
Speaker 1: Because the assumption is that people had to--the students had the means and otherwise where they wouldn't necessarily need a career.
Speaker 2: Exactly and many of the women at Simmons were first generation college students.  Many of the women in a number of the Seven Sister schools were part of legacy families where their parents had been educated. And so not all of the students at Simmons obviously were first generation, but many of us were.  This was the first step into a different life for many of these students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Many of them were Bostonians. And was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you were telling us the history, I interrupted you, I'm sorry but I just wanted to make sure that point was raised.
Speaker 2: So John Simmons supposedly was the founder of the home--the custom male suit, men's suit.  Supposedly, men used to--all suits were custom and so he had--I'm sorry it was ready-made suits.  So he actually did ready-made suits, and in order to get these suits he, he developed models so he came up with this notion of sizing and then he had women who sat at home and who sewed these suits and then he sold them and I guess in a store and he made a lot of money but what he noticed was that many of these women had no opportunity for livelihood other than doing this sewing at home.  So the--if you look at some of the original words that came out of his will that endowed the school, it was so that women would have, could, could be independent and could make a livelihood to support themselves and potentially their families.

Speaker 1: I joined [Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts] in 1965. One of, as I said, five black women in the class. And it was an interesting time because when we would all sit together in the cafeteria people would say things like, "Is this a sit-in? Ha, ha, ha." It was, it was a strange kind of situation.  We were all very friendly with all of the students in our class or many of the students in the class, but being so--having so few of us at a time when there was so much focus on civil rights and equality for African Americans--there we this sort of tension.  We joined the Simmons Civil Rights Club, but the summer after my freshman year I heard Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] speak at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and many of my classmates and I were, who had been children of the civil rights era, were becoming students or young adults of the, of the black activist, black power era.  So it was a really interesting time, so by the time we came back at the end of our sophomore years, we formed the Simmons Black Student Organization.
Speaker 2: Now, was Stokely's message black power?
Speaker 1: Yeah it was.
Speaker 2: At, at Harvard?
Speaker 1: Yeah it was black power and you know it was all about we--things aren't happening fast enough.  All of the violence that we're seeing affili- associated with people getting rights that they deserve is unwarranted.  We can either stand up and fight back or we--and get what we want sooner or we can continue with the tactics that have been used over the last X number of years that don't seem to be working as well as we'd like. And so you had a lot of tension between my generation and our parents' generation, who were staunch civil rights folks.  You know most of my classmates, most of our parents have been part of the Civil Rights Movement and now we're coming home talking about black power, stopping to straighten our hair, you know.  Reading H. black- Rap Brown [H. Rap Brown; Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin], reading Stokely Carmichael, going to these rallies. It was just a diff- an interesting time.  I remember my [paternal] grandmother [Pearl Moses Sneed] said to me, "Girl you better straighten your hair," (laughter) you know.  I'm like, "No, I'm not straightening my hair," so it was a very empowering time because we really felt like there were things that we could do to change where we were and that was the message, you can change where you are.
Story_ID: 611557
Speaker 1: So the Simmons Civil Rights- Simmons Civil Rights Club evolved--which had whites and blacks--evolved and became the Black Student Organization, which was black students only and we tried to get the school to be what we called more responsive to our needs, which were more black professors, more black students, more scholarship aid, more black administrative people.  We did something called the seminars, and we actually brought in--we tried to get a black history course, nobody wanted--the school wouldn't fund it. So we actually brought in black professionals across a variety of different disciplines and we had these seminars and we charged money and people came from the local community, students signed up from Simmons [Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts] and students from other places. And we filled an auditorium every single week for like seven or eight weeks with these lectures, as evidence to the faculty and administration that they should so something like this at Simmons and they didn't.  So the next year, my senior year, we really tried to work with the administration to get some sort of response to what we were interested in, and didn't. And if you would think about back to 1968, schools were erupting about--it was, it was wonderful time to be a young person because you could get engaged and involved in things that, that you believed in.  So you had white women you know asserting their, their rights for equality and so they had the start of the, the feminist movement.  You had the anti-war movement that was running across all campuses and you had many students walking away from the, the civil rights philosophy and embracing a black power philosophy, and so my senior year we went to the faculty and administration after having worked for two years trying to get people to pay attention to us and they didn't so we took over the president's office.  I was president and we issued, we had ten demands, we went in and we told him he wasn't leaving until he signed them.  It was a very interesting situation because we worked for weeks trying to figure out what we would and how we would do it and as president I recognized we were only as strong as the weakest person in our organization and that meant that we had to develop a tactic that the girl who was the most skeptical about doing anything could buy into.  So there were some people who said, "Let's burn the school down," you know, and then there were some people who said, "We'd better go study 'cause we'll flunk out," you know. And I needed to figure out how we could bring people together and make sure that nobody went back and told the administration that we were about to do something.  So we just went in his office one day, we put the smallest girl at the door, she sat down.  People just--it was a combination of the old sit-ins you know and the provost was there and the president's administrator and the president and we just sat there and we called people from the community, Mel King [HistoryMaker Melvin King] and John Brown [ph.] and you know we just sat in until we got them to sign. And he signed the ten demands and part of the ten demands was setting up a watchdog committee of community members, students, faculty and administration to ensure that these demands were implemented.  It was a very interesting situation because we all graduated, the seniors graduated.  The next year there were juniors who were then going to be responsible for having this happen. And a lot of things like happened at many of the schools where the administration said they were gonna do stuff and they started back pedaling.
Story_ID: 611558
Speaker 1: How many young ladies participated in the demonstration (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In this, well we strategically--there must've been about fifteen or twenty of us in, in the president's office because the several years after I joined, like the class of '66 [1966] had about twelve, or the class of '70 [1970] I mean that came in, in '66 [1966] had about twelve African American students and in the last two years there must've been twenty or thirty in those classes.  So the student numbers had begun to increase primarily because Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been killed, Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy], I mean there was just a lot of dynamics that were going on and there was now beginning to be more money for African American students so part of the movement came from masses, we had a critical mass.
Speaker 1: Now, did the sit-in take place after the assassination of Dr. King?
Speaker 2: Yeah it did, 'cause that was in '68 [1968] and we sat in.
Speaker 1: Was it that same spring?
Speaker 2: No, it was--'68 [1968].
Speaker 1: That next (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was the year that Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], that was the year where the first student unrests began, and so the next year a lot of schools were like talking about this and.
Speaker 1: Right 'cause the brothers had the guns at Columbia.
Speaker 2: Yeah in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: But the interesting thing is the schools did not--now, now trustee boards of schools and administrative and faculty are a lot more, a lot more proactive.  I think they thought Columbia was a fluke and as stuff started happening in the '68 [1968], '69 [1969] school year, schools--most schools weren't ready for it.  I mean I remember one of our tactics, potential tactics was we could take over the computer center and when I've given speeches at Simmons [Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts] I, I say, "We didn't even know where it was," you know and, "and then we thought if we did who would care?  What did it do, print the payroll checks?"  I mean we didn't know what it did. So it was an interesting time because I remember going back the next fall, I had already graduated and I went back to address the faculty meeting and when I took the stage many of the faculty walked out you know 'cause they weren't gonna be pushed around by some you know, some alum [alumna] who hasn't given a penny yet.  And the, there were those that stayed because there were faculty members, white faculty members who supported the students and there were people who attempted to help.  There was one fellow, Mark Solomon who was my--who taught a black history class.  He had been brought in from New York [New York], a young historian--I'm still friendly with him now and he was very supportive of us and there were white students who were supportive.  So the day we took over some of the black students didn't wanna go to the, go to the dean's the president's office.  So what they did was, they went to the cafeteria and they went all around the school handing out flyers.  "Black students have now taken over the president's office" and you know "They are not going to leave until he signs the ten demands.  Here are a copy of the ten demands, here's why they've done this."  And there was a woman Diana Franklin [sic. Diane Franklin] who was in my class who was a brilliant writer and I go back now and I look at these ten demands that we wrote and it's amazing to me how well written they were and how thoughtful they were and how comprehensive they were.  I'm, I'm stunned by it.  I recently found--I had a notebook of all the minutes of the Black Student Organization my senior year, and it was just--you know we were seniors in, in college.  So we would talk about, "There's a party at Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] this weekend and we have to get together to decide our political action, and the brothers at Northeastern [Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts] are you know gonna be protesting at such and such," so you could really sort of see the history of the times.  Of course we were interested in social stuff, but we were very politicized in a way that I think students in subsequent years weren't.  There weren't as many volatile issues and opportunities to be, to be decisive.
Story_ID: 611559
Speaker 1: That whole experience taught me a tremendous amount about leadership.  I came in with sort of strong leadership tendencies, but I learned how to take ideas and I learned how to take principles and I learned how to take philosophies and make them work and I learned how to work and mobilize people, and I learned that you know I was probably, I wasn't on the end of let's burn the school down but I also wasn't on the end of let's do nothing 'cause if don't you know if we do something bad we'll, I mean our parents might get mad at us.  I was more on the end of we've gotta get some kind of change now. But I knew that unless I was able to bring people in and engage them we wouldn't have succeeded and if I, if anything helped me, learn strategy, learn tactics, learn motivation of people.  It was that experience at Simmons [Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts] and it was probably a foundation that really helped me be successful ultimately in the corporate world.  It was all about compromise and coalitions and stuff that can make a difference when you're fighting around issues that are important with people who have power and you have none. If anything, and it also taught me a whole lot about being powerless, 'cause you don't even think about having power when you're a kid.  Your parents have power and you don't and it's sort of implied and understood but when we were fighting with the administration we--many of the kids were on scholarship, I was paying my own way.  I was on loans, but there was a lot for us to lose but the thought of losing something today that really didn't reflect out--stuff of substance and the, and the thought of gaining something for tomorrow that could be major life changing for us and others was so compelling that you know it, it won out in the long run.
Speaker 2: Now had you had any, when you reflect back on it, had you had any organizing training along the way, the formal or informal?
Speaker 1: Well, you know it's interesting 'cause you saw that all the time in the civil rights era.  You grew up and you watched people organize and you read it and I had heard Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] speak and Reverend Lawson [Earl Wesley Lawson]  would talk about going to these rallies and the planning and the organization. So for that kind of political action or social action you sort of had a visual rehearsal, but my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] was always involved in stuff and she was always planning and she was always organizing and so I watched her you know do fifteen or twenty breakfasts over the years, get the speakers, get the tickets sold, get you know, just everything had to be and she was just really organized and really had it together.
Story_ID: 611560
Speaker 1: One summer between my years at busi- in my years in college [Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts], I did community organizing.  I actually--it was between my junior and senior year, the summer of '68 [1968] and I worked in Boston's South End [Boston, Massachusetts], and we were knocking on doors trying to get people not to sell their homes because urban renewal was coming in and there were a lot of rich real estate ag- people who were trying to buy these homes.  Many of the homes had been lived in by wealthy Brahmins in the 1800s but over time they had been bought up by black families and a lot of the black families had turned them into rooming houses. But a lot of the families still owned these pieces of property and they were solid brownstone homes and we were trying to get people to come to rallies and to listen to--
Speaker 2: So were you working with Mel King [HistoryMaker Melvin King] or [HistoryMaker] Sarah-Ann Shaw or?
Speaker 1: Well Mel King, Sarah-Ann Shaw were--Sarah-Ann Shaw at that point had, was running--she had her own TV show at that point.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But Mel King was a big organizer in the South End, but I was working--I can't even remember the name of the group that hired me but we were literally paid to go knock on doors and that was very instructive because what happened was we'd knock on a door and I'd say, "Hi, I'm Paula Sneed [HistoryMaker Paula Ann Sneed] and I'd like you to come to a meeting. We're going to be talking about the plans for the South End and you should come and hear because we have--I know that you own this house," and a lot of time what people would say to me is, "You know honey, you're getting your education, you're, you're gonna make something of your life, but I'm just trying to hold onto this house, and I can't come to a meeting 'cause I gotta go to work." And it was clear to me that it was almost a middle-class luxury to be able to be political because if you had, you know if you were struggling and you had to pay the rent and feed your kids and do this, you almost didn't have the time to be political and that was an eye opener for me and it was some--
Story_ID: 611561
Speaker 1: And imagine, I went in, I wanted to be a social worker because when I went to college [Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts] I was gonna save the world.  I believed Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], I wanted to go in and I wanted to be a social worker and if there were social ills, I was gonna cure them.  I actually wrote a paper once 'cause people would say you know, like social work is not, it's not a worthwhile career and I remember arguing with somebody said, "I wanna be a social worker 'cause I do wanna change the world, and I believe I can do it, I can be a part of that."  And you know so the community organizing piece was yeah, social workers can work with people and help them deal with problems that they have, but community organizers operate on a slightly higher level and it, but it also showed me that you were really dealing at levels of reacting to the problem you saw, and so all of a sudden my senior year I had this real issue, 'cause what am I gonna do with my life.  'Cause now I'm recognizing that it is all about power and powerlessness and it is all about who controls and who doesn't and you're fixing the problems but shouldn't I focus my energies on you fixing, you know really getting at the policy place in this equation so I can really change things?
Speaker 2: So, well I guess you're saying so rather than trying to ameliorate the problem on some level you were, as an organizer you were trying to solve the problems (unclear)?
Speaker 1: We were trying to solve it but my, my, awakening was even that was the wrong place in the chain. That somebody had to change things at a different level, a completely different level.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so what I began to think about was I need, I need to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and that was my goal as I was leaving col- high sc- leaving college.
Story_ID: 611562
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna take, take you back a little bit just to, 'cause we--to '68 [1968] when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] actually was killed.  Do you remember what you were doing and what the college's [Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts] reaction--what that community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think--
Speaker 1: How it reacted to the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that night I remember I was a commuter and so I was you know commuting back and forth to school and I remember I was probably on the train or something coming home 'cause I, a lot of times I would stay late at school, I'd work--and I remember hearing it and I remember going home and watching it on TV and going to school the next day and the school was closed and there were all kinds of rallies and you know it was, it was devastating.  It was devastating because I could think back to that, that speech on the Lincoln Memorial [Washington, D.C.] and I really believed when he talked about opportunity I believed he was saying that I could get that opportunity. So now all of a sudden he's dead, and then the question is, you know 'cause in the beginning nobody knew you know, who killed him and, and you know was it--cause Malcolm [Malcolm X] had been killed I think the year before?  Was he just killed in six- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, he was killed in '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Okay, so it was, is this, you know, is this--who, who did this? And so now many of us had--I grew--I actually grew up at a time in the civil rights era when the, the black Muslims were, (makes sound), no. People, families made a choice.  They would either believe in the Martin Luther, the Martin Luther King side of the social problem eradication or the, as the Muslims became--black Muslims became more and more verbal, powerful, visible many families went in that direction.  The Black Power movement was sort of, closer to that end but without the religious aspects of it, it was sort of in the middle between the two.  So that whole time period was interesting because many of us were--we had read Malcolm's autobiography ['The Autobiography of Malcolm X,' Malcolm X and Alex Haley], we, we had seen the speeches, we had read the speeches, in fact we use to pass them out at Black Student Organization.  So now you have Malcolm gone, you have, you have Martin Luther King gone, it's scary.  And that then gave a lot more impetus to, if they're gonna kill the man who was for non-violence, we really have to take action.  So a lot of those comp--a lot of those factors feed into students really feeling like they wanted to do something assertive and positive during that time period.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I just wanted to go back and cover that and see how, what the reaction was (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So my senior year Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] gets killed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so now--and, and I was, you know at that point we had already been through the, the Chicago Convention of '68 [1968 Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois].  So I'm a community organizer that summer, I have my own apartment in the South End [Boston, Massachusetts].  My friends would come over, you know it was the first time we all, many of us had our own places and it was like you're really grown up. And as a kid my family use to always watch the conventions every summer, whenever they you know the summer and, and I would love the votes and the platforms and the arguments and we'd watch it on the news and we'd read The Boston Globe and we'd you know, what's on the political, the Democratic platform, what's on the Republican platform.  My parents really were a very engaged in it, and when Barbara Jordan ran, I mean that was--and Shirley Chisholm. I mean seeing Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Jordan you know sort of take the, take the podium, an incredible experience. So, it's now '68 [1968] and we're sitting there, or I'm sitting in the South End of Boston that summer and I see the dogs in Chicago [Illinois].  It's like, what is, what is happening?  You shot Malcolm, you shot Martin Luther King--they're putting dogs--they, it was one thing when they put dogs on black people but now they're putting dogs on their own kids, you know this company, this country is--we use to use the F-word all the time, this country is F'd up.  So that next year we go back to school, so all that was the impetus for taking over and really saying we've gotta take action now.  And then when Kennedy was killed I think that was several weeks before 'cause I think it was February or March of '68 [1968] or '69 [1969]?
Speaker 1: It was June of '68 [1968], Dr. King was killed April 4th, Bobby in June.
Speaker 2: Of '68 [1968]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in '68 [1968], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay so you know it, all of those factors--a friend of mine read Betty Friedan in the summer going into our senior year and I remember calling one of my friends from high school [Malden High School, Malden, Massachusetts] saying, "You have got get this book, I've got--she gave it to me, I'm reading it, you've got to read it."  It was a white Jewish friend and she, she read it and there was, it was just a great time to be a young person because people could divorce themselves from all of the theories and philosophies and values of the past, if you wanted to, or you could divorce those that were no longer applicable to your life and I guess I felt like, like my parents didn't know I--we were taking over the, the president's office, I remember coming home saying, "Oh today we took over the president's office."  My mother [Furman Turner Sneed] said, "Girl if you get, if you flunk out of that school within weeks of graduation--."  You know she, she said, you know she just walked away, but you know she was supportive of the kinds of things I believed in 'cause she was a radical for her time period.  You know quitting a job when you don't even have one and my dad [Thomas Sneed] was always you know, "You're smart, you're not gonna get yourself into trouble."  And I wasn't gonna get myself into too much trouble.
Story_ID: 611563
Speaker 1: So I left college [Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts] in '69 [1969] and my original intention was like to get that MSW, but I was so burnt out of working, studying, being politically active, that I decided I wanted to work.  So my first job was working for Reverend Lawson [Earl Wesley Lawson] who was the director of a program in Roxbury in Boston [Massachusetts] which is Rox- which is Boston's black community. And he was running a program for alcoholics called Outreach for Problem Drinkers [ph.], and it was originally a drop-in center and counseling for black male alcoholics and there were some Native Americans who use to come to this drop-in center, but they were more and more women who started to come to the drop-in center.  So you've got men and women--alcohol, not a great combination, and so he wanted a separate program for women alcoholics.  So he had had this position that was open.  So I got out of college, my--I, I get a job, I ran a day camp for the summer and then I thought, "Well, come fall I'd better get a job."  And you know my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] said, "You know Reverend Lawson has a position in Roxbury at the outreach program that he works in.  You should go talk to him."  So I went in and I sat down I talked to him, I interviewed and he hired me.  Now, I'm twenty-one years old, I am working with women who've been drinking longer that I've been living in many cases and many alcoholically.  I go in and my modus operandi is I work really hard, I do a good job, you know, that's it!  And so these women are alcoholics and I go in thinking I am gonna make them not alcoholics.  So my first day on the job this guy takes me to meet one of my clients, 'cause all the women had been, had male counselors before.  Now, I'm gonna be the supervisor of the women's program.  So we go into this house, I'll never forget it.  There was no light in the hallway, and it smelled horrible and so we start climbing up the stairs, and we weren't wealthy, but you know we, we, we lived in our own house and you know it wasn't horrible.  So there's urine smells, there's feces smells, it's bad.  So we knock on the door and the lady goes, yeah finally she comes, she yells out, "Who is it?"  And he says who he is and she says--he says, "I brought your new counselor."  "I don't want no new counselor."  And he cajoles her and she finally opens the door and you know she does not want any part of me. And I go in and I sit down and I have on my little whatever, my business--my work clothes and there's roaches everywhere, I mean the place is you know and I just took a deep breath and said you know this is my job and I'm gonna be good at it.
Story_ID: 611564
Speaker 1: I'm now set up, I'm now the educational--no, I'm now the women's coordinator for the Outreach Program for Problem Drinkers [ph.], that's my business title.  So I go visit all of my clients that--these are women who had come to the program previously and I invite them to come to the drop-in center on Tuesday afternoon because we're going to have a meeting. And I had thought about what we were gonna do.  I went--I had coffee, I made cookies or something.  I remember making things because in my mind I was going to bring these women together and we were going to have a conversation and by coming to the drop-in center and talking about what they were interested in, I was hoping that there would be time away from alcohol, but this would begin the process of engaging with me as their counselor and engaging with each other and in my mind within you know a relatively short time many of these women would stop drinking.  Well, of course I knew little to nothing about alcoholism and the first day no one shows up, no one.  I was a little disappointed but I sent out the notices and you know meanwhile I'm visiting with these women during the week and (unclear) are on my caseload and I'd set up appointments and then the second time no one shows up. And then I begin to realize that I was gonna have to measure success differently, because in my life up until that point, my success had everything to do with my input and my output.  So if I really worked hard, I'd earn an A, if I didn't work so hard I might get a B plus, you know but I really--if wanted to be president of the class I'd work really hard and I'd do the kinds of things that one does to, to get elected.  So I really had never had a major, well other than not being selected to be a majorette in high school [Malden High School, Malden, Massachusetts], I mean I never had a disappointment and I'd never had anything that I really worked for that I didn't get, and all of a sudden I realized that success was that if I said we were having a group meeting and--on a Tuesday and a woman showed up on Thursday and said, "Hey, aren't we having some kind of meeting?"  Aha! That's success. She remembered a meeting and she came. And so rather than like a student you measure success by semester, I'd finish the course and I'd move on.  All of a sudden I realized success was going to a lot longer and a lot harder and a lot more difficult to measure and I had to find my own measurement, and that was a second thing that helped me be successful in corporate. Because in corporate, success doesn't come when you want it necessarily. And, and at times it is not even the result of really hard work.  It is, there's a whole, it's a very complicated formula. But by going through that experience with those women in that program I learned a tremendous amount about myself and about, and about what success meant and it was humbling in that I realized that there would be a lot of things in my life that I would really want to accomplish and work hard at that I would not be able to do just because I could will it or wanted it to happen.  So I worked in that program [Outreach Program for Problem Drinkers (ph.)] probably about a year and a half, two years and I got promoted to run all of the training and to do all of the educational material that we handed out to the community and so I was sort of the second in command to Reverend Lawson [Earl Wesley Lawson]. And then you know a lot of it was the fact that many of these programs in the late '60 [1960], early '70s [1970] were demonstration grants and the government was saying, "We're gonna give money to unusual suspects, community organizations," groups that really didn't have a lot of the more traditional training in social service delivery and this money was going to these organizations as demonstration projects.  They were three or four year grants to see if it could work, and if it worked they were then gonna give them more money and it was the first time that much of this money hadn't gone to traditional institutions.  Course the traditional institutions didn't like the fact that somebody else was getting the money.  So there really wasn't a network of support for a lot of these community organizations and it was really the blood, sweat and, and tears a lot of times or the hard work of the people in those organizations to make them work. And I did well because I was young and I had a lot of energy and I was just gonna make it work, you know why couldn't I?  My mother [Furman Turner Sneed] told me, "Get it in your head, work hard," blah, blah you know that kind of thing.  So I loved the job but eventually I went to the parent agency that had gotten the funding for this particular project and there I ran all the program development, evaluation, I wrote grants and got money for health care programs, got money for other things, but ultimately the whole agency was a victim of these demonstration grants because a part of the grants provided administrative money and as these grants ended and there were no renewals in many cases--where did you go get the money?  And so the agency folded, I was out of work for a couple of weeks and at the time there was a new program that had just been funded at Boston City Hospital [Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts] and there were two physicians who had gotten a grant to run a sickle cell program.
Story_ID: 611565
Speaker 1: Now what year is this (unclear)?
Speaker 2: This was 1972 I think, or '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: That sounds about right.
Speaker 2: And so there was the federal--the NIH [National Institutes of Health] had given money for--to, to set up ten sickle cell centers and they would be established in big cities, they were, they would combine two things, research on sickle cell disease and a, some sort of community-based programs.  The two hematologists in Boston [Massachusetts] who got the grants were Lou Sullivan [HistoryMaker Dr. Louis Sullivan] who ultimately went on to run Morehouse medical school [Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia] and who was ultimately the first George Bush's [President George Herbert Walker Bush] secretary of health and I think health and human services [U.S. secretary of health and human services], but he was one of the authors of the grant of the NIH and the other one was a woman named Jane Desforges.  Lou Sullivan was the head of Boston University's [Boston, Massachusetts] hematology department at Boston City Hospital [Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts] and she ran the Tufts' [Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts] hematology department.  So I'm twenty-four years old I think, probably twenty-four maybe. And I go down, they had an ad in the paper, the black paper about come run, we need somebody to run the Boston Sickle Cell Center [Boston, Massachusetts] and they were gonna run the research stuff but they needed somebody to come in and set- and design and run the program for the community services.  So I go down there and they gave me the job.  Now, I'm twenty-four years old, I've never set up a program like that but I was hard working and smart, I, I had been appointed to the governor's alcoholism advisory board.  I was on a bunch of community boards and I was, you know I was very active in the black community and I went in and they asked me a few questions and I convinced them that I could design and run this program. And as I look back on it, it was really quite good.  What I knew about Boston was that health services were delivered locally.  They had all these local, these community--they called them community health centers and they had been begun about eight or nine years before that and a lot of people in various neighborhoods would go there for their primary care as opposed to what happened in many big cities where poorer people would go to the big city hospitals and get care they'd show up in the emergency room.  So I realized that we ought to be testing people for sickle cell disease at their local health center and that we ought to be counseling out of their local health center, so I knew that the blood ought to be tested in one location.  There was a lab at Boston City, so we get the lab, I went to Boston University medical school [Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts], found a guy who was a biomedical engineer who had this big computer lab and I said, "I wanna be able to computerize this data." And you can imagine in those days computerizing data was a big issue.  Everybody was afraid to give their social security number. So I set up a system.  I went to all the health centers across the city.  I sat down with the executive directors and said, "I wanna offer you a free service.  I wanna test in your facility, your people will draw the blood for free but I will assign an educated counselor to your center."  I came up with this educated counselor thing. "They'll come to your center a couple of times a week.  They'll provide the counseling to the families who've been tested and all the records will go back to their health record right here.  We won't keep anything at Boston City Hospital, we'll just keep statistics and our program is gonna do community education."  Well I set up this program, I hired all the people.  We had no typewriters, I bought IBM Selec- I reviewed all kinds of typewriters, I set up the whole thing from scratch.  It was a phenomenal experience and then when the NIH evaluated the programs a few years later, of the ten that were set up nationally, ours was the best, and I was--I ran it.  The two hematologists they had all these studies; there was genetic studies and you know they had about twelve doctors. And my interaction with them was just to make sure they got their grants in on time so we'd get it to the NIH, they'd get their money. But all of the community stuff, hir- you know all the stuff, the testing, the screening, the community education, the genetics counseling the--I ran that whole thing.
Story_ID: 611566
Speaker 1: Now one day I wake up and every year I had been saying I gotta go back to school, go back to school, go back to school, and I realized I'm twenty-six, I'm not married.  I'm gonna have to support myself for the rest of my life.  I have, I'm--I, I was probably making eighteen thousand bucks [dollars] up from six thousand when I started, which was a lot of money back then. But I realized that my next move had to be an appointed position, and I was young and I had no other credential other than a bachelor's degree and a pretty good reputation, and I thought no one's gonna appoint me to anything significant.  Who's gonna appoint me to, like how am I gonna get to be secretary of health and human services?  So I began to look around at what people were getting as far as degrees and I thought, well in the past to run these things people were either social workers or they were psychologists and then there were more and more lawyers and academicians who were moving into some of these rolls and I thought I--what I had learned was these, these organizations are run badly, you know people don't know how to run stuff, they don't know how to lead stuff, they don't know how to manage a budget.  I said, I'm gonna go to business school and I'm gonna learn those things and that's gonna give me a leg up to be, to get that job as the health- the secretary of health and human services, because I saw what happened when the government did those, those demonstration grants that'd come in.  They do an audit and they'd look at how the money was spent and they--I thought it wasn't that people were trying to be crooks, I mean dag, the people who've been running these organizations for fifty years, this community service houses, they weren't doing the greatest job.  Why did they expect we would do a great job in two years?  But I said if I learn something about management I'll do a good job.  So I applied at business school thinking that I would never in life work in a big company, ever.  It was not at all in my desire set, it wasn't in my plan, I didn't wanna work with those folks, 'cause to me business was white men who didn't like black women, and who I wasn't gonna like working with. And so (laughter) I did, I had no interest at all.  So I applied to business schools.  I think my original desire was really to go to Harvard School of Public Health [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts], because that would've given me some training in managing and leading and I thought well that would be a great credential for (gesture), but they didn't accept me and they didn't accept me because I didn't have medical background and Lou Sullivan [HistoryMaker Dr. Louis Sullivan] and Jane Desforges both called the school and said, "She's really bright, she's--would make a great student," and their attitude was, "We accept people with medical backgrounds, she doesn't have it, and then this little program she ran [Boston Sickle Cell Center, Boston, Massachusetts] is not medical background."  So that was that. So got into this, got into several business schools and started in Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] in the fall of 1977. I literally stopped working like on the Friday and started business school on Sunday because I was writing the last grant of the--you know the sickle cell program was funded, I think they were five year funding and you had to get the grant in like eighteen months before the funding was supposed to start. So I wrote the grant before I went back to school, and went back to school. But you know that six years of work experience right out of undergraduate school [Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts] was really phenomenal and I, I talk to my daughter [Courtney Bass] who is now twenty-seven and I use to tell her from college until you go back to whatever professional school you go back to is probably the most important time of your life.  You grow up a lot in college, and you should use college to do that, and then when you come out of college, you ought to use your first work experiences to figure out who you are and what you're good at and what you're not good at and what you like and what you don't like.  You ought to learn who you are as a human being and then you ought to decide what you wanna do.  Now, you know I can say that 'cause that's what I did and it worked for me, but I, I you know it is a good formula because a lot of times people pick something when they're real young and they pick it because of external stimuli as opposed to knowing who they are.
Story_ID: 611567
Speaker 1: I pretty much knew who I was when I went back to business school and it was a good thing because when I walked into Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] there were about twenty--out of a class of about 750 or eight hundred students, there were twenty-five African Americans, and there about maybe sixty women and very early on a guy came up to me and said, "You took a spot that a qualified white male should've had." And I said to him, "And I will do a lot better than he would've done."  And I just recently went back to my thirtieth business school reunion and one of the guys who, who I think was the one that said it to me, 'cause I couldn't remember.  It was one of the really early days at school and you don't really know people very well, and he said, "Boy, you know when you first walked into that classroom," he said, "you know your background was in social service," he said, "but you were just so confident." And I said, "You know the funny thing was I was confident," 'cause I had felt like I had done a really great job in my work experiences before I went back to school, and I was very proud, but when I went in that classroom, everything I had done was discounted by other students who had been in more traditional business roles. And at Harvard Business School in the first week or so they tell you, "Look around, 'cause 10 percent of you won't be here."  And at that point many of the people who didn't make it were foreign students, women and people of color, and I was gonna be dammed if I wasn't gonna make it, 'cause I figured these guys were not as hardworking as me you know for the most part.  These guys were no smarter than me, or some of them might have been but I could make up with hard work what I didn't have in gray matter and just because the thought was I wouldn't make it, I knew I would you know and so first, the first few weeks were (laughter) an eye opener because I didn't know anything about accounting.  I thought marketing was what you did when you went to the grocery store on Saturday (laughter).  I thought finance was when you wanted to buy a car or a refrigerator.  I had no--I had taken an accounting course you know right after, right when I knew I was going back to school and I had taken a calculus course 'cause the last time I had math was statistics in college and before that it was trig [trigonometry].  So I figured, hm I'd better take some math courses.  So when you go in and people are talking in finance class about albatrossing, I'm like what, is this a foreign language?  And so I was in a study group with another African American woman and three white guys and I had just a lot of savvy, street smarts and savvy and--I'm also very strategic and so in the marketing classes it was really, it just came intuitively to me. And the one guy had been a banker, another guy and had been a military guy, so the five of us really worked together that first semester and we all brought different skills.  The other African American woman was a recent grad from Harvard College [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], she was a math major.  So you know it was a nice melding. And by the end of the first, the first term, I had several excellents, you know.  They gave you excellents, pass and low pass. But I had one low pass, and I was really indignant so I went to the--and it was in a class that I--it was operations management and it was the midterm grade and I was like, when I walked in there they were talking about production.  I knew nothing about this, so I would just in sit in class like this, listening and taking notes and reading my cases.  So when I went and took the exam I knew I had done a good job but I get a low pass on the exam.  So I went to see the professor and he and said to me, "You know, I read the exams blind, and I read this exam and I thought 'Wow this is a good exam'."  He said, "Then I opened it up," cause they made you staple the, the, you know you staple the book back, so you handed it in it was a blue book and the first thing was the first written page and it was stapled, and he said, "I opened the book and I saw it was Paula Sneed [HistoryMaker Paula Ann Sneed], and I'm like, Paula Sneed wrote this exam?" And he said, "You never talked in class, you never contributed anything and so that's why you got a low pass 'cause you just--you know obviously you know enough to contribute but you didn't contribute, so this is a lesson."  And that was a wakeup call to me because I ended up getting a pass in the grade, the course overall, but I realized that in every class from that point forward I would go in and I would sit with the professor and I would explain to the professor what my intentions were in his class and I would go in and I'd say, "I expect to get an excellent in your class, you know I'm gonna work hard, I may not have the background in X, but you know," blah, blah.  And so by second year I got, I got honors in second years.  I got mostly excellents.  The only low pass I got was in a upper level finance course. But you know I had so many excellents the second year that I waived the low pass in that, that grade.  The point though was that Harvard Business School was a great experience because it prepared me for a lot of what I would experience in the business world.  And I guess I've always had this ability to be in a situation and to gain perspective.  So when I was in high school [Malden High School, Malden, Massachusetts] or I was in college [Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts] I understood what was happening but I also understood implications, and a lot of that was parental training.  My dad [Thomas Sneed] would say, "You know there's, there's a cause and there's an effect.  There's a penalty to pay if you don't do the right thing, and there's a reward and you gotta be thinking about that.  Use your head, think it through," you know, "anticipate, don't get yourself into a jam you can't get yourself out of," you know, that kind of like classic parent thing that you don't think (laughter) you're listening to really does build skills and it really informed a lot of our parenting.
Story_ID: 611568
Speaker 1: When you are on the verge of graduating I guess with your M.B.A, what were your prospects, did you think you were going back into the not-for-profit world, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well what happened was my first term, first year I read this class, this case about a guy who worked at General Foods [General Foods Corporation] and he worked on Cycle dog food and his job was to be the brand manager on that particular product and he was responsible for the advertising, the promotion, he was responsible for developing new products.  He worked with the sales force, he developed the marketing plan and the business plan for the year.  I mean he basically ran a business. And I was really fascinated by that job because I looked at the job and I thought, "I could do that job."  I basically did a job like in the Boston Sickle Cell Center [Boston, Massachusetts], you know I ran the show, and this is what this brand manager is doing.  And the work really sounded interesting and you know this guy, it talked about how the guy got into, by getting into the heads and the hearts of the person who owned the dogs he got into the mouths and the stomach of the dog and so it was all about understanding the, the human being that, that was gonna buy the dog food.  Well, my background was in social science, psychology, sociology and I thought you know this stuff is so intuitively obvious to me.  I could be a brand manager for the short term at least, so that's what I did.  I applied to companies to be a brand, to learn about brand management for the summer between my two years of business school and I ended up going to General Foods.  That interview was interesting 'cause the guy who interviewed me said, "What's a black girl with all this social consciousness like you doing in a place like Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] and interviewing at General Foods?"  And that made me mad, I was gonna write the company and tell them, you know, "Your guy insulted me," and my friend Linda [ph.], who was in my study group said you know, "Just wait to see whether they offer you a job before you, (laughter) you know start rocking the boat."  They did offer me a job and I did go to that guy when I was a summer intern saying, "You know I just thought that question you asked me was really a lot out of order."  And he said, "No it wasn't, it was a stress question.  We want to see how you would handle a question like that and you know you did have nothing but social consciousness on your resume and you had no business background and we wanted to know why you wanted here?"  Anyway I had took the job for the summer 'cause I thought how, how hard could this selling dog food or whatever.  And the job was a lot harder than I expected but it was also really interesting and it allowed me to use all my business kind of stuff that I had learned the first year. So at the end of the summer I had an offer to come back full time when I finished school.  So, now I'm torn because do I go back to the public sector right away, or do I go to the private sector for a while? And I all--I thought about it like maybe do an apprenticeship, really figure out how to really do this business thing and then go back into the public sector with more experience.  The other thing was I had about eighteen thousand dollars' worth of school debt and I was looking at this huge debt.  I had just paid off my undergrad debt before I went to back to school, 'cause my parents [Furman Turner Sneed and Thomas Sneed] were able to help me some, but I basically took out loans and I just paid them off, went back to school.  Now I have this huge debt and I'm thinking, "What am I gonna do?"  So I decided that, well I'll go work for General Foods for three years. That was the amount of time it typically took to get to be a brand manager and I figured that's all I'm gonna be able to stand.  I will then go back and do what I really wanna do and where my passion is.  Well twenty-nine years later (laughter) I retired. You know but it was, it was--the decision to go in was all motivated on the fact that I really felt after business school I needed a credible work experience in the private sector and I liked the work.
Story_ID: 611569
Speaker 1: The work [at General Foods Corporation] was fascinating, it was a lot harder than the case made it seem because there were so many variables and there were so many things beyond your control but marketing was something that really could be done in a very successful way by using a lot of the same things I used when I ran the Boston Sickle Cell Center [Boston, Massachusetts].  You know you really had to be creative and innovative and thoughtful in a very structured and strategic way.  It wasn't like creative like you see on, necessarily on an advertising ad, a piece of advertising or a print ad, but it was really thinking how to problem solve in creative ways that hadn't been done before so that you could best competition and you know it was very exciting.
Speaker 2: Okay now well give us an example of some of this excitement. That's--okay well can you think of a story--
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) where--yeah?
Speaker 1: One of the, of the brands--there's always, there's always opportunities to, in every aspect of business to creatively problem solve.  So when I first started out we were trying to--we needed new packaging for Stove Top stuffing and Stove Top was only about two or three years old and up until that point before they introduced stuffing, Stove Top stuffing which was a convenient boxed product, people had stuffing very rarely.  They had it at Thanksgiving, they had it at Christmas, 'cause it was a lot of work, dry out bread, chop it up, but a lot of butter in, a lot of certain ingredients.  People loved stuffing and they wished they could have it more often, but it just was too much work.  So they came out with this product and at first people were thinking, well but it's a holiday thing.  Why am I gonna have it on Tuesday night?  So the challenge was to figure out how to make stuffing something that people would want more often than Thanksgiving and Christmas? And if they didn't figure that out this whole product line wouldn't, wouldn't exist.  So someone had the idea that stuffing could be thought about like any other side dish. And at that point, potatoes were the side dish that most people put on their plate every single night.  And there was a lot of potato boredom and so people were looking for an alternative to potatoes.  So by taking something like stuffing and comparing it to potatoes and making it an alternative to potatoes, you begin to build an interest.  People understood what the substitute was.  I could use this instead of potatoes, oh I get it!  Now you got to get them to move to, why would I do that?  Well 'cause it tastes great and it's you know light and so this whole strategy then had to be translated to packaging and as a very junior entry level person that was my job.  And the packaging that I inherited was something that had a big red st- red box with the word Stove Top stuffing and then at the top was this little, little plate with a piece of chicken and you didn't even know what other else was on there, but it was Stove Top, and my job was to make this package more consistent with the overall strategic direction of the brand, and so you sit there and you go, okay. It's a package you know, it's this big, what am I supposed to?  And so you begin to work with people to begin to think about what is Stove Top, what are some of the equities?  What are some of the benefits?  What does it conjure in people's minds?  And so you had to be able to communicate all of that very succinctly in a couple of photographs to put on this package.  If you get your packaging right, particularly at a time when people are beginning to discover a product, it can really build awareness and trial and if they try it, they like it they'll come back.  So the role of packaging was a really important role and my job was to work to come up with and recommend the package that was going to be the most effective in accomplishing the goals packaging was supposed to accomplish at that point.  And so I--that was one of my first projects. And so came up with this product.  We took down the logo, we had a big spoon that basically protruded from the package that had a hunk of stuffing on it and you know you could see the celery and you could see the onions and you could see the bread and it made it look really delicious, and so all of a sudden you went from this ugly little, little package that just said Stove Top to something that was meaningful, and it was exciting.
Story_ID: 611570
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In marketing there were always opportunities, whether it was creative problem solving opportunities in, in advertising or promotion or packaging. Or line extensions.  What's the next way to take this to brand and the equities that the brand has and the relationship the brand has with consumers and move it to someplace else, you know another product form?  And so I, I found that I loved this work because every day was a problem to be solved either an internal problem because you needed to do something with your brand or you had a competitive threat and you had to develop a defense mechanism to be able ensure that they didn't take your rightful position in the marketplace so.
Speaker 1: Yeah Stove Top (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's fascinating.
Speaker 1: Stove Top stuffing caught on, I know it really caught on.
Speaker 2: It did.
Speaker 1: And another product that you were involved in is Shake 'n Bake.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Now you--
Speaker 2: Now when I say, "Shake 'n Bake," what, what is the words that come to your mind?
Speaker 1: And I helped.
Speaker 2: Exactly. And that was some of the most effect- I wish I could claim that commercial, but I joined that brand probably about twenty years after the brand was launched and when we would go to focus groups and we would say, "Shake 'n Bake," everybody would say, "And I helped."  The point was that Shake 'n Bake was an alternative to fried chicken and at the time when it was launched it was really innovative because people hated the mess fried chicken made.  A lot of health issues were surfacing around fried foods, so this was a product that allowed people to get good tasting chicken.  It wasn't as good as fried chicken quite frankly but good tasting chicken on the table much more conveniently and this notion of--people never let a little kid help with frying, but you could let a little kid help you shake the chicken and put it in, on a pan.  And so all of these brands really required initially some insight into behavior that existed that you could slightly change and make profitable sales on. But then ultimately all of these brands required someone to take the brand to the next level and I loved the opportunity in brand management to really take something that was inanimate that people had opinions and feelings about and shepherd those brands to a new place.  That's really what a brand manager is.  They are a brand steward.  It's like a shepherd, it's like a parent, it's--you take something and your job during your time on that brand is to take it to a better place.  So a brand like Jell-O, and I ran the deserts division at Kraft [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.] for a while, for several years actually.  Jell-O had been around since the 1800s. And so when you think about the numbers of generations that had had some form of Jell-O, it's, it's an institution in, in the United States. And almost every single household in America has a box of Jell-O gelatin pudding somewhere.  So if you're fortunate enough to be able to manage that brand for a while--I mean it's really, it's almost like, you know it sounds hokey but it's almost like an honor and privilege that you could take Jell-O to the next level and the person who managed it in the '40s [1940], the innovation was you could have pudding instantly 'cause in the old days you had to boil milk and put cornstarch--the person who came up with instant pudding.  It says pour a little milk, stir, done, but now if you're managing it in the '80s [1980] people want convenient desserts, they don't want to be stirring and messing up a pot.  So now what do you do?  Well you make it ready to eat and you put it in these cups and you sell it that way.  So every generation of brand managers is confronted with a new problem even though the brand may be old and I really enjoyed that aspect of it.  I enjoyed the problem solving, I enjoyed the fact that there are times that Private Label [Private Label Foods] or another competitor would come in the market and upset your apple cart as my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] would say, because that just meant you had another opportunity to come up with a better and a creative idea.
Speaker 1: Now you were with General Foods [General Foods Corporation], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And who was your big rival would you say?
Speaker 2: Well GF had a number of different categories, so in the coffee business General Foods had Maxwell House coffee and Folgers Coffee and Hills Coffee [Hills Bros. Coffee] and Nescafe are--so those were the competitors of that particular division.  If you worked in the beverage division we had Kool-Aid and so and we had Tang and we had Crystal Light and Capri Sun and our competitors were really--early on, it was soda, it was juices, it was Private Label and then it became water you know.  So, it's, it's anything that can substitute for that eating occasion so 'cause people go in and they don't say "Gee, I think I want Kool-Aid today," they say, "I'm thirsty."  And then the next line decision is, "Well, what am I thirsty for? Carbonated, non-carbonated." And so as--we have something in, in marketing.  You think of something, there's something you call market structure. And as a brand person you really understand your market structure because it reflects how people make choices, and what you're trying to do is really continuously understand those choices so that you can offer them something that's superior to what they're choosing now and again if you think about my social science background, I just enjoy that aspect of it, I enjoyed the puzzle solving the, the problem solving, the creativity associated.  Not creativity like people typically think of creativity but as I was saying before creative problem solving.
Story_ID: 611571
Speaker 1: When you mentioned Kook-Aid, I mean Kool-Aid you know is very popular in the black community.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: It always has been and people tend to drink it based on its color rather than the flavor (laughter).
Speaker 2: Both and yet that, that's--your absolutely right and what happened was in, in early days researchers really weren't looking at ethnic groups, they were looking at the majority community and as people began to be much more sensitive to consumers of color and they began to look at the consumption index of Kool-Aid among African Americans, African Americans by far drank more Kool-Aid than whites and so much of what began to inform how they marketed was studying African American consumption of Kool-Aid so that they could then develop things, 'cause blacks for example always put fruit and stuff in Kool-Aid, they, they (gesture) doctored it up.  Even the sugar-based Kool-Aid, people would add more sugar to it.  They mix flavors, I mean so they thought, "Wow," the brand people thought, "wow, we can do that and we can sell that," you know so.
Story_ID: 611572
Speaker 1: I didn't finish the question about competitors.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We had Post [Post Consumer Brands] cereal.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so Post cereal was a competitor with Quaker [Quaker Oats Company], General Mills [General Mills Inc.] and Kellogg [Kellogg Company].  We had meals division that I had worked in, the desserts that had Jell-O and Minute Rice. So we had a lot of different competitors because we were in so many different categories and the nice thing about being in a large company like General Foods [General Foods Corporation] when I joined was, you could stay there forever and continuously learn different categories, 'cause a category like coffee is commodity based depending on what the price of coffee beans are.  It really influenced what you would do as you marketed that brand in a given time period and so there was never a dull moment.  I went in thinking I would stay three years and when I left Kraft [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.] had been brought by Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.].  Philip Morris--I'm sorry General Foods had been bought by Philip Morris.  Philip Morris then bought Kraft, merged Kraft and General Foods.  So I joined General Foods, it was then merged with Kraft and as I exited my career in package goods or in food business, it was exiting out of General Foods.  When people ask me, "Why did you stay," you know like surprisingly. 'Cause most people don't stay in a company this long.  I stayed for several reasons.  First, I loved the work, I really did like the work.  There were very few days when I would get up and say, "Oh, I hate this work." Very few days, and I had a lot of different kinds of assignments.  I worked in brand management like I was describing.  I actually--my first VP [vice president] job was running something called consumer affairs.  I ran several of the divisions, I ran the desserts division, I ran the food service division.  I had a short tenure running the meals division. Then I ran all of the global market- I ran all of the marketing functions like advertising, promotion, packaging, marketing, research, database marketing.  All the marketing function media were under my group.  I started the first Internet marketing activity at Kraft and when they established an e-commerce division I was the first president of that division.  So I had a variety of experiences.  So I stayed because I loved the work and every few months, every few eighteen months or so I was getting a promotion or I was getting a new assignment and there was never a dull moment.

Speaker 1: But I also stayed because I saw a lot of people of color leaving, and my attitude was if we didn't--if, if black people and black women didn't go through and break what may have at times appeared to be the concrete ceiling then my children and my, my friends' children wouldn't have the opportunity.  So I saw the door sort of swung open in the '70s [1970] for more people of color and women to come into these organizations.  If everybody left, the door would shut and say like "That was interesting experiment. Didn't work." And I just felt like you know I have an opportunity here to be a trailblazer and I thought--I use to give speeches on being a trailblazer and I thought a lot about what trailblazer meant. But for me it came home when I--my daughter [Courtney Bass] when she was about six I'd gotten my first promotion to VP [vice president] so you know you're black, people tell you don't brag.  So who am I gonna call, my husband [Lawrence Bass] knew, he was happy for me, my--so I said my daughter.  "Mommy is a vice president," and she said--no, I said, "Mommy got a promotion."  She goes, "You got a promotion before."  I'm like, "No, mommy really got a big promotion."  I'm braiding her hair, and then she--I said, "Mommy is a vice president," and she turned around and she said, "Mommy, when I grow up I'm gonna be a president." And when she said that I laughed, I just started laughing 'cause I realized that's why I was at Kraft [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.], or General Foods [General Foods Corporation] at that point. I was there because if I could get to be a vice president and I could do whatever it took, maybe I could open another door so that when her generation came in they could be a president, and that's when all that religious training caught--comes in (background noise).
Speaker 2: We'll pause a second.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Those are great moments and I remember--I had, I actually--with Bill Cosby and he was so wonderful. But you know when my daughter said, "Mommy, I'm gonna be a president," I knew that I was gonna stay no matter what happened.  I might've been disappointed at times, I might've been frustrated, whatever.  It was very important for me to do, to push it as far as I could push it professionally because if I didn't and if my peers didn't, then our kids wouldn't be able to and I really felt strongly about that and that's where a lot of this religious training comes in because you know there were people that pre- not that I consider myself John the Baptist and but there's just this notion that people have to prepare for other people to follow, and you know I was having a great ride and as far as I was concerned, it--you know.
Story_ID: 611574
Speaker 1: I didn't think I would ever get to be some of--ever get to do some of the things that I wanted to, but I started telling people early on that I--that's what I wanted.  I remember going to a boss once and saying when he gave me my--you got your annual review and then you had to write what your career goals were.  So I wrote that I wanted to be vice president of General Foods [General Foods Corporation] and I'd been there about six years and he sat down and he said, "You know I wanna talk about your career goal."  I'm like, "Okay", and he said, "You said you wanna be a vice president." "I think I do."  And he said, "Well, I'm not even a vice president, and there are only like thirty-five to forty vice presidents here." And I'm like, "I know." And he said, "Well you know I'm not sure that, that's a reasonable goal."  And I said, "Well, why?"  And I said, "If I earn it, I expect to be given it, and I would expect that if that's my goal then as my boss you would help me achieve it."  And I said, "I'm not working this hard for your job, Doug [ph.]."  You know part of my problem at times was I engaged mouth before engaging brain, you know and that was probably an inappropriate thing to say to this guy 'cause he wasn't a VP yet, but the point was that I believe that if you wanted something you had to really put it out there that you wanted it and you had to work like you thought you were gonna get it.  Again, get it in your head if you're ready and able and it comes you can have it, and of course what ended up happening was I was able to make VP and I was able to get to president of a division and group VP and executive VP and global--I mean I got all the things, the trappings of corporate success because I just refused to give up when the going got tough.
Story_ID: 611575
Speaker 1: After the first eighteen months [at General Foods Corporation] as an example, there were about six in my class in my division and they appoi- they promoted three people.  Three--no, there were seven of us, they promoted four people, three white men and a woman who was very--whose parents, who had come from a lot of corporate backgrounds.  So she was very sophisticated and everybody knew who her father was and they were very impressed with her, and the people who got left behind were the black woman--me; a Chinese woman and a divorced white woman, single mother.  And you know I was devastated because if you get promoted in eighteen months it really meant that you were on the fast track and I went and I sat down and talked to this African American guy and I said, "You got promoted in eighteen months last time, what happened?"  And he--I, you know like, "Why didn't I get promoted?"  He said, "Because people don't know you."  I'm like, "What do you mean they don't know me?"  He said, "Well you come in, you work hard, you sit in your cube, you do your work you know, you do whatever it takes, but you know when they go into the room to decide on people, if everybody's equal they pick who they know and they don't know you.  You don't go to the cafeteria with them, you don't do this."  Well you know I learned really fast that I, I got it immediately that I had to behave differently if I was gonna be (gesture) part of the club and there were other times and I got promoted at, at, at twenty-one months which were the longest three months I ever had to wait, but you know I learned that, that would never happen to me again.  Then there were other things that happened over, over time where a promotion I thoud- I should've got went to somebody else and I got something else or but I always kept in the back of my mind that this--these successes were about position, power and money. And people don't give up position, power and money easily, and it wasn't--yes, it may have had more of a negative impact on women and blacks early on, but as I watched what happened to white men, it was a pyramid, a lot of those got, you know slipped off the slippery slope of the pyramid and my attitude was that if I, if I was prepared I would prevail. And it happened.
Story_ID: 611576
Speaker 1: And I followed you know some of my own rules like, I used to, I used to talk to younger people in the organization about something I call Paula's [HistoryMaker Paula Ann Sneed] principles, and the first one was you had to have a big, ridiculous, preposterous dream that you believed it that when you told other people they'd go, "Oh, yeah right." Which is sort of like what that boss did to me when I said I wanted to be a vice president, he was like, "Oh, yeah right."  So if your dream is so preposterous that other people can't imagine you doing it, it's about sized right.  Because that then makes you scared enough to figure out, "I gotta get going on this if I'm gonna even come close." So then the next principal is always have a life plan, always have a game plan.  If a strategic plan can take a business from point A to point B then a personal strategic plan can take your life from point A to point B.  And so that was my second principle and I have all these little stories about these principles, and the third one was that you had to see yourself as a reality shaper and that comes from the old civil rights days where there was, it was clear that all I saw growing up were people who believed that they could reshape reality. And that they could change it.  That reality was temporal, that it was influenceable, and so I saw that I tried to influence things in school and that's what I--you know if the reality was there were no blacks, or no women, there's you can't do this, my job was to change it.  And then the last one was, the, the next one was keep the right kind of people in your life because there are people who are success enabling and there are people who are success retarding. And if someone was in my life and they were--and, and this sounds really cavalier and I don't mean it to be.  I didn't ice people because they weren't success enabling, but I just kept people who could help me and support me and give me negative feedback when I needed it and who could really encourage me. 'Cause that was a foundation of my youth.  My parents [Furman Turner Sneed and Thomas Sneed] always encouraged me and I wasn't about to put people in my life later on who weren't as encouraging.  And the last principal was have the right kind of--have the right kind of characteristics that people--that you live up to.  Put some characteristics that you wanna live up to and then work every day to live up to them, and so I began to think about those things and I you know you go back in twenty years of speeches, I always figure out a way to weave those in because it really was the roadmap that I used to help me do the things I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 611577
Speaker 1: Complete--I guess what did you--after your first vice presidency what did you--where did you go?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes so I, my first vice president was head of consumer affairs at General Foods [General Foods Corporation].  Now, I had been on the line side of management, you know running parts of business.  Now, all of a sudden I move and I go into running a function. And it had been the f- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now how did that--I guess we, we need to actually talk about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like that the moment that happened and when you were chosen for that position, or when you achieved--I mean how did it happen?  What was it, what was the moment like?
Speaker 2: The woman who ran that department for a long time was a woman who had come out of home economics because that's what women, you know and that was the first--if you look at corporate history the first women VPs were typically vice president of consumer affairs, that was the woman's VP job.  So this woman had run it forever, and then she retired and they put a woman from marketing into that role, and they put her in there with the designed plan that she would run this department for a while and then she would--'cause she was gonna be one of the first women to move up to a line--general manager's job.  So it was sort of a pathway to something more significant.  So every--the rumor you know in big corporations, everybody knows when stuff is gonna happen.  So rumor was that Gabrielle was gonna, Gabrielle Hermann was her name, and she was gonna be moving on to another job. And this job was opening up and I had no idea that I was in the consideration for it and I was out there doing my little job running my brand.  All of a sudden one day someone called me, an HR [human resources] guy and said, "You know they're thinking about for that VP of consumer affairs job."  I'm like, "Really?" "Yup, they are." I'm like--"So you know think about it, it might be something you'd be interested in."  And my--and I had two reactions, first reaction was whoa, I'm over here in line management competing with these guys for line jobs. Now you're talking about moving me over here into this vice president of consumer affairs which is the woman's VP job.  Do I really want to do that?  What are you guys saying to me?  Are you telling me that I'm off, I'm not gonna make it any higher in here so you're gonna move me over?  Well, that's not what happened to Gabrielle, she moved through that into something else.  So I came home and I talked to Lawrence [Sneed's husband, Lawrence Bass] about it and he said, "You know you need to explore it and understand more about it."  So as I learned more about it, it was a vice president title and as vice president at Kraft you're compensation really shifted--or General Foods [General Foods Corporation]--your compensation really shifted so you went from base and bonus which, and bonus kicked in when you were a director and I had become a director you know at year six.  So now it's like year nine and VPs of marketing typically you didn't get to 'til the year twelve.  So I'm gonna be a vice president, I'm gonna get another level of compensation which was long-term compensation.  I'm gonna get a whole different level of stock options, so I began to look at the sheer numbers and I thought, wow, you know this ain't bad.  Secondly, I was going to be able to see a different side of the company and interact with a whole different level of senior executive that I wasn't going--hadn't been able to interact with before.  So I basically did a pluses and minuses and the pluses won out, but in the back of my mind there was always this thing of, yeah, but you know it is the one woman's vice president job and you know there were a lot of people who said to me, "Boy, you're crazy to take a job off of the line management track going over here." And the choice I made was betting on myself.  Because I talked to a lot--that the CEO of the company interviewed me, a lot of the very senior people interviewed me for this job, and they all said the same thing.  "One, we think you're bright, you're delivering, you seem to have the kind of capabilities that would allow you to be successful here long term.  We want to give you a job over here to give you more exposure.  There are some things we'd like to see happen in that group over there.  We think you could bring that kind of leadership to it and if you do it you will be rewarded.  We expect you to stay there between eighteen to thirty-six months and at the end of the time you will be rewarded with something that's better in the line side of the business."  So, should I trust them?  You know a lot of times people of color, particularly in those days didn't trust white men when they told them stuff.  It's like, why would I trust you? What evidence do I have that you're gonna deliver for me?  But my attitude was, what do I have to lose?  If it doesn't work out and they don't move me back to line management, I'll get a job someplace else.  You know it was sort of that attitude, so I took the job and a lot of my friends were like, "Girl, you--please you're crazy. I wouldn't've done it." But it did exactly what I thought.  It gave me the chance, I had a hundred person department, it was really needed, a real strategic remake and rethink. And I did wonderful things.  I reorganized it, I redesigned it, I restructured it.  It went from a very reactive group--and in that group was the consumer test kitchens, the nutrition group for Kraft [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.].  There was a consumer insights group that really you know did a lot of consumer and food research and behavior.  There was a product publicity and public relations department.  There was the beginning of something called consumer response, because at that point they were just beginning to put eight hundred numbers on packages and so no company knew how to do that and Kraft had put eight hundred numbers on a couple of packages--General Foods--and they wanted to roll it nationally.  They didn't know how to do it and most companies weren't there yet and so I got an opportunity to design that national launch and to do it. (Background noise) It was a great opportunity for me personally and professionally to demonstrate what I was capable of.
Story_ID: 611578
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay so how long did you stay in that position?
Speaker 2: Well, that's the interesting thing because I move into that position, I'm promoted in Ju- in November of 1975 I think?  No, no 1987, '86 [1986].  November of '86 [1986] I was promoted to that position and then almost immediately thereafter Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] buys General Foods [General Foods Corporation].  Art- R.J.R [R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company] had bought Nabisco the year before and by taking a cigarette business and merging it with a package goods business, it really decreased a lot of the risk associated with the cigarette business, because you can remember there were a lot of suits that had begun to appear, so Altria [Altria Group, Inc.] or Philip Morris was looking for a comparable move, so they bought General Foods.  They immediately--there's immediate tension between the General Foods' managers, management and the Altria management.  It wasn't exactly a hostile takeover, but it was pretty doggone close, and so I'm the newest VP in the, in the joint. And then Hamish Maxwell who was the then the CEO OF Altria or Philip Morris came in and basically talked about how you know he wanted to shape up General Foods and you know there were gonna be changes. And it was a very interesting time because the, the management of, of General Foods and the management of Philip Morris really weren't getting along and so very quickly within the time I was in the consumer affairs job many of the people who had committed to me that I would be moved to something more interesting were now gone.  And so I'm there for twenty-four months and I've never been in a job for twenty-four months, and it's twenty-seven months and then it's thirty months. And so I go to the head of HR [human resources] and I say to him, "Listen, you know when I came into this job I was told that I was going to be moved to something more interesting over the long term, and that's what my expectation was.  Now I understand that all the rules have been changed, Philip Morris has bought General Foods, many of the people that made the commitment to me, in fact all of them are gone.  And so if there is not this same commitment I'm okay with that because I recognize that those people are gone and you know the commitments left with them, so if you are going to move me back to a line job and if you think I'm worthy one, let me know, and I'm thrilled and I'll keep doing what I'm gonna do and I'll just expect that, that will happen, but if I'm not, tell me now because I want to be in line management someplace and I wanna you know get on with my life, and there's no hard feelings, you know I'm, I'm okay. I've learned a lot."  The guy goes, "No, no you're going to be promoted, you're gonna get this job." And then within the next you know six months, I was promoted to run the food service division at General Foods and it was the first time that a woman had, had a role like that.  That woman Gabrielle Hermann had been promoted to run a section of, of desserts but I had a whole division and that was quite an experience.  I was the youngest person except for one--it was one other person but I was one of the, the youngest person on my staff.  It was all white men who reported to me and it was quite an experience.
Speaker 1: So this is 1989 or so what or what?
Speaker 2: That was in, let me think--I ran consumer affairs--that was 1990, I was promoted in 1990 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineteen ninety [1990]. Okay.
Speaker 2: I moved into food service that year.
Story_ID: 611579
Speaker 1: I was running the food service division in 1990 and it had been the--it was the division that sold Kraft [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.] products into restaurants, institutions, schools, the military.  Most of the Kraft products are sold to consumers through grocery stores, but this was a slightly different area, and we primarily sold Maxwell House coffee and the coffee products to, to institutions or into the food service channel.  We also sold refreshment beverages and we sold condiments like we had barbeque sauces and, and salad dressings. And so that was not the complete portfolio but a major portion of the portfolio. And I had a very interesting story happen to me in that role.  I was young, I was probably about forty, forty-one when I took that job and most of the people in the food service arena are people who are owners of their distributorships.  So you have families that own these companies, very few of them were large--they might be public companies but very few of them were large like General Foods [General Foods Corporation] was large. And so it was a relationship sell. So we sold coffee to coffee brokers, people who put coffee in offices, or we sold coffee to people that served the big hotels, but these were distributors who were in the business for generations and they always knew who the president of the food service division was at Kraft--General Foods and that person constantly you know visited them, and so I had no sales background and I'm in this job and I'm going out and I'm meeting all these partners and our distributors and at that point Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] has bought Kraft and but Kraft and General Foods were managed separately.  So a lot of the distributors didn't like Kraft Foodservice, because Kraft Foodservice had done some things historically, like they would sell to the distributor and then they decided that they wanted to go direct and they'd pull all the products out and, and so when they would come, when they saw me take over this job they said, "Are you gonna be more like Kraft or are you gonna be like General Foods has been historically?"  And I thought I'm gonna be like General Foods historically because you have helped us make our profit numbers.
Story_ID: 611580
Speaker 1: So one particular visit stands out in my mind; I was going to Birmingham [Alabama] and I was going to meet a person who is a Pepsi [PepsiCo] distributor but who also put on his Pepsi truck packages of Maxwell House coffee, because if he was making a stop at a restaurant dropping off Pepsi, if he could drop off Maxwell House coffee it just increased his profitability on that particular drop.  The guy sold a million pounds of Maxwell House coffee for us [General Foods Corporation] a year and so needless to say he was a pretty big guy for us.  So the guy who reported to me was the vice president of sales. He had a regional head, a regional VP, he also had a district manager and he had an account manager. So all of us were going to visit this fellow. I'm the only woman, I'm the only black.  So we fly down on the corporate plane, I'll never forget it, it was the Tuesday after Thanksgiving.  We fly down on the corporate plane, we land in Birmingham.  We get off the plane we're gonna go to dinner--go to lunch.  So we get in the cars and we're going over towards the restaurant and we get to the restaurant and the man who owns the distributorship who I'm supposed to be meeting with isn't there, and his lieutenants or his associates were very pleasant, but distant, and I, I attributed that to the fact that they didn't know me and you know they're just getting to know me, but I also figured there's something going on here.  "Who is this black woman that's now the president, we knew all the presidents of Kraft Foodservice."  So the guy who owns the company comes in, sits down and he is outright rude. Rude!  And he's not talking to me, in fact he has his back to me and he's talking to all of my, my, my co-workers and eventually we leave and we're going to his office for the business meeting.  When we get to his office he starts grilling me.  Where did I go to college?  Did I have a graduate degree?  Where did I get that degree from?  Am I married?  Where did my husband come from?  Where did he go to college?  Does he have a graduate degree?  What kind of work does he do?  Where do we live?  I mean all of these questions which were incredibly inappropriate for a business meeting, just, just not relevant and it became very clear to me that this man had a problem with me.  So we're in the car driving back to the airport and the region manager says, oh the district manager says, "Oh, you'll have to excuse So and So, he was having a bad day."  And I looked at him, I'm in the passenger seat and looked and I said, "Excuse me, you and I both know that if he was having a bad day it was because I was there, and I am black and female.  That was his bad day."  I said, "We will not sugarcoat this."  I said, "The man had a problem with me. I know it, you know it and they in the backseat know it."  I said, "Now all we want from him is for him to buy a million pounds of Maxwell House coffee, that's it.  Now, if my coming to visit him is going to stand in the way of that, I'll never come visit him again.  It's as simple as that, but I don't want you to act as if this was an issue he was just having bad day.  Let's be very clear on what the dynamics of that was." And I was livid so you know I was pleasant enough, I spoke to him like I spoke to you, but I remember getting to the airport and I remember waiting for the car to come pick me to take me home and I always called home and my daughter [Courtney Bass] answered and I said, "Mommy had a horrible day, this man was very mean to me," and she said, "Why?"  And I said, "Well because I'm black and because I'm a woman."  Goes--well she said, "Well that was rude."  I said, "Yes it was rude, and it was a terrible day but you know what we will get over this."  And I remember that. So this was in November, in January we had--I had--I'm having a staff meeting and one--a person I'm friendly with who had taken on the responsibility of diversity for the company was coming in to do a diversity presentation about how as senior leaders every division had--and the staffs--had to set an example, and she was giving examples about how people don't really understand slights that are being picked up by women and people of color.  So the vice president of sales, as Cheryl [ph.] is giving one of these examples, says, "You know, I, I understand that because we were down in Birmingham a few months ago, Paula [HistoryMaker Paula Ann Sneed] took me and Such and Such down, and when we got there we were supposed to have lunch in So and So's country club--at So and So's country club, but they don't serve blacks in the dining room of that country club, and so we couldn't go.  So at the last minute everybody had to shuffle around and so that we could get, find a restaurant that would serve us."  And so the guy goes and tells this story, now imagine.  I'm sitting there, I got my whole staff around me, twelve, twelve men. And the story was annoying, you know the situation had been annoying enough to me but I didn't even know about this thing about the country club not serving blacks, and, and he didn't obviously tell me at any point from the situation happening until and then he brings it up in this meeting, and I'm sitting and I--you know my friend looks at me, you know it was a diversity person and I said, "That's exactly the point that Cheryl is trying to make. That there things that happened that wouldn't have happened to any you that happen to people like me because of who we are.  It has nothing to do our competence, has nothing to do with our capability, it is all about the shell we were born in." And I said, "And that's what we have to change in this company so that we are allowing people to perform and are allowing them to achieve based on what they're willing to contribute and having nothing to do with arbitrary things like gender and skin color, et cetera."
Story_ID: 611581
Speaker 1: But you know as I think back and that, and these--stories like this, these affronts are, are things that just happen and my attitude is always, had always been and the reason why I stayed so long [at General Foods Corporation] in addition to liking the work was when you're in these environments you are trailblazers and a trailblazer puts up with all kinds of unknown and negative--unknown elements and negative elements. And what a trailblazer has to do is be resilient and resourceful.  If you went down a place and you couldn't get past--some of you had to go back, some of us have to figure out and build a boat. Whatever it was you had to do it and you couldn't let temporary setbacks or annoyances or frustrations get you down. And the people who really were successful you know they learned from all these things and they could laugh at them and they could get beyond them, and that was my orientation, that you know I'll never forget this situation in Birmingham [Alabama], and (laughter) I probably wouldn't laugh about it you know but I learned from it that all I wanted from that guy was the Max- the objective is the Maxwell House coffee, the objective was not to get him to like me 'cause that wasn't gonna happen.  The interesting thing was the guy in the car said, "Well you know Jimmy Lee [ph.] doesn't like blacks 'cause I've heard him say black stories, black jokes a lot and he doesn't like women in business at all 'cause his sister was trying to--," oh, I said the guy's name I should've of said that but, "his sister's in business and didn't--and he doesn't like his sister in business and," blah, blah, blah. So, the, the point though is that women in my generation and blacks in my generation were trailblazers and racism and sexism did exist and they were a fact of life, they were not an excuse for not succeeding, and so if you saw them as a fact of life you always were trying to be creative to get beyond it and that's a lot of the reason why I stayed and I am, and sometimes as I look back I'm happy for having some of those situations, because it, it informed me every day that this was not as easy as it might have seemed at that particular moment and it also informed me that if I could overcome it and I could do the kinds of things and I could achieve, that whether, whether anybody knew about it, I was having an impact that my parents [Furman Turner Sneed and Thomas Sneed] and my grandparents and other people could've had and probably deserved but didn't have access to, and so I was paying back some of the input that they had given or the hard work that they had been given and my achievements were really not a reflection necessarily of me but were a reflection of the kind of things that they wanted and could've done if they had been allowed to.

Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The highest rank was division president or general manager, the title was general manager, division president and the titles were EVPs [executive vice president].  In 1995 General Foods and Kraft [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.] were merged and the companies which had been run independently although owned by Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] were now brought together and there was a me- I was at that point running the meals division and there was a meals division at Kraft and so the guy who was running the meals division at Kraft became head of the meals division and many of the brands that I was running in New York [New York] were moved to Chicago [Illinois]. And so now the question was what job will I have?  Well I had just the year before when I had run the desserts division after two and a half years of really blowing beyond my objectives I had, had a bad year in desserts.  That's a whole separate story, and so my reward for having a bad year in desserts was being moved to meals, and I was not a happy person when that happened, and I wasn't happy because the plan that I didn't deliver in desserts was a plan that was not deliverable and I had argued with my boss for three months during the planning process not to, to have less objectives, more reasonable objectives, but it wasn't going to happen and he--I have a note he wrote me saying you know, "I'm happy you stepped up to this 'cause I know it's gonna be really difficult but you know," blah, blah, blah. And of course you know I didn't make the objectives, and I knew, I said to him, "If by February when we're doing the selling for Easter, we are not at this level, we are gonna be off by this number of units and this number of dollars, and the profitability is gonna be at risk and we would need to do X, Y, Z.  I need to have my money restored for spending," and of course it didn't happen.  So we didn't make the plan and so it was a terrible year and I was in essence not demoted per se, but I was moved to a smaller division.  So and for all intents and purposes it was a demotion.  Money stayed the same, position stayed the same but status wise it was a demotion, and so when they merged the two companies and Kraft and General Foods came together--since I was running this meals division and they were now gonna move the products out to Chicago, the question was what should I, you know what's gonna happen with Paula [HistoryMaker Paula Ann Sneed]?
Story_ID: 611583
Speaker 1: Well, if you looked at all my rank- my ratings, I'd always gotten exceeds ratings, so they aren't gonna fire me, but what am I gonna do?  So they offered me a job to go, move to Chicago [Illinois] to run something called marketing services.  There were twenty-seven different functions across Kraft [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.], General Foods [General Foods Corporation] and Oscar Mayer [Oscar Mayer Company] and they were trying to merge all these functions, these marketing functions into, into one unit and I was gonna--supposed to go in and do that and then elevate the level of performance of this new unit, radically beyond where the group was before.  Now I have a decision to make. One, I don't want that job because you know I had been a general manager, I don't want to go run the marketing functions, no.  Secondly I don't want to move to Chicago, my husband [Lawrence Bass] has a consulting firm in, in New Jersey, our daughter [Courtney Bass] is in the eighth grade, I'm happy where we live and I don't wanna move. And I particularly don't want to move my black female child to the North Shore of Chicago.  I don't know anything about the North Shore of Chicago, all I, all I had heard was that there were really wealthy white people, not very diverse communities and I didn't want to live there.  So I went to the fellow who had offered me the job who I had known for years and I said, "You know look, I wanna commute, I don't wanna move.  I'm gonna commute, I will go out on Monday, I will come back on Friday," 'cause my thought was I'll do this job for two years, they'll move me back to New York. And I just said, "Give--instead of relocating me, give me my money in relocation, give me in commuting."  Now, why did I do that?  Because I was about forty-six, forty-seven I should've you know--a lot of people would've just left, just packed their bags, you know--ego.  I'm better than that, first of all I should've been moved out of desserts.  Second of all I don't wanna go to Chicago. Here's why I didn't go, here's why I didn't leave. Number one, first and foremost there were family considerations.  I was there eighteen years at that point.  At year twenty you're vested in the retirement plan and the retirement is, was very lucrative and you have retiring medical for life for you and your spouse.  Now you do the discounted cash flows and that's a ton of money, just that element all alone.  Secondly, the retirement plan if you leave before you're twenty, before twenty years, when you get fifty-five and you wanna take your money out, you could only get something like 60 percent of your full benefit, but if you're there twenty years and you retire at fifty-five you get, you get something like 90 percent 'cause full retirement is sixty-two but you could take your money out early. You know, 90 percent, 60 percent--hello!  I figured I have to stay here two years because it would be silly to let my ego stand in the way of something that could make a difference for my husband and I, longer term. Secondly, there was a big stock option tranche that I had been given and it was gonna mature about year twenty and a half, and at the same time that stock option matured was going to be a big, the three year bonus, the multiple year bonus, it was gonna pay out.  So I just added up all the money and to walk out at year eighteen verses to stay two years, two and a half more years, the money was too good to walk away from, and I began--and I realized and I remember sitting there at the dining room, sitting at the kitchen table you know crying about what had happened you know 'cause I thought it was unfair and it was unfair, but I thought you know I can't let my ego stand in the way of something that makes me sense for me and my family. And I just decided I'm gonna put a smile on my face, I'm gonna hold my head up.  People are gonna say, "Oh Sneed's [HistoryMaker Paula Ann Sneed] gonna leave, she's not gonna put up with this B.S., she's gonna be mad," and I'm saying people are gonna think that this is the job I begged for, that I wanted this job that it--you know and like--so would--people--I'd--people would say, "Oh, people said you're leaving your papers on the street."  I'm like, "Really? I love this job."  And I said it not in a way that people would say, "Oh yeah right."  I said it in a way like, "She really looks like she loves this job and boy she's like moving and shaking over there, she's like reorganizing and setting up new programs and doing this and that."  And I thought like you know I'll keep myself interested for two years and then as soon as I get that bonus, I'm outta here.
Story_ID: 611584
Speaker 1: Now when I started in Chicago [Illinois] that first January, 'cause it happened all over the Christmas break, my boss came down and he said, "Well I put you in for one bonus but someone at Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] might like you 'cause they increased your bonus by about X percent," and it was a sizeable increase. And the people at Philip Morris knew I got screwed, basically, and they were you they were quote, unquote (gesture) making it up in the short term with some money, but you know I was still I was pretty hurt, but I stayed for those two years and during those two years I really did like the job, I loved it.  And then a lot of things changed.  I got the--my restricted stock tranche paid out.  I got the--my long term bonus, I was having a good time and I realized now I'm staying 'cause I wanna stay.  You know I don't have to stay anymore 'cause you know I could leave any time, but I enjoyed the work.  And after that I became the chief marketing officer for the company.  I became--that--I set up and ran the e-commerce division, I then was the group vice president running e-commerce and marketing services.  I then became global head of marketing resources so I got about four promotions after that point at year eighteen.  And my counsel a lot of times to younger people is, don't let your ego stand in the way of your, of your best interest.  And so many times particularly young people who've been successful and who've got track record that says I'm really good, the first affront that happens to them, they're willing to pull up and, and like walk away without doing the kind of really objective assessment of what is it I'm walking away from, and I'm not sure what would've happened.  I could've left at year eighteen and left the money on the table as it respec- with respect to retirement but as I look at just the incremental benefit that accrued having not done that, for me it was a wise decision and once my daughter [Courtney Bass] said something in just in passing, and she said, "You know, mom, I'm proud of you."  She said, "I'm proud for the things you did and accomplishments but I'm also proud that there were times that you, you know sucked it up and did what you had to do and didn't, didn't just walk--just didn't walk away in a huff."  Because you know, if you know--you've, you've been around me now for a little bit you know you--I got emotional, I got--and I could walk away in a huff and you know, but a couple of times early on in my career when I was really mad at a boss or something I'd go, "I'm gonna leave."  And Lawrence [Lawrence Bass] would say, "Leave. You can leave.  You don't have to stay, you can leave," and then he'd say, "But you know Paula [HistoryMaker Paula Ann Sneed] if you left you might feel like they got the best of you."  Then I was like damn they're not gonna get the best of me, you know.  That ain't gonna happen, I am not gonna let that happen (laughter), I'm not gonna.
Story_ID: 611585
Speaker 1: And so I--sometimes people say, "Are there choices you would've made differently?" And I don't know, I don't think so. You know, I don't think I would've made choices differently and in very many aspects. Maybe the one choice I would've made differently was when I came out of college [Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts] and was working the first years I lost eighty pounds, I got really thin, and I kept that weight off for a long time, and then after that after I got married and had a baby I never was able to get it off and if I could do it differently maybe I would've exercised and ate better my whole life, you know that would've been something I would've done differently but other than that from a career standpoint probably not.
Speaker 2: That is one of our questions and now I don't have to ask it.
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 2: But--
Story_ID: 611586
Speaker 1: But, tell us now when you look back at everything you've done to this point--now you retired in t- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In '07 [2007] officially [from General Foods Corporation].
Speaker 1: 'O-seven [2007] okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right and it was just a good time to retire, was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, and you know I had--one of the things that happened to me at one point when I was working in the consumer affairs department or right before I had that job I was on a plane and I was reading Fortune magazine about the number of women on boards of directors. And I was surprised at how few there were and I don't know why I was surprised.  I hadn't really thought a lot about being on company boards. But when I saw that, I thought and at that point there were only about like 9 or 10 percent of maybe it was 11 percent of board spots were held by women, and the board spots held by women of color was point and then a bunch of zeros and then a number, and then I thought, oh my goodness, why is that?  Well of course you knew, I knew why, but I thought that's a goal.  So I remember I was sitting, I think we were going to Disney and I said to Lawrence [Sneed's husband, Lawrence Bass], "Look at this, read this article," and I said, "That's something I'm gonna shoot for," and he said, "Go for it."  And then once you say something like that then you say, "Well, how do I do that?" You know, I'm sitting here thinking that's a goal I want, and there's, there is the goal out there.  I have no clue the distance, how to get from here to there.  Then I began to actively think about it and I thought well I guess the way to get there is be like these women, and all of these women had one of or two things in common.  They either inherited the business or they were family members and they were on the board and that wasn't gonna happen for me.  The others were women who had high positions in the company and at that point I was like a director, a category director.  So I thought well in order for me to get on a board I'd better get to be something better than this.  Sure enough as soon as I got to be a vice president in food service, not in the consumer affairs department (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Consumer, yeah.
Speaker 2: --but in food service the phone rang.  I was there like a week and--or two--and I remember the woman called and said, "You know I'd like to talk to you about a corporate board," and I thought, you know I said, "I'm very flattered but I have to do my job right now." That position, that food service position was really tough because here's what happened.  All the women were saying "Don't let us down," you know 'cause now I'm running a, the first women to run a division and all the blacks they gave me a big party to celebrate this and you know basically it's, "Don't let us down," and so I felt like the average white guy going in.  Just had the job to do, I had the job to do but I also had this burden that I couldn't let myself down, I couldn't let my parents [Furman Turner Sneed and Thomas Sneed] down, I couldn't let anybody down.  I remember I use to--went in and I didn't know the food service business, I use to study--I was studying.  I remember coming home one night--Friday night we would always have dinner together as a family 'cause a lot of times during the week we couldn't.  I remember my daughter [Courtney Bass] saying to me, her and my husband were laughing and they would say, "Mommy's sleeping at the table," and I was literally eating pizza and falling asleep I was so tired. And I remember laughing at work one day saying, "be careful what you ask for because you might get it."  Because here I had this job and it was really hard and I had to demonstrate in a very short time that I was down the learning curve, understood the food service business, the distributing, the distribution, models, understood all the different businesses that we had to sell in and so when this woman called me and asked me do I wanna be on a board it's like, please, I gotta mange this business, no.  So for the first couple of years I got phone calls and I didn't even respond to them because I felt like I had to manage this business.  Finally a company called me and they asked me to be on the board and I was interested but I couldn't do it because my parents had gotten sick and I was trying to be a wife, a mother, a business person and a daughter to these two parents who were sick in Boston [Massachusetts], and so I put it off but in '94 [1994] or--yeah, I guess it was '94 [1994] I joined my first board.  And that experience opened my eyes to a different kind of corporate environment.  You know the environment of the board room, and so now here I am working in a company at a senior executive level but seeing how senior executives are viewed and seeing the decisions from a different level, which was fabulous because it gave me insights into the kinds of things I needed to do as an employee. But having that first board experience got me several other--got me entree into another board experience because one of the people on my first board was the CEO of a company, he invited me to be on his board and from there I was tapped to be on a third board.  So I was first on the Hercules company [Hercules, Inc.] board then I moved to Airgas, Inc., and then I was invited to be on the Schwab- the Charles Schwab [Charles Schwab Corporation] board and now I'm on Tyco Electronics [TE Connectivity Ltd.].  I am no longer on Hercules.  But even though I'm retired from day to day work, having these board experiences still keep me engaged and involved in business and ultimately I'm gonna go back to some kind of business environment again.  I've loved the opportunity over the last year to be sort of quote, on sabbatical.  I, I see it more as a sabbatical than a retirement, but you know at some point I feel like I'm not doing enough.  I'm involved in my boards, I, I'm really involved in some not for profit work, but I need to do a little bit more.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The good thing is that having made the right decision at year eighteen I don't have to work if I don't want to now, you know.  And so that's, you know there's a cause and an effect.  So I'm, I'm happy that I have that independence but I feel like at sixty I've got a lot of energy and a lot of opportunity still ahead of me.
Story_ID: 611587
Speaker 1: Jamison Bass [Courtney Bass] and Lawrence Paul Bass [Lawrence Bass] taken when she was probably weeks old, maybe no more than six or seven weeks old and she could fit right on my husband's arm between his elbow and his hand, and at that point we use to call her Doodle, and we call this the Daddy and Doodle picture. And unfortunately I cut his head off when I took it but you know it's still a fabulous shot.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay ready?
Speaker 1: This is Lawrence and my wedding picture.  We were married September 2, 1978 at Memorial Church [Memorial Church] at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and it was supposed to be a hurricane that day but the hurricane didn't show up which is probably why we're, we're so happy and smiling, in addition to the fact that we were madly in love.
Speaker 2: Lawrence and I have had the good fortune to travel a great deal and this particular picture was taken on a cruise that we took and it was probably one of the first cruises we took as empty nesters, so that was always nice (laughter) that we were traveling by ourselves.
Story_ID: 611588
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Breaking barriers in Corporate America, retaining my strong sense of self that I had as a young kid growing up outside of Boston [Massachusetts] and not forgetting who I was, where I came from and what got me to where I am, and then a big part of my legacy will be helping other young people of color succeed in their chosen fields of interest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I feel strongly about that, I put my money where my intentions are and spend a lot of time counseling, mentoring, giving feedback. I spend a lot of time doing that.  I did when I was, when I was working.
Story_ID: 611589
Speaker 1: I would always accept you know an opportunity to speak to--you know, I, I--if it was junior high school kids or if it was five kids or five hundred kids, you know I, it wasn't a number, it wasn't I will only take certain assignments.  I feel like people, I didn't even know at times influenced my life in a major way and if people only remembered one thing about me, I would want them to remember that I helped other young women achieve.  The fact that I achieved you know, oh well.  That just put me in a position to help other people achieve, so the, the kernel ought to be, wow, she really made a difference in helping other people achieve in a variety of ways.
Story_ID: 611590
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My hopes would be that every African American child would have access to an excellent education so that they can achieve their full potential. And I worry a lot about the fact that the educational system in this country today is not equal and I'm involved in something called Teach for America, I'm on the board there, because I feel so passionately about this and I see evidence of the lack of equity all the time, and African Americans as a group of people will not achieve if the young members of our race don't have access to great educational opportunities.  I would also hope that we would gain back some of the sense of solidarity that we had--that I saw we had during the '60s [1960s], during the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s].  Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] once gave a speech about twenty years ago that I'll never forget, or components of. And he talked about the fact that in Harlem [New York, New York] at that point it was very different that when he grew up in Harlem and he said at a given point and time there was every economic level within the African American community visible in Harlem, but through some of the benefits of the civil rights era were some of the negatives for our predominately black communities and so what existed in Harlem at that point were relatively few economic levels, and so if you're a little poor kid in Harlem in the '40s [1940s] maybe, you saw a dentist and you thought I could be that but if you were a poor kid in Harlem in the '90s [1990s] what you might've seen were primarily people making money in different ways that weren't as admirable, and so his whole notion of the fact that our communities were lacking role models because of where we now lived and people not being visible and people who, who had moved out never coming back.  Those were issues that really frighten me and I would hope that we, whether we are millionaires or billionaires, or whether we you know are people who are really struggling financially, would understand that we have a common past and will probably have a common destiny.  I'm absolutely enthusiastic and thrilled and energized by Barack Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] campaign and am an avid supporter and I'm hoping that some of the solidarity that we're now seeing as people mobilize around his campaign will translate beyond that into something very powerful.  My--I guess that's the answer to the question.  Those are my hopes and my aspirations.
Story_ID: 611591
Speaker 1: I'm tempted to ask this, I, can't--I'll--
Speaker 2: Ask me.
Speaker 1: When you look at Barack Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] campaign right now, I mean is--are they branding him properly or do you think--I mean it's successful, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but you see how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it's very interesting. Because it--they--and I actually e-mailed a bunch of my friends today and the, the conservatives are now coming out, there an op-ed about him in The Times [The New York Times] today or maybe it was yesterday that was just really bad. And then beginning with Michelle [Michelle Obama] and I hope that the handlers and the branders of them will be--will work aggressively to be able to, to ensure that the aspects of his brand come through consistently and that they can--that his benefits and his attributes really outshine competition both with Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] and ultimately with McCain [John McCain] and it's a challenge, it is a huge challenge.  I'm hopefully going to be elected to the board of the American Marketing Association and we're gonna have a big meeting next January when--the--I'm on the planning committee for this big meeting and we were talking about wouldn't it be interesting to have some of the people who manage these, develop these and manage these brands of these candidates to come and do the Monday morning quarterbacking, and it's, it's a concern and unless you get on it and you only have to look at history to understand how to successfully do it and how not to do it, but I look at the Clintons and they've in the past done reasonably well.  I'm hoping that Barack's people are as talented as some of Clinton's people were in his early days.
Story_ID: 611592
Speaker 1: Have you ever met Donna Brazile or David Axelrod or those--?
Speaker 2: You know I did meet Donna Brazile at a, at a conference once and she is a role model of mine.  See I'm a big proponent of role models.  I always have a role, I always have people that I admire that I wanna be like when I grow up and a lot of them are a lot younger than me, you know I say, "I'm gonna be that person when I grow up." I always throw--because I look at people and I study their characteristics and their traits and I can find things that I think I would be better if I emulated. And I met Donna Brazile and she was very reflective and she talked about--I met her right after the last campaign, and she talked about you know what had happened and she's just smart and savvy and I also watch her on TV now.  I watch CNN all the time and every time she comes on I say, "Man, she's beautiful, I want her make-up artist," you know, I mean she's just got it all together, she really does. And I, I am really proud to see so many people across so many different segments of population.
Story_ID: 611593
Speaker 1: If you ask what I'm happy about that is what I'm happy about, things that wouldn't have existed when I was a kid that my kid can see and, and, and presume is natural, but I do think we still have to help our young African American children understand that there is still racism and then there is still sexism and so many young people today 'cause they didn't grow up in the quote, unquote struggle--middle--they don't understand racism and they don't understand sexism and when they get into environments where, when they get into environments beyond school, 'cause school you earn an A,  they'll give you an A don't care.  Even if they grade on a curve if you earn an A you'll get it. But in the corporate it's not fair.  It is not, or in law, law firms or in a lot of these places it isn't fair.  It is all about power, money and people not wanting to share.  They didn't that message in kindergarten, so you know if people think that you know, "I went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge Massachusetts] and I went here and I did that, you know and it's not gonna about racism for me.  I'm better than the other blacks.  Your generation was a little stupider than mine." You know, hello?  Not true, wake up.
Story_ID: 611594
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family now, you, you've been married about thirty years now and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It will be thirty years September 2nd.
Speaker 1: --tell us how you met your husband [Lawrence Bass] and what your marriage has been like?
Speaker 2: I met my husband when I was a second year student at Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts].  He was finishing a master's degree at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I was at Logan Airport [General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport, Boston, Massachusetts] going to take a flight, and as I was coming into the airport I saw this African American guy dressed in a three piece suit, cute and I thought hm, not bad. And I went through security and in those days it wasn't a big deal, it was 1977. And when I got to the gate and sat down I was reading a case 'cause I was going to interview at Quaker [Quaker Oats Company] and I had cases of course to do when I got back to school, and I look up and there's that black guy who was in the you know front lobby and he's now in the same terminal area as me.  And then all of a sudden I look up and he's standing in front of me and he said, "Hi, may I--is that seat next to you taken?"  And I said, "No," and then this is where the story separates.  I said--he said, "May I sit there?"  And I said I said, "Sure."  He said I said, "Free country."  Now, my friends go, "See you know you said, 'free country,'" but (laughter) I think I said, "Sure," so he said--but what I noticed about him was he had an MIT ring on and I knew the MIT ring and I thought oh, not stupid.  This is good, cute and not stupid.  So he sits down and you know he starts talking to me and we got on the plane and he's sitting right next to me, and it's this big plane that has two seats, three, four seats and two seats.  I said how did this happen that this guy is sitting next to me?  Well in those days they use to take a little tab and put it on your boarding pass and he saw where he was sitting and traded down from first class to sit next to me.  So we're on the plane and he's such a nice guy and I couldn't figure out how old he was.  He had grayish hair, he was graying and I thought like how old is this guy and he was at MIT and he tells me he's from Paducah, Kentucky and he's talking about a Sunday school convention, he's talking about his family and he's like a really nice guy and I thought, "Gee he's really nice," and then he tells me how old he is and at that point I was twenty-eight or twenty--I guess I was--it was '77 [1977] so I was gonna be thirty that year, so I was twenty-nine and he told me he was like twenty--gonna be twenty-five that May and I'm like (makes sound), this is not a guy for me, he is too young. And I thought--so I get off the plane.  I give him my number, he carries my bag and I call my friend and I say, "I met such a nice guy for your sister," 'cause my friend who had been in the study group at Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], sister was at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  I said, "This guy's perfect for Debbie [ph.], he's really nice, he's sweet, she'd like him.  He's smart," so I said he's gonna call me and when he calls me I'll invite him over and I'll invite you and Debbie over and we can introduce them.  So he never called me, he never called me. And I was stunned that he never called me and I had one of these phone forwarder things 'cause they had just come out and I use to forward my phone to my uncle's.
Story_ID: 611595
Speaker 1: And he never called. So it was February--at least I thought it was February when I met him and in June I'm walking into my uncle's building and out of the next building comes these two black guys, and one of them goes "Hey, aren't you Paula Sneed [HistoryMaker Paula Ann Sneed]?"  And I'm like, "Yeah."  He said, "Don't you remember me, I'm Lawrence Bass, I met you on that plane going to Chicago [Illinois]."  I go like, "Yeah, you're the guy that never called me."  He goes, "Oh, I was writing my thesis, I was busy, I was travelling you know, I just couldn't, didn't have time to call you 'cause I knew I was away every weekend and if I called you I couldn't take you out."  I'm like yeah, yeah, he goes, "No, I'm gonna call you tonight."  I'm like, "Okay." And he said, "Here's your number," and he spouted my number off.  Now, I was stunned and he said, "I'm gonna call you tonight," and he did and he took me out to dinner, it was a very nice dinner but I was moving to New York [New York] within a couple of weeks.  So I moved to New York and he was calling me and then he came down to see me over the summer and by the end of the summer we were engaged, but he was moving to Detroit [Michigan] and I was moving to New York.  I was already living in New York and so we got married in September 2, 1978 and he was still working in Detroit and I was working in White Plains [New York]. But before we got married we did this little plan, this little--what are we gonna--how are gonna manage two careers and, and we wanna buy a house and we wanna get, have a child and we have thirty thousand dollars of school debt and, you know we used that year of engagement, when we were engaged and living apart.  We talked all the time and we just really got to know each other and really talked about things that were important and our values and there was a lot I really liked about him in the beginning.  His parents like mine [Furman Turner Sneed and Thomas Sneed] had been married a long time.  Both of our parents were able to cele- well mine celebrated a fifty year anniversary.  My husband's father died right before their fiftieth. But he was really close with his family.  There was just elements of him, his background that were close to mine, although in the beginning his parents didn't like me 'cause I was this northern girl who was mouthy and you know had opinions and (laughter).  They use to call on Sunday morning, "What did I cook?"  It was like, "Nothing."  "Well, what are you gonna cook?"  "I don't know--we maybe we'll go out."  "Boy, you reckon that wife ought to cook?" You know (laughter), I was like--his father was really feisty with me in the beginning, but we have one daughter [Courtney Bass] who is now twenty-seven and we're really proud of her.  She graduated from Exeter boarding school [Phillips Exeter Academy, Exeter, New Hampshire] and then graduated from Harvard College [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and wrote a magna cum laude thesis on the role of students in the end of apartheid in South Africa.  She's an African--history major with an African concentration, and then she taught for two years for Teach for America and now she lives in Beijing [China].

Speaker 1: And Lawrence [Lawrence Bass] when we first got married was working at Bendix [Bendix Corporation] and then he--we lived apart that first you know year or so and then he moved and took a job working for RCA [RCA Corporation], but when he--when we first got married literally we were driving back from Boston [Massachusetts] where we got married to where I was living in New York and he said, "You know I think I wanna quit my job and start my own company."  (Laughter) I was like, "Excuse me, we just got married, you wanna quit your job and you know like what is this?" And he said, "No, I just really want to work for anybody, I want my own company," and I was thinking, uh-oh, this is a problem.  And he goes, "Why don't we--," and I thought 'cause what could be better than someone paying every two weeks, you know?  That was my orientation, my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] worked all the time while I was growing up.  She worked in city hall, at city hall [Malden City Hall, Malden, Massachsuetts].  My dad [Thomas Sneed] worked. I was like, "What's wrong with this picture?"  And the agreement he and I had was if he could make as much money and on his own that he could in a company then, "Fine, go for it."  And I didn't understand his dream, you know wanting to own his own company.  He didn't understand mine wanting to work for people and go to endless meetings and you know play politics and all that.  He just didn't have the patience for it, but we both loved each other enough to know that we could support each other's dreams, and so many times in my career he was just the major difference between my success and failure.  One time I was working on a project for months and the day I had to make the big presentation to the CEO.  I woke up and I was sick as a dog, and I couldn't go to work. I said, "I can't go to work." And he said, "But you've been working on this for months.  You've been staying up half the night.  You've been writing this dec--," 'cause in those days there was no PCs [personal computers], you wrote everything long hand and he said, "You've gotta be crazy, you have to go present," and he called, he had called his client and he said, "I can't come this morning, I'll come tomorrow," blah, blah, blah.  He said, "Take a shower, get your clothes on," you know.  "I'm gonna go warm up the car and I'm gonna drive you to work." And we live thirty miles from where I worked and there was the Tappan Zee Bridge, and so he drove me in.  I got out of the car, I was so sick. I went and I presented.  He waited for me and my boss knew I was sick, she looked--took one look at me and she said, "You're sick aren't you?"  I'm like, "I'm dying."  She said--but I got my money maybe it was a sympathy vote, but I made my presentation and this big project got funded and I got in the car and drove home and I remember that as--he drove me home.  I just remember that it was, you know this is so important to you and you've worked so hard.  You're not gonna like get off the field at the last minute, you know, it's silly. And whether it was that or just being a sounding board he made such a difference in my life that I, I say to people, "Keep the right kinds of people around you," and the most important right kind of person is the person you are married to or are in a relationship with, and that person has to care enough about you that they are supportive and that they also give you a kick in the pants when you're wrong you know and, and just really help you gain perspective and I've been blessed with that and this last year we've spent more time together this last year than we spent in the whole twenty-nine years of our marriage, and people always said things like, "Oh my god, you'll probably be divorced at the end," but we still laugh, we still have a good time you know. I don't like the fact that he doesn't put the dishes in the sink, dishwasher.  He leaves them in the sink, I never even noticed it before you know but now I notice it 'cause I'm home, but hey, if, if in every relationship people just spend time on the plus side of the column, all relationships would work, but most times people think about the negative sides and they think about the picky little things that you know in the scheme of the world really don't count and I was determined.  My mother [Furman Turner Sneed] taught me that, I watched--she and my father [Thomas Sneed] always kissed every time he came, every time one of them came home.  They, they kept that lit- they kept that spark in their marriage and I just realized you know what that's an important spark.  You gotta every day tell the person you love them, every day.  Well, yeah some things may piss you off but that's what--that's life.  You know everything doesn't happen the way you want it to and so we've been able to keep this relationship good and happy.  They say if you can build a house together which we did, you can stay together forever so I guess, I guess it's (laughter), it's 'til death do us part.
Speaker 2: That's wonderful, that's something you really can't--it's hard to achieve that so that's really--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is, I think it is.

Speaker 1: Were your parents, were they around to see you become successful in business and?
Speaker 2: They were. My, my dad [Thomas Sneed] passed away in '94 [1994] and so I was already in--running desserts division [at General Foods Corporation], and my mother [Furman Turner Sneed] lived until 2002 and so they were able to see.  I got a, I got an honorary degree and they, they both came to, to that and they were able to appreciate that. And my mother was always just very proud of the things that I've able to do as was my mother-in-law.  My mother-in-law was--she bragged more than mother.  I mean my mother would you know--but my mother-in-law she was like, "My daughter-in-law--," which was a real movement from them because they couldn't even imagine me working.  You know, my mother-in-law's attitude was you have a child [Courtney Bass], you gotta stay home and take care of it, you know.  So I use to always say to my mother-in-law, "You've raised a great husband for me."  She was like, she was very, I was very close with my mother-in-law and Lawrence [Lawrence Bass] is, was very close with my parents.  I think my father felt like, thank god I got another guy in here.  These two talkative women you know and my father-in-law and to used really get along well and Lawrence I'm sure is looking for my daughter to bring home somebody that he can relate to.

Speaker 1: One remarkable aspect of being here is that you know you have a beautiful home, large home.
Speaker 2: Well thank you.
Speaker 1: And it's filled with--you know often it's said that people when they get into, go into Corporate America they lose their identity and that sort of thing but you know this home is filled with beautiful African American art, African art pieces that are bigger than I am. You know is there--how did you develop a passion for the arts like this?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't really have a lot of time to study art and to do that kind of thing, but I wanted an environment that reflected who I am and my past and so we were very fortunate to be able to find an art dealer who had a lot of these African American arti- African artifacts that we were able to buy as this person was going out of business and we were thrilled about that. But when we went to South Africa we were able to pick up some things that were, that we just fell in love with.  Like I didn't really know a lot about Shona sculpture, but when I walked into this gallery in South Africa and saw these pieces I was, I just didn't wanna leave without buying the pieces I bought, and we probably bought more on--in that store.  It was 9/11/2001 [September 11, 2001].  We walked into the store in South Africa before and it was given the time change and stuff didn't happen and we bought this stuff and is said to Lawrence [Sneed's husband, Lawrence Bass] as we were leaving, I said, "My goodness we've probably spent more money than we spent on the whole trip," 'cause I'm a good trip shopper you know.  I always--but I just loved the pieces and they made me happy and they made me smile and I just feel like the things I have in my family room and the things I have around the house, and we have a place up in Boston [Massachusetts] and the things we have up there of a fabulous Paul Goodnight picture that I walked into and it was something about marketing, it was called 'Marketing' [sic. 'Mass Marketing'] and it showed all these wonderful African American women like at a marketplace and I just felt, you know what that's me, I'm a part of that.  And my first VP [vice president] job General Foods [General Foods Corporation] they gave us a budget, we could you know decorate our office and the budget was huge and I spent a bunch of money on getting some African artifacts to put in my office and some pictures to put in my office because I wanted people to walk in and see this is who I am and this--I'm proud of this, and one of the pictures is actually hanging at the top of the stairs and then you know I had some, some covering, some beaded coverings.  I don't know if you saw those in the back hall but I had some of those and they were some beautiful, beautiful pieces and they made me smile, they made me happy you know and I just felt like when people walk in, they'll see that this person here may be a business person, and may have an academic credential that suggests one thing but when they look around this space what they will see is that this person is reflecting what they are about in a real substantial way and you know.
Speaker 1: Well my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 611599
Speaker 1: Well my last formal question I think you've already answered but I'll ask, I'll ask it again just in case so there's further reflection.  Ma'am how would like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As someone who helps other people grow and develop.
Speaker 1: That's the same exact same way you answered it before (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Oh, you're very welcome, thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a wonderful opportunity to be able to tell my story, hope it helps somebody.
Speaker 1: Oh, I think it will.
Speaker 2: Great, thank you.

Speaker 1: This is my mother Furman Mary Sneed [Furman Turner Sneed], this is her high school [Everett High School, Everett, Massachusetts] graduation photograph, it was in her yearbook and it was--this particular photo was a gift to my father.
Speaker 2: That is my father, Thomas Edwin Sneed [Thomas Sneed]. It was his graduation picture and he gave this picture to my mother.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay ready.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother Mary Sneed and Tommy Sn- my father Tommy Sneed and it was probably taken about 1970 and they probably were at some event for the Massachusetts Association of Credit Unions [Massachusetts Credit Union League; Cooperative Credit Union Association].  My mother was the president of the City of Malden [Massachusetts] credit union [Malden Federal Credit Union] and every year there was some event that my parents would go to.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of Courtney Jamison Bass [Courtney Bass] at about, my daughter, at about five or six months old taken with her christening dress on that my mother made.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of Courtney Jamison Bass at about two year--about a year and a half about two years old and she's holding an apple.  I love this picture because there's a picture of me at a comparable age holding a toy that was taken in a photo studio.  So we would always display these two picture together, the picture of Courtney and the picture of me.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Next one please.
Speaker 2: My mother and father, Tommy Sneed and Mary Sneed, taken in about 1985 or 1986.  You'll notice that my mother had an Afro and my father who had been sick was a lot thinner than he had been historically.
Speaker 1: Maternal grandmother, Hattie Feimster Turner.  It was taken around the time she was eighteen.  Because I have a picture of my grandmother, Hattie Feamster, my mother, Mary Sneed, myself and my daughter taken at the same time, I typically show all four of those pictures together.
Speaker 2: And William Bass [ph.], my husband, Lawrence Bass' parents.  The picture was taken probably in about 1985.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Douglas Isaacs [ph.] and his wife Flossie Isaacs [ph.], they are my godparents, or were my godparents. The picture was probably taken about 1975 or '76 [1976] and they were my parent's best friends.  We shared Thanksgiving dinner together every year and have for the last sixty years even though the parents have passed away.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (unclear).
Speaker 2: This is my high school [Malden High School, Malden, Massachusetts] graduation picture, it was taken in 1965.  I have a little pin on my collar, it was from the Latin Honor Society that I was involved in called, or English Honor Society called Convenaminus Odd Metatundum [ph.].
Speaker 1: This is a picture of Courtney Jamison Bass taken at her, probably around her eighteenth birthday and because we, we have four generations I typically show this picture with my high school picture and my mother's and my grandmother's, material grandmother.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 1: The first picture was--this picture was taken when I was about a year, about two years old.  I know from the shoes I had on. And I'm holding a little bunny that my mother said was one of my favorite toys that she bought to the picture shoot.
Speaker 2: This picture was taken when I was in kindergarten at the Hilltop Nursery School [Malden, Massachusetts] and I remember that green and blue and yellow plaid dress, I loved that dress.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 2: My daughter, Courtney Jamison Bass, now lives in Beijing, China where she's been since 2005. So she's been there now almost three years.  She went to Shidu, China where there is a panda reserve and had her picture taken with the panda and I just loved the, this, the smile and just the doing something different and daring.
Speaker 1: When I retired from Kraft [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.] they did a little carton drawing that reflected who I am and my experiences at Kraft.  So you'll see the picture of General Foods [General Foods Corporation] where I started my career, the picture of the Statute of Liberty because I was based in New York [New York].  They have my educational credentials at the top, a seal of Simmons [Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts] and a seal of Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], some of the brands I worked on, Shake 'N Bake.  I was very involved in the start-up of something called Food and Family [Food and Family Magazine] which is a magazine sent to about twelve million households in the U.S. and another three million in Canada and of the on-line activities at Kraft called KraftFoods.com so they put those there.  I always wore scarves, you can see all the jewelry, 'cause I typically have tons of jewelry. I love photography, so that's reflected.  I'm a die-hard Democrat, so they put that on there 'cause although politics doesn't belong in the workforce I managed to find a way. And then on the top of the desk you'll see something called La Mer, which is this face cream. It's pretty pricey but I've always, I've used it for the last fifteen years and I don't have a lot of wrinkles so all the joke was that it was the magic potion that kept me looking young, either--
