Speaker 2: It is what it is.
Story_ID: 57096
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's [Bobbie Vance Poussaint] side of the family and your father's side separately, and then we're gonna put, put 'em together.  So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Bobbie, B as in boy, O-B-B-I-E, Vance, V as in Victor A-N-C-E, Poussaint.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was June 8th, 1925.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And place of birth was--I believe it was Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and wha--what were the stories?
Speaker 2: We can go back at least a couple of generations.  My mother's parents were settled in a town called Humboldt, Tennessee, H-U-M-B-O-L-D-T, Humboldt, Tennessee.  It--Her father's name was Willis Vance, and he was a Baptist minister.  And my grandmother's name is escaping me right now, but I'll come back to it.  She was a, a pharmacist, and both of them had graduated from college.  And she eventually owned her own pharmacy in Humboldt.  What else?
Speaker 1: Now that's significant.  I don't think there were many female pharmacists in those days.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She was very unusual, very unusual.  She, she--
Speaker 1: When--
Speaker 2: Her, her family name was Maclin, M-A-C-L-I-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Gustava (ph.); that was her first name, Gustava, Gustava Maclin, and she came from a large family.  I believe there were seven or eight children.  And at least one of her brothers became a very successful doctor in Birmingham, Alabama.  She had another--She had a sister who became a teacher.  They were all very accomplished.
Story_ID: 57097
Speaker 1: Now, now do you know where your grandfather [Willis Vance] and grandmother [Gustava Maclin Vance] went to college?
Speaker 2: Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].   At least that was my grandmother.  My grandfather is--escapes me.
Speaker 1: Okay, do, do you know if they met in Nashville [Tennessee], or if they--
Speaker 2: No, they did not meet in Nashville.  As a matter of fact, it's my understanding that it was a sort of arranged marriage.  My grandfather was a widower with a small boy.  And he was looking for a wife.  And my grandmother's family was concerned that she was getting older and wasn't interested in marriage; she was more interested in her studies and her pharmacy--her hopes to, to own her own pharmacy.  And somehow the connection was made, and she was basically--shall we say strongly encouraged to marry my grandfather.  And, according to my mother, she lasted about two days, and then she got back on the train and went back home because she didn't want to be married.  And her parents sent her back again, and so she became the wife of Reverend Vance.
Speaker 1: That's interesting that her parents could send her back.  Now she's grown apparently.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yep.
Speaker 1: Finished college.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And had her own business and her parents sent her back.
Speaker 2: Sent her back, yes.  I think, you know, they were concerned about the family and the family name and how embarrassing it was that, you know, she would desert her husband--and so quickly (laughter), particularly when he hadn't apparently done anything in particular.  She just didn't wanna be married.  So she was a very strong-willed woman, very talented.  She wrote; she--unfortunately we don't have any remaining examples of her writing, but she apparently liked to write fiction.  She was also very handy with a gun.  They lived on a farm, so she was very handy as far as running the farm and killing the chickens and all the things that you have to do when you run a farm.  She was also very independent, in terms of her religion.  She was Episcopalian.  And even though she was married to a Baptist minister, she--on Sundays she went to her own Episcopalian church.  So she was--she was a very modern-day woman.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now that's interesting because most--I think--I think especially maybe in the Baptist church the pastor's wife has role to play in--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --has to--is expected to play some role in church development and--
Speaker 2: Yeah she was not interested in doing that.
Story_ID: 57098
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they stay married?
Speaker 2: They stayed married, yeah.  And my mother [Bobbie Vance Poussaint] was their only child.  And she grew up as a very spoiled only child.  And they--she was sent away to boarding school when she was I guess in her middle teens--late teens.  She was sent to Tuskegee [Tuskegee High School, Tuskegee Alabama].  And I believe she managed to get herself expelled.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she went to the, the high school function of Tuskegee--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother was, in every sense of the word, a princess.  She did not work well with authority figures and so she broke a couple of rules.  And Tuskegee wanted to expel her.  And apparently her mother came and talked them out of it.
Speaker 1: So she actually went back?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then she ended up going to Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], which is where she met my father [Christopher Poussaint].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did she finish Hampton?
Speaker 2: No, actually, she didn't.  She ended up years later finishing her college degree at NYU [New York University, New York, New York].  And she got a Master's in Social Work from Hofstra University [Hempstead, New York].
Story_ID: 57099
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother [Bobbie Vance Poussaint] have any stories about growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) She told me a story about how her mother [Gustava Maclin Vance] was very strict about no pets in the house.  And my mother really wanted to have a dog and so she got this puppy from someplace, and she brought it home.  And she showed it to her father [Willis Vance], and her father warned her that her mother was gonna be very upset.  But he agreed to help her hide the dog.  And my grandmother came home and somehow she figured out that there was this dog around, and she insisted that they get rid of the dog.  And my mother said no, and my grandfather tried to talk her out of her position.  And she was not willing to be talked out of it, and so she went and got a gun.  And she told him that he had to get rid of the dog, otherwise she was gonna shoot him.  And she, in fact, shot so that the shot went right past his ear.  She was an excellent shot.  I mean, she--if she wanted to hit, she would've hit him.  And so, naturally, the dog was--a--another home was found for the dog.  But my mother talked about the, the [Great] Depression and how because they lived on a farm and they were--not well-off, but they were all right--that men would come to the back door and, and ask for food.  And, generally, they would always find something for them to eat.  She talked about her mother running the pharmacy and having, again, to keep a gun with her in the pharmacy because there were some white people in the area who did not approve of the idea that there was this black woman who owned this business.  And, apparently, there were a couple of times when she had to pull the gun to get people to leave.  And, generally speaking, my mother described a fairly privileged growing up with a mother who was very strict but also very caring in her own way.  And her father, who was just very loving--very loving.  So that's--those are the im--some of the images from her childhood.
Story_ID: 57100
Speaker 1: Did she [Bobbie Vance Poussaint] talk about what her aspirations were when she was growing up and what she wanted to be?
Speaker 2: She talked about wanting to write.  She mainly talked about wanting to travel and see the world.  I think that she had normal "aspirations" at the time of marrying and having a family.  And she was very social.  And when she went to Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], she, you know, talked about how her mother had supplied her with all these fancy clothes; and she was--you know, belonged to different clubs; went out partying as often as she could.  And my father, I think, attracted her, in part, because he was forbidden fruit in a--in a way.  He was from New York [New York City, New York], Spanish Harlem [New York City, New York].  My mother's parents assumed that he was some sort of gangster, and they did not want her keeping company with him.
Story_ID: 57101
Speaker 1: He [Christopher Poussaint] was very handsome, very much of a party person.  He was the oldest of eight children and the privileged son; as the eldest son, he was the privileged one in his family.
Speaker 2: Let, let, let's just go to his side of the family now.  And can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 1: Christopher Wallace Poussaint.
Speaker 2: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: It was 1920--I believe it was October 26th, 1920.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: New York City [New York].
Speaker 2: Okay, now what can you tell us about his side of the family, and how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 1: His side of the family--really only about two generations.  His father was a working lay--he, he, he worked as a printer for a New York City newspaper.  He was a very strong union man.  And he married my grandmother.  She was apparently very much younger than he--very light-skinned.  And they had eight children:  five boys, three girls.  He managed to buy a, a townhouse on 101st Street in New York.  And it was a very strongly organized family structure.  My grandfather was not particularly tolerant, but he was a strong man.  He was--he was a strong man, and he loved his children in his own way.  But he was not an easy man to get along with.  Supposedly, our ancestors came from Martinique [Lesser Antilles, Caribbean].  At one stage we thought it was Haiti, but one of my uncles did some research in Haiti and came to the conclusion that, that was not the case but that it was much more likely that we came from Martinique.
Speaker 2: Now is there a story as to why they, they think it was Martinique instead of Haiti.
Speaker 1: Mainly a physical resemblance, in terms of the family has certain clear physical traits, in terms of the shape of the face and eyes and nose and whatever; all of the Poussaints basically look alike.  And so we found much more of a physical resemblance with the people of Martinique.
Speaker 2: The--These are Poussaints in Martinique?
Speaker 1: Poussaint, yeah.
Speaker 2: In, in, in Martinique?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 57102
Speaker 1: And supposedly when whatever ancestor of ours came to the United States, the immigration officer put a "P" on the front of the name instead of a "T"  That in point of fact, our name is--should be Toussaint with a "T" but instead it's Poussaint with a "P."  And everybody always asks, well what does that mean?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's just a mistake.  The handy thing is, is that anybody named Poussaint is automatically a member of the family.  One interesting thing that has to do with the physical resemblance thing: years ago, when I was in Africa for the first time.  And I was visiting a, a friend of mine in, in Mali.  And she, she was a--she was actually the ambassador at the time.  And we were walking down the street in Bamako, Mali.  And as we walked along, people would sta--would point at me at various times and say, "Fula."  And after it happened several times, I asked my friend what, what does that mean.  And she said, they were identifying you as a member of a particular tribe, the Fulani.  And I became so intrigued that I asked her to track down the closest Fulani village and went there.  And it was the strangest thing because when I got there and I looked around, it was like my family.  I mean, everybody looked like me.  And it just made that kind of bond, you know, over hundreds and hundreds of years seem very real and, and, and tangible because of that link, the physical link, you know.  So it's, it's, it's one of the things that, that is frustrating about African-American history very often, you don't have a written record, but you have physical kinds of things that, that identify you and your--and your ancestors.  And there is that, particularly on the Poussaint side.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay, now can you go back to your great grandparents on your--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: On my father's side, no, not really.  My grandfather did not talk about his family at all.  So I don't--I don't really know much--much of anything about them.
Story_ID: 57103
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you don't--you don't know much about your great grandparents on that--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --side, but they--are they--are they the ones that came over from--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Martinique?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and as I said that--they had eight children; one of--one of them is my Uncle Alvin Poussaint, who is another HistoryMaker.  And Alvin was the youngest boy; my father [Christopher Poussaint] was the oldest boy in the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, Alvin Poussaint, the great psychologist and--psychi--was he--
Speaker 2: Psychiatrist.
Speaker 1: Psychiatrist or psychologist?
Speaker 2: Psychiatrist.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  And--retired from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] now.  He was at Harvard, right?
Speaker 2: He was at Harvard, yeah.  He's still doing some work with the Judge Baker Children's Center, which is where--what he's been running for years.
Story_ID: 57104
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what did your father [Christopher Poussaint] say about growing up in New York [New York City, New York]?
Speaker 2: He didn't talk very much about growing up in New York.  He, he was--it was a close family and so a lot of the interactions, the socializing, etc., went on with family members and, and then folks in the neighborhood.  It was a--it was a close neighborhood also; it was 101st in Lexington.  And there were a lot of blacks.  There were a lot of Puerto Ricans.  My younger aunts and uncles were very involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  (Unclear)--As a matter of fact, my, my youngest aunt, Julie, I believe she was a member of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  I'm not sure; it might have been CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].  And she actually married an Italian guy, much to my grandfather's dismay.  He was not in favor of inter--interracial marriage.  And there is a scene that I remember from my childhood of my aunt coming home from a date with her future husband.  And they were in a convertible.  And my grandfather started throwing her clothes out of the second story window and, you know, telling her that, you know, she was banned from the family, and you know, this, that, and the other thing.  And it was--it was very dramatic.  And she married him, and she had a couple of kids.  And, you know, they had a fine relationship.  But my--again, my grandfather was very strict about the way he saw things and the way things were supposed to be.  They Harlem [New York City, New York]--the Spanish Harlem and the regular Harlem that my father referred to was a very vibrant place.  There were a lot of opportunities for socializing--a lot of very healthy black businesses.  My father followed in his father's footsteps, in terms of becoming a printer and very--a very strong union man.  And he just enjoyed his growing up.  It was a tough neighborhood in certain ways, and my father was very good at using his fists.  And he was, as the eldest son, the first in the family to go to college.  So that as a main--that was a major thing, his going down to Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].
Story_ID: 57105
Speaker 1: Okay, now what, what career path was he [Christopher Poussaint] on when you went to Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I think--I think it was always assumed that he was going to follow in his father's footsteps that he was going to become a printer.  It was a job that paid very well that a black man could make a career out of.  Now, I think that he also wanted to be a graphic artist.  And he was actually very talented as an artist, but there was no way for him to make a living doing that, so he went into the printing business.
Speaker 1: So that--that meaning that he probably--the chances of him gettin' hired to do graphic arts--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, slim to none.
Story_ID: 57106
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, so, now is there--is there a story your parents tell about how they met?  I mean, how they--
Speaker 2: It was--I believe it was just a--some sort of social event at Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]--some sort of dance.  As I said, my mother [Bobbie Vance Poussaint] was intrigued by him because he was--he was good looking; he was from the big city; he was very smooth; was used to flirting with a lot of women; and so she found him exciting.  And she also enjoyed I think--I know she also enjoyed upsetting her parents (laughter) by encouraging the relationship to go forward.  They married--I believe it was 1943.  And she dropped out of school to go up and live with his family in New York [New York City, New York].
Story_ID: 57107
Speaker 1: She--My mother [Bobbie Vance Poussaint] was very curious intellectually.  And she became intrigued by the Communist Party, and as a matter of fact, she became a member of the Communist Party.  And she would have fundraisers at her home--her and my father's [Christopher Poussaint] home.  They ended up buying the brownstone that was next to the house that my father grew up in.  And my mother would have these fundraisers.  My father would come home from work and find his house full of all of these strangers.  And at one point, my--the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] showed up and was threatening to arrest my mother for her party activities.  She managed to not get arrested, but she, she said that she later found out that it was her father-in-law, my grandfather, who reported her to the FBI.  And it was a very active social environment, my parents' home.  They rented out rooms on the top floor to a number of their fellow students from Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] who had graduated.  Some were artists and dancers and whatever.  And so there was a constant kind of coming and going in the neighborhood--in the house.  And they stayed married for ten years and then got divorced.  And my mother moved with me and my younger brother who was a year old.  We ended up moving out to Queens, in St. Albans, Queens [New York City, New York] and--which is where I ended up finishing elementary school and high school.
Story_ID: 57108
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, the way they walk, they talk, they--the way they looked, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Physically, I take after my father [Christopher Poussaint].  Because, as I said, all of the Poussaints look alike, and it's very easy to identify us.  I'd say, in terms of temperament, I'm more like my mother [Bobbie Vance Poussaint].  And certainly as far as intellectual curiosity I'm more like my mother.  Both of them had a good sense of humor, so I--I got that from both sides.  And I probably have a tendency to, to think that I'm more like my mother because I--you know, from the time that I was ten my father wasn't around, so I was--I was shaped more by my mother than my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, well, now how many siblings do you have now?
Speaker 2: One.
Speaker 1: One, okay.
Speaker 2: One full sibling and two half siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's one sibling.  Sister or brut--or brother?
Speaker 2: Brother [Christopher Poussaint], younger brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's nine years younger than I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his name is, is Christopher Poussaint.
Story_ID: 57109
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Hmm, earliest.  I remember playing out in the street a lot (laughter) and--with neighborhood kids.  And I remember going to Catholic school, St. Francis de Sales [St. Francis de Sales School, New York City, New York].  My--
Speaker 1: Is this your first school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, actually, no, it was my second school.  I went to some sort of private kindergarten that my mother got me a scholarship to go to.  I can't remember the name of it.  But then I went to this Catholic school on 97th Street.
Speaker 1: Now that, that, that's your earliest childhood mem--mem--memory--the earliest thing that you can remember doing?
Speaker 2: The earliest, yeah, was--was going to Catholic school.  I don't remember anything earlier than that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I'm gonna get into school in a minute, but I just wanted to--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: I always ask that question.
Story_ID: 57110
Speaker 1: Can you describe the neighborhood you--now, now you grew up in two neighborhoods, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Started off in Spanish Harlem [New York City, New York], I guess.
Speaker 2: Right and then Queens [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: Then Saint--St. Albans, Queens.
Speaker 2: St. Albans, Queens.
Speaker 1: Yep.  Can you describe the places you grew at, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: 101st Street was a street full of brownstones.  Most of them were apartments--apartment buildings, a lot of families, a very rich cultural mix of blacks and Puerto Ricans.  There might have been a couple of Jewish families; I'm not sure.  The--it was a close-knit neighborhood, to the extent that people looked out for each other.  And if you were a kid, and you were doing something that you weren't supposed to be doing, that somebody would tell your mother.  So there was a sense of, of security--of, of, of being watched and cared for.  And it was--you had all of the energy of New York-Manhattan [New York City, New York].  And my world was basically from 96th Street North, and I was totally happy.  And because of my father's [Christopher Poussaint] large family, I got a lot of attention from aunts and uncles.  When we moved to St. Albans, it was very different.  It was suburban at the time--small single-family homes.  And we had a backyard; and I think it was a two-bedroom house with a finished basement.  And my mother was working as a social worker in, in New York, in Manhattan, so it was quite a commute for her.
Speaker 1: So did--were--You were youngest--you're the youngest--no, no, no--
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm--
Speaker 1: --you had a brother [Christopher Poussaint] that was nine years younger than you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my brother's nine--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --years younger than I, so I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: So you were the baby when you all--when your parents split?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah, I was about ten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 57111
Speaker 1: And, generally speaking, the split was difficult for my mother [Bobbie Vance Poussaint], but I think she's the one who precipitated it.  My mother was not very practical.  She was very bright and very talented and excellent at her job.  She ended up moving up the ranks at the welfare department to become Deputy Commissioner of Welfare for New York City [New York].  But at home she was not very organized, to put it mildly, and had a very difficult time managing a budget and doing some of the things that you need to do raising children.  And so as a result, I became--I matured faster than I might have otherwise, because I had to take care of certain kinds of things, like, you know, we were--we didn't have very much money and we--periodically the electricity would get turned off.  And I would--my mother would send me down to the electrical department--company to get it turned back on.  I did the shopping--food shopping.  I did a lot of the things that, that you need to do to manage a household.  And, and it freed my mother up to, to concentrate on her career and her friends.  So--and it--it was a--it was a good childhood.  I went to a public school for the last two years--7th and 8th grade I believe--P.S. 118.
Story_ID: 57112
Speaker 1: So the, the Catholic school--now was your father [Christopher Poussaint] Catholic?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father [Christopher Poussaint] was Catholic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he insisted that his children be raised Catholic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was--my mother [Bobbie Vance Poussaint] wasn't thrilled about, but.  As a matter of fact, she would show her displeasure (laughter), in terms of--of the--the Catholic tendencies, at Catholic school you would get assignments including certain prayers that you were supposed to say.  And they encouraged you to get your parents involved, and so I would try and get my mother to be involved in some of the stuff that we were supposed to be doing.  And my mother would feed me questions, like she'd say, you know, tomorrow when you're going to school, ask sister so and so about Immaculate Conception and have her explain it to you.  And, of course, I would.  You know, what did I know, I was in the third grade I think it was or second grade.  And I would ask the question, and the sister would get upset.  And it would end up that I would have straight A's in everything, but I'd have a D in conduct because I kept asking these awkward questions and not cooperating the way they felt I should cooperate in catechism class.  So--but, again, my mother encouraged me to use my intellect and to question authority, and so for that I'm grateful, you know.  And the, the--when my mother finally was able to justify taking me out of Catholic school, I think it was because a member of my class' father died, and they had--they insisted that the entire 2nd grade class go to his funeral.  And I was turned off by this and talked to my mother about it, and she was very upset about it.  And finally my father relented and said, you know, that I could go to public school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so by, by this time you're lea--you're, you're living in, in Queens.
Speaker 2: In Queens [New York City, New York], um-hmm.

Speaker 1: Right, right.  So now is this--did you like school grow--growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I loved school.  I, I loved--from, from the very start I've always loved going to school.
Speaker 1: And did, did you have a favorite subject in grade school?
Speaker 2: English, writing.  I, I wrote a lot.  I don't know if I ever actually thought about becoming a writer, but I loved writing and I loved languages.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you an avid reader?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, I was an avid read--reader.  I would--I would hide under the covers at night after bedtime with the flashlight reading until the wee hours, until my mother caught me and made me turn off the flashlight.  But, yeah, I was an avid reader.
Speaker 1: So what, what mind of reading material did you favor?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think--fiction.  They didn't have a lot of books that were designed for African American kids.  So I, I think I read the standard classics--American literature classics and a lot of Mark Twain, and, and as I got older, James Baldwin and Richard Wright, and as many African American authors as I could get my hands on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I don't why this, this is popping in my head, but wha--wha--wha--what about Huckleberry Finn?  Did you--did you like that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I wasn't thrilled with Huckleberry Finn, but I, I was an avid enough reader that I would read just about anything that I could get my hands on.  And, and, and--I did not--I was probably not as discriminating as I should (laughter) have been, but I just enjoyed reading.
Story_ID: 57114
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now did you have any favorite teachers in grade school or middle school?
Speaker 2: I had a (laughter)--I had a teacher who was not my favorite; her name was Mrs. Fernans (ph.), and she was my 6th grade teacher.
Speaker 1: This is in Queens [New York City, New York], right.
Speaker 2: This is in Queens, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school in Queens?
Speaker 2: P.S. 118.  And Mrs. Fernans was extremely anti-communist, and she would--in teaching us about the world and world history, and this that and the other thing. Everything negative became--it was all caused by the communists.  And I found that I was unhappy with that explanation.  And then I talked to my mother [Bobbie Vance Poussaint] about it, and my mother ended up coming to the school and having a fierce argument with Mrs. Fernans.  And basically telling her that she was not free to try and fill her daughter's mind with, you know, that kind of rhetoric.
Speaker 1: Now, now this is the middle of the Cold War and--but I'll just say, and I don't know if you agree with this, but New York City is different from, say, being in the middle of the Midwest, just in terms of the political range of--in New York City.  Because, you know, you got like socialists on--actually on the ballot in New York City--communists for mayor and other--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --positions.
Speaker 2: Yep, and was--there was a lot of--it was a very rich political environment to grow up in.  And, as I said, my mother had, had experimented with communism and I believe socialism.  And she was a social worker, and so she was on the streets a lot.  And she saw how people were actually living and what their problems were and had strong feelings about one's obligation to help where you could.  And she was a strange combination because she felt very strongly about the average person, the average man/woman and her responsibility to be involved in helping them.  But at the same, same time, my mother was a terrible snob, which was a result of her upbringing from the South and being this princess.  So, again, it was--it was (laughter)--it was a fruitful environment for me to be in because I couldn't take anything for granted, and it made me come to my own conclusions about things.  And I was able to recognize early on that some of the things that my mother was saying just re--really didn't (laughter) make a whole lot of sense, in terms of she'd say one thing and then she'd behave a different way.  But it was never boring.
Story_ID: 57115
Speaker 1: But do you know how your mother [Bobbie Vance Poussaint] got involved the Communist Party at all?
Speaker 2: I don't really know.  I think part of it was her studies and going to NYU [New York University] and meeting a variety of people there.  And she very much enjoyed the political debates, and, and I think that's probably how she got involved with the Communist Party; I don't really know.
Speaker 1: Did--Was there any particular activists that she respected, you know, more than others in, in New York [New York City]?
Speaker 2: She didn't--She didn't mention individuals.  She, she--no, she didn't mention individuals, so I'll just leave it at that.
Speaker 1: So did she admire Paul Robeson?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  She did admire Paul, Paul Robeson.  I think she was--she was intrigued by him, and she admired him, but she did not meet him, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so was she a leader in the Communist Party or was she just a--just a member--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I think she was just a member.  She was just a member.  I, I don't think--she was still pretty young and kind of feeling her way.  And she was having enough difficulties (laughter) kind of dealing with being a young wife and mother.  And so she was kind of that combined with her studies.  And, you know, moving into social work pretty much consumed her energies.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did she--was she a member of any other social change organizations like the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or?
Speaker 2: The NAACP, yes; I believe she was a member of the NAACP.  That was pretty much it I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did, did she ever--she had--had she finished school by the time you were 10 and you all moved to Queens [New York City, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had finished her undergraduate degree.  She later got a master's and that was after we have moved to, to Queens.
Speaker 1: And did she suffer any repercussions at work for be--for being a member of the Community Par--Party?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  The, the only--as I said, the only thing as far as repercussions that I know of was having the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] show up at our house.  But as far as it affecting her job, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No problems.
Story_ID: 57116
Speaker 1: As you grew up, I mean, how did that affect you with so much rhetoric on television and--you know, we had--we had that Cold War going on, the Iron Curtain and all this, you know.  What did--I know the McCarthy hearings [The Army-McCarthy Hearings, 1954] you would been about what, six--six or seven?
Speaker 2: Yeah, pretty--.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--I don't know if you're aware of those at the time or?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I mean, I, I was--I was--at that stage of my life, I really--the good thing was, was that there was so much going on as far as my family was concerned with my aunts and uncles and their friends, the--the very interracial, interethnic kind of environment that I lived in and the political and social consciousness that came as far as, as the Civil Rights Movement was concerned.  There was more of a sense of black identity--searching for black identity and encouraging aspects of black identity than there was the political ideolo--ideological kinds of things.  I, for instance, took dance when I was very young.  My mother enrolled me in ballet school.  And I--and I enjoyed dance.  I, I went to the--I believe it was the Carnegie School of Ballet in New York [Carnegie School of Ballet at Carnegie Hall, New York City, New York], and it, you know--like many little girls that thought, oh, it'll be wonderful to be a professional dancer and bounce around in tutus and all that kind of stuff.  And--but the reality was that I didn't see any black women who did that.  And it became clear to me that, that was not an option, and I switched over to modern dance and then into Haitian and African dance.
Speaker 1: About how old were you when you got involved in Haitian and African dance?
Speaker 2: I was in high school.  I stopped the ballet when I was, hmm, probably about seven or eight.  And from that point on it was modern dance and then in high school the switchover to, to Haitian and African dance.
Speaker 1: Okay, in those days were you aware of Pearl Primus and, and--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, and, you know, all that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --all the black dancers like Katherine Dunham.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my--one of my aunts, my Aunt Julie, the youngest, was also very much into dance.
Speaker 1: And she, she was very--she was a very active dancer.  And then there was another woman, [HistoryMaker] Billie Allen, who was a friend of my parents from the college days who was a very successful dancer in New York [New York City, New York].  And she made me aware of some of the great things that were going on in the area of, of black people in dance.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay, so--all right so, so did you continue to take dance and--when you moved to Queens [New York City, New York] too?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I, I continued.  I, I took modern, modern dance while I was in Queens, although I studied in New--in, in Manhattan.  I would--I would come to Manhattan [New York City, New York] and study and then the switchover to, to, to Haitian and African dance.
Story_ID: 57117
Speaker 1: Now I didn't ask you about--I prob--you know, I need to--Now the neighborhood in Queens [New York City, New York], now how did that compare to the neighborhood in, in Manhattan [New York City, New York]?
Speaker 2: It was very different.  It was completely different.  It was a neighborhood in transition in that I think when we--when we moved in it was maybe half white.  Within a few years it was all black.  The white folks just left.  I lived across the street, as a matter of fact, from someone who if she's not a history maker, I'm sure she will be--Lani Guinier.  And there was a, a sort of cadre of, of black professionals, middle class folk who gravitated to that neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, I know her father he was Ewart Guinier who is in charge of black studies at, at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] at one time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So was he involved in, in that kind of activity then?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I mean, I have no--I have no memory of him at all.  Lani and I interacted, but she's younger than I am so, you know, we weren't like close friends.  But it--that was the kind of environment it was.
Story_ID: 57118
Speaker 1: And I went to high school, Andrew Jackson High School [Cambria Heights, Queens, New York City, New York], which had something like 5,000 students.  And--
Speaker 2: That's a large high school, in other words.
Speaker 1: Very large high school, and I, I enjoyed it.  I was very active in a lot of clubs and also loved the academics, loved being able to study French.  I wanted to study French because I had decided that I needed to because of my name and because my mother loved French.  I decided that I needed to learn it and that one of my goals was I was gonna go to France someday.  So that was in the back of my mind.  So I, I took French in high school.  And when it came time for me to go to college, one of the things that affected my decision to go to Sarah Lawrence College [Bronxville, New York] was that they had a junior year abroad program in France--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --which appealed to me.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, so you started high school in--was it 19--
Speaker 1: Oh God, let me see.
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961] or?
Speaker 1: Six (unclear).
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960], I guess.  Was that it?
Speaker 1: I graduated from college in '66 [1966] I think it was.  So if we go back, I started in 1962 so.
Speaker 2: You started high school in '58 [1958] then?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  Okay, 1958.
Story_ID: 57119
Speaker 1: Alright. So you're just starting high school, and the Civil Rights Movement is really kicking up in the media.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did--Now did you pay attention to the--very much to radio and television when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No, I (laughter) had no interest really in, in, in radio.  I watched television the way everybody else watched television, but I didn't have a particular affinity in that direction at all.
Speaker 1: Did, did you watch documentaries at all growing up or?
Speaker 2: No, no, I watched the standard, you know, sitcoms, and occasionally if there was a documentary that had anything to do with black people I would watch it.  But other than that, nope.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I remember things that I--we're almost the same age.  I remember things like "The Hate That Hate Produced" that Mike Wallace did about the Nation of Islam and the "NBC White Paper" on the voting in Mississippi or, or the CBS re--reports on voting in Mississippi, those kind of things.  Did you see any of that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but they were few and far between (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right, right, I think in those days I think the evening news was only fifteen minutes at one point.  They finally expanded it to--
Speaker 2: To, to--
Speaker 1: --half an hour.
Speaker 2: --half an hour, yeah, yep, so.
Speaker 1: So did you--your mother get newspapers at home?
Speaker 2: No, actually she didn't.  We couldn't afford it.  So, no, no newspa--no newspapers.
Speaker 1: Okay, just wondering if you read any of the black papers that were coming through (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I would read the "Amsterdam News" when I could get my hands on it, you know, but that was pretty much it.
Speaker 1: No "Ebony" or "Jet" or?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah--no, "Ebony" and "Jet," both.  I, I assume that my mother had a subscription to "Ebony" and "Jet" 'cause they would show up at our house, yeah.  And I remember the, the "Ebony Fashion Fair."  And "Ebony" had a particular importance because you always knew that there would be positive stories about black people and black people who were achieving and making a name for themselves and all of that kind of stuff.  So it was--it was--it was a positive influence.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, were there any black pe--people in the media in those days that you remember or?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I--One of the reasons that I didn't gravitate towards the media was that I didn't see people of color, so it never occurred to me that it would be something that I would get involved in.
Speaker 1: I only know--I know about Hal Jackson in New York being a DJ.  Did you know about him when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: The name is familiar, but I (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, but that's about the only one I can think of from that--you know, that we--that actually am aware of myself.  I wasn't around that (unclear), but okay.  So, so when you were in high school, you say you focused on French and literature and?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 57120
Speaker 1: And did you have good grades in school [Andrew Jackson High School, Cambria Heights, Queens, New York City, New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  I'm--I, I was salutatorian of my class and the--actually the way that I ended up going to Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York] was the year that I was graduating Sarah Lawrence, which prides itself on being a liberal non-Seven Sisters school, was running out of black people.  It had pretty much two black people per class.  And they apparently looked up and realized that there were--their black people were graduating (laughter) and--
Speaker 1: Now does this--what you're talking about implies maybe that there was a quota at Sarah Lawrence (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, my assumption is that there was.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah we were just talk--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --discussing--
Speaker 2: We're talking about--
Speaker 1: --whether or not there's a quota at Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think--I think it was an unofficial quota at--otherwise, it's difficult to understand how they ended up with two black students per class.  And they sent around one of their last remaining black students to talk--to go to different high schools in Manhattan [New York, New York] and talk to black girls who had good averages, and talk up Sarah Lawrence and encourage them to come and offered them scholarships.  And so I had applied to four other colleges, and I ended up going to Sarah Lawrence because Sarah Lawrence gave me a full scholarship, and my mother [Bobbie Vance Poussaint] couldn't afford to contribute anything to, to school.  So that became the choice.
Story_ID: 57121
Speaker 1: Now during this period of time, I mean, did you--I mean, when your--after your parents split up, did you see your father [Christopher Poussaint] on a regular basis?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, my father would, would--we'd, we'd see each other.  We'd come out and, and pick me up, and we'd go someplace.  I'd see him about twice a--twice a month.  He'd come out for, you know, like a Saturday or something like that.  So he was--he was a presence in my life, but we didn't get to spend a lot of time with each other.  But he made sure that he kept contact.
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of your father's political orientation, he was a strong union man you said, as his father was before.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was, was he involved in the Communist Pa--Party too at all?
Speaker 2: No, no, my father was basically kind of apolitical.  What was good for the union was--that was as far as it went.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And he was working for the newspa--papers too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: Initially, he was working--it was a racetrack paper.  I can't remember the name of it.  But then he ended up going to the "New York Times."
Story_ID: 57122
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, so, now were you involved in any other activities in, in high school [Andrew Jackson High School, Cambria Heights, Queens, New York City, New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was--I was involved in virtually everything--I mean, theater groups; I think I belonged to a math club; I--as a matter of fact, I tried out for the cheerleaders, not because I wanted to be a cheerleader, but because it annoyed me that there were no blacks on the cheerleading squad.  So I went out for cheerleading.  I passed the audition, but then they said that they had--the advisors had determined that I already had so many other outside activities that it would be a strain on me academically if I joined the cheerleading squad.  So I got rejected as a cheerleader, but that was the only thing that that I (laughter) did not participate in.  I was very active.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, was school close by or did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was only about five blocks from my house.
Speaker 1: Okay, and it's hard to have been of 5,000 students.  That's really--a big school in Chicago [Illinois] now has maybe 3,500, but 5,000 we just--
Speaker 2: Yep, we, we went on three shifts and, you know, I--it seem--to me it seemed normal (laughter); it didn't seem peculiar at all.  And part of that was, you know, well it was New York and everything--everything's crowded and every--you know, there were large numbers of people everywhere all the time, so why not high school?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: All right, so high school graduation you're the salutatorian?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And anything other special--else that's special about high school graduation?
Speaker 2: No, nope, just looking forward to getting away--
Speaker 1: So this was 19--
Speaker 2: --going off to college.
Speaker 1: --okay, 1962?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: In the fall of '60 [1960] [sic] [1962].  Now, now what would happen during the summer, anything special?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember--nothing I can recall, no.
Story_ID: 57123
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York] and that--and that's in--is that in New York or?
Speaker 2: Bronxville, New York.
Speaker 1: Bronxville, okay.
Speaker 2: It's in suburban New York, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, well tell us about your--did you visit the campus prior to being admitted?
Speaker 2: I don't believe I did.  I (laughter) was just so happy to get a scholarship, which by the way turned into a loan after the first year.  And in order for me to make ends meet, I had--I held basically about three part-time jobs while I was at Sarah Lawrence.  And another reason why I had to do that was my mother [Bobbie Vance Poussaint] insisted that she was going to be contributing a certain amount of money to my tuition.  And each year she would not have the money.  And I would get called into the financial affairs office, and we'd have the same conversation about your mother did pay and what are you gonna do, or what's gonna happen?  And I would take on another job, and, and get it taken care of.
Speaker 1: And Sarah Lawrence was--it was a kind of strange environment.  I was--there was me and one other black student whose name was Carol Darden (ph.).  She--her sister, Norma [Norma Jean Darden], had also gone to Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York], and they ended up doing a series of cookbooks later, Strawberries and something--
Speaker 2: That's, that's Spoonbread and Strawberry--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, that's it, yes.
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And Alice Walker came to Sarah Lawrence while I was there.
Speaker 2: Was she an underclassman--I mean, be--be--behind you?
Speaker 1: She was--she was--
Speaker 2: Oh, Alice Walker.
Speaker 1: Alice Walker, right.
Speaker 2: Alice Walker, okay.
Speaker 1: She was like a year ahead of me--one year ahead of me I think.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Sarah Lawrence was--it was full of a lot of very wealthy, slightly crazy white girls.  They were all very nice to me, but I never felt at home there.  And it was a good environment for me to be in because it taught me that money does not make you happy.  Because most of the girls who went to Sarah Lawrence came from wealthy families, and most of them that I met were very unhappy.  But it was good exposure for me.  I concentrated on comparative literature, French and American literature and continued my French studies.
Story_ID: 57124
Speaker 1: And as I said, in my junior I went on their junior year abroad program to Paris, and was a student in Paris [France] for that year.
Speaker 2: Now, okay.  Now, now that must have been exciting.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was.  It was--
Speaker 2: To go to Paris.
Speaker 1: --it--it was--it was great.  It was--I had no money; I lived on 75 cents a day and ate the same thing every--everyday.  I'd have one--I, I lived in this dormitory for French Moroccan girls.  And I was the only American and shared a room.  It was a six-floor walkup in--on Rue Bonaparte, B-O-N-A-P-A-R-T-E.  And it was--it was a phenomenal learning experience.  My roommate was from--was French Moroccan and--
Speaker 2: Now, just one of the (unclear) things I (unclear) ask you?  Now the trip was sponsored by the--Sarah Lawrence?
Speaker 1: By Sarah Lawrence, um-hmm, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: And so you didn't stay with Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York] through this but--
Speaker 1: No, it--
Speaker 2: Were they all split up?
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --(Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --everybody was--was living in a different kind of environment.  And my roommate, Mary Frost--her was name was Mary Frost Staple--she was very into being French and the latest French fashion and this, that and the other thing.  And she sort of felt that Americans were not barbarians, but one step above barbarians.  And I'll never forget one day I had saved money for months, and I went out and bought myself a pair of shoes and put them into the closet.  And when Mary Frost got back in the room she opened the closet door, and she looked at the shoes, and she said, "Oh, my God!  I would actually wear those shoes."  You know, and it was kind of like, you know, (laughter) I didn't realize you had good taste (laughter), you know.  So that was something of a turning point in our relationship.  Then all of a sudden she decided I, I perhaps was salvageable.  But it was a very exciting time.  I did--took a course at the Sorbonne [University of Paris-Sorbonne, Paris, France].  The other courses that I took were seminar type courses for Sarah Lawrence students.  Everything was in French.  I, I came to, to really enjoy French culture.  I (laughter), I remember running into Geoffrey Holder in the street and practically swooning, because I just thought he was one of the most phenomenal black men I'd ever heard of.  But it was--it was--it gave me a tremendous appreciation for art.  I already had the appreciation for literature.  And I just came to love the beauty of the city and, and to be in an environment where one's passion was as important as one's profession.
Story_ID: 57125
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so who were your favorite writers?
Speaker 2: Oh, James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka.  I, I--the African writers I came to, to know and, and hear about when I was in Paris.  The African American writers, of course, I, I had heard about before, but particularly James Baldwin.
Speaker 1: So the African writers Achebe and Soyinka, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, they came later.
Speaker 1: And what, what about now the ones from Martinique and--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --and Haitian?
Speaker 2: Not really, no--did not explore that.  I should have, but I didn't.
Story_ID: 57126
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so, so is there--is there a particularly interesting story or highlight of your stay in Paris for that year?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I had my [paternal] Aunt Julie, the youngest aunt, her ex-husband, the Italian guy that she had married, was coming over on business, and he contacted me and said that he was coming over and he wanted to take me out to dinner.  And--which I was thrilled about because, as I said I was living on 75 cents a day, so I very seldom got to eat like meat and things like that.  And so he showed up one particular evening, he and this colleague of his, another American.  And we went to the opera.  And then afterwards we were in the taxicab and my uncle said, "Do you know where the gay people hang out?"  And I wasn't sure exactly what he meant by gay, but I asked a couple more questions and became clear that he was talking about gay as in homosexual.  And so I knew of a particular cafe that was near the Champs-Elysees and so we ended going there.  And I spent much of the evening sort of acting as a glorified pimp for my former uncle's friend who was gay and was looking for a companion for the evening.  And so as guys would come into the restaurant, he would ask me if I would talk to them and see, you know, if they'd be interested in hanging out for the night.  Or he'd say, you know, tell that one that I'm interested in him, but he has to take a shower first and, you know, I mean, it was really (laughter).  It was a very interesting evening.  And we ended up staying up and I think until about 3:00 in the morning, until he finally found somebody that he was, you know, comfortable with.  So that was one of the more standout memories (laughter) that I have of, of, of Paris, and the rest of them are just memories of, of the beauty of the city and, and, and the elegance of the French people.
Story_ID: 57127
Speaker 1: Now did you meet any, any writers that you're-(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --there works?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: All right, so, so you're there from your junior year--
Speaker 2: Junior year.
Speaker 1: --so this is like '60--[1960]
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 2: um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And so you came back in--for your senior year in '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And then I decided that I wanted to be a lawyer, a civil rights lawyer, and I applied to a number of law schools and got in.  And--
Speaker 1: Now what brought that decision on.  I mean, what, what was (unclear) 'cause I know--well this, this is the height of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Right.

Speaker 1: You know, you had the March on Washington in '63 [1963] before you went to Paris.
Speaker 2: Which I attended.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well--well tell us about that (unclear).
Speaker 2: I don't remember a lot of it, I just remember, you know, great crowds of people and this feeling of--this festive feeling.  And I was there with my then fiance.  I ended up having three different fiancees at different times and being mesmerized by Martin Luther King, and just coming away feeling that we had reached a new more positive level and that things were gonna be looking up.  'Cause there was such a feeling of, of power, in terms of all of those people coming together with similar goals and, and ideals.  So it was a very exciting kind of event.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense when you heard that speech that it would be, you know, singled out, you know, (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, it was--it was just--it was so moving and so powerful, and he delivered it so extraordinarily well.  And I heard an anecdote about some of the background to the speech.  Walter Fauntroy who is his--was King's [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] lieutenant at the time, was saying that the night before the speech was given that there was a meeting of men who were putting the program together for it the other day and that--most of them were ministers.  And there was a, a strong contingent that was arguing that Martin Luther King should not be the main speaker, and that this was an opportunity for other speakers to be known.  And Walter said that one of the ministers stood up and said, "God spoke to me last night and said that I should be the primary speaker."  And then shortly afterwards another guy stood up and said, "Well I don't know what time God spoke to you, but he spoke to me about 2:00."  And he said, "I'm supposed to be the speaker."  And it--this went on and on and on with, you know, different men standing up--preachers standing up saying, you know, I'm supposed to be it.  And they finally--it was really sort of getting out of hand.  And apparently it was Dorothy Height, who was the only woman there who had been quietly sitting in the background, which was what Dorothy normally did, and Dorothy is the one who raised her voice finally and said, "Gentlemen, we really do have to keep our eye on what is most important here, and if Martin is the one who can get the message out and have it heard by the most number of people, then we have to let him speak."  And Walter said the testosterone level went down considerably in the room.  And they agreed that Martin could speak, but that he had to limit the amount of time that he was gonna have.  And it was after that, that he and, and Martin and a couple of other people went off to the hotel room and started putting the speech together.  But I've always loved that anecdote.  I think it's just, you know, wonderful--oh, God, God spoke to me at 2:00 a.m. (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm tending to think Reverend Hosea Williams was in that mix--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but I, I know you didn't say that but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --was he one of the ones?
Speaker 2: I believe--I believe he was, yeah.  So anyway, it was--it was a very--it was a very exciting time.
Story_ID: 57129
Speaker 1: Okay just thought I'd ask.  Okay so, so in your senior year and you're, you know--are you--you were thinking about law school.
Speaker 2: Right, yep.
Speaker 1: 'Cause of the, the--
Speaker 2: The Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I wanted to be more involved and I wanted to--I wanted to have a skill that could be used, in terms of furthering, you know, the advancement of, of, of black people.  And the guidance counselors at Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York] were not thrilled with this at all, because Sarah Lawrence girls "didn't do that kind of thing."  They went into the arts or, you know, whatever.  But I applied to different schools and I got in.  And one of the schools that I went to--that I applied to and was accepted at was NYU [New York University, New York, New York] Law School.  And I went in for an interview, and I was told that as a black student I was--I would need to come in advance the summer before the fall semester for remedial work, and it didn't matter where I had gone to school or what my marks were or anything.  It was: you're black, you will come to this remedial series of classes during the summer.  So I said no, and I went to Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] instead.  And I found that I was--after a few months, I felt sort of alienated from the environment, because it was primarily privileged white guys.  And they were coming at things from a vantage point of by birth practically, they had the right to decide how other people should live.  They had the right to make the laws and they had the right to determine right and wrong.  And the rest of the folks, the masses, would, you know, abide by what their decisions were.  And I was--felt--well I was part of the masses; I was not part of that privileged group.  And so I never felt comfortable.  I did actually do better than I thought I was gonna do, in terms of grades.   Because I could write well and so my grades were fine.  But it was--the, the more I went on, the more I became convinced that being a lawyer was not temperamentally the thing for me to do.  And I started asking some of the third-year students what they planned to do when they graduated, and about half of them said, anything that doesn't have anything to do with law.  And I would ask them well, why did you stay?  And they'd say, well, once you get sort of into your second year, you can't justify dropping out of Yale Law School.  So you just figure what the hell, I'll just stay and finish up the, you know, the three years, and at least I'll have a degree and it'll look good on my resume.  And I didn't wanna spend three years doing something that I didn't fundamentally believe in.  And so an opportunity came up.  My future husband had--was working in Malawi in East Africa, and he contacted me and asked me to join him.  And I ended up doing that, and I went and lived in Malawi for about a year.
Story_ID: 57130
Speaker 1: Now, well, stop here a second and just tell us how you met your husband and what was he doin--doing in Malawi?
Speaker 2: I met my husband through mutual friends.  At the time that I met him, I was engaged to a different guy.  And my husband says that when he saw the guy that I was engaged to, he had said to his friend, "She's too much woman for him.  That's not gonna last.  I'll just wait."  And in point of fact, I did break up with the guy I was engaged to.  And we started dating my last year at, at, at Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York].  And he was going to Yale Law School.  He was graduating.  And he got a job, a government job, with the government of Malawi to come over to work in their international affairs legal department.  When he got over there he discovered he was the international (laughter) affairs legal department.  And so that's how--that's how we met and that's how we ended up getting together.
Speaker 1: And I--when I went over, the thought was that we would end up getting married.  And I got cold feet again, and so we didn't get married.  But I stayed for a year and worked at Malawi's radio station basically as the receptionist.  I found that a number--my then fiance is a, a light-skinned black man with straight hair.  And he had gone around to a number of companies in Malawi to inquire about openings, with the idea of me being able to get a job when I got over there.  But it turned out that a number of these companies assumed that whoever his girlfriend was or his future was that she was white.  And so when I showed up with my afro, all of a sudden the jobs that were supposedly open were not open anymore.  So--because these were British expatriates who were in charge still.  So I had a really tough time getting any sort of employment.  And what I--part of what I had to also get used to was, for the first time in my life having household help.  Because, since it was a government job, you got government housing.  And with the government house came a housekeeper and a gardener.  And at--initially I felt so uncomfortable about the whole thing, I said, you know, no, I don't really need a housekeeper or a gardener or whatever.  And then it was pointed out to me these guys need the job so shut up, so I did.  And so I, I sort of was in this strange kind of limbo of being an expatriate but not a white expatriate, being a black woman who was supposed to fit into the white expatriate lifestyle.  Like, the spouses would get together and have these card games where they would drink each oth--drink themselves silly on gin and tonics and pims (ph.), and whatever.  One time Henry and I were--my fiance and I were going to a social event at one of these British expatriate homes.  And as were walking up to the front door, these dogs started barking hysterically.  And it turns out that the dogs had been trained to bark at black people.  And so it was a little embarrassing because we were guests, but the dogs didn't realize we were guests and so they were, you know, ready to tear us to shreds.  So there are all of these kinds of, of weird contradictions, in terms of, particularly my role, my situation in Malawi.  It was--again, it was fascinating, but it made me recognize that this was, again, not a circumstance that I would feel--would be a long-term home, you know, for, for me.
Story_ID: 57131
Speaker 1: I also am not in favor of snakes, and Malawi's full of them.  And my husband will never let me forget we came home one, one evening and we drove into the carport.  And as we got out, this snake came out from underneath the car.  And I apparently--I sort of blacked out, but apparently I ran inside and locked the door with the husband on the outside (laughter).  I said, you take care of it.  But, yeah, dealing with, with, with snakes and, and various unsundry kind of--very large insects and whatever.  I mean, I loved the wildlife.  I loved--we went to a couple of game parks, and, and I was fascinated and loved it.  We actually--at one point we were running after a lion.  I mean--which was counterintuitive.  So I found--I found the whole experience really fascinating, but it was not gonna be a long-term place for me to be.
Story_ID: 57132
Speaker 1: And I had been to Africa--it might have been--maybe it's the summer before I went to Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York]; maybe that's what I was doing that summer.  I was--I joined Operation Crossroads Africa.  And I was part of a group, a student leader delegation of about eight of us.  And we went to--basically to meet with other youth groups in Mali, Senegal, the Ivory Coast and Guinea.
Speaker 2: So this is while you were--before you went to Sarah Lawrence?
Speaker 1: Yeah, just before I went to Sarah Lawrence.  And that was also a really fascinating time.  And one of the things I remember from that trip was the attempt of this tribal chieftain to buy me as a wife.  He had--the group had gone to his village, and there were--there was the chief, and he already had three wives, but he decided he wanted to buy me as a fourth wife.  And the, the head of our group came over to me and said, chief so and so wants to buy you, you know, and he's (laughter) offering a really good price.  I think it was like three or four cows.  And we have to handle this very delicately because we're in his village, and we can't afford to, you know, insult him.  And I said, so what are you suggesting, that I accept the offer (laughter)?  I mean, how do you not insult him?  And, long story short, what happened was the person who--one of the people who was with us was the head of tourism for Mali.  And he negotiated with the chief to explain to him that--I think he told him that I, you know, I was already promised to somebody else and, you know, so it wasn't personal.  And then after he had negotiated that, then the, the Malian official came to me later and suggested that I might wanna spend some time with him, because if I didn't I might have some difficulty leaving the country.  It was just very strange; the whole (laughter), whole thing was very, very strange.  But the Operation Crossroads representative got him to back down from, you know, his little--and, and the thing about it was, it, it wasn't like I was some femme fatale or something like that, I was just, you know, I was, you know, a twenty one-year-old student.  Well, no, I was an eighteen-year-old student because it was just before I went to Sarah Lawrence.  So anyway, it, it, it was a very interesting experience.  But that was my first introduction to, to Africa, and it was West Africa.  And so then later when I went to Malawi, that was my first experience with, with East Africa.
Story_ID: 57133
Speaker 1: What did you--did you--I guess when you look back on it, would you have any reflections on the way women are treated in Africa in those days in--as opposed to the United States or France for that, that matter.
Speaker 2: Well I was--I was intrigued by the role of women in Africa in, in the sense that most of the women that I met were very strong women.  They, they took care of their families, they--a lot of them were, were market women who, who can't--you know, built small businesses.  They--I saw them as the--as the fundamental strength of the--of the society in most of the African societies that I came in, in contact with.  So, on the one hand there was his feeling of, of admiring the, the tremendous strength, but at the same time recognizing that, in terms of rights.  In terms of legal, you know, rights, they had so many struggles still facing them and attitudes tor-towards them, in terms of being property of a man, that I had tremendous problems with.  But, again, it was--it was one of those kind of contradictory situations, in terms of seeing a group of people who were oppressed in a number of ways.  But within that oppressed state there was a tremendous strength that allowed them to function and to move forward.  So I gravitated towards African women as much as I possibly could because I felt that I could learn so much from them, and I did, I did.  As far as French women were concerned, I guess the main thing that I (laughter) learned from French women was how important it is to learn how to flirt with men.  How to--how to be comfortable in your femaleness and very aware of yourself as a--as a--as a woman.  And, again, they were not interested in the same way American women were concerned with equality and legal rights and politically active and--not in the way American women were.  But there was this great sense of, of security and self-confidence that French women carried with them which I found to be admirable.
Story_ID: 57134
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were in Malawi in 1968--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when--Were--were you there when Dr. King was assassinated or were you back?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that must have been unusual not even being here when--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it was.  It was--it was very unusual and felt for the first time like I really wanted to be home, you know.  And the thing that, that--a--again, as far as, as seeing my future or what was important to me was--what was important to me was being able to work for the benefit of black people but, again, having a skill, not just, you know, showing up and saying, here I am, you know, I'm coming back to mother Africa and use me as you will, but having some concrete kind of skill.  So that's what encouraged me to go to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] to get a Master's in African Studies--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which is what I did when I came back from Malawi.  Well I worked; I worked for a year before I did that.  I worked for an organization called AIESEC, A-I-E-S-E-C, [International Association of Students in Economic and Commercial Sciences] and it was--it was an organization that placed business students in internships in different countries.  And I was hired to be director of programs.  And one of the things that I found fascinating was occasionally we'd get requests from Japanese firms.  And they would say, we want a student that has this skill or that skill or is taking this course or that course.  And they just put a little note on the bottom saying, "No negroes."  And I took great pleasure in writing back and saying, "All we have is negroes" (laughter), which didn't go over really well.  But anyway, I did that for about a year and then went to UCLA for my Master's in African Studies.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Okay, so that job with Aiesec was in--was in, in, in New York?
Speaker 2: In New York [New York], um-hmm.
Story_ID: 57135
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so UCLA--so UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] at, at--you know, I know is a strong school for literature.  I think that's the home of the Mark Twain pa--papers and a lot of other things.  But, so--but, but they had a 19--this is 1969 or '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969] I think it was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969].  They had a course in African literature?
Speaker 2: It was African Studies, with--and you know, you could concentrate on--in whatever area you, you wanted I wanted African literature.  And they also had a magazine called "African Arts" magazine, which was a very slick magazine that concentrated on collections of African art and academic studies of African art.  And I got a job as an associate editor on the magazine, which helped to pay my bills.  But--and it was also, you know, something that I loved doing.  So I did--I worked at "African Art--Arts" magazine and I studied African literature and art for the two years I was there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember Af--"African Arts" as a perfect bound magazine with very expensive paper--
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: --a lot, lot of rich color prints and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.  And it was just great.  It was--it was a, a wonderful experience.  And I had to go through something of an emotional transition with living in the wa--West Coast, particularly in Los Angeles [California], because I was coming from a very East Coast New York kind of mentality.  And I was finding that most of the folks that I was meeting in Los Angeles were very kind of stereotypically Californian, very, you know--what's your sign, you know, that, that kinda thing.  And I was very--I was getting very sort of irritated.  And, again, I didn't have any money.  I, I had to get a car when I--'cause you can't survive without a car out there.  And I got this MG Midget convertible--
Speaker 1: [TAPE INTERRUPTED]
Speaker 2: --and the, the MG Midget convertible with 175,000 miles on it.  And the top didn't go up, but the guy who sold it to me said, "Don't worry about it.  It never rains in California."  And I remember the exact moment when I just deci--that I converted and became a Californian for the amount of time that I had left there.  It was Christmastime, and I was particularly depressed because it was like 85 degrees and everybody was running around, you know, in halter tops and all the rest of it.  And it was just, you know, as far as I was concerned, it wasn't really Christmas.  And I was driving on Wiltshire Boulevard and I stopped at a stoplight.  And I looked up, and from lamppost to lamppost across Wiltshire was a life-sized replica of Santa and his reindeer.  And Santa was in a fuschia jumpsuit trimmed in white fur, and each of the reindeer had little earrings on.  And I just--I, I burst out laughing.  I just thought it was one of the funniest, most ridiculous things I'd ever seen in my life.  And I realized at that point that what I needed to do was to stop fighting it, and just join it and that Los Angeles has its own particular bizarre kind of charm; and it's not New York; and it's not gonna be New York.  And so from that point on I just kinda relaxed and got into it, and I enjoyed the rest of the time that I was there.  But it, it took me awhile to get to that stage.
Story_ID: 57136
Speaker 1: Now what about your professors at, at UCLA?  Were there any, any professors that stand out as mentors or particularly good guides to African literature or, or, or African Studies?
Speaker 2: There was one professor per--his last name was [John] Povey I believe it was who taught African literature.  He was British, and he was (laughter)--he was--he was the quintessential British good old boy.  And I enjoyed working with him because he did have a genuine love for African literature and knowledge of African literature, but he was also phenomenally lazy.  And so when it came to--he was supposed to give me my exam for my Master's.  And he was also the, the senior editor for "African Arts" magazine.  And so he didn't really wanna go to the trouble of making up an exam for me, so what he said wa--and, and he all--he had this tendency to always be slightly late for whatever appointment he had.  So he just said--one day he said, look, why don't we do it this way, if I show up in the office tomorrow on time, then I'll give you a test.  If I'm late, we'll just say you passed the test and you get your Master's.  So, of course, he was late 'cause he didn't wanna give me a test; he didn't wanna bother to put the test together.  So I, I never had to take any sort of exam for my Master's.  I said okay, sounds fine to me.  So (laughter) it, it was--it was an interesting experience.  And, and there were other professors there who--a number of whom were white--who were genuinely devoted to the culture of Africa--cultures of Africa, and I enjoyed working with them.
Speaker 1: Now, now is there any, any--were there any African professors there that, that really?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember.  I think there, there was at least one.  There might have been a couple.  Usually they were it, it--visiting professors.  They weren't, you know, permanent staff.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know I--it's a prob--it's surprising to a lot of people that most of the African Studies departments are dominated by wa--white people from Europe or the U.S.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, that was definitely the case.
Story_ID: 57137
Speaker 1: Now did you find out about any particular African writers that really excited you?
Speaker 2: Well I continued--I continued to, to be a tremendous fan of Chinua Achebe, and, and to a lesser extent, Wole se--Soyinka.  And later when I, I left UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and I went to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] in the--their Doctoral program of Comparative Literature, one of the authors that I was trying very hard to get young black people interested in was Chinua Achebe.  And that met with (laughter) very limited success.  When I got--after I got my Master's my future husband, Henry, at that stage had moved to Indiana, which was his hometown--his home state.  And he was teaching at Indiana Law School [Indiana University Maurer School of Law] in Bloomington [Indiana].  And, again, we were talking about getting married.  And so I moved to Bloomington and enrolled in the Doctoral program for Comparative Literature.  And my thought was that I was going to get my Doctorate and then teach.  And I was co-teaching two courses in African--African-American literature, and I discovered that about ten percent of the students in my classes, all of whom were--virtually all of whom were black, were functional illiterates.  They were--they had been "socially promoted" throughout high school, and they had managed to get into Indiana University as freshmen, and they could barely read and write.  And in talking to them about the problem, a number of them said that they didn't see it as a problem, that they thought that they could bluff their way through most writing assignments they might have or forms that they might need to fill out, and that they got most of the information that they need about themselves and the world from watching television.  And so I was busy doing things like--I was taking a seminar in translating parts of the Bible into Swahili and stuff like, which was, you know, esoteric to the nth degree.  And so I decided that what I needed to do was to learn something about the medium that these young people related to, which was television.  And so I changed my major to mass communications, and I applied to the Columbia University [New York City, New York] special journalism program for minorities--I think it's called the Michele Clark Fellowship Program for Minorities or something at Columbia University--and ended up going to Columbia for this, this program that prepares you to go into broadcasting.
Story_ID: 57138
Speaker 1: Now what, what year is this that--what year did you got to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: It was the year after I graduated from UCLA, so.
Speaker 1: So that would have been what, 1970--
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970], yeah--
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970]?
Speaker 2: --seventy [1970], '71 [1971], in there.
Speaker 1: '70 [1970], '71 [1971], okay.  So Indiana University's in '71 [1971], and then you went?
Speaker 2: To Columbia University [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: Wa--Within the year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.  And so I went through that program [Michele Clark Fellowship Program for Minorities] and part of it--part of the, the deal was that if you successfully completed the program that you in fact got a job somewhere.  And so the job that I had after completing the Columbia program was as a news writer at the CBS station in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now before we get you out of Columbia [Columbia University, New York City, New York], how, how did you--I mean, were there any special teachers or per--personalities you met at Columbia that really influenced you?
Speaker 2: Well there, there are a couple of people.  Jonathan Rogers was a good friend.  And Jonathan later became--was he president of the BE--no, not BET--TV One.
Speaker 1: He, he also--I think this is the same one--this is the one that went to Chicago and was in charge of WBBM for a while or the news sec--sec--section of WBBM.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he might have been, yeah.
Speaker 1: Back in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: In the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was.  Jonathan and I were in the same class.  And--what was her name.  There was a news reporter in New York.  I wanna say Beals [Melba Pattillo Beals] or somethin', but I can't remember the last name, but she came to teach us a cou--a couple of classes.  And she was the only black woman regularly reporting for New York television, as I recall.  I can't remember her name right now.  But those--it was individual classmates that I particularly remember, not, not any professors or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Not your--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is the--this is the Fred Friendly School of Communications--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, right.
Speaker 1: --at Columbia there?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 57139
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so, so you went to WBBM in Chicago [Illinois], the CBS affiliate to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to write news.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So who were some of the other African Americans at WBBM when you arrived?
Speaker 2: Um, um, um, um, um--
Speaker 1: Well I know of Harry Porterfield [HistoryMaker].
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: He, he was there, right?
Speaker 2: That's, that's exactly who I was--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --trying to think about, Harry.  Yes, good old Harry who was something of a mentor to me.  He was just the kindest, sweetest man.  And, and when I went, my goal was--I was just going to stay there for a few months or a year; and then go back to Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] and finish my doctorate; and, and, start teaching.  But it turned out that each time I started to, to do that, something would happen and I end up getting promoted.  And the way that I got into reporting actually was, one day I was in the newsroom and--in my jeans and sweatshirt and whatever, and I was working on writing for the--for the afternoon show.  And word came over the police radio that this--police and fire radio--that this massive fire had broken out at this mansion in suburban Chicago [Illinois].  And the assignment editor was looking around, and all of the reporters were out covering stories. And so he just sort of pointed at me as the closest warm body and said, go out with the crew and get information on the fire and call it back into us; and we'll make an anchor reader out of it for the 5 o'clock news.  And so when I got out there I discovered that the very nice, quiet valedictorian high school son had murdered his mother's father, his sister's brother, the family dog, set the house on fire, and committed suicide.  And so obviously that became a page one story.  So I called it in, and the news director came on the line a few minutes later and said, "Renee', you're gonna have to a live standup at the top of the 5 o'clock news.  And I said, I can't do that; I don't--I don't do that; I'm a writer.  And she said, "Well you have to do it because we don't have time to get a reporter out there."  So I ended up doing this live standup at the top of the 5 o'clock news in my sweatshirt and my jeans about this story that had happened.  And I--honestly, I was so nervous; I have no recollection of it.  I got through it.  And, of course, there are always standard follow-ups that you do with that kind of story.  The following day, you go to the--you know, to the kids high school, and ask all of his friends and his teachers how could such a wonderful man have done such a terrible thing?  And they all go, "I don't know," and you put it--the report together.   And so--and then the next day you go to the neighborhood and you do the same thing.  And they all go, "I don't know," and you put a report together.  So by the time I'd done like three stories, the news director said, "We'd like to have you try out as a reporter."  So that's how I ended up moving into reporting.  It was not something that I was interested in or had aimed to do.  It just happened.
Story_ID: 57140
Speaker 1: Now does that make you the second black reporter from--what--was Har--Harry Porterfield [HistoryMaker]--
Speaker 2: Harry was there.
Speaker 1: --one of the reporters--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He, he was already a reporter by then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, he started off as a writer, you know?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: With editing writing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was a long time before he was able to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And there was one other woman whose name escapes me at the moment.  But she didn't--she didn't stay very long.  So anyway, I was--I was there for about a year and did reporting--a lot of feature reporting; ended up doing a public affair show, and--
Speaker 1: What, what was the public affairs show's (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I can't remember the name of it, but it was--we went out in the field and, and it--the focus was the arts.  And I got an offer to join CBS Network as a correspondent.
Speaker 1: And about what--what years are these?  Now you, you went to BBM in '71 [1971] (unclear) this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'bout--
Speaker 1: Seven--
Speaker 2: '71 [1971], so it's like '72 [1971], '73 [1973], in there.  And anyway, they made this offer for me to come be a correspondent.  And I said, no, because I felt that I hadn't reported enough; I didn't have enough experience; and I felt very strongly that if I was going to be on a network, you know, I would be representing black people before millions and millions of people.  And I didn't wanna do that without having the kind of experience that I felt was necessary.  And they flew me into New York [New York City, New York].  And the vice president of CBS News took me around and kept introducing to me--me to people as our new correspondent.  And I kept saying I'm not your new correspondent.  And we did this dance, and I finally said, you know, look, I'm serious; I, I'm not gonna accept this job.  And so I didn't.  And I went back to, to [W]BBM and continued on with my reporting there.  And I got word that they were not happy with me in New York, but so be it.  And then about a year later they came back and said, we're at--we would be interested in you still.  And I said, well I'll do it if I can report out of the Midwest bureau.  Because I knew that I would get tremendous experience because there are only like five reporters in the bureau, and we had fourteen states to cover.  So that absolutely meant you were working all the time.  And so that's what I did; and covered a lot of blizzards and a lot of droughts and standard stuff that you'd cover; and found that I was getting better and better at it; and then finally--and it turned out one year somebody had done a study and discovered that I got on the Walter Cronkite show more in one year than Lesley Stahl did, and Lesley was working out of the Washington [D.C.] bureau.  But it was exactly because, as a Midwest bureau reporter, I was out in the field constantly doing these stories, and they would end up on, on, on the Cronkite Show.
Story_ID: 57141
Speaker 1: So then my hus--my future husband and I finally decided that we really were gonna get married.  And he was--he had just gotten a job working for the Carter [President Jimmy Carter] White House at the NSC handling African affairs.  And so we decided that we were gonna get married and, and obviously live in Washington [D.C.].  And the CBS bureau folk--I, I said to them: look, thank you very much; I'm leaving; I'm gonna go; and, you know, I'll find something else to do.  And they said, no, wou--if you postpone your wedding for a year, we will find room for you in the Washington bureau.  And I said that's crazy.  And long story short, they ended up finding a space for me in the Washington bureau.
Speaker 2: And so I went to--
Speaker 1: So this is--this is during the Car--this is--now, now we're at least past 1976.  We're in what?  'Cause Carter [President Jimmy Carter] came in '76 [1976], so.
Speaker 2: I'm bad with dates, so--
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --it, it was at the beginning of the Carter administration, whenever that was.
Speaker 1: That's '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yep.  So I--they put me in to the White House as the third correspondent.  Sam Donaldson was, was number one.  They had me covering a lot of stuff on the Hill.
Speaker 1: Now CBS had--Sam Donaldson was with, with CBS then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I was bored to death because I was used to the kind of reporting that I had been doing at--in the Midwest where you're really out in the field.  And you're really involved with stories and people and this, that, and the other thing.  And this was all press conferences and news releases and all that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 57142
Speaker 1: Let me ask this now, before we go, go too far with the Washington bureau.  What, what kinds of stories did you do in the--in the Midwest that were really memorable that--and, and were they fulfilling your goal of trying to reach black people with--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --news?
Speaker 2: Generally speaking, one of the things that I did was, when I would put together any kind of story, I always had an audience--a particular audience in mind.  And it was a young black woman of sixteen.  And I'd say to myself, would she understand what I'm saying here?  Would she--how would she relate to this report?  Would it matter to her?  How can I make it matter to her?  And how can I put it into--into concepts and language that she would be comfortable with?  So that was always my starting point.  And I did--well, there was one particular story I can't--I can't remember what state it was in.  I think it was Illinois, but I can't remember.  There was a, a fire at this disco, and something like thirty or forty were killed.  And I was sent out as one three or four correspondents who, who went out there.  And there really wasn't that much for me to do, in terms of the main story.  But I--what I ended up doing was, I had been sitting watching the--they had made a, a morgue out of the local school gymnasium.  And I'd see the, the caregivers, the rabbis, and the ministers and whatever, and the priest coming and going all day long.  And I ended up doing a piece, talking to them about what the experience was like for them.  And what in the world do you say to somebody, you know, when they have lost someone in such a terrible way?  And--
Speaker 1: That wasn't the big fire in Cincinnati--right outside of Cincinnati, was it?
Speaker 2: Might have been.
Story_ID: 57143
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were actually were in Chicago [Illinois] from '70 [1970] to '78 [1978].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that's when--and you--and you got married in 1978?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And now your husband, wha--what's his name again for the record?
Speaker 2: Henry Richardson.
Speaker 1: Henry Richardson, he, he took a job in the Carter [President Jimmy Carter] Administration in African affairs?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And moved to D.C., and you all got married in se--sev--'78 [1970].  And you started with WJLA--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in Washington, okay.
Speaker 2: It was after I had come, and I was working for CBS I guess--I--was for about a year.  And as I said, I was really bored.  And so I--one day I had just--I got a call from the news director at WJLA, and they were looking for someone to anchor--co-anchor with the male anchor, David Schoumacher.  And they wanted, and it was very important--David wanted it too, that the co-anchor be equal.  And so that basically meant they had to find somebody who had network credentials, because David came from network.  And so they contacted me and asked me if, if I would be interested, and it ended up I said, yeah, sure.  And I started it anchoring at WJLA.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, all right.  So did you--did you like being an anchor, you know, rather than a reporter?  That's two different things.
Speaker 2: Very different.  Actually, I didn't particularly like being an anchor.  It--it's a very sort of--it's a very public role, and it's, it's, it's almost like being an entertainer.  And it was--I'm basically a very private, quiet kind of person, so.  And, and what I enjoy is telling other peoples' stories and getting to know them and getting out in the field and all of the things that an anchor normally doesn't (laughter) do.
Story_ID: 57144
Speaker 1: But--and when I first started out, I had a ver--a short afro.  And it turned out that that annoyed certain segments of the Washington [D.C.] community.
Speaker 2: The black section?
Speaker 1: The black section.
Speaker 2: Black women in particular?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm, yep.  As a matter of fact, one black woman wrote to me and said that, "If I had any pride in myself as a black woman, I would straighten my hair."
Speaker 2: Is that ju--just the opposite of the reason why, why--I mean, the reason you had a natural was--
Speaker 1: Right, yeah--
Speaker 2: Because of pride.
Speaker 1: --pride in myself as a black woman, yeah.  But the, the afro was considered inappropriate by primarily black women.
Speaker 2: Now this is interesting because this is--this is the late '70s [1970s], right?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: In Washington D.C.?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: With Marion Barry [HistoryMaker] was the mayor, right?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm, yep.
Speaker 2: The--this town is known as "Chocolate City"--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --or "The Chocolate City" of the, the other--of the other Chocolate cities.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Eighty percent black population at that time I believe it was. So why do you think that-
Speaker 1: [TAPE INTERRUPTED]
Speaker 2: Well it was--it was something of a surprise to me, that reaction.  But I came to understand that there was a certain segment of Washington black society that prides itself on its history and its accomplishments.  And for some black women it's being as--how can I put it diplomatically--being as, as much a part of the majority as possible.  And so that meant wearing certain kinds of clothes, and having your hair done, and belonging to certain kinds of organizations; and I didn't do any of those things, so I didn't fit in.  And I remember walking down the street one day, and this black woman and her daughter--I guess she was maybe about 12--came up to me and said, "We've been watching you, and we've come to the conclusion that you must have gotten the job because you're intelligent"--period--as opposed to intelligent and attractive.  It was, you got the job 'cause you're intelligent (laughter) 'cause you're certainly not attractive.  So it became a distraction; my hair became a distraction.  And so eventually I gave in.  I had--and I straightened it; I had it straightened.
Story_ID: 57145
Speaker 1: But what I wanted to do was concentrate on, on reporting, and what became increasingly clear to me was that in order to do that I had to get rid of the cosmetics that interfered with the story.  And when I first started out I wore glasses on set.  And I had two pairs of glasses, and I would switch off depending on what pair of glasses was near the door when I got ready to leave.  And I'd get calls after, after stories, not about the story, but about why are you wearing glasses?  I like the glasses you had on last Wednesday.  Why don't you wear those more often?  You know what I mean?  Those were the kinds of things that I kept running into that--I mean, you know, people would fixate on what blouse I was wearing or, you know, a particular pair of earrings or--
Speaker 2: Did they criticize David Schou--Schoumacher?
Speaker 1: No, um-hmm, no, this was--this was totally--it was about being a female and being a black female.  And so I learned how to present myself in a professional manner that was not distracting and so that I could focus on the content of the stories and not worrying that I was, you know, I was the story.  One of the things that convinced me finally that I was gonna have to stop, that I could not continue--I, I, I reached a stage where I, I could do the anchoring in my sleep; it became an automatic kind of thing.  And I had limited input as an anchor, in terms of the show.  And, and I didn't see real opportunity for there to be change because the more and more--increasingly it became about sales and revenue, as opposed to the story and the news, and I was not comfortable with that.
Story_ID: 57146
Speaker 1: And other black anchors at the time--I remember Max Robinson was with ABC and had similar struggles about how evening news was pitched by the writers and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --they change it, you know, at the desk sometimes about how thing--things were phrased, you know.  So were, were you a member of the National Association of Black Journalists at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I--I mean, I remember one time I was reading a story about crime in, in Sweden.  There was a major uptick in murders or something in Sweden.  And I looked down at the desk and I saw black prisoners--film of black prisoners was running as I was talking about crime in Sweden.  And it--it was--what had happened was that the tape editor was rushing to get--you know, get some tape for a voiceover and had just punched in to the computer prisoners, and it turned out that all of the film that we had was of black people being, you know, as prisoners.  And I actually apologized on the air as this was running.  And I said--you know, I said to the audience, obviously, we have the wrong video, and I--you know, I sincerely apologize.  And afterwards, I was like ballistic, but I understood, you know, the reality.  And it's the same kind of thing I went out to, to do a story on the annual report that the Urban League does.  And the, the major point of the--of the report this particular year was highlighting the fact that there are more white people on welfare than there are black people on welfare.  And so I came back out to the station and I was putting the story together, and I said, we need to have some footage of poor white people to illustrate the--you know, the point of the story.  And we said, we don't have any footage of poor white people.  And they looked genuinely stunned at the suggestion.  And I said, well go find some poor white people and take pictures of them because this is insane.  I mean, all, all of the criminals, all of the poor people, all of the unemployed people, it's nothing but blacks.  And what it was--you know, some people say, well, you know, it's a conspiracy and blah de blah.  No, it's just laziness.  It's just laziness and stupidity.  But after a certain point, I had a hard time dealing with it.
Story_ID: 57147
Speaker 1: I, I--one of the last reports that I did was--there was a story that--this undercover cop had been killed in Southeast D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  And it was--it was late, and our normal reporter was out doing a story.  And so I volunteered to go out with the crew to cover the shooting.  And we got out to the--to the street, and there was--the, the cop's body was still out in the street and it was covered with a tarp.  And the press was cordoned off in a certain area, and we were waiting for the chief of police to show up and make a statement.  And as I'm standing there with my crew just feet from the body, I start hearing my name being called.  And there were neighbors who had come out to find out what was going on.  And they began noticing--oh, it's Renee.  What is she doing out here.  And they started calling my name and saying, "Come on over!"  "Sign an autograph!"  "Come on over talk to my little boy."  And I was like I just wanted to crawl under something, you know.  Because I was there as a reporter, but they could not make that distinction.  And I totally understood from their vantage point.  I was the person who comes into their living room every night.  I was like a little star.  And so I went over to them and to talk to them and, and get them to quiet down.  And I said, you know, don't you see that body over there?--I mean, you know.  But the awful thing was, was that seeing a body in Southeast D.C. is not that unusual; seeing a television anchor in your neighborhood, that's unusual.  And I realized I can't pretend that I can do reporting anymore in this kind of environment because I am the 800 pound gorilla; I have become the 800 pound gorilla.  I just chan--by my very presence I change a story.  And fortunately, it came to, to be that I ended up getting an offer from "Primetime Live" to come work for them as a correspondent, which I did.
Speaker 2: Okay, what, what year is this?  Let me see.
Speaker 1: I left--I was at [W]JLA for thirteen years, so '78 [1978], '88 [1988].
Speaker 2: About 19--
Speaker 1: Ninety-one [1991]--'91 [1991], '92 [1992]--
Speaker 2: Ninety--
Speaker 1: Ninety [1990] in there.
Speaker 2: --(Unclear) yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 57148
Speaker 1: So I went to "Prime Time Live" and--
Speaker 2: How did that offer--did they--did you get offers all the time or was this a special instance or circumstance?
Speaker 1: It was--it was I believe--I'm tryin' to remember.  No, it wasn't--there wasn't anything special about it.  It was--it was--I had, in the--in the course of, of doing various and sundry things for [W]JLA [WJLA, Washington, D.C.], I had met different network executives.  And, and my agent--I had an agent then--my agent knew that I was interested in getting out of [W]JLA and doing something else and, and doing something else that involved reporting, and so he's the one who came up with the offer from "Prime Time Live."  And so I went--I went there; I was there for three years.  I won three Emmy Awards.
Speaker 2: Now wha--what stories did you win Emmy Awards for?
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh, let me see.  One, one was for a story on Senator McGovern's daughter who was an alcoholic.  One was a story on the anniversary of the death of Anne Frank, where I went to, to the Netherlands.  And one was--I believe it was a story about a, a shooting at a subway station or something that I did where a, a man was killed.  And I think I did a story about his widow who became this adamant gun violence opposer.  So as I recall, those were the three.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 57149
Speaker 1: And I did some fun things too.  I interviewed Charles Barkley; did a profile on him; did a profile on Sammy--Samuel Jackson.  Again, I realized at a certain point that I might not have a permanent home there when I was out in the field and Toni Morrison--word came that she had gotten the Nobel.  And I called the executive producer and I said, "The next profile I do has gotta be Toni Morrison.  I've met her.  She's wonderful.  It's gonna be great."  And there was this pause, a silence.  And the executive producer said, "But we've already done Alice Walker."  And I said (laughter), "What does that have to do with anything?"  And it was at that point she realized kind of what she'd said.   And I said, "Look, clearly, we need to have a discussion about this."  And we did, in fact, when I got back to the--to--a few days later when I got back to the studio.  We had a meeting of some of the staff at my request to talk about certain kinds of racial sensitivity.  And everybody was very pleasant.  And I realized that it was like going over their heads or going behind their heads, or whatever; it wasn't really penetrating.  And I realized that I was tired, that I didn't feel like taking on the burden of educating a new group of white people about black people.  And the stories that I was interested in covering, which had to do with black people and women, were not the stories that they were particularly interested in.  One of the last stories I did for them was a story about how to get bacteria out of your kitchen sponge.  And it was--because it was 'Prime Time,' they made a big deal out of it.  And they got these five young families in Suburban New Jersey to allow them to follow them around with cameras for days taking shots of them in their kitchens and handling their babies and this, that, and the other thing with a special black light to show where bacteria was.  And she--you know, she picked up the pork chop, and the bacteria from the pork chop was on her hand.  And then she picked up her baby, and she moved her baby.  And so the bacteria from the pork chop is now on her baby.  And then the, the culmination was, they sent data out to these testing stations.  And it came back there was one particular homemaker who had the most bacteria on her baby or something like that.  I mean, it was just insane.  And I, I wanted to say (laughter) to all of these--these couples is, you must be crazy.  Why in the world would you let, you know, camera crews into your home that--and, and allow yourself to be humiliated in front of millions of people?  And a few days later, the executive producer called me in and said, oh, you--oh, the reaction to that report, it's been fantastic; I mean, really, people just love that.  We--we're thinking about doing like a series of those kind of, you know, how to things and, you know, news you can use kind of thing, you know.  And so I basically was saying to myself, I gotta get outta here.  And I did and started my own documentary production company.
Speaker 2: This is in '93 [1993] then?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 57150
Speaker 1: Okay, so your production company was called?
Speaker 2: Wisdom Works.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we did--I'm tryin' to remember.  We did a biography of Dorothy Height ["The Life and Surprising Times of Dr. Dorothy Height," 2001].
Speaker 1: Now where was it--did you have a distribution system for your work?
Speaker 2: No, it was--the distribution system was me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so this biography of Dorothy Height then, was it shown on public te--television or?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, it was shown--yeah, it was shown--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --on public television.  And we also did--the main one that we did was a documentary called "A Journey Towards Peace" ["Tutu and Franklin: A Journey Towards Peace," 1998] that involved Archbishop [Desmond] Tutu and John Hope Franklin and twenty one high school students from three different countries.  And we took them all over to Goree Island.  And the students were all housed together and told that they had to work through their racial stereotypes and ethnic stereotypes of each other, and come up with recommendations that they would present to Archbishop Tutu and John Hope Franklin--recommendations for better race relations in their respective countries.  And then Tutu had just finished his report on the Truth and Rec--Reconciliation Commission for Mandela.  And Franklin had just finished the report on race relations in America for Clinton [President William Jefferson Clinton].  And so I suggested that the two men get together and share what they had determined--discovered.  And they had never met before, so that turned out to be really wonderful.  And so we shot for about two weeks.  And it--we did an educational component.  We had study guides and discussion guides and all of that kind of stuff.  And it ended up, it was shown on PBS, and it was also shown at--in forty different states, at community organizations, and schools.  And that was really one of the best experiences of my life.  That was--that was truly wonderful.
Story_ID: 57151
Speaker 1: Now, now had--were you--were--had--I, I was watching some stuff last night on YouTube about this and I--I was--I, I think on C-SPAN you were telling a gentlemen on C-SPAN that, that the project was informed by some of your other trips to South Africa, that you had--you had been before when the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --apartheid struggle was going on.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah.
Speaker 1: And met Bishop Tutu [Archbishop Desmond Tutu] and probably some others.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, I had--I had--when--before the revolution, Archbishop Tutu was one of the few African--South Africans who were allowed to come over with some regularity, and so I had met him.  And whenever he would come, I would always do some sort of report on his visit; so I got to know him.  And when he was to be installed as Archbishop, he invited like--I think there were like five Americans or something--to come to his installation in South Africa.  And I was one of those five, and I was the only one that the South African Embassy refused to give a visa to.
Story_ID: 57152
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, so anyway.
Speaker 2: [OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was the only one that, of the five that Tutu [Archbishop Desmond Tutu] had invited, that the [South African] Embassy refused to give a visa to. And I got word that it was because of all of the reports--the pro-South African, you know revolutionary, you know, reports I'd been doing.
Story_ID: 57153
Speaker 1: Let me say this, now this is the time I--I remember ABC was really on South Africa.  "Nightline" had many specials about South Africa and it seemed like ABC was taking the lead.  I don't know if--I, I don't--I don't think I was only just wa--watching ABC on the--on the news.  It seemed like--most of the special reports about, you know, Soweto [Johannesburg, South Africa] and the uprising there and (unclear) when they were in--I saw Allan Boesak and everybody else on ABC.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was this pretty much--
Speaker 2: Yeah, part of it was, was also the Ted Coppell was very interested, and he, of course, had, had Nightline as, as a forum.  So anyway, word got leaked to the--to the "Post" about my visa problems, and they published a little blurb.  And the next--the day before I was supposed to leave for South Africa I got my visa.  And, and I was given the visa; I think it was for a one-week stay.  And I was supposed to not do anything that had to do with journalism.  So, of course, I immediately (laughter), once I got over there, made connections and (clearing throat), and managed to get into some of the townships, riding around on the--in the bottom of cars and--you know, with blankets over me and all that kinda stuff.  So it was--it was a tense, but, but fascinating time.
Speaker 1: So this, this is prior to Nelson Mandela's release (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, so this is in the '80's [1980s], I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So then yeah.
Speaker 2: And so when, when Mandela [Nelson Mandela] came to the United States for the first time and came to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: That's in '91' [1991] (unclear).
Speaker 2: I was--I was, along with a, a colleague of mine--we hosted this big event at the--I think it was at the--was it the Convention Center?--can't remember--where ever the, the--this big rally was for, for Mandela.  And that was the first time I got to meet him.  It was really exciting.
Story_ID: 57154
Speaker 1: Okay, so "Tutu and Franklin: A Journey Towards Peace," that was in--it was released, released in '98 [1998] I think.
Speaker 2: I think it was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I think it had a life of--several years after it was released.  It was--'cause I know the C-SPAN piece I saw on the Internet last night was from 2001.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The people were still talking about it and, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was very well received.  And, and it was (laughter)--it was sort of like reality TV, but for race relations.  And, and the, the kids were, were phenomenal, the, the group that we managed to get together.  And then we were able to, to sort of follow along and see what happened to them afterwards, you know--not as much as I would like to have followed along.  But I got to travel again to South Africa.  And I--I had--I'd been to South Africa for the Discovery Channel, working on a project.  It didn't come to anything, but it allowed me to stay there for, for a while.  So it, it, it came to be one of my favorite places.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now you also did work during this period I think for A&E?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And Lifetime Channel?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I believe, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: The A&E thing was, was mainly their biography of Malcolm X, which I narrated.  And I can't even remember.  I did stuff for, for Discovery, and Lifetime, and PBS; and they all sort of blend together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was the A&E "Biography of Malcolm X" [sic] ["Malcolm X"] near the time of the Malcolm X movie?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And that would have been 1994 I think or so?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, honestly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was--it was at the tail-end of my stay at "Primetime Live."
Speaker 1: Okay, so then nine--'92 [1992], then going to '93 [1993], yep.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That makes sense; that makes sense.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you said for Lifetime you did--
Speaker 2: I can't remember what I did for Lifetime.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I honestly can't.
Story_ID: 57155
Speaker 1: All right, so, so did you like, you know, working with your own pro--production company better than--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I--I'm, I'm much--temperamentally, I'm, I'm much better suited (laughter) to be my own boss than to, to work for other people.  And the, the thing that I didn't love, of course, is what every documentarian hates, which was raising the money for the documentary.  So I spent a lot of time begging, and you know, filling out forms for grants and having interviews, and you know, this, that, and the other thing.  And the thing that got me over the hump was, was Camille Cosby and her contribution to the whole project.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so she made a contribution to some--at some point?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Early on.  And she had apparent--I, I am not quite sure how she heard about it, but she did.  And her office called me and said, you know, she'd be interested in, in talking to me about contributing.  So, at first I thought it was a joke, but she was absolutely serious, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is--this is towards--this is in--this is in--later in the '90s [1990s] "The Cosby Show" I guess had been during the, the mid--late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) made a lot of--made a--it was the number one show on television, lots of money made, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so Camille was very generous.  She, she was a major contributor to "Tutu and Franklin" ["A Journey Towards Peace"].  The rest was all foundation grants and stuff.  And she was also a major contributor for the Dorothy Height film.
Story_ID: 57156
Speaker 1: Okay.  I didn't ask you about working with Dorothy Height, but I should ask you.  What, what is she like?
Speaker 2: Dorothy was a very special woman.  And, and she had a very young spirit, despite being in her nineties.  And she had a will of steel.  When she made up her mind she was gonna do something, she did it.  That in her last years, the focus was on getting this building for the, you know, National--
Speaker 1: Council of Negro Women.
Speaker 2: Council of Negro Women.  And loads of people told her, you know, this is not the time; you can't get people to give money for buildings; I mean, every kind of excuse in the world why this is a bad idea.  And she just kept moving forward.  And she got it.  And she wanted to have one building on Pennsylvania Avenue that was the root for presidents for their inauguration, owned by a black organization.  And she achieved that.  And she was a very humble woman, amazingly so.  Part of her--that was part of defining who she--who she was, it also got her into some problems because she did not like taking the spotlight in certain kinds of situations.  And she was--in so many instances when you see the, you know, photos from the civil rights period, and, and you see the leaders of the Civil Rights Movements--organizations, Dorothy would very often be the one who's in the corner in the back, you know.  And you can identify her because she always has a hat on.  But she didn't push her way up to the front.  And there were many people, particularly women, who felt that she should have pushed her way up to the front, that she accepted too easily this role standing in the background.  But that's where she was comfortable, and she was able to effect change from that position and with a certain kind of fist of steel, you know, and the velvet glove kind of approach.
Story_ID: 57157
Speaker 1: So one of the--at one point, I was in South Africa, and I was--Dorothy was there, and we were--we were covering her.  And there was a march of--I think it was union workers, and they asked Dorothy if she would join the march.  And she was in a wheelchair and said, yeah, sure.  And so we have pictures of her at the head of this march in her wheelchair with her fist raised, saying, "By any means necessary," you know.  And this was a woman--she was like ninety years old, you know, but she just would not let, let anything stop her.  And, and she also had a, a wicked sense of humor that very few people got to, to see.  And she was just a good, kind, amazingly intelligent organizer who was committed to changing the lives of black people.  And I have nothing but admiration for her.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think a lot of people assume that she's from some sort of a big money background or something, but that's not true.
Speaker 1: No, um-hmm, no, no.  She came I think from a mining town in Pennsylvania.  And (laughter), and she, you know, she talked about wanting to--about loving to play basketball when she was in school, but the problem was she couldn't shoot (laughter) very well--like yeah, well, that is a problem.  And talked about winning--debating contests when she was in high school and going to the statewide semifinals and discovering that she went with one of her teachers and discovering that there was no place--they couldn't find a room that would--a place that would rent to them as black people.  And she had to spend the night before the debate sleeping in the theater where the debate was going to be given, because she had no place to stay.  But she still ended up winning the debate.  And she just, you know, she, she had a number of, of stories that really--if you, if you could get her to talk about the personal side as opposed to the professional side, you, you really had a very strong sense of, of who she was as, as a person and the fact that she had given up certain things, like a family, you know.  And that was something that, that aided her at different times and that she knew that she'd missed out on.  But she made her place in history, so.
Story_ID: 57158
Speaker 1: Now what about John Hope Franklin who--we, we mentioned Desmond Tutu when we had talked about Dr. Franklin.
Speaker 2: Yeah, John Hope [John Hope Franklin] was wonderful.  I, I describe myself as a John Hope groupie.  He--we, we got to know each other pretty well, as a result of "Tutu and Franklin." And I found him to be--well, obviously brilliant, but also just amazingly kind and very, very determined, a quintessential gentleman.  He tells a story about when he belonged to this club here in Washington.  It was--might have been the Cosmos Club; I'm not sure.  But he was--he was the first and only black who was admitted to this club.  And one, one year he was getting the presidential medal of freedom or honor or whatever it is for the highest civilian award from the White House.  And so he flew in for that.  And he had arranged to have some of his friends meet him at the club for dinner.  And so they were waiting for a couple of people to show up, and he went downstairs to the front door to see if they were down there.  And he said this white woman came in and handed him her coat and said, "Check that for me."  And her assumption that he was the bellhop of something, you know.  I mean, well it, it speaks volumes.  What--basically he, he just said, "You know, madam, I don't work here."  And I don't know whether or not he pointed to his portrait on the wall (laughter) or not, but he, he did it in a very dignified, very--you know, not angry just--this is the reality, you know, deal with it kind of thing--when so many other people, you know, particularly at his stage in life, with all of the accolades and all of the things that he had done, to have the--you know, the realization that in many people's eyes you are still just a bellhop, you know, and that's what you'll always be.  And he took that in stride.  And his, his way of, of dealing with it and fighting it was through his intellect, through his mind, and his books, and his writing.  And he's just made phenomenal contributions.  And he loved orchids.  I was at his house once, and he took me out into the back in the area where he kept his, his orchids.  And he created one and named it after his wife.  And--just--he was--he was really--he loved to cook--loved to eat; he was a Renaissance man in many respects.  He was really quite, quite something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 57159
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about now the National Visionary Leadership Project?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now this, this starts in what year?
Speaker 2: Wow, you get me with these years?
Speaker 1: I think--let me see--let me see--do I have a note?
Speaker 2: For some reason I'm thinking--I don't know 2000.
Speaker 1: Does, does 2000 sound right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, around there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that came about through conversations that Camille Cosby and I had about lamenting the fact that there was all of these wonderful elders that we both knew whose stories were not being preserved.  And the more we talked, the more we thought about putting an organization together that would not only preserve those, those stories, but would also teach young people how to go into their own local communities and do stories about local elders.  And so we decided to start NVLP [National Visionary Leadership Project], and that's how it came about.
Speaker 1: Now, a, about--now I got to thinking about 1997 or '98 [1998], in that area, the--National Public Radio broadcast some excerpts from the Library of Congress archives on--of, of slave narratives that were recorded back in the 1930s I think for the WPA.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Often there would--the young whites--college students were interviewing all older black people, often people living on the same plantation that they owned--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --sometimes, you know, about their remembering this is slavery.  And those were broadcast on--and people had never heard those.  We had never heard 'em before, and they had been in archives all that and never been played.  That--had you heard about those at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I had heard about them.  I had not heard them, but I had heard about them.  And one of the things that I'm--that I'm proudest of is that the Library of Congress has an archive of the NVLP interviews that were done also.  Because I see it as--you know, as one continuum of sort of filling in the gaps of our history.  So for me it was the perfect job because I got to do--to combine reporting--interviewing.  I had the, the excitement of building a program, particularly a program focused on young people, which is where my loyalties lie.  I'm always tryin' to think in terms of that 16-year-old girl and how to make her life better.  And so all of the--all of the elements came together, and we were able to create this organization that went on for several years.
Story_ID: 57160
Speaker 1: Now can you tell us like the scope of the project and then and how did it work 'cause I know there is a, a youth, an elder, an intergenerational dialogue--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --component--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we, we--well, Camille and I sort of divided up some of the interviews with some of the more famous elders.  Like, she did Sidney Poitier and--who am--I'm thinking about Russ--what a minute--the basketball player.
Speaker 1: Bill Russell.
Speaker 2: Bill Russell, thank you.  And I did (laughter) everybody, everybody that she didn't do.  We were doing I think about fifty a year.  In order to be an elder considered for the project, you had to be seventy or above.  (Laughter) I'll never forget there's a particular congressperson who we invited to be a visionary, and we didn't get any response from him.  And I ran into him at a function, and I said, you know, "So, what's your answer?"  And he said, "Well, I'm not seventy yet."  And I said, "But all of your biographical information says that you're, you know, seventy."  And he says, "Oh, that."  He said, "See, when I first started out in politics, people thought that I was a lot younger than I was.  I had this sort of baby face, and so in order to impress people, I advanced my age.  So actually the age that is in the biographies is actually wrong.  I'm younger than that."  And I said, "Okay, then when are you gonna be seventy?"  And he said, "Well, I'll let you know."  And that was it (laughter), and we never heard from him again.  So seventy for some people is a--you know, a reasonable cutoff and for some others, they just didn't wanna get there.  But--and so we, we would identify, you know, various elders, and just contact them, and travel to where they were, and, and do the interviews.  And then we also had this component where we contacted different schools and started kind of small chapters where young people would be encouraged to go out and interview elders in their own local communities.  And we would work with the faculty at the school to help them to learn how to work equipment and, you know, do the interviews and this, that, and the other thing.  And then we had scholarships that we gave for winners who did outstanding projects.  And each year we would bring all of the students who were part of the program--and there were usually about 30 I think, to Washington for several days of meetings with elders and this, that, and the other thing.  So it, it was--the emphasis was very much on intergenerational; that was very, very important to us.  And it worked remarkably well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 57161
Speaker 1: So, now is the program [National Leadership Visionary Project] still going on or is it--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, no, I left awhile ago.  I (laughter)--it was the, the price of, of success.  As--as CEO, my job basically changed from creating the program to raising money for the programs.  And that became my full-time job.  And there is nothing that I hate more than going out and trying to be a fundraiser.  And since that's what the organization needed, I said, you know, thank you very much.  You need to hire somebody to go do that.  So since then, I moved into doing individual consulting for different people and worked on getting a certificate in multimedia, doing a lot of volunteering and mentoring, and now doing--teaching at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were with the National Visionary Leadership Project for ten years I think or, or just about, right?
Speaker 2: Was, was that on it?  It was--it was close to that--something like that.  (Unclear) I think it might have been shorter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  To 2000 to 2010, I guess.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't that long.
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I think it was--it was closer to, to six years, not ten, yeah.
Speaker 1: Six years, oh, to 2006.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About that.
Speaker 1: All right, I know a book was pub--published as a result in 2004 I believe, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: A Wealth of Wisdom.
Speaker 1: A Wealth of Wisdom.
Speaker 2: Yeah, an extraordinary or "". Legendary African Elders Speak And--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were excerpts--
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --from the interviews that we did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 57162
Speaker 1: Did, did you have any favorite ex--well, all of them probably are, but what, what comes to mind right now?
Speaker 2: Oh, well there are all sorts of different ones.  One, one, one who we interviewed--the first black admiral, and he was this very gruff--he was one of the toughest interviews that I did.  Anyway, he was tall and, and strong, and he was very, very self-confident.  And so his wife was there in the background--and a very vivacious and energetic woman.  And so I said to him--and they have a couple of kids--and I said to him, you know, you've done--you've spent months and months and months away from your family.  What was it like when you would come back?  How did you manage to reintegrate yourself into the family?  And he said, well we never had any problems with that.  I mean, we never--I, I never had any problems with that.  And I said--I said, wait a minute (clearing throat), military families have this problem all the time--you're gone; you come back; your kids have forgotten, you know, what you were like.  How did you deal with that?  And so I kept pressing him, and finally he said, "Okay, look, I come back; I take my wife into the bedroom.  By the time we came out, there was no problem.  Okay?  End of discussion."  That's (laughter) all he had to say about it.  And I said--I looked at him--I was just--I just started laughing.  I said, no, you did not just say that to me.  And his wife was over in the corner, and she had her head in her hands like this.  I mean, it was really--it's, it's hysterically funny.
Story_ID: 57163
Speaker 1: And then another time, I was interviewing Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King].  And I was asking her about her childhood and this, that, and the other thing.  And she was telling me about all of the wonderful things she did and how she was salutatorian, and she sang in the choir, and she did this, that, and the other thing.  And I said, okay, let's, let's all agree that you were a saint when you were a child, okay.  But didn't you ever do anything when you were a lil--a kid that was, you know, out of the ordinary or mischievous or anything like that?  And she thought for a while and she said, "Well there was this one thing.  There was this, this boy.  He was really gettin' on my nerves.  I guess I was about--I, I don't know.  I was about nine--ten years old, something like that.  He was really bothering me and, and we got into an argument.  And there just happened to be this axe, and I don't know.  He ended up with a cut.  It wasn't a deep cut.  I mean, it wasn't a lot of blood, but his mother just got so upset with me.  And she was yelling and screaming and talking about how she was gonna have me put in jail and this, that, and the other thing.  And, and, my brother and my sister, you know, were talking about your--you just keep getting in trouble, and you're a Tom boy, and you--you know, we're tired of this."  And she said, "So I decided that from that point on I was going to spend all of my time learning how to be a lady.  And so by the time I graduated from high school I was a lady, and nothing like that ever happened again."  I thought that was so cute.  The idea that, you know--you know, Coretta Scott King, you know, used this axe to cut this kid, you know.  And--but I, I love those kinds of anecdotes because they show, particularly to young people--they show that these folk that you think of as icons are really very, very human and that they, they make mistakes, and they mess up just the way you do, and they deal with it, you know.  And sometimes I have to say to some of these--some of the icons who didn't wanna talk about mistakes or difficulties through this, that, and the other thing.  I'd say, you know, but you have to for the sake of the students, for the same of the young people who are gonna listening to this.  Because they have to understand the truth of what's involved and how hard it is and, you know, what you had to go through so that they can feel that there's hope for them too, you know.  And it took a fair amount of, of convincing sometimes, but ninety-five percent of the time they, they always came through, and the interviews were just always inspiring to me.
Story_ID: 57164
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, I just wanted to ask you about the Cosbys.  Camille Cosby seems to take a keen interest in black life and, you know, the development of black people as--as her--her husband does.  And occasionally he gets in trouble for, you know--in some (unclear) for what he might say, but nobody can deny he's got a keen interest--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in, in his people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they, they, they--as a couple I think that they're, they're, they're both tremendously committed to, to the welfare of black people.  And, and Camille, she's an interesting kind of combination of being fiercely pro-African American and, and very concerned and, and, and determined to be involved and to make an impact, but being personally very, very shy and, and quiet spoken.  And one of the things that, that was an ongoing kind of struggle in--as we were working together with NVLP [National Visionary Leadership Project] was that she was very--she would never wanna take the spotlight.  She would never wanna be the one who was making the speech or, or you know, thanking people for coming or this, that, and the other.  She always would want to fade into the background, and I was always kind of pushing her saying, come on Camille, you know, get out there; let people see you.  Let--but she wanted to let her resources tell the story and do the work.  The difficulty was that she had hoped that there would be more people who would step forward and contribute the way she and Bill [Cosby] contributed.  And it--that turned out not to be the case, and I think that was a tremendous disappointment to her. And, you know, there's so many not-for-profits that our struggling, particularly those that are oriented towards African Americans--and you look around at, at, you know, some of the sports figures for instance, some of the entertainers and, you know, are making gazillions of dollars, and you're tra--tryin' to figure out, well, why aren't they more giving the way the Cosbys are giving.  And, and, you know, some of the other African Americans who, who are--have really made a commitment to helping, you know, black folk, and it's something that I never understood.  I mean, and I've had conversations with some entertainers and some sports figures, and I put that question to them, and I've never gotten an answer that to me makes a lot of sense.  But hopefully that will change.
Story_ID: 57165
Speaker 1: Did you all try to primarily raise money amongst the, the black community--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We tried everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But pra--initially, it was primarily the black community.  Because thi--this was a project for African Americans, you know, by African Americans.  But it was--it was American history.  And, you know, the idea was that we wanted to keep it as, as honest and straightforward as possible, with no suggestion that, you know, anything had to be compromised.  And, and we kept it that way.  I mean, we, we insisted, you know, no subjects were off limits.  There were no restrictions on, on, you know, how we dealt with anyone or what we did with the material.  The whole point was to get this information out in as many ways as possible and to get the next generation, the younger generation, involved in understanding how important these elders are and how much they can learn from them and getting them to feel as committed as, as we are.  We did a, a project with Dunbar High School here in the District [Washington, D.C.].  And it started primarily because, as I was traveling around the country interviewing these elders, a number of them would say, I wou--I grew up in Washington.  I went to Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington, D.C.].  Well that was the only academically oriented high school that they could go to.  And so we decided, well, we need to find out more about Dunbar.  And we ended up doing a project where we worked with, with Dunbar students, again, teaching them how to do interviews and working with the teachers to--in terms of their learning more history and then helping them to video tape interviews with elders in their local communities.  And, and then we had--the school had a special assembly where they show the work of the students.  And it, it--and they made excerpts from the interviews part of their courses in D.C. history.  And so it's, it's--the impact of the work sort of flowed.  And that was what usually would make me feel the most fulfilled would be to see that kind of result coming from the work that we were doing.
Story_ID: 57166
Speaker 1: Now what was the criteria for selecting the subjects.  You said there was an age criteria, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But was there some kind of yardstick to measure their success or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was really--it was--it was really fairly subjective.  Initially, it was that they needed to have made some sort of major impact on African Americans.  And there's plenty to choose from.  I mean, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, you know, scientists, Bill Russell, Maya Angelou.  I mean, the list goes on and on and on.  And it--sometimes the difficulty was that some of the elders didn't wanna talk about themselves.  They, they felt that--some of them felt it was bragging, and they, you know, felt it was inappropriate.  And some of them just felt, you know, people don't need to hear this story; you know, it's not, it's not important.  And my, my feeling is they're important.  And that is--part of whatever legacy I can leave is those stories.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Typically, how long would an interview be?  'Cause I know oral history can be--UCLA can interview somebody for a week.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I've seen those, those kind of tapes--these long, long interviews, or they could be three hours, or they could be a couple of days.  I mean, what was the scope--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Generally, they'd run about three hours, sometimes a little longer, but particularly because we were dealing with elders, they get tired.  And we'd have, have to break it up, you know.  Sometimes we'd do two hours one day and then stay over and do, you know, two hours the next day.
Speaker 1: Okay, and now you and Camille Cosby were interviews, but you had like young people too interviewing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --young people who, who were interviewing local elders in their own communities.
Speaker 1: In how many cities were--how (unclear)?
Speaker 2: We had I think about 15 colleges that were participating with us, in terms of the program for the young people.  And then we just went to, you know, wherever the elders were we went, in terms of states.  So it, it really was a national effort, you know.  And for a while there, it was like living out of a suitcase again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 57167
Speaker 1: Now The HistoryMakers started up in 1999, around the same time.  Was there--and--I know when I got started out, I hadn't heard about the project.  But people would always--would ask me what I thought about--but I said, well, I don't know.  I haven't been in it (laughter).  And did you have the same kind of feeling of shadowing somebody--someone else--somebody else's project or, or, or, or this sense of another group doing the same--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--I was definitely aware of The HistoryMakers and very excited about what they were doing.  And, and there was a different kind of focus.  I mean, we were never talking about doing, you know, 5,000 interviews.  We were never talking about anything that, that large.  And we were--we restricted ourselves to elders.  And then the other thing that, that really differentiated us was our focus on the intergenerational and the young people and the educational programs.  So, I saw them--the two organizations as complimentary, in terms of what we were doing.
Story_ID: 57168
Speaker 1: Now what about some of the young people that participated?  Have you kept up with some of them?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, I haven't.  I don't--I really don't know what--what's happened with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But hopefully they're doing great things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would hope so.  I would think so 'cause, you know--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --by virtue of the fact that they were exposed to all that wisdom.
Speaker 2: Yep, one would hope.
Speaker 1: Okay, now the program is not going on, but is there a way for people that participated to, to communicate with each other or to?
Speaker 2: Well there was for a while.  I don't know if, if it's continuing.  I honestly don't know, so I'm not gonna--I'm not gonna speculate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: So the collection is housed now at the--
Speaker 2: Library of Congress.
Speaker 1: Library of Congress.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So I guess the Library of Congress would I guess be I guess a place where people can touch base with it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and see.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And all the interviews are available right now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as far as I know they're--
Speaker 1: So Library of Congress on-online or do they have to actually--
Speaker 2: I don't think they're all online.  I'm pretty sure they're not all online; I think some of them are.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About how many of them are there actually?
Speaker 2: As I recall, there were 200 and somethin'--200, yeah, 200--300 in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, so after 2006, you've been basically doing your own production work?
Speaker 2: Doing--doing consultant work and doing--going back to school, doing some studying, and doing a lot of mentoring and volunteering.
Speaker 1: Okay, you do motivational speaking too or?
Speaker 2: Occasionally, not very often.  I, I find my greatest pleasure is working with children.  And so there are a couple of organizations that I--that I work with and do tutoring, and mentor a couple of little boys.  And I, I try and find situations where I can be very hands-on as opposed to, to speaking about being hands-on.  And that's-- often when I--when I make contact with an organization, they'll say, oh, It'll be wonderful to have you on our board.  And I say, no, you got the wrong person.  That's not what I'm here for.  I'm here to come help wash the dishes, and serve the table, and mentor the kids, and--you know, that's what I do, so.

Speaker 1: Okay, now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, and you've done so many things.  Is there any major thing you would do differently if you could change it?
Speaker 2: Wow, I, I can't say that there really is.  I've, I've thought about that occasionally.  I don't have any regrets about anything that I've done.  And I don't think that I would--I would change it.  If anything, I wanna travel more; I wanna see more of the world.  And I want to get back to writing again.  I got away from that for a while, and I started--I started taking some courses.  Part of my difficulty is that I, I got very good at writing for broadcast, which means you don't u--use adjectives and adverbs (laughter), and you make very brief sentences.  But if you're trying to write fiction, it doesn't work very well.  So I wanna get back in touch with more of my creative side.  And that's one of the things that I'm working on.
Speaker 1: And did you have a burning project that you wanna finish--you know, a writing project or a film pro--project.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, not, not one in particular, but I--I think I would like to write a book.  It'll probably be fiction.  But I have to get past a number of hurdles, emotional and psychological, before I'm able to do that.  And I also still like filmmaking very much.  And, you know, there may be another--occasionally, I'm, I'm approached about, you know, doing narration for different projects and, this, that, and the other thing.  And if I believe in the cause, I'll say yeah, sure, and I do it.  And hopefully they'll be opportunities for more involvement beyond the narration part, 'cause I, I enjoy writing, and I enjoy putting films together.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, we always ask this question: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Speaker 2: I worry sometimes that African-American folk have lost sight of their history and lost sight of the importance of a certain cohesiveness.  I'm particularly concerned about young black people who believe that there is no such thing as racism, that because we have a black president it's sort of taken care of that problem.  And they seem--I worry about them because they seem woefully unprepared for some of the roadblocks that they're gonna run into.  And I just worry that we get so caught up in material things and making money and reaching certain positions that we lose track of why it matters, what values we should have, what difference we can make, and that we owe whatever we have to those who came before us and that we can't lose sight of that.  And sometimes, unfortunately, I think we do.
Speaker 1: Okay, what today, when you look back over every--everything you've done at this point, would you con--consider to be your, your legacy?
Speaker 2: Probably my legacy would be the interviews that I did with the elders that are at the Library of Congress.  I don't really think much about my legacy as a broadcaster, because TV is such an ephemeral kind of entity that stuff is done, and then it appears and then it disappears.  So I've never attached a great deal of, of importance to holding on to those elements.  So I would say--I would say my legacy would be the interviews.

Speaker 1: Okay, now tell me about your family now.  You didn't talk about children.  Did you ever have--
Speaker 2: No children.
Speaker 1: No children?  Okay.
Speaker 2: No, just me and my husband 36 years of marriage.  And he teaches at Temple Law School in Philadelphia [Temple University James E. Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And it's, it's been 36 years of making a marriage work.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  You've been very thorough.  I can't think of anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, and we haven't moved from these seats since--
Speaker 2: I know, I know.
Speaker 1: Over three and a half hours.

Speaker 1: But the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as an African-American woman who cared about her people and used what talents she had to make a difference in their lives.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
