Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight, People magazine-ish-type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I do.  I was just thinking about all the desserts that I like (laughter), sweet potato pie probably is my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, you know what I'm thinking.  I'm, I'm wondering if these answers are the same as we did--
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: --the first time.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: This is, for those, we did this before, but the audio didn't turn.  We're doing this again.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But the--okay, do you--
Speaker 2: Does it--
Speaker 1: --have a favorite--
Speaker 2: --does it need to match up with the transcript or something, or?
Speaker 1: Oh no, no--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, I don't--
Speaker 1: --because I don't think--
Speaker 2: I don't really know.
Speaker 1: --they could even get a transcript last time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I'm just, I'm just wondering though.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But do, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Green.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Winter, I like winter.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Right now it's Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: The one that comes to mind is pass it on, yeah, pass it on.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 145575
Speaker 1: Now, we're, we're gonna, I wanna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's Mildred McEwen, Mildred Blackmon McEwen, M-I-L-D-R-E-D, Blackmon, B-L-A-C-K-M-O-N, McEwen, M-C-E-W-E-N.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: May 2nd, 1931, Abbeville, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: A-B-B-E-Y-V-I-L-L-E [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, where is Abbeville in relationship, I guess, to--
Speaker 2: It's actually right next door to Oxford [Mississippi].  I can't tell you which direction, but they're very, they're right next door to each other.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, what, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How, how far back can you trace your mother's family?
Speaker 2: Well, I know about my grandmother, Annie.  That's my mother's birth mother.  And her father is Charlie Blackmon.  Annie's mother is--actually, on, on, on my grandfather's side, his grandmother is Emma, and her husband is Felix, so those are my great-grandparents.  And my great-great-grandparents on my grandfather's side, my mother's father's side, is Sara--no, I'm mistaking.  It's Susie, Susie McBride, and her husband was a man by the name of Indian McBride, and there the line stops.  We don't know much about the family history from there.
Speaker 1: That's on your, your mother's--
Speaker 2: Father's side.
Speaker 1: Father's side, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And we know that Indian Mc- Indian McBride was, well, he was Indian.  They took away his first name and called him Indian.  We don't know what his real first name was.
Speaker 1: And so he, he was Indian?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Cherokee.  And the story goes that he was a full-blooded Cherokee, but, again, I don't know his real first name.
Speaker 1: So he's your great--what is he?
Speaker 2: Great-great.
Speaker 1: Great-great-grandfather.
Speaker 2: Grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that takes us back how far do you think? Back into the 19th century, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now would, would he have been around, was, was, his, was his time like mostly after slavery or during re, Reconstruction, or what do you think?
Speaker 2: His time and Susie's time would have been during slavery.  Emma, my great-grandmother, and her husband, Felix, would have been children of slaves.  So they could have been slaves as little children.  The story goes that Felix came from a slave family, but he was not, he was not a slave as an adult, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So that's right as, so this takes us to 1860s, I guess.
Story_ID: 145576
Speaker 1: All right, now, are, are there any stories about, about what the end of slavery was like, or did they pass down a story about it, or observations about it, or?
Speaker 2: You know, if there are any, Larry [Crowe], I don't know them.  What I do, the, the parts of the stories that I remember are that [Burgess' maternal great-grandfather] Felix had run away from his family, his slave family, and met my, my great-grandmother, Emma.  But I don't really know of any narratives, any stories.
Speaker 1: So he ran away while the, when he was enslaved he ran away, or did he?  Is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: No, that's not what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I believe this was after emancipation--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that he ran away from his family.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And his parents would have been slaves at some point in time, but I don't have that story.  I just know that from the dates and from the little pieces of the stories that I've heard.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is there, is there a story about why he ran away?  When you say he ran away from his family, that implies that something was going on he didn't like, so he got away from them, or--
Speaker 2: That's, that's possible--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --but I don't know the details of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That would be speculation at this point, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he, so, how far did he go?  I mean were they, I mean do you have any idea?  I mean were they--
Speaker 2: My, the, the, the story goes that these, his people were from Oklahoma, and he ended up in Mississippi somehow, so from where he started out in Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay, I remember this from last time, 'cause it's a curious thing for people to run from Oklahoma to Mississippi.  Though some say that it's not much difference.  But there's a, but Mississippi's always seen as the roughest, toughest place for black people.
Speaker 2: It is, although, if you're mixed up with the Cherokee Nation, it might not be such a leap, because the, the Cherokees were going through very hard times, as you know, during that period as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he may have been running away from reservation life in Oklahoma too.
Speaker 2: It, it could have been.  I really, again, it would be speculation on my part.  I don't know that for sure.  Yeah, I wish I did, but I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 145577
Speaker 1: So, the people on your mother's [Mildred Blackmon McEwen] side were basically, were, were they farmers, or were they involved in some trade or what?
Speaker 2: People on my mother's side were farmers or sharecroppers or had worked on the plantation at some point for slave masters.  My grandparents, Charlie [Charles Blackmon] and Annie [Blackmon], I remember them as sharecroppers from being a little girl.  I didn't know that, that term at the time.  I thought they were farmers.  But my mother and dad explained it to, to me and my sisters that no, they were sharecropping.  They were farming someone else's land.  And we, they lived on a place called the Douglas Plantation, and they farmed that land.  And they got a part of the crop, and Mr. Douglas and his family got the other part.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is in, this would be in, in Abbeville [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at that time, it really didn't have that name, but now it has that name.  It was just called the countryside at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 145578
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your mother [Mildred Blackmon McEwen] have some stories about growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she, she seemed to have a very good, lively childhood.  She lost her mom [Annie Blackmon] when she was very young, I think about three years old.  And her dad [Charles Blackmon] remarried, so her stepmother, Carrie--Cara, actually was her name, but they called her Grandmother Carrie--raised her along with her brothers and sisters and a bunch of stepbrothers and sisters.  So, I think all in all they had about seventeen or so youngsters in the family.  Many of her brothers and sisters were very close to, to my age.  So I actually thought I was growing up with my cousins, and they were my aunts and uncles.  But my mother, I, she, tells stories about playing with, you know, her brothers and sisters 'cause they were her playmates, basically, when they weren't doing chores around the farm.  You know, they made up their own games, stickball (laughter) made out of, you know, they'd make their balls out of old cloth, you know, wrapped together tightly.  And they'd play their form of baseball, but they called it stickball, just using a branch from a tree and you know, this wound up cloth ball.  She tells stories about her dad going into the woods for whatever herbs and plants that he needed to cure, you know, whatever was going on with the family that got sick.  So they never needed a doctor or a pharmacy.  You know, the pharmacy was in the woods.  And my, my grandfather knew a lot about herbs and plants.  You know, she talks about playing with some of the little white kids who were, I believe, the Douglas children.  But once they got a certain age, like eleven or twelve, she would say they'd have, you know, she would always say that they somehow disappeared.  They could no longer play together after they reached a certain age--yeah, lots of stories (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, you were born in '53 [1953], right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so this is like just before the Civil Rights Movement hits.  And let, well, let--did your mother have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did.  She went to school, to grade school.  And she went to what we would call junior high school or middle school up until about the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Now do you know the name of the school--
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: In--okay.
Speaker 2: I do remember her talking about it being like a one-room school.  I don't know that it had a name.  It probably did, but I don't know what the name was.  It never occurred to me to ask.  I think I'll ask my mom (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 145579
Speaker 1: Okay, so well, we'll go on to your father's side.  Can, can you give us your father's full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: Yes, his name was Earnest McEwen, Jr., E-A-R-N-E-S-T, M-C-E-W-E-N, Jr.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 24th, 1931, and he was born in Oxford, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, what, what are the stories about the ancestors on your father's side?  Do they have any?
Speaker 2: Yeah, his father was Earnest McEwen, Sr., and his mother was Epsy Thomas.  On my dad's side we can go back a, maybe another generation beyond my mother's [Mildred Blackmon McEwen].
Speaker 1: Back in, into slavery then?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are the stories about--
Speaker 2: Well, we knew that they were part of the McEwen family, plantation family.  Like most of the slaves, they were given the names, the last name of the slave owner, owners.  We know that there is a lot of African blood in both sides of my family.  There's also some mixture.  On my dad's side we think there's Choctaw Indian.  We know that there's Caucasian because the, the slaveholders--I'm trying to find the right words.  But the slave owners mated with the slaves, and so we know that there's some mixed blood from, from the slave era on my dad's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is the McEwen plantation a big plantation?  Was it a big place?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know that for sure, but I know that there was lots of land that was owned by the McEwen family at one time.  And that was passed from the plantation owners in some way, shape, or form.  We think it was purchased, but we don't have any documentation.  We think it was purchased by some of the former slaves, but, again, we don't have any documentation.  We just know that the land that was called McEwen land was passed on into the black part of the family at some point.  And over the years it was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Some of it or all of it?
Speaker 2: I think just some of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm thinking some of it, but, again, Larry, I don't know for sure.  I mean, I'm sure you know that not a whole lot is documented in terms of records, recordkeeping.  It's documented through stories, and that's, you know, another kind of documentation that I think is often questioned unfortunately.  But the story is that there was, you know, lots of land that the black McEwens had.  There's lot of land that the white McEwens had, and then over time the parcels were sold off.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 145580
Speaker 1: All right, now, where did your father [Earnest McEwen, Jr.] go to school?
Speaker 2: My father went to school, he went to college at Alcorn A&M College [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, later Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: So he, he was able to go to grade school and high school right there in Oxford [Mississippi], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so being in, Oxford being more of a, a town, I mean, Abbeville [Mississippi] is just a countryside, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And Oxford, he was right in town.
Speaker 2: Oxford he was right--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in town and--
Speaker 1: So, do you know the name of the black school in, in Oxford?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew you were gonna ask me that.  I know the name of the church but not the school.
Speaker 1: What's, the, what's the church?
Speaker 2: The church he went to was called West Spring Hill, West Spring Hill Chapel [sic, Church, Oxford, Mississippi].  But I don't know that I've ever heard him say the name of his high school.
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of the churches were, were involved in education too on some level, or, as you know, close association, so I don't know.  There, we know it was an all-black school.  We know that much--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --probably supported by the State of Mississippi, if you wanna call it support.  And that's the (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Likely, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a likely scenario.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it would have been all-black for sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was there a particular black side of town in Oxford that people grew, grew up in, or was it a--
Speaker 2: You know, my recollection of Oxford, you know, this is my own recollection, and I actually thought Oxford was an all-black town (laughter), when I was little, because I didn't know, I didn't understand what segregation was.  I remember Uptown, what we called Uptown, which was basically one little city block, town block, was mostly white people.  Like when you went into the shops, when you went into the townhouse, when you went into the courthouse, everything, all the people they were white.  My grandfather [Earnest McEwen, Sr.], though, actually ran a cafe.  And I can't recall if it was on that square or if it was just close by the square.  But that was pretty unusual for his era to be a shop owner, a shopkeeper.  It was like a little cafe, 'cause I remember going up to eat there on Saturday mornings.  And I don't remember any other black shopkeepers.  There may have been some, but I, my recollection is that most of them were white, and he was, like, unusual.
Speaker 1: So he was in Uptown, and he had this caf, his cafe was Uptown, or--
Speaker 2: It was at least in that area.
Speaker 1: --on the--okay.
Speaker 2: Again, I can't remember if it was on the square or if it was off the square, but it was certainly in that general area.  And so you asked about a side of town.  There were certainly a part of Oxford that was black and a part of Oxford that was white, but I can't tell you which part was which, was which, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was definitely segregated, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, so your father had a, was able to--was, was your father the first person in his family to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the first person not only to go to college but even to think about going to college.  My dad had dreams and aspirations of going to college from the time, at least the stories go, his own stories and those of his sister and one of his brothers, from the time he was a little, very little boy, yeah.
Story_ID: 145581
Speaker 1: Okay, now I think we've, well, we've talked about before that your--well, did your grandfather [Earnest McEwen, Sr.] or did anybody else in your fam, family, like, work on the campus of the University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: No, my dad [Earnest McEwen, Jr.] actually worked on Ole Miss [University of Mississippi], Ole Miss's campus.  When he was a young man he, he could work there.  He worked as a janitor, but Ole Miss was still segregated at that time.  And it was actually through his work as a janitor there that he was enabled to go to college.  He met one of the professors.
Speaker 1: Now, so you're saying when he got out of high school, his first job was working at the, on the campus of Ole Miss.  He didn't go right to Alcorn [Agricultural and Mechanical College, later Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't go back--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --to Alcorn.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: He, right out of high school actually he got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was eighteen.  My mom [Mildred Blackmon McEwen] and dad were eighteen when they got married.  They had children right away, my two older sisters and myself.  And my dad was working at Ole Miss when he had me.  And I don't know much of his employment history between high school and Ole Miss, but I'm assuming that it was some kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was still a young man, yeah.
Speaker 2: He was a very young man--
Story_ID: 145582
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, let me ask you this be, before we get into that story, 'cause it's a pretty dramatic story behind just the college--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: How, how did your parents [Mildred Blackmon McEwen and Earnest McEwen, Jr.] meet?  How did your mother and father meet?
Speaker 1: They met, well, in those days, they called it courting (laughter).
Speaker 2: Or coatin' (laughter).
Speaker 1: Coatin, yeah, yeah, that's right (laughter).  And my dad met my mother at her house.  I remember my father would go and visit her, court her there.  And they couldn't go out, you know, unless somebody was with them.  But my mother tells the story that, you know, when she saw my dad it was like love at first sight.  She knew that he was the guy.  And she knew that he would--she would spend the rest of her life with him, so.  I don't know if it was exactly the same for my dad, but for my mom, that was it, yeah.
Story_ID: 145583
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so he's [Burgess' father, Earnest McEwen, Jr.] working.  So he gets a job at the University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi].  It's probably a decent, considered a good job.
Speaker 2: It was considered a very good job, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean it paid a lot more than farm work.  And that was about the only thing you could get, working on a farm, you know, or janitorial work.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, did he ever talk about--I mean did, did he really, did he enjoy being on the campus, you know?
Speaker 2: He did.  My dad loved, he loved learning.  From the time he was a little boy, he would read anything he could get his hands on.  And he loved talking to people.  He was very outgoing, very gregarious, very generous, very good at conversation, and he would talk to anybody (laughter).  And so he loved being around the professors, the students, and being able to, you know, do--to be in that kind of atmosphere, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what he's, he's, how long is he there before he meets the, William Faulkner?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't exactly how long he had been there, but he was about twenty-one when he met Mr. Faulkner.  My dad would, like I said, he would read anything he could get his hands on.  I remember one of the, the stories that I heard was that one of the professors actually saw him reading one of the Oxford [Mississippi], or the Ole Miss [University of Mississippi] newspaper.  And you know, he was a black man on campus, so he kind of stood out (laughter).  And I'm sure he probably stood out even more because he was reading a paper, probably reading it, knowing my dad, very closely and so on and so forth.  But at any rate, he struck up a conversation with this professor who saw him there.  And the professor put him in touch with the dean of the college, Dr. Love [ph.], dean Love.  And Dr. Love was really impressed with my dad's drive, his ambition, his dreams, and his determination.  And so he put him in touch with Mr. Faulkner, and Mr. Faulkner became my, my father's benefactor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Faulkner was, he's one of the, one of the writers of the early part of the century that's really celebrated.  He, his books like, he deals with racial issues of the South.  You know, he talks about, you know, race prejudice in his books, you know, as being an integral part of what's going on down there.  Did, did they, did your father, well, I mean did your father get a chance to interact with Faulkner and talk about his work or, or, or--
Speaker 2: He did, you know, and I, I learned a lot of what kind of relationship my dad had with Faulkner actually after my dad passed on.  But Mr. Faulkner not only became his benefactor, you know, he paid, he paid for my dad to go to Alcorn [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, later Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi], paid for his tuition.  He arranged for books and clothing to be sent to my family so that my dad wouldn't have to work and be distracted from his studies.  But later, like I said, after my dad died, I, I asked his older sister, I asked my mother [Mildred Blackmon McEwen] just, you know, intense questions about so, you know, what was dad's relationship really like with Faulkner?  'Cause I knew that, from my father's stories, that Mr. Faulkner invited him as well as the rest of my family to his home while we still lived in, in Mississippi.  When we moved North, every time we went back, we were always welcome to be there.  But one of the things I learned just recently, actually, in doing some research for the book that I just completed, was that my dad actually got to see some of Faulkner's manuscripts, which to me was like, you know, just lit up my, my, my life because, you know, as a writer, I would love to have known that from my dad's own mouth.  But he got to see his manuscripts.  He got to talk to Faulkner about just, you know, ish, stuff that was going on in the, in the, in their world.  And so he did have a good interactive relationship with Faulkner, even though it wasn't, you know, the, the norm to do that at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so he got the money to go to Alcorn State?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And so he--and support other, other support for the family too, so he wouldn't, the family wouldn't starve while he was going to school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a pretty good deal, you know, I guess.
Speaker 2: It was a very good deal.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and no strings attached.  It was like, you know, you go make, make, make a better life for yourself and pass it on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pass it on to somebody else.  You know, you don't owe me a thing.
Story_ID: 145584
Speaker 1: All right, now I know there's a story about Alcorn State [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, later Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] too.  I mean things didn't go completely right at Alcorn State, did they?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: I mean, so.
Speaker 2: Well, like you said, this was very close to the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement.  So my dad [Earnest McEwen, Jr.] started college actually the year I was born, in '53 [1953].  And he was in his element there, I mean, again, loved learning.  It was an all-black school, so, one of the oldest historically black colleges [HBCU].  And my dad was one of those natural-born leaders.  And so he was always involved in something with the student body.  During his senior year, he was actually president of the Alcorn student body, the student council.  And one of the things that my dad always did was he stood up for what he believed in.  He spoke out for what he believed in even if it would cost him something.  And he was about three months from graduating, and he led, along with the other student council officers, a walkout, protesting some very bad treatment by one of the faculty members there at Alcorn.  And the trustees basically gave the students an ultimatum, you know, go back to class; we're gonna shut Alcorn down.  And although the student body supported the student council, many of the students went back to class.  I mean, you know, these are students just like my dad, you know, from very poor families, from farm families, and they're the first of their family to go to college.  They're not gonna throw it all away, you know, and so they went back to class.  The officers actually were all expelled from Alcorn.
Story_ID: 145585
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so what are the, you know, well, tell us some more details about this, this, this expulsion.  Your father's [Earnest McEwen, Jr.] expelled from school [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, later Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] for--
Speaker 2: He was expelled from school as one of the officers, as the, as the prime officer for the student council along with the other officers.  And a few other students were just asked to be dismissed.  They called it ousted back then, you know, ousting a student, students.
Speaker 1: Now what exactly did they do?  Did they, they--
Speaker 2: They basically, like I said, there was, there was a mass walkout.  All the students in Alcorn walked out of class and refused to return to class until the requests that they had about dealing with this particular faculty member [Clennon King] were handled by the trustees.  And the trustees refused to acknowledge their requests.  They refused to acknowledge the, the devastation that this faculty member was basically, you know, causing within the campus community.  And the faculty member happened to be a black faculty member who was misusing the, the, his power as a spokesperson for the campus for academic matters.  He was taking his position, if you will, and attaching the students' pictures to his claims about race relations, etc.  And the students just said, you know, this is not something that we believe in.  We don't support this man.  I don't--we can't understand why he's using our pictures.  This is basically, you know, taking our--
Speaker 1: Now, now--
Speaker 2: --freedom of--
Speaker 1: --can, can, can you make it a little more clear.  What was he trying to do with their pictures?  He was trying to show who what?
Speaker 2: He was trying to affiliate the students with his position that he was taking, which would basically defended the--
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: --he was making statements about race that he felt were true, that he believed in.  And because he was using the students' pictures, it looked like the students were going along with his beliefs.
Speaker 1: Now what, what kind of beliefs--
Speaker 2: The students disagreed.
Speaker 1: --were, were we talk, talking about?
Speaker 2: I wish I had the transcripts in front of me 'cause I don't wanna misquote.  But it was essentially the--I think the best way to put it is he was basically talking about African Americans, about black people, about Negros at that time as being one down, as being inferior, as being less than.  And he was making these statements to the press at the time and basically saying, you know, this is what I believe; this is my position; this is what I believe.  And by associating, by putting these students' pictures alongside of his statements, by inference, you could--or guilt by association, if you will, that the students were backing up his beliefs and claims.  And it doesn't seem like a huge thing (laughter), but it's a big thing because you're taking advantage of someone whose speech, freedom of speech is being violated.  And you're, you're basically saying, you know, this group of students, the student body, believes the exact same things that I believe.  And the students took--objected to his, his statements about blacks.  The students objected to the way that their voice was being used, misused by this professor and basically called for his resignation.  And the trustees wouldn't hear of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was making some sort of a case for black limitation or something--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in his work--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and, and using the students to illustrate his points.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and this position actually was a position that was very often voiced by white professors and by the white trustees.  But to have it voiced by someone of your own race was just intolerable.
Speaker 1: So, for example, I guess, perhaps the point is that, you know, black people can only be educated up to a certain level.  Was that the, the, the, the message?  And this is something that the State of Mississippi would agree with or, or try to--
Speaker 2: This would be something--
Speaker 1: --promote that you can--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that the state would want to promote, that the press would want to promote, because this was the prevailing belief at the time.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So if you educated them at a cert--you know, 'cause I know there was a big belief in industrial education for black people, you know, that, you know, anything beyond that would be wasting your time because they really couldn't catch onto it anyway and that sort of thing, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 145586
Speaker 1: So the students took issue with this man's [Clennon King] actions, and, like I said, they called for his resignation.  They staged a walkout.  The student council led the walkout.  My father [Earnest McEwen, Jr.] was the president of the student council.  And because of his stance and being a spokesperson for the entire student body, he was basically ousted, asked to leave on the day of the walkout along with all of the other student council officers and a handful of other students, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, the--now, was, was William Faulkner or any of the people that own this able to come to his aid, or were they conflicted too, or what, or what, what happened?
Speaker 1: Well, the president of Alcorn [Agricultural and Mechanical College, later Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] at the time basically backed up the students.  He, too, lost his job; he was asked to leave.
Speaker 2: What was, what was his name?
Speaker 1: Otis--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Dr. [Jesse R.] Otis.  I'm trying to remember his first name, and I can't right now.  But he--
Speaker 2: This is dramatic, the president loses his job.
Speaker 1: It was very dramatic.  I mean this--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was something that was worthy of being in the newspaper.  And it was the first time, according to the reports, that any students, at any time, in the history of the unrest, if you will, that was building up to what we now call the Civil Rights Movement, it was the first time that this had happened at a historically black college [HBCU].  And you know, the press thought it was worthy of reporting on, so it must have been a fairly, you know, significant event.  It was significant enough the, you know, that they threw the students out.  The, the organization actually that came to his aid, in addition to Dr. Otis, was the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Story_ID: 145587
Speaker 1: My dad [Earnest McEwen, Jr.] ended up going to Central State College [later, Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] to finish his senior year, so he graduated from, from there.  That's--
Speaker 2: Central State in Ohio?
Speaker 1: In Wilberforce, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Wilberforce, Ohio, okay.
Speaker 1: And so the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] extended support to help my father finish his degree, to help him, you know, get in, into the college, and be able to finish on time, basically.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, what was your father's major?
Speaker 1: It was called building and construction.  It's now called architecture.  But in those days, it was called building and construction, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, so he on, he only had a year to finish at Central State, right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: He basically had about three months to go--
Speaker 2: Three months to go.
Speaker 1: --three months from graduation, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And what I love about my dad is that, you know, he, he, like I said, he was a very principled, values-based person.  And if he believed in something, he would put his life on the line for it.  And in this case, he believed in taking this position against Dr. King was his name, Clement King [sic, Clennon King].
Speaker 2: Okay, I was just getting ready to ask you that, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So Dr. Clement King was the--
Speaker 1: Clement King--
Speaker 2: --professor in--
Speaker 1: --was the professor.
Speaker 2: --Alcorn [Agricultural and Mechanical College, later Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] who--
Speaker 1: Yes--
Speaker 2: --was--
Speaker 1: --who caused all the--
Speaker 2: --who caused the trouble.
Speaker 1: --all the ruckus.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so he put himself on the line.  He put his education on the line, you know, something that he had dreamed about for years.  But this was an important enough stake for him to say I'm gonna risk it for what I believe in.
Story_ID: 145588
Speaker 1: Okay, so your father [Ernest McEwen, Jr.] finished at Central State [College, later, Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] in, in what year?
Speaker 2: So that would have been 1957.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-seven [1957].  Now did the whole family move to Ohio too, before they--
Speaker 2: The family moved--my dad went--no; the short answer is no.  My dad finished his degree there, and then he sent for us to join him.  I guess we did live in Ohio for a very short period of time, and then we moved to Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did you move to Detroit [Michigan] directly?
Speaker 2: We moved to Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay, in Detroit, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dayton [Ohio] is, was known as a little, little sister of Detroit or something anyway (laughter) 'cause of the auto industry.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, so, so, did, so what did your father do in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Let's see, initially, well, you know what, initially--I'm not sure what his first job was, Larry, but I know that my dad worked as a janitor again after he graduated from college.  And I remember him telling the story about [William] Faulkner saying to him, you know, you will get your college education.  And he said and you can make a better life, he says, but don't expect it to be easy; don't ever expect it to be easy, and it wasn't.  With a college education, my dad could not find a job as an architect.  They weren't hiring black architects, not in that part of the country.  You know, I've since heard stories that are about that era.  You know, there were a few black architects in the country, but they were not in the Midwest.  My dad could not find work in his field, so he went back to being a janitor.  He ended up working at a hospital in Highland Park [Michigan], which is very close by.  And there he learned--again, he was very studious, very, you know, eager, aggressive type of learner.  He eventually learned about working as a blood bank technician.  So he studied hematology, and taught himself enough to get, to get a job as a blood bank, as a lab tech, and had a career as a lab tech for a number of years.  And he eventually ended up working like three, four jobs when, as I was growing up just, you know, to be able to put food on the table.  By this time, I had four sisters plus my mom [Mildred Blackmon McEwen] and my dad.  And my dad was always very generous, so he would, you know, would always help people who wanted to come, relatives who wanted to come from the South to stay with us or to help 'em get settled or whatever.
Story_ID: 145589
Speaker 1: You've got, you've got four sisters, right you said?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And where do you fall in the--
Speaker 2: I'm the third.
Speaker 1: You're the third?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, third from the young--from the oldest?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm in the middle.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  And when you think about your parents' personalities, your father [Earnest McEwen, Jr.] and your mother [Mildred Blackmon McEwen], and their, their talents, and gifts, and dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: The most--you know, I think I actually have a lot of both of my parents in me, I really do.  From my dad, I have his tenacity and love for learning.  I love, I love being in school, I love studying (laughter), and using that to help other people create a better life for themselves.  I'm kind of a dreamer, like my dad.  He was a pretty, pretty strong visionary and a man who dreamed dreams outside of his time; from my mother, tenacity as well but a different kind of tenacity.  She's very practical, very, you know, down to earth, feet on the ground; and I think from both of my parents, compassion, just really a big heart, I think a genuine love and concern for other people regardless of who they are, regardless of where they come from, regardless of their race, or ethnicity, or age, doesn't matter.
Story_ID: 145590
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, where did you live in Detroit [Michigan]?  Now, this is 1957.
Speaker 2: Late fifties [1950s].
Speaker 1: Late fifties [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: We lived, first places we lived was in East Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay, East Side.
Speaker 2: East Side.  And we lived with relatives for a, a short while.  And I can't remember exactly where now, but I know we lived in the attic of some of our relatives who had come from the South, lived in the projects.  I remember a place called Selden--these were the Selden Projects [Detroit, Michigan]--went to a place called Ralph Bunche Elementary School [Ralph J. Bunche Preparatory Academy, Detroit, Michigan].  At some point, we moved to another neighborhood in Detroit.  And back in those days, the neighborhoods were a mixture of--you know, we don't call 'em this anymore, but we were all kind of in the, in the ghetto (laughter), the Jews, the Italians, the Irish, and the blacks.  And so I remember having lots of different kinds of neighbors.  And this was on the, in the West Side of Detroit on a place called Clements Avenue, yeah, Dexter [Avenue] and Davison [Street] would be the area.
Story_ID: 145591
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: You know I can remember--I think this is my own memory.  You know, you hear so many stories, you aren't quite sure what it, if it's your own memory or somebody else's telling you.  But I think I, my earliest memory that I claim as my own is being in a nursery school at Alcorn [Agricultural and Mechanical College, later Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi].  So I would have been about three or four years old.  And my mother [Mildred Blackmon McEwen] was working there in the nursery school as a cook.  And so I remember kind of being on her skirt tail, you know, just kind of following her around--I was kind of a mama's girl--and being with the other children there.
Story_ID: 145592
Speaker 1: What were some of the--I know we, we, we cov--we're covering a lot of geographical territory, but what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Red dirt (laughter), red dirt from Mississippi.  So, the, the soil there is very compacted, like clay, and it gets everywhere.  So I remember red on my hands, red in my fingernails, red on my skin, red in my hair, just from the dust.  I remember Easters.  You know, church was a big thing for my family and remember being in church almost all day, every Sunday.  And we'd have our meals at church.  We'd have pageants at church.  And Easter Sunday we would hunt for these little, little bitty eggs called, they were from guinea hens, little wild hens that, that roamed around.  But they were little, much smaller than regular hens' eggs.
Speaker 1: So you'd hunt for them out in the--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: You knew, you knew where to look for 'em?
Speaker 2: Well, they were bought--you know, our parent or you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the elders--whoops, I'm sorry about that.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Carry on.
Speaker 2: Our elders would have boiled them, picked them, you know, found them--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --and boiled them, and then hid them around the, the grounds of the church.  And so the activity for the kids would be the Easter pageant, you know, where you'd recite your Bible verse and sing a song or whatever, and then going to hunt for the Easter eggs.  I remember being around lots of people.  Like I said, my mom [Mildred Blackmon McEwen], my mom is from a huge family and so lots of people all the time, especially Mississippi.  In the North, lots of people (laughter), we had lots of relatives.  My mom was a good cook, and she would, no matter how little we had, she would always open her doors and offer something to, you know, somebody else who had less than we did, so the smell of, like, beans cooking, rice cooking, neck bones cooking, greens, shelling peas.  We would get fresh peas.  We would get as much fresh stuff as we could from, from the Eastern Market in Detroit [Michigan], because my, you know, my parents were used to having farm fresh food.  And so they would buy as much fresh stuff as they could.  I remember parades.  We, you know, we didn't have very many things to keep us busy like kids do today like video games and television and so on and so forth, so we'd make up our own stuff.  We would have parades just because we could.  And all the kids in the neighborhood would get together and make, you know, little instruments out of old things that we found around the house, cans, oatmeal cartons, whatever.  My mother was a big baseball fan, so I remember listening to baseball games on the radio with her.  I remember spending lots of time with my sisters.  My two older sisters and I are very close in age.  And then my two youngest sisters are eight and ten years apart, so spent time playing with my older sisters a lot and then kind of being the surrogate parent for my two younger sisters when my mom had to go to work--very close family; you know, blood is thicker than water.  We'd stick up for each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A lot of the things that we talked about and cared about we kept to ourselves.
Story_ID: 145593
Speaker 1: So you, you, I know you had some extended family in, in Detroit [Michigan], some other members of the family would come up from Mississippi, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to live in Detroit too.  So did you, at, at a certain point, did you have a nice, you know, cross-section of relatives in Detroit that--
Speaker 2: We had a good cross-section of relatives in Detroit.  A lot of family from my father's [Earnest McEwen, Jr.] side had come up, and I knew them as aunts and uncles.  When I was older, I learned they were my great-aunts and uncles (laughter) so lots of time, lots of time with, with, with my elders there and with their children.  And when we moved to Ann Arbor [Michigan] after living in Detroit for about seven or eight years, we would often go back and visit the, ma, my relatives in Detroit.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you moved to Ann Arbor?
Speaker 2: I was in the fifth grade, so I would have been--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about ten.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, that's '63 [1963] or so, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 145594
Speaker 1: Let's see, well, where did you start school?  Did you start at Ralph Bunche [Elementary School, later Ralph J. Bunche Preparatory Academy, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I don't know if that was my first school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really don't remember if that was kindergarten or not.
Speaker 1: But you started, you started school in Detroit [Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: I started school in Detroit, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay, all right, so, but at one time you went to, at, at a certain point you go to Ralph Bunche I know (laughter) and then--
Speaker 2: I changed schools I'm just thinking like three or four times in Detroit, and I just don't remember if Ralph Bunche is my first school or not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm thinking not, but I can't, I can't tell you which one was anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you go to junior--well, you didn't, no, you were, you were too old for--
Speaker 2: I was still in grade--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were still in grade school--
Speaker 2: -grade school.
Speaker 1: --when you moved to Ann Arbor [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 145595
Speaker 1: Now, your, your father [Earnest McEwen, Jr.] got a job in Ann Arbor [Michigan] at the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--
Speaker 1: --as a--
Speaker 2: --let's see, what was he doing by then?  He got a job at the university hospital [University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And by this time, I think he was also working for Ford Motor Company.  He had taken all of the process skills that he had learned as a building and construction major and was able to figure out how to apply them in an automotive environment.  And so he had become a process engineer at Ford, but he was still working as a blood bank tech to make ends meet to, to--you know, lots of, lots of mouths to feed, girls going to college by that time or getting ready to go to college.
Story_ID: 145596
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, I assume you liked school.  I couldn't imagine you not liking school (laughter).
Speaker 2: I did like school (laughter).  You know, I, I loved school.  I did not like, though, the transition from Detroit [Michigan] to Ann Arbor [Michigan].  It was, it was tough for me, and I had a rough year.  I remember that first year in fifth grade I had a really rough year.
Speaker 1: What was the rough thing about it?
Speaker 2: You know, I think part of the rough thing was I didn't know--in Ann Arbor I was one of a few black kids in my whole school.  I was the only black kid in my class in fifth grade.  And you know, having moved from the South where you're surrounded by all blacks, then to Detroit [Michigan] where you're surrounded by mostly blacks and, and white people who treat you well, to moving to Ann Arbor where, at least my, my, my impression as a young kid, was, you know, kind of like who's she; it was like this kind of standoffish kind of thing.  And so it was just really hard to, to, to fit; I didn't feel like I fit in.  I really didn't feel like I had a group of friends that I belonged to.  And maybe that had nothing to do with race.  Maybe it just had more to do with being the new kid in school.  But for me, it felt like it had to do with race.  Another thing that really affected me in my, in my fifth grade was I was a pretty smart kid, you know.  And you know when the teacher calls on you, and you raise your hand.  You think you know the answer, and your just waving and waving.  And this particular teacher I had would look at me as if I wasn't there, you know, as if I was invisible.  And after a while, you know, I didn't have the language for it as a kid, but what, what happened was you just stop raising your hand over time.  And I wasn't the kind of kid who would stand up and you know, kinda talk to the teacher.  Instead, I kinda withdrew into myself.  And so that, that fifth grade year was, was tough, just trying to figure out who I was, where I fit in, you know, did I matter anymore, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, another thing that's worth noting that, well, once again, the family is in a big university town.  The University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] sometimes is the largest university in the United States and sometimes UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] or [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] is.
Speaker 2: It depends, yeah.
Speaker 1: But it's one of the largest.
Speaker 2: It's big.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 145597
Speaker 1: So, so did you, did the family benefit from, from being in that environment?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  In fact, my dad [Earnest McEwen, Jr.] moved us to Ann Arbor [Michigan] by design.  My dad was a crafty (laughter), crafty soul.  He knew that if we moved out of Detroit [Michigan] that we would have a better chance of getting into good high schools.  And he knew that high school mattered in terms of getting into college.  He also knew that being in a university environment would give us a bet, especially U of M [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], would have us, give us a better chance of going to the university or someplace of that caliber.  And so he moved the family there with the intention of giving us a, a firmer foundation, if you will, firmer footing.  There were good schools in Detroit--don't get me wrong--but the ones that were really, I'm gonna say, catering to black kids and good were few and far between at that time.  I remember Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] standing out.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think most of the people that we've, we've interviewed that have been raised in Detroit went to Cass Tech--(unclear).
Story_ID: 145598
Speaker 1: But, so, where, where, where, where did you go school in Ann Arbor [Michigan]?  What was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: I went to Northside Elementary School [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and Forsythe Junior High [later Forsythe Middle School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], and Huron High School [Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I have to tell you this story.  The, the other part of the, the grade school story is that in sixth grade, I had the kind of teacher who is the exact opposite of my fifth grade teacher.  So, you know, I--bad news, good news.  Bad news was fifth grade; good news was sixth grade.  I had a teacher who just changed my life.  She's still a role model for me as a, as an educator today.  Would you like to hear that story?
Speaker 1: Sure, yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: I was gonna at--one, one of our questions is if you have a favorite teacher or not--
Speaker 2: Oh, she's--
Speaker 1: --so this is the one--
Speaker 2: --hands down my favorite teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Her name is Mary Jane Gillespie [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was, she was, you know, like water to a thirsty tree.  She saw this little, you know, pitiful, withered up little child that I'd become.  And she just kind of watched me for a little while, you know, in the beginning of her class.  And over time, she, you know, gave me extra things to do.  I would finish my work a lot faster than the other kids.  She'd give me ex, extra things to do, which is not unusual.  But she had the kind of classroom that had materials that went all the way up to like twelfth grade reading and studying and all that kind of stuff.  And she knew that I was, you know, pretty, pretty intent on learning, and so she would give me things that would challenge me.  She also gave me a book that I still have called 'The Dream Keeper.'  It's a little book of poems by Langston Hughes.  And that book was the book that changed, again, it changed my, my thinking; it changed my life; it changed the way that I, you know, was in the classroom.
Story_ID: 147302
Speaker 1: We were talking about grade school--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --your favorite teacher [Mary Jane Gillespie, (ph.)]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --she gave you 'The Dream Keeper [and Other Poems]' by Langston--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Hughes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did.  She gave me this book of poems.  And she knew that I, like I said, love reading.  I don't really think she knew that I loved poetry.  But this was one of those moments in your life that you just remember.  Larry [Crowe], it was the first time that I had held a book of poems in my hand by a black poet.  It was the first time that I opened the pages, and I saw people, these were woodcuts of people who looked like me.  You know, they had my eye structure; they had my cheekbones; they had my lips.  It was the first time that I had read, anything, literature, any kind of literature, poetry, or anything where the words were shaped in the same kind of rhythm and music, you know, that I was used to hearing at home and spoke at home.  I mean this is, this is a big deal for me.  And I remember reading that book, and reading that book and copying the poems, and trying to write like Langston Hughes.  And it was the first time that I remember actually really trying to write good poetry.  I had, you know, begun to write poetry before that, but this book was like a life saver, like a lifeline for me.  From there, Ms. Gillespie realized that I loved poetry, so it became like a little thing for us to exchange poetry and poems and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--this points something.  And I don't think I mentioned it last time, but you know, you think it, during that era--and I grew up in the '50s [1950s]--most black people really didn't know much about black culture.  So maybe the Harlem Renaissance was more for academics than for the actual people, 'cause the people didn't seem to know who Langston Hughes is or you know, we, we knew [Paul Laurence] Dunbar and--(unclear).  We didn't, we didn't know Langston Hughes.
Speaker 2: I didn't know about him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, I studied that era in college.  I didn't even learn about it in high school [at Huron High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], let alone, you know, before then.
Speaker 1: And you know, even growing, growing up near these college campuses didn't do any good in Mississippi, right?
Speaker 2: No, not Mississippi.
Speaker 1: In terms of knowing anything about black history--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or culture, or literature.
Speaker 2: No, no.  You were living black history, but you didn't know it at the time (laughter).  But learning about the history that came before us, no, that was not part of the, the education, the curriculum, no.
Speaker 1: So it took a teacher in, a white teacher, in Ann Arbor [Michigan] to introduce you to Langston Hughes?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: So, you started thinking about writing.  Now, you knew that [William] Faulkner was a celebrated writer, though, in Mississippi, right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I knew that he was an important writer.  I knew that he was an important man in Mississippi, life in Oxford [Mississippi], life in particular.  But I don't really think I appreciated how much until I got a little bit, until I, you know, was a little bit older.  And like I said, we kept so many things, our families kind of tucked within our family, it didn't really even occur to me to talk about this story, you know, that my, my dad's [Earnest McEwen, Jr.] relationship with him, until I was in my thirties.  It just wasn't something that we did.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, it wasn't something that we--it was special.  We knew it was special, but it wasn't something that we talked about, or my father actually never talked about it that much in detail.  He certainly didn't brag about it.  And like I said, some of the details about his relationship I found out after he died, yeah.
Story_ID: 147304
Speaker 1: Was literature and Eng- English your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were among my favorite.  But literature, studying novels, short stories, poems, anything like that was right up my alley.  I loved music as well and public speaking, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: So all the arts right there together--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so, okay.  So now, when, when you were in high school [at Huron High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], by the time you got to high school, were you, had you kind of opened up, and were you involved in activities and--
Speaker 2: I was very involved.  In fact, in sixth grade I became--like I said, Ms. Gillespie [ph.] just poured this water on me, and I just kind of started to blossom again.  I remember being very involved in sixth grade (laughter).  And you know, we had our little student council in the classroom and so on and so forth.  And I would run for office every time I could, like every other, every second or third week we would change officers so that everybody got a chance.  And I remember at one point Ms. Gillespie kind of whispered in my ear.  She says maybe you should stop running, you know, give somebody else a chance.  And so whatever she did, whatever magic potion she poured on me, you know, started my, my interest and engagement with student council life.  So I was pretty active in, in junior high school and high school, yeah, in lots of different activities in class and outside of class.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in, did you run for class officer in high school, or?
Speaker 2: I did.  I was secretary.  I don't think I ever ran for president.  I kind of liked being in high school either vice president, or secretary, or not treasurer (laughter), and I don't think I ever ran for pres, for, for president.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how were your grades in school?
Speaker 2: My grades were actually pretty decent.  Like I said, I was a pretty good student, a very good learner, sometimes not quite the model student.  I developed into a pretty outspoken character.  And when teachers would do stuff that was like really stupid (laughter), you know, just wasn't supportive of learning, I would, you know, speak out and let them know that.  And sometimes they appreciated it, and sometimes they didn't, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, was there any time you ever got in trouble for speaking out?
Speaker 2: I got kicked out of class a couple of times, once I think in junior high for some curriculum that one of the teachers wanted to, wanted us all to kind of swallow whole without really critically thinking about it.  And I told her that her approach was (laughter), you know, full of it, and she kicked me out of class.  I got kicked out of class in high school for--we had a dress code still, so we, you know, the girls still had to wear skirts and dresses.  And I wore jeans just to test the policy, and I tested it (laughter) and I got--well, the, the, one of the teachers sent me down to the office, and they called my, my parents [Mildred Blackmon McEwen and Earnest McEwen, Jr.].  My dad was home at the time, 'cause I think he was working the night shift.  And he basically told them that they couldn't kick me out of school, that, you know, he challenged them and asked them what was more important, my blue jeans or my learning?  So they didn't kick me out.
Speaker 1: This is in a public school?
Speaker 2: This is in a public school.
Speaker 1: Okay, in Ann Arbor [Michigan] of all places--
Speaker 2: Ann Arbor, yeah.
Speaker 1: --which was considered one of the most liberal, kinda, of the Big Ten schools I guess, that [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and the University of Wisconsin [-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] I guess you can say that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a pretty liberal environment, but we had, every now and then we had a pretty conservative teacher (laughter), yeah, so.
Story_ID: 147305
Speaker 1: All right, so, now, any, any other mentors in high school [at Huron High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] or, or, or influential people?
Speaker 2: You know, I, the ones that stand out to me are, again, in English and public speaking.  I had a couple of really strong teachers in, in high school, Andrew Kerrigan [ph.] was my jun, was my English teacher my junior year.  And I can't remember the, the fellow's name--oh, Mr. George [ph.], wow--from my senior year.  They were both very strong teachers, very influential.  But you know who stands out more than anything else?  Ann Arbor would occasionally bring poets through the schools, live poets, like real live published poets, and which were for me was like a big deal.  And I remember seeing Gwendolyn Brooks in one of my classes.  And her visit, it was probably less than, you know, forty-five, fifty minutes, whatever the class periods were.  But that visit, and her presence, and her being with our class was one of those, you know, defining moments for me, kind of like the Langston Hughes book.  But she, I remember she came.  She was herself--she was, she was in her head rag, you know.  I mean you know 'cause you're from Chicago [Illinois]; you knew her.  And she was just dressed just plain and like in her house dress.  But her poems, it's, were like, they were like jewels.  And her presence, she was, she was this wonderful creature who created these incredible stories through poems.  And yet, you know, when you looked at her, she looked like your next door neighbor.  And it was like, oh, wow, I get permission to be like her; I get permission to do that.  And again, I don't think I had those specific words, that, that language at the time, but looking back on it now, that's exactly what happened.  You know, it's like this person that I've only encountered in the book is a real live human being who looks, and breathes, and acts just like my neighbors, just like me, just like one of my family members.  So, it was life changing, yeah.
Speaker 1: I think there's a certain point when you realize that you, that you are, that you are concerned about who wrote a book that you start really thinking about writing yourself--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who the author is.  A lot of people never think about that when they've--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 147306
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so, what were your aspirations as a high school senior?  Did you aspire to become a professional troublemaker, or a writer, or what, what did you--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) well, you know, I didn't aspire to become a professional troublemaker (laughter), although I probably could have.  You know, at that time I was really loving English, loving speech.  I was involved in something called forensics, which is competitive oratory, like making speeches, competitive dramatic arts, that kind of thing.  And I was really focused on I think rebelling against my parents [Mildred Blackmon McEwen and Earnest McEwen, Jr.] because, you know, in, in my, in my family, we didn't get a choice about going to college.  It was like, you're going to college.  It's just a matter of which one you're going to, and of course, my dad thought I should go to U of M [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And I was just seeing how much I could push back before, you know, the, the, the two by four fell (laughter).  And I ended up, you know, applying to lots of colleges and ended up going to University of Michigan, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, it's one of the better schools in the coun- the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I mean did you, did you, had you had much experience with the university before you--
Speaker 2: I did.  I mean as, you know, when you live in that kind of community, it's hard not to interact with, with, with the campus community.  So I was very familiar with the, with the campus area, if you will, the geography, very familiar with some of the programs because I ushered for some of the dramatic series and the music series, both through the university as well as the professional plays and music groups that came through.  So I got to see a lot of excellent, excellent orchestras, bands, you know, dance troupes, plays, etc., as a junior high and high school student.  I got to know some of the university library resources, because as a high school student, the kinds of stuff that I was interested in, the high school library could fulfill some of my needs.  And some of them, I needed to go to the university to, to do more work, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I felt comfortable there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so, I take it you had pretty good grades when you--
Speaker 2: I did, yeah, yeah, U of M is, is pretty selective, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  So, I know the people in Michigan--I mean the, the, the state school is Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan].  A lot of people don't know.  But U of M is private, right--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: It's a state school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it just happens to be one of those state schools like [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] that are, you know, very high caliber state school.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 147307
Speaker 1: I know at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], I know from the last time that you met and was influenced by Robert Hayden, the poet, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell, tell us about that, another great poet.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hayden was at University of Michigan during the time that I was there.  I believe he was, had just transitioned from Fisk College [sic, Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And I had the good fortune, you know, one of those God-winking moments, the good fortune of being in his path when he was there.  And he was actually one of the few formal mentors that I had in poetry.  And I took two semesters of work with him.  And he paid attention to my work in a way that said what I was writing mattered.  That wasn't the first time that it happened, but for poetry that was the first time it happened for me.
Speaker 1: Now this is--you, you started University of Michigan in 19--
Speaker 2: Seventy-one [1971].
Speaker 1: --'71' [1971].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduated from high school [Huron High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] in '71 [1971] and started University of Michigan in '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, did, did you meet him immediately, I mean your freshman year--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or did it take a while?
Speaker 2: I was, I think I was a junior or a senior, probably a junior.  So, by the time I got to Hayden, I had taken a number of other good literature course, really strong professors, some good black literature, African American literature, and, and then I encountered him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so, now, University of Michigan in those days, there was a--trying to think--Ali Mazrui, the African political scientist, was there then, I know, who did the Africans years, years later.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know more about it than I do (laughter).
Speaker 1: It was--
Speaker 2: I wasn't aware that he was there--
Speaker 1: I'm tryin to think--
Speaker 2: --at the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was there.  Dr. Eva Jessye, I think we mentioned her last time too.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, she was at--
Speaker 1: --as someone being there.
Speaker 2: --the [University of Michigan] School of Music [Theatre and Dance, Ann Arbor, Michigan] at the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, School of Music, but--
Speaker 2: And she was actually involved in some of the theatrical work as well.  That's how I got to meet her--
Speaker 1: Yeah in--
Speaker 2: --yeah, through my work with plays, theater.
Speaker 1: [HM] Jon [Onye] Lockard, the artist, Jon--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Onye Lockard, yeah, great artist, who ended up painting the art center at Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], a big mural in the art center at Central State University (laughter)--(unclear)--but, but there were a lot of arts and culture going on in those days--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at University of Michigan.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --absolutely.  This was right after--I entered college right after the, the Black Arts Movement kind of hit its peak.  And so, this was very much in the early days of African Studies in big universities, African American Studies certainly.  So there was lots of, lots of culture and lots of attention to African and African American culture at the time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 147308
Speaker 1: With, I mean, besides Robert Hayden, in, in those early days, who, who influenced you the most?  Can you--let me ask you this question.  This is a question I always like to ask women: When did you first get a natural?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, my, you know what, I, my first natural was when I was in Los Angeles [California] doing my doctoral work.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't have one in school at the University of Mich, of Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's, that's a tale.  You know what, because I got married with a natural, so it had to be at the University of Michigan.  I had one of those big fros then.  My first little fro was in Los Angeles [California], 'cause I got tired of the big fro (laughter).  But yeah, you, yeah, so probably high school, when we were still braiding our naturals, and curling 'em (laughter), and letting 'em leap, yeah.  Mercy, I'd forgotten that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what was, I mean, and what was the--now that's a cult--that's part of the, the Black Arts Movement and the cultural--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was a statement, a political statement, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it something that, that your parents [Mildred Blackmon McEwen and Earnest McEwen, Jr.] agreed with at the time, or did they--
Speaker 2: You know, my parents didn't disagree.  If they, if they disagreed, they would let us know.  If they disagreed vehemently, they would let us know for sure.  But my, both my older sisters and I had very big naturals.  And I don't recall them ever saying, you know, don't, don't do that.  They supported us in standing up for what we believed in, and as long as it was legal, you know.  And that was something that we all believed in at the time.
Story_ID: 147309
Speaker 1: And did your family--I know I've got you at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], but I keep going backwards.  But did your family pay close attention to--I imagine they would, but I guess you could explain how, in what fashion they paid attention to the Civil Rights Movement and all those storied places in Mississippi, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Mississippi, and Jackson [Mississippi], and Greenville [Mississippi], and Greenwood [Mississippi], and--I mean, did, did they, did they have relatives down there who were involved in the, with the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and voter registration or any of the movements?
Speaker 2: You know, we had family in some of the places that you spoke of, Greenwood certainly, and Oxford [Mississippi] Abbeville [Mississippi] area, in southern Mississippi, in, in some of the other Southern states.  I really don't know if my relatives were that involved.  And the reason I say that is, well, first of all, I don't know, but what my, my--I believe is the story is that they were probably more involved in making a living than on the picket line.  That's my recollection.  And I remember when we visited, when the family visited my relatives in the South, I remember still going to segregated schools even after the civil rights bill [Civil Rights Act of 1964] was passed.  For a number of years the schools were still segregated there.  You probably know that Mississippi was like one of the strongholds of, you know, bucking against the change.  And Oxford in particular and Greenwood in particular were some of the last to get on board with the program.  So, if they were involved, Larry, I think I would have known about it, and that wasn't part of the family story or stories that I heard.
Speaker 1: I just wondered, not so much about specific people, but if they, your family paid maybe closer attention to it than families that didn't have the direct link, you know, 'cause Mississippi was really in the news quite a bit, in '64 [1964] I know especially with the, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party going to, to the convention [1964 Democratic National Convention]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in '64' [1964] and all that, but--
Speaker 2: Right, I don't believe my family was involved in that, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did they talk about it at home?  I mean did people talk about it?
Speaker 2: They do, of, of course they talked about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I don't believe that they were on the front lines.  That's what--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I'm talking about in terms of being involved.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't matter as much as it--did, did your parents [Mildred Blackmon McEwen and Earnest McEwen, Jr.] actually talk about it at home and talk, talk about the significance of it, 'cause they relate to it more because they were from there?
Speaker 2: We did talk about it, yeah, but it wasn't like something that we would--that I remember my parents getting up and going to the South for or even the family members who were actually living in the South being on the front lines for.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So the focus was to come North pretty much more than--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And to fight the fight there, 'cause there were certainly--we always talked about the different forms of racism and how in the South, in the areas that we were familiar with, it was in your face, like you knew where people stood 'cause it was like, you, you know, people just told you what they thought of you or called you what they thought of you.  And in the North, the, the, the racism was a lot more under the table, subtle, what we now call micro inequity (laughter), which to me is, you know, bizarre.  But, you know, if it's racism, it's racism.
Story_ID: 147310
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in Detroit [Michigan], in '68 [1968] I guess, right, when the--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --when the riots (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, by '68 [1968]--
Speaker 1: --when the, when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated, were you there, or were you in Ann, Ann Arbor [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I'm thinking we might have been in Ann Arbor by then.  We were in Ann Arbor by then, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yes, you were, you were, you're right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Your were, you're right.
Speaker 2: Yep, I remember the day that Dr. King was assassinated.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, do you have any particular story about that day that you remember?  Of course, there was no riot in Ann Arbor, but--
Speaker 2: No.  You know, I, there were so many assassinations within that five, seven year period that my first recollection was President [John F.] Kennedy being shot in '63 [1963], and then Bobby [Robert Kennedy], and then Dr. King.  And I don't remember, I don't remember anything particular other than being just very, very, I'm gonna say somber.  And I don't believe at that time that I personally and that we collectively realized the magnitude of what we had lost.
Story_ID: 147311
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, okay, so, University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], you met--now, what was your major when you started?
Speaker 2: As an undergraduate, I ended up with five majors, just because I liked to take classes, and so I ended up with I think it was English, speech, anthropology, education, and something else (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so did it take you longer than, than four years to get out of school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But like I said, learning was easy for me.  And it wasn't anything at all for me to take more, you know, more credits than normal and work at the same time.  I loved it, I, you know, so no, it didn't take me any longer.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's a lot of, that's a lot of, lot of interests.
Story_ID: 147312
Speaker 1: Did, now--oh, well, back to Robert Hayden, what, what was he like?  You know, many people would like to know, you know, about a reflection, you know, would, would like to hear a reflection about the life of Robert Hayden from the students, so what was he like?
Speaker 2: Well, my experience of Robert Hayden was that he was very devoted to both poetry, and teaching, and people.  I'd say he would, you know, probably beat me hands down in terms of being one of those aggressive, avid learners.  I remember him taking, taking the time and paying attention to your work, my work in particular, as a, as an emerging poet.  He was very nearsighted, so I remember him holding the paper very close to his face as he read.  And it was always a guessing game, like, okay, so what is he thinking?  What is he thinking?  And with poetry it's what is he feeling?  And you know, then he'd take the paper down, and he'd just, you know, either be beaming or him, him, him wrinkled, furrow brow.  But he, you could always read his face, you know, once he, once he, once he read a poem.  But my impression was that he was very caring.  He paid lots of attention I mean to the kind of detail that, that matters to a poet, which is what a good mon, mentor does for you.  He was very outspoken about the Black Arts Movement and not being a part of it.  I remember that about him.  He was his own person, and he believed in his personhood above all.  So he was very much ridiculed by his fellow writers and, and poets, particularly blacks, for not taking a stand with them during that time.  He threw his support behind all humanity not just part of humanity.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know he was--I have two mentors in Black Studies that love two separate poems of his.  One is 'Middle Passage,' and the other is 'Runagate [Runagate],' yeah.  And those are often included in black anthologies of--and I don't know if they're included in (laughter) any ja--I suppose their included in some general anthologies too--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --but I haven't seen 'em.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they are, yeah.
Speaker 1: But that's--he was trying to--he, he didn't want to be labeled as just a black poet--
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.
Speaker 1: --in those days, okay.
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.  No, he wanted to be remembered as a poet, as an American poet not as a black American poet.
Speaker 1: So there's a generation gap between him and the gener, the poets of that, that era I guess, the new poets of that era.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure what you mean.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess there, that would have to be a generation gap between, I guess, he and people like him-- (unclear)--Amiri Baraka or [HM] Haki Madhubuti, who's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he would be like of the prior generation.  Is that what you mean?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Though Haki's favorite poem is 'Runagate,' so (laughter).  That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, were, were the Moodys there?  Do you, you remember them, C. D. Mood--I mean [HM] Charles Moody [Sr.] and his wife [Christella D. Moody]?
Speaker 2: I don't remember them being there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think they were there, but I don't know if they--
Speaker 2: They may have been.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I mean it's a huge place.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a big place; that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 147313
Speaker 1: You graduated in what, what year?
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you--oh, we didn't mention--I mentioned Eva Jessye.  We didn't talk about her.  Now she was--tell us a little, a little bit about her, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, Eva Jessye, I met her first through her artifacts.  She had donated so many of her musical artifacts to the [University of Michigan] School of Music [Theatre and Dance, Ann Arbor, Michigan], which was actually pretty near my family home on what they call north campus, and so I knew about her before I actually met her.  And I actually had the good fortune of meeting her when I was in a play, a music called 'Tambourines to Glory.'  And she had been brought on as the technical advisor because it was set at a, in, in a time period that, where she was, you know, very well steeped, and she could give us our p's and q's about doing things correctly to fit the period.  And I had one of the lead roles in the play.  And it was a, it was a gospel musical by Langston Hughes.  And Eva would sit in the house, you know, watching the show take shape.  And the director would call on her every now and then to give us pointers about the music and about the gospel style and etc., etc.  And Eva, I just remember her as being this wonderful, wonderful elder.  And she would sit in the house, you know, in the seats in the auditorium, and she would look like she was nodding, you know, like napping or something.  I go hmm, she looks just like, you know, my auntie so and so (laughter), you know, just sitting there napping.  And you wouldn't think she was paying attention.  And then all of a sudden, you know, her head would snap to, and she'd say something that was like right on point right directly at you.  And you go, mm, mm, mm, she been listening all along (laughter), you know, so.
Story_ID: 145611
Speaker 1: So okay, so Eva Jessye we're talk, talking about now, she lived a long time.  I think she was about a hundred when she passed away.
Speaker 2: Close to a hundred, yeah.
Speaker 1: Close to a hundred years old.
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly but ninety-six or ninety-seven maybe.
Speaker 1: She was known all over the Midwest at least and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: -- maybe the country as a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, very well-known and very well regarded.  We loved her.  And like I said, she would give us that, you know, pointed, pointed advice right when she seemed to spring back to life.  But I remember she's profiled in that wonderful book called 'I Dream a World' ['I Dream a World: Portraits of Black Women Who Changed America'] that profiles African-American women who helped shaped, shape American life.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And one of the things they talk about in there, which is what--one of the things she shared with us at the time was that she was technical advisor to the Gershwin Brothers, Ira [Gershwin] and George [Gershwin], for the first rendition of 'Porgy and Bess.'  And she would say, you know, I've been black longer than they have (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now this is a cultural link that a lot of people are probably wondering about: How could George and Ira Gar, Gar, Gar, Gershwin write pointedly about black life having not been black and not lived in those communities?  But Dr. Jessye was a technical consultant.
Speaker 2: She was a technical consultant.  Dr. Jessye started her career or very early in her career, conducted choirs, and orchestras, and did, you know, she was a composer as well and very well-versed in that culture.  And so yes, she was a, a, a much valued resources for that kind of, you know, focus to get it right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Where was she from originally?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't, I don't recall, Larry [Crowe], where she was from.  I'd have to, I'd have to think on that.  I don't recall now.
Speaker 1: It just occurred to me.  It's not so much a question for you as it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and I just wondered--(unclear)--I have to look, I have to look that up myself.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: But, yeah, but, okay, so, any, any other professors or teachers or experiences at, at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] that, that are significant in shaping what you ended up doing?
Speaker 2: You know, there were, there were many in my area that, where I ended up getting my doctorate, but they were, they helped shape me while I was at U of M, so, Dr. Richard Haas, Dr. [Loren] Lamont Okey.  Both of them were very strong scholars and practitioners in the world of what we call performance studies--Richard Burgwin.  There's one gentleman whose name I won't name, but he was instrumental to me in a negative kind of way.  You know, there are some teachers who teach you what you need to learn through positive, uplifting, supportive learning.  This particular fellow was, he was actually associated with the school of education, and I was working on my certification at the time and teaching secondary school.  And I remember being--I don't know--maybe five, maybe ten minutes late to some class function that we were gathering for and so on and so forth.  And I'm not often late, but for some reason that morning I was late, and he just lit into me, you know.  And you know, and it was one of those moments where the, the reaction seemed to be like way bigger than what the, the crime was, the offense was.  And I thought, what, you know, what is going on up in here?  And so, I, I just remembered that moment, and I'm, you know.  And what I remember most about it, again, because he was a, an education professor, just how not to treat people, you know, how not to treat students, particularly if you want them to learn, and more importantly, more importantly, how not to treat other human beings regardless of whether it's a learning environment or not.  So unfortunately, I, I remember him for that, but that taught me a lot about what not to do, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 145613
Speaker 1: All right, so, what did you do when you graduated [from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I went straight from undergraduate to graduate sch- grad, graduate school and--excuse me--
Speaker 1: At, at, at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I could take--
Speaker 1: So you graduated in what year, was it?
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and started my master's work there in '75 [1975] as well.
Speaker 1: And you were working on a master's in what field?
Speaker 2: In speech and theater.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever consider becoming an anthropologist?  Did you, were you--
Speaker 2: I, I did at one time; I was very interested in anthropology, but I realized that was not the discipline that I cared most about, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I knew it was in there for some reason (laughter).  Okay, so, any, any stories about your master's degree--
Speaker 2: You know, I--
Speaker 1: --in--
Speaker 2: --there are lots.  I think the, the, the big story is that I just sailed through my master's program.  I had such a blast (laughter).  I, I was in a, I was in a field where speech and theater, both of which were just fun for me; they were exciting.  I got to study literature deeply.  I was in a, in an area of theater called performance studies. And so, these days we take it for granted that you can stage a novel or stage a short story.  Well, back in those days it was like unheard of.  You know, if it wasn't a play, it didn't get on stage, and so performance studies was devoted to literature that was not written with the intent of being performed on stage.  And so the curriculum basically is how to shape poetry, or how to shape a short story, or how to shape a novel into a performance piece, or how to shape a newspaper column, or a telephone entry, you know, and, and, and give I some performative kind of dimension.  And like I said, I, I, my two years in my master's program just sailed, sailed by.  I worked incredibly hard I remember into the wee hours, and it just felt like play, you know, like (laughter), didn't feel like work, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you finished your master's in, in what year?
Speaker 2: In '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-seven [1977].
Story_ID: 145614
Speaker 1: And I was sure that I was gonna be an academician, so I went straight into my doctoral work.
Speaker 2: Okay, at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] as well?
Speaker 1: No, I, I went out to--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Los Angeles [California] to USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So that's a--now, what, how did, how did you choose USC?
Speaker 1: Kind of by default, because I knew that to teach in that field, to get three degrees from the same university, was, at least at that time, was considered you know, not the thing to do.  So as much as I wanted to stay at U of M because of their strong program, I knew that I should move on and get a broader base of research and experience.  So I looked at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois], which was a really strong school at that time in that discipline, still is.  And I looked at USC and a few other schools, and USC looked the most promising in terms of the faculty, the opportunities, and it was a, you know, it's a private school.  They offered me a full scholarship, and I thought, hmm, what's not to like about this (laughter).  And they had a couple of really strong faculty at the time that I wanted to work with, so.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, how did you like California?
Speaker 1: I loved USC.  I did not like Los Angeles [California] (laughter).  So I stayed--I was really focused.  I had a goal to complete my Ph.D. in three years not the five years that it typically takes.  And I did it and promptly moved out of L.A., next door to Santa Monica [California].  So I ended up staying a lot longer in that area than I intended to, but.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you, you, you earned your Ph.D. in 1980, right?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And did, what, what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 1: My dissertation was looking at the performance of poetry that is separated from its music, so I chose ballads to look at, because ballads have a, a tradition of being understood as poetry.  And ballads at one time were actually connected to the music.  And so I looked at the history of that tradition with, within the context of performing those poems as performance pieces.
Speaker 2: Okay, so did you look--I mean, how broad a scope--I mean, I mean did you look at, like, European ballads, or did you look at some of the West African ballads--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I mainly looked at European ballads--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --out of the English tradition.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I drew on other sources, so I looked at West African sources and how, in that world anyway, the two haven't become separated.  But in the English and the European tradition they have.  So I really wanted to look at the separation, the aspects of separation and how to put them back together, how to look at the, the crumb trail, if you will, for showing the linkages and then the performance dimension as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So from what you're saying, I, I think, if I understand correctly, you're saying that in the early development of a ballad, it's, it's, it's a, it's meant to be song, right?
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: So it's not--I mean, the, those are--the, the two elements aren't separated out.
Speaker 1: Exactly, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's a, it's a lyric that's--
Speaker 1: It's a lyric.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, all right, okay--(unclear)--be like that in a, something like a song or role and then, or the--I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, that song or role actually is in that tradition.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and/or then you look at West Africa, it'd be like '[The Epic of] Sundiata'--(unclear)--you know.  But they don't separate 'em out.  This is literature, and this is singing.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And in our culture, we don't separate them out anymore.  I mean, you know, we have a ballad tradition here that where it's, it's singing and poetry at the same time.  But somehow along the way they got separated in the European tradition, yeah.
Speaker 2: Do you think, think--you know, I don't think people think much about the songwriter here today in this country as they do about--when they hear the song they think about the singer of the song, but they don't think about the songwriter even though if the words, even if the words are profound as it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I think that's generally true.  And I think that, you know, that's why a few of our songwriters who also are performers, incidentally, like people like, you know, like a Bob Dylan or somebody as, as acclaimed as a songwriter, you know.  But we have few of those; they are very few and far between, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, so, so many write the song but don't, don't perform it, right--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, we--
Speaker 2: --and don't get the recognition.
Speaker 1: --we tend to follow 'em up with the singer, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 145615
Speaker 1: All right, so, you earn your Ph.D. [from University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] in 1980, and so you moved to another part of southern California.  And did, did you start teaching, or what did you do?
Speaker 2: Right after my Ph.D., I interviewed for several positions and realized that after all that studying all those years, that being in academia was not for me, not at that time in my life.  It was very, very narrow and constrictive.  It just felt tight to me, and I wanted to do more things than what I realized I could do in the academy.  So I ended up working in communication in an entirely different arena.  I, I left the world of performance behind and went into technical communication, working in the business world of all places.  I'd never dreamed that I'd be there, but that's where I ended up.
Speaker 1: I mean, well, what job did you, did you--how did that happen?  I mean how did you get--
Speaker 2: How did that happen (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I, like I said, I, I realized that working, working as a professor, as a researcher just wasn't, you know, gonna cut it for me at the time.  And so I, you know, did a lot of soul searching and did a lot of just, you know, looking at, so this is what I've been studying for the last, you know, umpteen years, ten years or whatever.  And here are some threads that I might be able to, you know, pull up and make a, make a, at least a job out of it and maybe a profession.  And so I looked at the common threads between the communication that I had studied, you know, in my undergraduate and my graduate degrees and kind of mapped that out to what the professional world outside of academia was looking for.  And I'd always kind of had an interest in science and technology and that kind of thing.  And so, it was one of those I think lucky convergences of, you know, my preparation and just hittin' the streets and trying to figure out what I could do with this degree.  It wasn't an easy transition, I can tell you.  A lot of people over here, you know, the business world, looked at me and you know, they saw the Ph.D., and they go, oh my God, you know, ivory tower, you know (laughter); we don't need her.  And so, I remember collecting rejection letters, you know, just to learn from them.  Okay, so, you know, look at the pattern.  What are they really looking for?  And I eventually found a company.  Honeywell was the first place that I worked after that.  And they actually hired me because I told them that I was willing to go back to school (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what did, what did, what did, did you do for Honeywell?
Speaker 2: I was a technical writer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they said we'll hire you if you go back to school and learn how to program these computers.  And I said okay, send me, and they did.
Speaker 1: So this is 1980--
Speaker 2: This is 1980.
Speaker 1: In 1980?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --back in the days when computers were as big as this room.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: You know, then you had--
Speaker 1: It was just be--
Speaker 2: --punch cards to, you know, tell 'em what to do.
Speaker 1: Right, right, and they were just starting to make a transition to the smaller computers I think the, with the Mac Plus came out in what, '82 [1982] or something, '83 [1983]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Since--(unclear)--so you, you, you were on the ground floor of then-new computer technology.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I worked as a technical writer for a couple of years.  And then I realized that I really liked education.  You know, that's what I had been training to do, you know, become a teacher all along.  And there was this wonderful emerging field called technical education as well.  And so I ended up staying in the high-tech world for almost twenty years, just working my way through the maze of, you know, what I could do with my communication and education background, found out that I really liked leading projects, leading project teams, and managing other people, and I ended up being a manager for most of that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, throughout the eighties [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Throughout the eighties [1980s] into the nineties [1990s].
Story_ID: 145616
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in '86 [1986], at age thirty-three, you earned an M.B.A. from University of Southern California [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Now you got a Ph.D., so--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --you go back and get an M.B.A.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) a glutton.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: A glutton for learning, yes, I did.  I was in the business world.  I realized that to get ahead there, you know, my academic background was great, but it wasn't gonna earn me many bucks in the, you know, in the management, in the management tiers.  And I really didn't know that much about business.  Like I said, I had no idea that I'd end up working there.  And so the M.B.A. actually gave me more background and context for the world that I was living in and working in, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so, in other words, you may, may have been a Ph.D. in performance studies, but in the business world you, it didn't count for much.
Speaker 2: Not very much--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --not for the field that I had chosen to work in, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 145617
Speaker 1: So, it says here you were also appointed assistant professor of, at the College of Engineering at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] in '88 [1988].  Am I, am I, are we going too fast here?  Are we going--
Speaker 2: No, that's fine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is after, after you worked in the--
Speaker 2: In the business--
Speaker 1: --tech, yeah, the technical field in--
Speaker 2: In tech, in high-tech.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in business for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so at the University of Washington this would be a job at, in their College of Engineering.
Speaker 1: Now how did that come about?  I mean, how did you even know that, that was opening up, or how did they know about you and--
Speaker 2: Because--that's a great question--I, I think intuitively, in business I always wanted to ground the work that I was doing in business with what was going on in terms of the research.  And I knew enough about academic research to be able to marry the two.  So I was always in some way, shape, or form affiliated with the university, even though I was working over here, so I would be an adjunct teacher or blah, blah, blah, something to kind of keep my feet wet.  And I would always, as a, as a manager, use the resources of their research in engineering, or human factors, or whatever it happened to be to feed the processes that we used in business.  So I learned about the opening at UW through--I think it was because I was on the adjunct faculty at the time.  And it seemed to be the right time in my life to make a transition back into academe--well, not into academe; I never really, you know, consummated that after my Ph.D.  You know, my daughter was still young enough.  I felt like I had done what I wanted to do in the business world, and it just seemed to be good timing to, to be a tenure track faculty.
Story_ID: 145618
Speaker 1: --Okay, well, well, let's go back to that for a second now.  Now, you get married at a certain point, right, in--
Speaker 2: I got married--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --right after undergraduate [at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So we missed that part (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so, how did you meet your husband?  Where, where did you meet and what, what--
Speaker 2: I met my husband in high school [at Huron High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], so high school sweethearts.  We met through music.  We were both very, very much into music: orchestra, band, choir, any extracurricular activities we could figure out how to, you, know, be involved in, jazz band, traveling to different countries being musical ambassadors, that kind of thing.  So we had a lot of the same passions and interests.
Speaker 1: So you actually traveled to different countries as a part of the band in the--
Speaker 2: As part of the band--
Speaker 1: --in, in, in high school?
Speaker 2: --this was not part of the high school band, but it was something that found out about through our high school.  And our conductors were very much involved, and this was People to People, a program called Musical Youth International.  And they would sponsor programs that for the summer, for about eight weeks in the summer, would take you to foreign countries to be goodwill ambassadors through music.  And so both John, my husband, and I got to travel with them for a couple of years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a, that's a good experience it sounds like.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What countries did you go to?
Speaker 2: Let's see, the, let's see, the first time we went to Great Britain, so England, Scotland, and Wales.  The second time we went, we went to Germany, Denmark, back to England, and some of the United States, like the Eastern Seaboard: D.C., Washington, D.C., New York [City].  Yeah, I think that was--Austria; we went to Austria as well--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you met--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in high school, but ha, ha, when did you get married, did you get--
Speaker 2: We got married right after undergrad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: July of that year [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, and your daughter was born in--
Speaker 2: Daughter was born in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when we lived in Santa Monica [California] actually, but, you know, they're right next door to each other.  And I re, you know, we, John and I knew that we didn't want to raise Quinn in L.A.  So that was the, the nudge to get us out of southern California, and we moved here to the Seattle [Washington] area.
Story_ID: 145619
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you were explaining how you found out about the job and how--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so through some of my connections with the faculty there [University of Washington College of Engineering, Seattle, Washington], a lot of technical communicators care about what we call human factors or how the customer experiences a particular product.  And so I had ties with the university faculty for that kind of research, found out about the opening, thought it was a good time for me to make the transition, interviewed well, and got a position on the faculty there.  And it was good; it was a good position for me, but it was the wrong time in my life.  I didn't realize that the pace of working at a big academic research-driven university would be as slow (laughter) as it was.  And so I think I stayed about a year and a half, and then I went back to business.
Speaker 1: So it was just too slow for you, huh?
Speaker 2: It was very slow, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well--
Speaker 2: Like at this point in my life, I think that that pace would be okay.  But at that point in my life, I was still in my thirties, and it was just way, way, way too slow, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so, so you left there in what year was it?
Speaker 2: Went back to business--
Speaker 1: In--
Speaker 2: Think I went to Aldus [Corporation] after that.
Story_ID: 145620
Speaker 1: Were, were they, were they calling, were they, they, they trying to recruit you from the school [University of Washington, Seattle, Washington], or were they, were, were, were, were people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I happened to--
Speaker 1: --after you?
Speaker 2: I happened to know someone who was at Aldus [Corporation].  And I told her, I said you know, you've got to get me out of here.  And she says, well, guess what, I wanna leave my position (laughter).  She said would you be interested in interviewing for it?  And I said well, sure.  And it was just one of those plum jobs that combined communication; it combined theater; it combined high-tech, all the stuff that I had, you know--like I said, God winks; God has a sense of humor, 'cause he prepares you, and you don't know you're being prepared.  But this was at the, at the time when what we now call--well, we now call it the Internet, but at that time we were calling it multimedia, was just coming, you know, on stage.  And all of my training, and background, and experience just kind of came together for this particular position at Aldus.
Speaker 1: Now, Aldus is known for PageMaker--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and other, other graphic--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --applications.  Is, is, is Aldus still--
Speaker 2: Aldus is no longer around--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --although we think it is.  We have a group called Aldusions [ph.], and we still stay in touch with each other.  But they were bought by Adobe Systems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Adobe is still very much in business, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, all the Adobe functions are carryovers from, they have something, they have some remnants--
Speaker 2: They--
Speaker 1: --of Aldus.
Speaker 2: They have some remnants of the old products, and a lot of the Adobe products that they already had, as well as a lot of new products, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Story_ID: 145621
Speaker 1: So, well, how did you like work, working at Al--now, how could you use your theater skills at, at Aldus [Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Because multimedia is actually a, a wonderful blend of, it's what I call virtual theater; it's theater but it's on a screen.  And so you have, you have people that you include in your multimedia, so actors or players.  You are creating a virtual experience for people, which is very similar to creating like a play on, on the stage or really creating a virtual world that the audience members get to kind of look into and become a part of.  And that same kind of thinking is the kind of thinking that you have to, have to use when you're creating something that is virtual, that is not really real, okay, on a computer screen, yeah.
Speaker 1: Give us an example of what kind of, what are we talking about, a--I, I guess I'm just trying to figure out what, what form you're talk--
Speaker 2: So in today's world, let's think about video clips--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --okay.  This wouldn't, not have been true fifteen years ago (laughter) when it was an Adobe 'cause there was, the technology was way too slow.  But think about a video clip.  All the, all the skills that you need to use, like you guys are using now, (laughter) okay, you'd have to think about how you're gonna shoot the--you could conceive the scene, how you're gonna shoot it, how you're gonna light it, what, you know, positions you're gonna place the actors in, what they're gonna wear to make you feel like you're actually creating something that is real, believable, something that I could experience too.  And so all of the skills that you would need to create a video clip that would be interesting, and engaging, and keep your attention for, you know, a minute, a minute and a half would be the same kinds of skills that you would have needed in that world that we used to call mul, multimedia.  Does that make sense?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just, I'm, I'm guess I'm trying to get at what's, what formal--or, or just give an example of a piece that you created for Aldus that, I mean, that would use a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't have been creating it.  I was a--
Speaker 1: --or--
Speaker 2: --manager at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was overseeing the graphic artists, the graphic designers, the engineers, the technical writers, and editors who would have been creating the software, or the documentation for the software, or the educational experience for the software.
Speaker 1: We're talking about software doing a lot more things than just PageMaker then.  That's what we're talking.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, so that's, that's where I'm--(unclear)--I can't see, see that being applied to PageMaker, but, but, but like what, for, for instance?
Speaker 2: Okay, so for example, let's, let's--
Speaker 1: Educational--
Speaker 2: Well, let's take it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --back to PageMaker.  So, for PageMaker, you have this product that allows you to do, you know, typing and laying out pages so that they look good.  For to learn how to do that, you'd have a user education experience.  So you might have a tutorial, okay, or some sort of tour of the product.  So my group would have been responsible for creating that educational experience, and to make it as realistic as possible, and to make it online, experiential, interactive, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Does that make sense?
Speaker 1: Okay, it makes sense.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Thank you (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're welcome (laughter).
Story_ID: 149144
Speaker 1: Well, we're in the '90s [1990s] now, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now we got another master's degree here we haven't talk, talked about, a master's degree from, in applied behavioral science from Bastyr University [Kenmore, Washington].  Now, now, this is, this makes, what, the third master's degree?
Speaker 2: Third master's.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so what is this one about?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, by this time, I am really thinking about the rest of my life and what I want to do with the next chapter.  And I had, you know, become very attached to management, managing people in the world of business.  And what I really cared more about, what I, what I figured out was not so much the high-tech, the bits, and the bites, part of it, but really the people and how the work got done.  And so this degree was actually a nice way for me to learn more about how people think, how they behave, how a values drive their decisions, etc., etc., which is really, you know, what managers, at least what good managers, I think, think about in, in, in business or in any other context.  And so I, I, I wanted to, I knew I wanted to consult in some way, shape, or form, Larry, by this point.  And the degree from Bastyr was a focus in leadership development and consulting.  And so that was my, that was my motivation.  I didn't know at that time if I wanted to stay inside of a business and do that kind of consulting or if I wanna just, you know, hang my own shingle and start my own practice.  By the time I finished that degree, I realized that I really wanted to work on my own and start my own practice, so that's what I did.  I had the opportunity to do that.  When Aldus [Corporation] merged with Adobe, they actually offered me venture capital to start my own high-tech company.  And although it was very tempting at the time, I said no.
Story_ID: 149145
Speaker 1: I really wanted to start my own company but not in high-tech, so I walked away and started Jazz, Incorporated.
Speaker 2: Okay, now what, what year is this when you start Jazz?
Speaker 1: This would have been 1994, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is just as you're--let's see--yeah, okay, so that's a year before you finished your, your master's degree in leadership development.
Speaker 1: So actually I may have the date wrong then, because it was 1995 that I started my practice.  It was after I--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --it was after I got my degree.  I'm sorry, off by a year.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so 1995.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now why did you call it Jazz?
Speaker 1: 'Cause I love jazz, and I love music, and I loved the metaphor of jazz in particular; because, as a consultant, you have to have kind of a point of view about your work, and my point of view is that people in organizations know what they're doing.  But sometimes they lose their way (laughter), you know, because things change.  The business gets bought; the business gets sold; the business, you know, is struggling; the business has, you know, an infusion of cash, and they don't know what to do with it; the products sell; the products don't sell.  You know, people go crazy trying the make the numbers or you know, do whatever.  And you know, having worked in business for almost twenty years by this point, you know, I knew that there were certain ways that people perform with just incredible excellence, and that happened very rarely.  But my belief about people is that they want to do excellent work, and sometimes they just can't because the process isn't correct, or the, the funding isn't there, or the resources aren't there, or the people aren't trained, or the whatever, the whatever.  But my fundamental belief is that people know what they're doing.  They just need sometimes a little help to get there.  And with jazz, my understanding of jazz is that, you know, people know what they're doing.  Good jazz ensembles, every single player, you know, whether it's a three, you know, or four, or five person combo, whether it's a whole jazz orchestra, they all know what they're doing.  And they each take turns being followers; they each take turns being leaders, and that's what happens in business, but they don't call it--it's, you know, it's not--they don't really conceive of it in the same way.  And so I wanted to take this metaphor and see if it could work over in the business world to see if, you know, that follower/leadership dynamic could actually play out in, in the business world.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So what exactly does Jazz do now?
Speaker 1: Lots of different things.  My focus is leadership development, so that's the core of the practice.  And because I care about race, and gender, and age, my leadership work is always cross-cultural.  So there's always that cross--there, there always braided together.  I don't separate out cross-cultural diversity work for my leadership work.  So in my practice I sometimes create leadership institutes.  So I'm a consultant to organizations that need leadership training or leadership expertise in some way, shape, or form, and I create specialized programs or institutes for, for their employees.  I also am an executive coach, so I work with leaders on being their best at where they are in their organization or working with them to leave a good legacy behind.  So, like I said, the, the central focus is always leadership development, and it takes different forms: consulting, developing institutes, or coaching.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, so people hire, hire you to come in and try to make a difference in their organization by getting people on the same page and--
Speaker 1: On the same page.
Speaker 2: --and pushing 'em, you know, I guess--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, I try not to push 'em (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, well, lead or--
Speaker 1: But to, but to--
Speaker 2: --inspire them.
Speaker 1: --to inspire them to find what is already usually within them, but somehow it's either been tamped down or you know, their roles have changed so maybe they learn, need to learn new skills or a new way of behaving in their particular position, yeah.
Story_ID: 149146
Speaker 1: What's the, what's the biggest problem your--well, well, what's, well, I guess, what's, what's the most common problem you're asked to address or the common problems that businesses have that, that consult with you?
Speaker 2: Probably the most common one these days is getting people, to use your words, on the same page.  And sometimes it has to do with the overall vision for the company, for the organization, new opportunities, so, you know, how do we get there from here?  How do we get everybody aligned and kind of singing from the same sheet of music, so to speak.  Sometimes that looks like getting two individuals aligned so it can, you know, be at an organization-wide level, or it could be just between you and me, like we aren't quite getting it.  You know, we aren't doing what we need to be doing together.  So it can be very, very small scale or large scale, but getting people aligned and marching, you know, so to speak, in the same direction, pulling in the same direction.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, so, give us an example I guess of what, what exercises I guess or, or events you would, you know, put together to help a, a group out, you know, in that kind of situation.  And does it take a lot of time?  Do they have to devote a week to what you're doing, or do they have to--
Speaker 2: It depends, it really depends on the group; it depends on how far along they are; it depends on how much chaos there is; or how much disalignment there is.  Sometimes it can be a conversation where I'm a coach.  Like, say you're the executive of an organization.  And I'm sitting here talking to you, and maybe you are pretty hip, okay.  So you can pretty much do this on your own, but maybe you just need a little shoring up, or a little coaching, a little direction.  So I may be working with you behind the scenes, but you're actually doing the work for the organization.  So that's one way that it can look, and maybe that takes, you know, depending again on, on, on where your business is, where you want to take your organization, how fast and how far.  It can take a half a day; it could take a day; it could take a week; it could take a month; it could take several years, it just depends.  A lot depends on the, the size of the organization as well, relative to your competitors and what they're doing.  So it's not necessarily just about the, you know, the, the organization itself.  Sometimes it could be I'm working with the executive teams.  So I'm working with you as the executive as well as all of the vice presidents who report to you because you can't do it without them, and they have to be pulled along as well.  You know, maybe, maybe one or two people are just promoted in, into their position, and they don't quite have enough skill or experience.  And so maybe I'm just working with those two individuals, in addition to working with the whole team, but working with those two individuals kind of off line and then working with the whole team.  Sometimes it's developing a nine-month or a twelve-month institute.  Because really, the skill sets are so varied, you wanna kind of even the playing field out.  So you want everybody to go through kind of the same experience, educational experience.  So it really just depends on what's needed.
Story_ID: 149147
Speaker 1: So consulting takes a lot of your time, I take it?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: But you also have found time to publish poetry and to participate in writing work, workshops and such.  And tell us a little, little bit about that, if it's not too soon (laughter) to talk about.
Speaker 2: No, I, you know, people ask me how I find so much time to do all these different things.  And for me it's like how, I don't know how not to do them.  For me, Larry [Crowe], poetry, music, poetry, the, the arts feed the work that I do as a consultant.  They're like soul food for me.  It's like I get, I get Gloria back, and I get to be in balance by writing poetry, something that I really care deeply about, something that I'm pretty good at.  I get fed by doing that.  And for, because I'm a public speaker as well, I often use poetry in my keynotes.  And people are always asking for a copy of my keynote or that poem that I shared or whatever, and I--you know, for years, I would say, well, you know, here's a copy of it.  And then I realize, you know, people are really liking this stuff.  Maybe I should pull it together into a manuscript into a book form.  And so about ten, eleven years ago I decided to start publishing my poetry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 149148
Speaker 1: Well, what you just said about trying to keep, keeping in touch with who you really are and that informing what you do in business, you think that's pretty, pretty much true across the board?  'Cause I've heard there are some managers that say that, you know, they, they really want their employees to be absorbed in the business and not--in fact, one, one, one even wrote, wrote once you can, you can serve no other master in this business (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, I hear both, I do.  And I hear that less these days, what you just said, than I used to, but it's not the norm.  Most managers in business want their employees to be focused on the work, okay.  But I'd say, you know, more and more, I hear from men, and more women, but men and women managers who want the whole person to be there, because they know that to get the best--you know, you can't get the best out of somebody who's just focused on the work, and they're leaving half of themselves behind in the parking lot.  You know, most good managers know that to get the best product or service, they need, they need 100 percent of Larry, okay, and they need all the diversity that you can bring as an individual.  They don't need 50 percent of you left outside.  And I'd say more women than men get that, or at least they're more vocal about it.  I was looking at a survey in Pink magazine a few months ago.  And in my line of work we call this being authentic at work, that hundred percent stuff, being authentic, being real, you know, bring all the parts of yourself to who you, to, to your work.  And there are something like 52, 53 percent of women managers who get that and who actually declare that that's what they want from their staff, which is pretty significant.  That was not the case when I, you know, began doing this work ten years ago.
Story_ID: 149149
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about your poetry.  Now you, you pu- you, you published three books so far.
Speaker 2: Three books.  One is a chapbook, a very small book of poems.  And two are available on bookstores, 'Journey of the Rose' and 'The Open Door.'  'Journey of the Rose' is really, I'd say, my first complete book of poetry.  And it's the culmination of poems that I actually worked on when I was studying with Robert Hayden back in my college days [at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] through poetry that I had written just as recently as when the book was published ten years ago, so just a wide spectrum of poets, poetry.  'The Open Door' is an exploration of my ancestry, my African heritage, beginning with Africa and the Middle Passage and my life here in the United States as an African American.
Speaker 1: Now have you been to Dakar [Senegal], or to Goree Island [Senegal], or the, the--
Speaker 2: I've not been to Goree, but--
Speaker 1: --or the--
Speaker 2: --I feel like I've been there.  You know what, the first time I went to Africa was actually last year.  And I'd say that my soul has been in Africa forever, and my body arrived last year.  But I feel like that place I know like the back of my hand, you know, like my, my cells know that place, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, the--I can see, when I was reading some of the poetry, I could see the influence of Robert Hayden, you know.  I could--you could even tell, you know, that, that--why do you think the Middle Passage was such a profound focus for a lot of black poets and writers?
Speaker 2: You know, I think several reasons.  I think one of the reasons is because it's so much a part of our history and so much a part of who we are, how we identify.  And it was such a horrific episode, era in our history.  And so, to do [due] diligence as a poet, I just believe that we have to explore that part of our history.  Even if we don't write about it, it's a part of who we are; it's a part of our cellular; it's a part of our DNA, and I'd say that literally as well as metaphorically.  We pay--you know, just like jazz musicians build on what other jazz musicians have done, poets do the same thing.  I mean we have an, a heritage basically to build on.  I think another reason the Middle Passage is so seductive, and this is my personal believe, but I believe that the 21st century that we live is a perpetual middle passage.  You know, there's always some group, some culture, some ethnic group somewhere on the planet that's being just ripped asunder from their geographic underpinnings, from their cultural heritage, from everything that they've known and identified with.  And so from a, from a metaphorical standpoint, I believe that poets sort of naturally gravitate to this thing that we call the Middle Passage, and I believe people do as well.  When I, when I talk about and read my poems from 'The Open Door' and talk about the Middle Passage not just being the, connected with the African slave trade, people get it, they get it.  You know, they get that 9/11 [September 11, 2001], for example, is an example of what I'm talking about, is that, you know, larger context of the Middle Passage.  When I talk about apartheid in South Africa, when I talk about the ethnic cleansing in, you know, Bosnia, or anywhere on the planet, they get it.  And I think of all of those as, as examples of middle passages, if you will.
Story_ID: 149150
Speaker 1: Well, tell us something about the cave--
Speaker 2: Cave Canem?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Ca, Cave Canem, alright (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: That's how much I know about it.
Speaker 2: That's all right.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Cave Canem is a fellowship of poets.
Speaker 1: That's, that's spelled C-A-V-E, like cave--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but it's Cave--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's Latin.
Speaker 1: --Kanem, K-A-N-E-M [sic, Canem], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, beware of the dog.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Latin.  Cave Canem is a fellowship of poets and writers from the African Diaspora.  It's largely African American poets, but we have African Canadians, African Central Americans, South Americans and so on.  And it's really, it's, it's a, it's a haven.  It's a nurturing place, if you will, for black voices because we don't get that kind of nurturing amongst other black voices, particularly in poetry.  So it was started about twelve years ago by Toi Derricotte and Cornelius Eady, two poets who have, you know, planted a seed for something to grow.  And it's just grown into this wonderful fellowship of, of writers and poets that support each other whether we're in the same room or you know, thousands of miles apart.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and that's a--so you have a retreat every year or is it, or, or--
Speaker 2: There's a re--
Speaker 1: --several times a year?
Speaker 2: There's a retreat every summer to nurt--to bring in new writers and to feed the fellows who want a multiyear experience.  So you can go back as a writer three times over a five-year period, which is unusual.  Usually, you go to a writers retreat and then you're done with it, but this is intended to build a community.  And they, we have gatherings, and events, and readings throughout the year.  They're largely on the East Coast, because that's where a lot of the writers live.  That's where Toi and Cornelius live, but we're gettin' bad out here too, and we're pullin' 'em to the West Coast, so, yeah.  This fellowship has made such a difference in the twelve years that's it's been in existence in terms of black poets getting published by major periodicals and journals, which is how you do it in poetry.  That's, you know, how you kind of get your name out and build your following, build your credentials as a poet.  It's made a difference in terms of the, the kind of prizes that black poets are being awarded and recognized for.  It's made a difference in terms of prize winners outside of the normal literary prizes but positioning poets for, you know, big, big awards and recognitions that normally we wouldn't even be recognized for, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 149151
Speaker 1: Let me--we try to ask some reflective questions now I guess since we're kind of towards the end.  When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: I probably wouldn't have cashed in my Adobe stock (laughter).  And I say that and, and you know, I, I, I probably would not have so soon.  If I'd held onto it, I could probably, you know, be doing the kind of writing work that I really, really wanted, want to do right now and be able to fund it.  You know, I, I, I don't think so.  I, when you look back on your life, it makes sense in a way that it doesn't when you're right in the middle of it or when you're looking forward.  You know, as I've mentioned throughout this time, some of the things that seemed to be like, well, so why did I spend time over here, you know, ten years later, or twelve years, or fifteen years later, makes sense to me now in terms of why I had that particular experience or why I went to this particular school or you know, got this particular degree.  It all makes sense in hindsight.  It, I couldn't have seen this part of my life even ten years ago, let alone twenty or twenty-five years ago.  So I think in, in retrospect, I, I don't, I don't think of anything that I would do differently.
Story_ID: 149152
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Some of my hopes are connected to my concerns.  And I hope that our young people, in particular, and I'm talking about our twenty-somethings and thirty-somethings, learned about their history and learn about the price that others paid for them to be able to do what they are able to do now so freely.  And my concern is that they won't, that they won't take the time to learn, that, you know, they are a generation or two removed from the struggles and the, the sacrifices that, that we made, that some of us made.  And in my generation and certainly before my generation, I just think that we're, you know, setting ourselves up to repeat some of the same stuff that we've been through if we don't learn from our past.
Story_ID: 149153
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what are your future plans?  You, you plan to write more or to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  I just completed another book.  It's coming out this fall.  It's called 'Dare to Wear Your Soul on the Outside.'  And it picks up some of the themes from my previous book around legacy, and being true to your calling, and the character qualities that make for strong family, strong communities.  I enjoyed writing that book.  It was a lot of work, a lot of research, a lot of time.  But I, I really love writing, and so I hope to do more writing.  And when I mentioned, you know, before about not selling my stock, it takes a lot of time away from other things to write.  And you need money to live on, so there's the practicality of, you know, making a living and writing.  And sometimes it's very hard to do both well.
Story_ID: 149154
Speaker 1: Now, right now you're still, you know, somewhat young by the standards that we have for interviewing people, so, but, but what, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think my legacy so far has been in helping to lay the groundwork for others to become the best that they can be.  I do a lot of work with children, and I call it leadership work.  With them I don't call it leadership work.  I call it, I call it character building work now.  Yeah, but caring about our, our children and youth and planting seeds for them, and helping them grow into, you know, their fullness, and also helping adults to do the same, and to really step forward and to put their voice out there.  That's what I mean when I say dare to wear your soul on the outside, is to make your voice known, because there's only one of you in all time.  You know, there's only one Larry; there's only one Gloria; and there's only, you know, our calling, our voice.  Our calling can only come through us, and I think that's essential.  So I think that's, that's my legacy so far.
Story_ID: 149155
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us something about your family.  I know you have a daughter [Quinn Burgess] and a husband [John Burgess], right, so--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: I have a daughter who's twenty-one, and her name is Quinn.  She just graduated from Mount Holyoke College [South Hadley, Massachusetts], and she's a history major.  You know, she is the light of my life.  She has absorbed a lot of the stuff that I talk about, that I believe, my legacy, if you will.  She's going after her dream.  Her minor is costume production, of all things.  We never believed in TV, so we only got three channels in our house the entire time that she was growing up (laughter).
Speaker 1: What three?
Speaker 2: So she was TV deprived, three channels.  But she watched old movies growing up and really came to appreciate film, and the costuming, the characters, the stories, the, just really good classic, classic films.  And she was fallen in love with designing these magnificent costumes and combining history with that.  She's very interested in mid-18th--mid-19th century history and costuming.  And you know, it's one of those things about be careful about your values because they might just rub off on your kids (laughter).  So she's going after what she, what she wants to do.  My husband is John Burgess.  And like I said, he's very much involved in music.  He chose a different profession.  He's in a, he has his own business as a consulting consultant.  He consults to all kinds of companies, manufacturing and accounting consulting connected to computer technology.  But he keeps busy with his music.  He's a composer, so he's composed lots of things for our church orchestra.  He accompanies me in my readings and my keynotes.  He's a very good keyboardist, piano player, and he also conducts our church orchestra as well.  So he keeps his hands in the pie (laughter).
Story_ID: 149156
Speaker 1: So is there anything I have not asked we need to answer before I ask my la, we need to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: You know, I would like to say, we, we, I talked to, a bit about my dad [Earnest McEwen, Jr.], and I'd just like to say a word about my mother [Mildred Blackmon McEwen] because she has been such and continues to be such an influence in my life.  I asked her one time, I said you know, how did you put up with all of daddy's stuff, (laughter) you know, puttin' himself out there, puttin' the family in, you know, potential danger?  And she just said you know, Gloria, I loved your father more than anything.  And she said I put up with it because I believed in him.  And she also said I put up with it because I believed in almighty God, and he would get us through anything.  So I just wanna honor my mother as well and thank her for just being such a blessing in my own life and so many other people's lives.
Story_ID: 149157
Speaker 1: Okay, last question is similar to legacy.  I think we have about twenty seconds left on this tape.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as someone who lends a hand and who finds a way to lift up your spirit, no matter what.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 142658
Speaker 1: This photo number is P1030053.  The photo is of my mother [Mildred Blackmon McEwen] standing and me standing.  And I am about maybe three years old here, so in the mid-fifties [1950s] this photo was taken.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: The next one is 055, and this photo is of my mother as a young girl.  And it looks like a studio picture with a painted backdrop.  She is in her early teens here, maybe thirteen or fourteen, so the decade would be the 1940s.
Speaker 2: The next photo is 056.  This is a photo of me and another student in a production at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] called 'Tambourines to Glory.'  And this was taken in the mid-1970s.
Speaker 1: The next photo is 057.  This is a photo of my maternal grandparents, my grandmother, Annie Blackmon, and my grandfather, Charlie Blackmon.
Speaker 2: The next photo is 058.  This is a photo of my paternal grandfather, Earnest McEwen, Sr.  And again, this is a photo in a studio with a painted backdrop.
Speaker 1: The next photo is 059.  This is a photo of me in my doctoral robe, so it's 1980.
Speaker 2: Next photo is 060.  This is a photo of my dad [Earnest McEwen, Jr.] in one of the labs that he worked in, probably at Detroit Osteopatic Hospital, Osteopathic Hospital [Detroit Osteopathic Hospital, Highland Park, Michigan], where he was working as a blood bank lab technician, so this must be in the 19, late 1960s, I imagine.
Speaker 1: The next photo is 061.  This is a photo of the cover of my book of poems called 'Journey of the Rose.'
Speaker 2: That's published in--
Speaker 1: It was published in 1998.
Speaker 2: Next photo is 062.  This photo is of the cover of my next book of poems called 'The Open Door,' and this was published in 2001.
Speaker 1: Next photo is 063.  This is the cover of a book that I wrote called 'Legacy Living: The Six Covenants for Personal and Professional Excellence,' and this was published in 2006.
Story_ID: 142659
Speaker 1: This is a photo of me and my mother [Mildred Blackmon McEwen].  I'm on the pedestal.  And it's the only photo that we have of me as little girl.  I was about three years old in this picture.  And my mother is standing off to the, to the side there.
Speaker 2: This is a photo of my mother as a young girl.  Her name is Mildred Blackmon McEwen, and we believe she's about thirteen or fourteen in this picture.
Speaker 1: This is a photo of me, Gloria Burgess, in a musical called 'Tambourines to Glory.'  I was playing a character called Bernie Lee [sic, Birdie Lee].
Speaker 2: About what year is that?
Speaker 1: This is probably about 1976, '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: This is a photo of my maternal grandfather and mother.  My grandfather's name is Charlie Blackmon.  We called him Big Daddy.  And this is a picture of my mother's mother, Annie Blackmon.
Speaker 1: And this is a photo of my paternal grandfather, Earnest McEwen, Sr.
Speaker 2: And what year is that?
Speaker 1: Mercy, this is, I'm guessing it's in the forties [1940s], but I'm not really sure.
Speaker 2: Not 1870?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No.
Speaker 2: And this is a photo of me and a graduate photo of one of my many degrees.  This is me in my doctoral robe, so this is 1980, Gloria Burgess.
Speaker 1: This is a photograph of my father, Earnest McEwen, Jr., working in the blood bank as a blood bank technician.
Speaker 2: This is 'Journey of the Rose.'  This is my second book of poetry, Gloria Burgess.  And this is the book that was supposed to be a leadership (laughter) that I now use with my work with leadership development.
Speaker 1: This book is called 'The Open Door,' and it's my latest book of poems, exploring poems and images from the Middle Passage into, from our, my African heritage.  And the arc of the book covers African Americans in the United States today.
Speaker 2: This is a, a recent book came out in 2006 called 'Legacy Living' ['Legacy Living: The Six Covenants for Personal and Professional Excellence'].  And the subtitle is The Six Covenants for Personal and Professional Excellence.  The book explores the inner qualities of leadership and spiritual values for living a good life and being a good human being.
