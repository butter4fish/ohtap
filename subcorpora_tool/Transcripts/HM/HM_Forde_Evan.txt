Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as a warmup, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My favorite food at the moment is lobster shrimp tacos.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Do you have a favorite color?

Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is:  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase or saying.  I talk so much, lately I've been quoting my father a lot, and I recently had a birthday, and so I've been quoting what my father used to say about aging.  He said there were--the three things he taught me about aging.  One was (chuckles)--the first thing he taught me about aging is, "Aging is not for sissies."  The second thing he told me about aging is that, "You should be gentle with yourself because eventually you're going to get to the age, and you won't know when that is, but everything that's wrong with you, you're going to die with that wrong with you."  And the third thing that he told me is, "Enjoy life, because everyday above ground is a good day, and if you don't believe me, trying missing one."
Story_ID: 27084
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but separately, then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll bring them together.  So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Margaret, M-A-R-G-A-R-E-T; maiden name was Carey, C-A-R-E-Y; and married name, Forde, F-O-R-D-E.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Miami, Florida, on April 4,1930, I believe.  Women are kind of funny about their age, so.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  So, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace her family, and what are the stories about what they were doing?
Speaker 2: On my mother' side, actually, I don't know that much of my family's history.  On my mother's side, I know that her father was actually born in the Bahamas in Eleuthera; and that (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Can you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: It is Bahamas.  E-L-E-U-T-H-R-A. [sic, ELEUTHERA]  Eleuthera.
Speaker 1: Eleuthera.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Bahamas is an island.  And her mother was from the Jacksonville [Florida] area.  And I know that my grandmother had seven or eight sisters, many of whom lived up until their nineties and even over a hundred.  And I know a little bit about the family that, somewhere in the family chain above that, and it may have been my great-grandfather, or one of them, that there's some Cherokee Indian and an Irishman on that side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories associated with that, I mean, in terms of it?
Speaker 2: Not, really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there a story about who the Irishman might be?
Speaker 2: I've seen a picture.  I mean, he looked like a serious Irish guy (laughs).  Like, no kidding, like I'd heard before, but when I saw the picture recently.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this would have been, like, in the nineteenth century or twentieth century?
Speaker 2: So if my mom was born in 1930, her mother was probably about twenty or twenty-one when she was born.  So this would have been in the 1800s sometime.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27085
Speaker 1: Is there a story about your grandfather coming from the Bahamas, about how he wound, wound up here, or what he was doing too? Coming to Miami [Florida]?
Speaker 2: There's a story about he and my grandmother met, that my grandmother was visiting Miami, visiting her sister here and traveling back to Jacksonville, excuse me, and was on a train, a passenger train, and they sat in the same compartment on the train, and by the time they arrived in Jacksonville, he had proposed to her and she agreed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But there's not a story about why he came to--how he ended up in Florida, or if he was on a merchant vessel, or if he came over for some specific reason (simultaneous--
Speaker 2: I don't know anything like that.
Speaker 1: --to go to school or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, do you know what your grandparents did for a living?
Speaker 2: The main thing I know about my grandmother is that she was the first Avon [makeup] lady I ever knew.  And so, she was very famous for selling Avon in Jacksonville.  My grandfather, I do not know what his occupation was.  Now that I think about that, that's maybe a little odd, but he and my grandmother were divorced shortly after my youngest uncle was born.  So, I was--by the time I met my grandfather, he was living here in Miami and had a new family with a son who was just two or three years older than me and that sort of thing, so.  But I--and I believe he was retired by then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now--so was your mother raised with her father in the home or had they divorced?
Speaker 2: Not apparently, only up until about age five or six.  And she, from all accounts, she was pretty young when they got divorced.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your mother went on to become a teacher.  So, was she a good student in school?  Did she like school?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know much about my mom's--actually, I don't know a lot about her childhood.  I know that she and my dad met at Florida A and M University [Tallahassee, Florida], and she was already a college student and preparing to become a teacher when she and my dad got married.  And my sister was born, my older sister, she's two years older than I, and my mom dropped out of school.  And so, the first several years of my life, I knew my mother as a cashier at the local grocery store.  That's what she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, eventually, my dad, who had become a surgical technician at the VA [Veterans Affairs] Hospital down here--by the way, he was the first black surgical technician there--became a classroom teacher and taught during the day and worked as a custodian at night and sent my mom back to school, and she became a teacher.  I mean, I actually went to my mom's graduation from college, which totally changed my family's life and history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, so did your mother have any stories at all about growing that she shared about growing up out of Miami, what the neighborhood was like?
Speaker 2: Well, actually--so she was born here in Miami, but was actually raised in Jacksonville.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about Jacksonville?
Speaker 2: I don't recall any stories about her childhood.
Story_ID: 27086
Speaker 1: Well, let's go to your father's side of the family, then we'll move on from there.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Samuel, S-A-M-U-E-L, James, J-A-M-E-S, Evan, E-V-A-N, Forde, F-O-R-D-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And he was Samuel James Evan Forde the Second.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he has more names than you (laughs).
Speaker 2: He does.  And he once told me in the same conversation where he mentioned that I'd become a oceanographer because my grades were below sea level, which was at my graduation.  He said, "If I'd known you were going to turn out so well, I would have given you my whole name instead of just Evan."
Speaker 1: Okay (laughs).  So your father had a sense of humor.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: So, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is April 16, 1927; Green Cove Springs, Florida.
Speaker 1: Green Cove Springs, Florida.  All right.  Now, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family? How far back can you trace his side?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I know that my father's father was born in Barbados, immigrated to--so he was born in--I'm going to say 1884 or something like, I just saw that recently; immigrated to the United States and was listed on--in the 1917 Census--actually, it was the Selective Service documents from that time--and he was already an M.D., a doctor.  So he was one of the first black, licensed physicians in the state of Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he became--this is your grandfather?
Speaker 2: This is my father's father, yeah, who never married my grandmother.  So my father actually grew up with the name Peterson and legally changed his name to Forde, when they got in the Army.  I found out after he died in going through his papers.
Speaker 1: So he was the first licensed M.D.--
Speaker 2: Not the first.
Speaker 1: --African American.
Speaker 2: But he was one of the first black, licensed physicians in the state of Florida, my grandfather, yeah.
Story_ID: 27087
Speaker 1: And I've hardly ever mentioned him [my grandfather, Samuel Forde Sr.] because I know that, during the time my father [Samuel James Evan Ford the Second] never got a high school diploma.  He dropped out of high school six times to work, because his mom was only making two dollars and fifty cents a week cleaning people's homes, and he had a father who was driving a Model T  Ford and could have easily have taken care of--if he didn't care to take care of the mother, of his child.  He have could easily made sure that my father's life was a lot easier.  But so, my father never graduated from high school, but worked.  You know, I know he worked on the ice truck, he worked as a milkman; he did all sorts of things.  When I ask him about it, knowing the importance of education, the impetus that he placed on it and how dedicated he was throughout his life in making sure high-quality education was available for everyone, how could he have dropped out of school, and he said, "When you're an able-bodied young man and you see your mother struggling, then that was the only thing I could think about doing, is trying to make things easier for my family."  So my dad was in the Army, and was training for the invasion of Japan when we dropped the atomic bomb.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This was 1945.  So--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was stationed at Fort Dix [Trenton, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my father and I were a lot closer.  We had golf course trips, fishing trips, boating trips, and that sort of thing.  So I know a little bit more about his childhood and growing up.
Speaker 2: So, did he-- so he was getting ready to be shipped over, but when they dropped the bomb, he didn't have to go.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I believe he was actually on a ship that turned around and came back, yeah.
Speaker 2: He finished the rest of his service in the United States?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And he was honorable discharged.  And what's interesting, when he came back, and taking advantage of the G.I. Bill, went to FAMU [Florida A and M University, Tallahassee, Florida] and was doing well, and his father sent for him; sent him a train ticket and offered to pay his expenses for college and pay for him to go to medical school, because my dad did want to be a doctor.  And, but then he would have to disown his mom and not associate with her any more.  And so my dad said he just got up and walked out.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  Now, is there a story about some kind of a bad, you know, I mean, there are very neglectful fathers, you know, in history, of course.  History is full of them, but he seemed like he had a real grudge against your grandmother.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, he, he had--he fathered two children with my grandmother.  So my uncle and my dad, and I believe it was the circumstances.  I calculated his age when he fathered my father as mid-forties, and my grandmother was only twenty years old.  And there's a family story that something happened during an examination, which in order to work in people's homes as domestic, you had to have health papers.  And so there was something not all above-board about--it's a family story about how their relationship began, and then once he became married, he married a woman who was a professional educator in Green Cove-- Green Cove Springs, Florida, and I understand there is a--actually, a display at a museum about that branch of the family about her and him, because he supposedly over forty thousand babies during his career, many of whom were white; like, well over ten thousand of whom were white.  So he must have been very good at what he did.
Speaker 2: And the only one in the rural area, I guess, to do it.
Speaker 1: I can imagine.
Speaker 2: So, but he is--he shared your father's name, but he's the first, and your father is the second?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so with the--supposedly, he and I have striking physical resemblance, except for the facial hair.  And there is a lot of conjecture about the name, Samuel James Evan, and Forde with an "e", being a very Scottish or Welsh name.  And there were a lot of Scottish and Welsh immigrants to Barbados during that time.  And, as a matter of fact, I went to--when I was purchasing, not my first car but one of them, the manager of the dealership was from Scotland, and he wanted to see me in his office because he thought I was a Scotsman.  And he saw he and he said, "Not what I expected to see."  He said, "But your name," he said, "There's three or four pages of Evan Fordes in the phone book in the city I grew up in."  So there's that thought that maybe his father was also.  So it's possible that great-grandfathers on both sides could have come from Wales [United Kingdom] or someplace.
Story_ID: 27088
Speaker 1: Now, your father went on to FAMU [Florida A & M University, Tallahassee, Florida], and he got involved in the--as a medical technician?
Speaker 2: Well, he was pre-med.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then once he was faced with being a husband and a father, felt that he really couldn't submit to going to medical school at that time, that it was more important that he provide finances for his family.  And once he got his degree, majored in biology, minored in chemistry, came to Miami [Florida] and began to work at the VA [Veterans Administrations] Hospital as a surgical technician.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's unfortunate that, that he passed in 1989 and doesn't know that his grandson, who was only three years old when he died, is in medical school now.  So he'd be very pleased.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But he didn't give up though.  He went to--I mean, he must have given up on becoming a doctor, but he went on to become a school teacher, didn't he?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He became a school teacher.
Speaker 1: A science teacher, all right.
Speaker 2: Science teacher, business manager, athletic director at a high school that, at that time, went all the way from seventh grade through twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: Now, what high school was that?
Speaker 2: North Dade Junior/Senior High School [Bunche Park, Florida], which I attended.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Where he taught me for one marking period (laughs), when I was in the seventh grade.  And it was kind of apparent to both he and I that that wasn't going to work out well, and I got transferred to another class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So he graduated from Florida A and M (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) So-- yeah.
Speaker 1: --with his teaching credentials.
Speaker 2: Well, actually, with a degree in biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And became a teacher.  He got certified as a teacher.  And later, actually, after I got my Master's degree, he got a Master's degree in education administration from Florida Atlantic University [Boca Raton, Florida].
Story_ID: 27089
Speaker 1: When you consider your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they walk, how they talk, how they look, even, who do you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh, my dad for sure.
Speaker 1: And why?
Speaker 2: First of all, I'm every bit of stubborn as he was, which is one of the reasons we butt heads quite a bit in my youth.  I thought he was the meanest person that ever walked the face of the earth.  And his name was Sam.  That's what people called him, except the kids--the people that grew up with him and his cousins, and those people actually called him Evan.  So by naming me Evan, he was sort of sore at naming me after himself.  But he told me later that his--that he could see something in me, but I just had this little, like, wild streak or stubbornness; and he said, "I felt that you were in danger at all times.  I felt you were in danger of dying tragically because you did something stupid, or with the fellas."  I wanted to be one of the boys or would do something criminal and wind up in prison.  And he said, "My strategy was through punishing you vigorously, putting the fear of Sam in you until you got the fear of God in you."  And he said, "One day a light came on."  So my dad, being a professional educator, and punishing me, yes, but never in anger, and the lectures that came along with the paddlings were as painful as the physical punishment.  But he fashioned a piece of wood into a paddle that was conceived (laughs)--conceived in righteousness and dedicated to the proposition that if he spared the rod, he'd spoil the boy.  And he wanted to make sure he wasn't--I was not going to be spoiled.  And one day that light did come on for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you attribute the light coming on to the discipline or the--?
Speaker 2: Well, he talked to me.  He talked to me all the time.  "This is why we're doing this.  This is why we're doing this this way, son."  I cut the grass and he'd come out--I'm twelve years old--and he would inspect the grass with me, the yard.  And if it wasn't done to his satisfaction, I wouldn't get my fifty cents allowance for that whole week  But by the time I was thirteen, I was cutting ten people's yards.  I had my own business.  And so I tell kids, "By the time I was twelve years old, the only thing I really did well was cut the grass, and I could really cut the grass," you know.  But he told me, "When you do a job, you don't walk away from it or you don't do it and run and hide.  You should be able to stand up and say, 'This is the work that I did, and I did it to the best of my ability, and if it's not to your satisfaction,' that is, the person that hired you to do it or asked you to do it, you'll work until you get it to their satisfaction."  So there is that discipline that he was instilling in me.  And so there was that, but he--the sense of humor, I used to hear some of his teacher friends used to come over on Friday afternoons, and they would sit around and entertain one another, and they were sort of lofty--I mean, Shakespeare and--combination of Shakespeare and Redd Foxx-type of humor.  And I used to be sitting in the room listening and wasn't getting hardly any of the humor.  I just got one of the Redd Foxx jokes about two weeks ago, by the way.  Some of it was definitely adult humor, and, but when somebody told a joke that they didn't think that was funny, sort of; for example, if my dad had said it, one of his friends would say, "That's amusing, Sam," you know.  And it was kind of fun to be sitting in the back of the room, and if he came back there, I'd kind of scurry in the closet or hide or pretending I wasn't paying attention.  And when he wasn't home, I'd listen to his Redd Foxx albums; I didn't get one one-twentieth of the jokes, I didn't get them.  So, but, there was that sense of humor.  And the sense that there are things in life that are going to come at you fast and hard, that you have to be absolutely serious about, and you don't have any choice.  But then there are these other times; we're fishing, we're bowling, we're playing golf, we're sitting around; he played the piano by ear, and we had a family song, it was really amazing.  There was this jocularity and laughter, even in the face of the most serious things that were going on.  You know, there's a time to be serious, and you dealt with it, and you were a man, and you were responsible.  You know, he went to Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] for a summer to learn the New Math.  I think I was eleven or twelve years old-- twelve.  And he said he didn't lose one moment's sleep thinking that our house wasn't secure.  He knew I was on the job.  And he never worried about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  I was either thirteen or--it was probably that summer when I was thirteen.
Story_ID: 27090
Speaker 1: Growing up, first thing that I remember as a child is being about two years old.  And I know I was two because we moved from mom's [Margaret Carey Forde] aunt's house into our own home.  And I remember running through the house, no furnishings, yelling and being able to hear my echo with my sister who was two years older, and being so short that when they moved the dining table in there, I could literally walk underneath the table.
Story_ID: 27091
Speaker 1: And so there was my older sister--
Speaker 2: Can you name them [your siblings] all and--
Speaker 1: My older sister is Bernadette, and she's two years younger; and I had a sister who was a little more than a year younger than me named Valerie who died when I was two years old, and I remember her very distinctly.  Some sort of traumatic brain injury. We don't-- I don't know if it was congenital or somebody dropped her.  There was a lot of mystery about it.  And I recall asking my mom, "Where's Valerie?  Where's Valerie."  And me and my sister would both ask, and she'd just start crying.  And it was about three years after that, my mom had actually gone back to college, and when my younger brother was born, she came home.  And my younger brother is Kevin, and Kevin was very interesting, five years younger than me; reading the entire Miami Herald by the time he was five years old; and I was struggling in school in group three, which is the worst group; group one, group two, group three.  So when I was in the fifth grade, for example, my brother was reading on the fifth-grade level, and I probably was only reading on about a third-grade level.   He was a little genius, very smart, and every academically that I wasn't.  And, you know, he didn't show any particular athletic skills or, you know, because my sister, at that point, in my family growing up was the son my father always wished that he had had, because she used to beat me up, slap me upside the head especially after I got a haircut.  "Baldy, scaldy, 1940s," slap me upside the head.  And I recall, you know, so my sister was also the one who was telling my dad everyday what I had done and causing me to get so many of those paddlings.  So she was not my favorite person at all.  But I really cherished my younger brother; and although I wasn't very physically strong or coordinated or anything, anybody who threatened my younger brother was gonna have a fight with me.  I was very protective of him.  And some people, I think, bothered and pushed him or whatever, because they knew that that was a way that they could get to me, because I would come and challenge them, even though I may have known I was going to take a beating, I would not let anybody mess with my younger brother.  And my sister could beat the both of us (laughs), you know, so.
Story_ID: 27092
Speaker 1: Your household, growing up is, your mother [Margaret Carey Forde] and father [Samuel James Evan Forde the Second], your sister [Bernadette] and your brother [Kevin] and yourself.  Did any of the grandparents or other relatives live with you?
Speaker 2: My grandmother--my father's mother lived in New York City [New York] during that time, so didn't get to see her very often.  And my mother's mother lived in Jacksonville [Florida], and we, at least, got to see her during the summer because we'd spend a couple weeks in Jacksonville.  As a matter of fact, during the time that my mom was away in college, my father [Samuel James Evan Forde the Second] was teaching during the daytime, working as a custodian at night to pay for her being schooled, which meant there was nobody to watch me.  I was very poor--I was poorly behaved in school; actually was kicked out or otherwise removed from kindergarten because I wanted my mom, and I didn't understand that she was away in school; I felt that she had deserted me.  And she didn't make it any better by coming home to visit and telling me she was going to stay.  And, actually, there was one Sunday when she was getting ready to drive back to Tallahassee [Florida] that my dad caught me about a block and a half away from home, five years old, running down the street after the car.  Somehow, she thought I was diverted while they were leaving, and--and I really missed my mom.  And, like I said, my story for much of my life was that my mom deserted me.  And so I had a bond with my dad, but I lived with my mom's aunt during the school year.
Speaker 1: In Tallahassee [Florida].
Speaker 2: No, here in Miami [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, and my story was that wherever it was my mom was going, she took my sister with her, and she didn't take me because I was a bad boy.  So I spent the next thirty-five years of my life trying to prove to my mom that I was a good boy through some classes I've taken, and all that, I get to see that now, and that she really didn't desert.  Because when came back from school, with a degree, and we had two professional salaries, in our neighborhood, the Forde family became like the Huxtables.  And there were Christmases when things were so lean I wouldn't even ask for anything.  And things really changed in our household after my mom became a teacher.
Story_ID: 27093
Speaker 1: Did you grow up in the same neighborhood the whole time here in Miami [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Until I went away to college, yes.
Speaker 1: Same house.
Speaker 2: Same house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, describe the house.  What kind of a house was it?
Speaker 2: The house was a one, two, three, four-bedroom, one-bath home; and with the lot, it was about seventy-five feet by a hundred feet, and a--as far as a black community is concerned, I would say it was middle class.  It's kind of hard to put a finger on that, but--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the community?
Speaker 2: Bunche Park.
Speaker 1: Bunche Park.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Named after Dr. Ralph Bunche
Speaker 1: Now was this--
Speaker 2: B-U-N-C-H-E.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Ralph Bunche who wrote the U.N. [United Nations] Charter.
Speaker 2: There you go.
Speaker 1: And was it a federally-funded housing development?  Because I know they--
Speaker 2: It was a development.  I don't know if it was federally funded, but I know that it was an all-black community.  And, you know, my dad was very involved in getting us streetlights, and sidewalks, and other municipal services.  And so I actually grew up with seeing my dad be a community activist, in addition to his role as a teacher.  And he was--actually, commissioner for [Boy] Scouts for Dade, Broward, and Monroe counties [Florida] back during the '60s [1960s], which was really unique for a black man at that time, over all of the Scouts in the area.  So, they're involved with youth, and community, and--something else about my dad is that, you know, I've never in my entire life met somebody who knew my father who didn't have something kind to say about him.  And after he died, there were countless people who came to me, "Your father helped me get my first job; your father wrote a letter to get my son out of prison; your father did this; he helped me; he gave the family twenty bucks when we didn't have money to eat."  It was a side of him that I'd, as a child growing up, I couldn't really see.
Story_ID: 27094
Speaker 1: But in addition to that, something that was really cool about my dad [Samuel James Evan Forde the Second], is he was Mr. Wizard.
Speaker 2: And now is this in reference to the popular television program (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Well, what I'm going to say is that, we, on a night when Venus was really close to the moon, for example, we'd get dozens of phone calls.  "Mr. Forde, is something bad about to happen?"  Oh, he'd say, well, actually, "They're many millions of miles apart, and forget it."  If there was an eclipse or something, "Mr. Forde, the moon turning to blood," and the so and so and so.  Yeah.  And, you know, one of the first things that happened to me in the neighborhood is, even though I wasn't doing well in school, I was a child who, when transistor radios came out and somebody's wouldn't be working, and they may bring it to me, and I'd just put the batteries in the right way, and they were like, "Hoo, little Mr. Wizard," you know.  And I had a telescope, microscope, and chemistry set.  You know, my dad told me he intentionally bought a chemistry set that had no capacity for explosions, but somehow I created explosions with those chemicals in there.  But I wasn't reading that well, so I might mix things improperly or--
Speaker 2: Was that a Gilbert Chemistry Set?
Speaker 1: I don't even know if it was a Gilbert back then.  Like I said, my--the first thing that I ever voluntarily read was a Superman Comic Book.  And up until the time I went away to college, I was still calling the word "invulnerable," "involuterable."  I remember, like, seeing it and sounding it out and go, "Oh, my goodness."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: "That's 'invulnerable.'"
Speaker 2: Like "Superman was invulnerable."  (laughs).
Speaker 1: Involuterable.  (laughs).
Speaker 2: Right.  So, okay.  So you had trouble reading, but you said your brother was a reading wiz.
Speaker 1: Oh, absolute wizard.
Speaker 2: Now is--and your father--now, did you see the program "Mr.--"Watch Mr. Wizard," on T.V.?
Speaker 1: Not at that time, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But people were calling him Mr. Wizard, they must have seen (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: I'm saying, or "Mr. Science."  I'm saying is role was like that of "Mr. Wizard," or like the community alchemist or something or--because he, well--but, you know, part of it was scientific knowledge or explaining the natural world; and I'm not sure if I ever met anybody who was more intelligent than my dad, in terms of raw I.Q.  Even when I became a professional, we had this little game where I'd tell him a word, and it could be very specialized, the marine geology and geophysics; and because he had Greek, Latin, and French, he could come up with the definition of the word that was 70 or 80 percent.  Amazing.  And another things is, when I ask him the origin of something, "Where do we get the word, 'mayonnaise' from?"  And he'd tell me, and I'd say, "Oh, boy, this is a crock."  And later, I'd look it up, and he was right all of the time.  I mean, literally, you know, I sold 'World Book Encyclopedias' one summer as a summer job while I was in Columbia University [New York, New York], and one of the things they told us is that, "A four-year-old child will ask two hundred and fifty to three hundred questions a day."  But what I didn't know is that, if the questions are being answered, if you said, "Shut up, Johnny," he'd stop eventually.  But I had a father who could answer the questions and was willing to answer them.  And so, as I began to have a natural curiosity about the world around me, there was somebody at home who could answer those questions.  And I didn't even really realize that what he did as a teacher was teach science.  I just knew he was a teacher.  Wasn't really interested.  All I knew is when I could hear his 1948 Buick, so this is in the mid-60s, right, coming from three or four blocks away, called it the 'Green Hornet,' "Oh, shoot, Daddy's coming home.  Why doesn't he go out and do some more community work?"  'Cause I knew I was probably going to get punished for something.
Speaker 2: A 1948 Buick.
Speaker 1: 1948, yep.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's an old car for those days.
Story_ID: 27095
Speaker 1: Now, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we attended church every Sunday, and my dad [Samuel James Evan Forde the Second] was a deacon or steward.  I'm not sure.  His name was on the cornerstone of our church that we went to, AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church.  And--
Speaker 1: That's Steward (Cromwell?).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yep.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Mount Herman.
Speaker 1: Mount Herman.  Okay.
Speaker 2: AME Church.  And I later became the youngest trustee ever elected at that church.  I think I was twenty-six or twenty-seven years old.
Speaker 1: We always ask this question:  What were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing up?  Okay.  I'd just like to go back to the spiritual side of things for a second, because I believe it's important.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: I heard that when my father was I the Army, his nickname was Rev, and that he was the superintendent of Sunday Schools while he was a student at FAMU [Florida A and M University, Tallahassee, Florida].  He was like the student superintendent, and so there was a very strong belief in God in our household, and I grew up praying and believing.  And there was this beautiful family bible that was there, but nobody ever seemed to read.  And--but, you know, I'd got the faith from my father, more so than my mom, and it was very important to me.  I mentioned earlier during--when our house burned up, and when it's appropriate, I'll tell you how that came to pass at that time, but the faith was very--it was definitely in me, and the thing that I said about my dad saying, he wanted to put the fear of Sam I me until I got the fear of God in me, and it happened one day where he told me--some of my friends, who I used to go out with all the time, and we'd go out on Friday evenings, one of them, one of the kids was driving his older brother's car, whatever, and we'd carouse around and do things that we shouldn't have been doing; and one day, there was a guy in the car when I got in there who I didn't know very well.  And so by the time we got to the corner, I asked to be let out of the car.  And I said, "I just remember my mom's [Margaret Carey Forde] got something she needs me to do."  But it was that young man who I didn't know very well who I was uncomfortable with.  And that night, he had them stop at a 7-Eleven and he robbed the 7-Eleven.  And they were all accessories.  They didn't get caught, but the word of that happened and got back to my--word of that having happened got to me, and my dad asked me, "So why didn't you go?"  And I said, "Well, you know, you know, you've always told me, you know these boys, you grew up with them, you know what they will do and won't do, most likely.  But a teenage boy is dangerous and so and so."  I said, "But I didn't know this young man very well.  And that's why I didn't go."  And he said, "So, what's the real reason you didn't go?"  I said, "Because I knew if anything happened, I might not survive the punishment that you give me."  He said, "Okay.  Well, I'm glad you didn't go.  That was exercising good judgment," he said, "because there was no immediate threat.  You didn't know anything bad was going to happen, but you heard that little voice, right?  And the little voice told you, 'Mm, back out of this.'"  And he said, "You know, so I'm really glad that you used wisdom.  That's something called wisdom, son, where you don't have to actually fall into the hole to know that there's a hole out there you could step into."  And he said, "I really look forward to the day when you'll do the right thing, not because you're afraid you're going to get caught or that I'm going to punish you, but because you know it's the right thing to do."  And those words really pierced my heart.  And it was during that conversation that the light came on for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How old were you at that point?
Speaker 2: I'm going to say I was probably about sixteen.
Story_ID: 27096
Speaker 1: We haven't gone through school step by step, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now you said as a little kid and--now, where did you start school?  Did you start in kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I started kindergarten, and I got kicked out of kindergarten or I dropped out of kindergarten somehow.  This was part of my acting out because my mom [Margaret Carey Forde] wasn't here is how I later went and looked back at it.  I cried every day and misbehaved until they'd take me out, put me time out or whatever they were doing back in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name--
Speaker 2: And but that actually stunted my academic growth.
Speaker 1: So what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: The kindergarten?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, gee.
Speaker 1: Is it the same as the elementary school?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was--one of the ones I think was Cooks Kindergarten or it may have been that's where my younger brother went, Cooks.  And, you know, there wasn't the standardization of the curricula during that time.  So a kindergarten student in one of these little black kindergartens could have been doing something totally than any other one, and, but, I don't know what they did with me, because I wasn't in school.  And then, I started first grade at Bunche Park Elementary [Bunche Park, Florida]. And--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Here's what I want to say.  That I may have--I know that I wound up, when I went to my mother's aunt's house, I then transferred to another school, still in the first grade, Rainbow Park Elementary; and I may have completed the first grade back at Bunche Park.  And so my sister says, having switched schools may have been what, especially without having the standardized curriculum, may have been part of what started me off on such a negative academic note.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you were telling me earlier, that things kind of turned around when busing started?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was much later.  But what's odd is when I was in the sixth grade the first, now, I recall having disagreements.  I'm not going to call it arguments with an adult.  Disagreements with teachers in elementary school over science questions.  And I remember there was a question, fourth grade, fifth grade, true or false; there are many plants in the desert.  And so I said, "True, there are many."  And the teacher marked it wrong.  I said, "Not many compared to a rain forest.  But, many?  What's many?"  You know.  And I said, "And they are made to be able to live in that climate and there's cactuses and--"  But there was an instance where my level of knowledge was higher than the teacher was teaching to.  And he said, "Everybody, all of the twenty-nine other students in class all marked that as false.  There are not many plants in the desert."
Speaker 1: Yeah.  All right.  But what a--
Speaker 2: You see the distinction?  And so maybe--
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) (uncomfortably?) worded question.   I mean, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, now we look at it that way.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I recall that's one that I particular remember.
Speaker 1: These stories seem to always happen in the sixth grade.  I've interviewed over a thousand people, and they always have a sixth-grade story where there's some kind of challenge with a teacher about something like this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, it was in the sixth grade that I finally made my first "A" in spelling of all things.  And I was in the school Spelling Bee.  And I remember the word that I missed was "worship."  And I could see it in my mind spelled the proper way, and I spelled the word "workshop" instead.  But I think somebody I knew, an old teacher or somebody, walked into the room.  But I was actually in the Spelling Bee.  That was the first "A" I made was in spelling, which is odd for a child not doing well and not reading well.
Speaker 1: That's right.  So, did you have favorite teachers or mentors in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I was definitely afraid of my first-grade teacher, the one that I remember, Ms. Jackson, who I was convinced was a gorilla in a woman's suit (laughs), for some crazy reason.  I don't know why I thought--she was one of the sweetest people I ever met.  And later I recognized that, but I was terrified of her (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is Ms. Jackson.  Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: As far as the other teachers were concerned, so she was memorable.  I could see faces of teachers whose--I remember Ms. Nelson; she was really a sweetheart.  She was at Rainbow Park Elementary, I think about the second grade.  So I was back over there again.  I'd switch back and forth because if I was staying with my aunt, I was going to Rainbow Park Elementary; and if I could stay at home, I was at Bunche Park Elementary.  So sometimes my younger uncle would be down here at the-- the one who did the magic, Uncle Spencer, who was my favorite uncle. Sorry, Uncle Jimmy.  But if he was visiting, then I could stay at home because he'd watch me.  He was a teenager.
Story_ID: 27097
Speaker 1: So around sixth grade, were you in the Boy Scouts [of America], too?  Your father [Samuel James Evan Forde the Second] was a--
Speaker 2: I was in the sixth grade--not in the sixth grade, I don't believe.  I--yeah, actually, I did something with the Cub Scouts.  But there was nothing about that that particularly stood out for me.  And I was in a position with the Cub Scouts, with a woman in our neighborhood who was a principal at a school up in Broward County [Florida], where she was the scout master, and I as the older boy who, there was a position called 'Webelos,' and I worked with her with the scouts for that.  And when I joined the Boy Scouts, it was really great, because it was life altering for me.  My father wanted me to have the best Scout Master in south Florida, and there was this gentleman who had become the first black sergeant on the Miami--City of Miami [Florida] Police Force, and he was a Troop Master.  And, unfortunately, that troop met three bus rides away from my house.  So I had to get on the bus, transfer to another bus, transfer to another bus, and then walk about five blocks to go to the meetings.  And that eventually began to wear on me.
Speaker 1: So why--well--
Speaker 2: Why didn't my dad just take me?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was busy, and I had to leave on that journey before he was done from school for the day and its responsibilities.
Speaker 1: No.  The question I was asking, why didn't--was he a Scout Master at the time himself?
Speaker 2: Was my father?  No.  He was the commissioner of the Scouts.
Speaker 1: Oh, the commissioner.  Okay.  So, but he never performed as a Scout Master?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did.  He was a Scout Master.  Yeah, and I used to be a little boy and go on some of the little camp fire stuff and overnight things, and we actually had a tent we used to set up in our backyard, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So scouting didn't work, it's too far away from home to consistently--
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: Scouting didn't work because it it's too far away from to be consistent.
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting.  The first thing I ever did in my childhood where I saw an impact of my working hard, was when I got in that Scout Troop, I admired--there was one young man who had become a-
Speaker 1: Eagle?
Speaker 2: --Eagle Scout.  And I remember how much I admired him.  And the other young men in the positions of leadership--and this was in Overtown [Miami, Florida].  And I heard that we were going to go to camp that summer.  A camp called Camp Sebring [Avon Park, Florida] in August.  And it was January, and you know, so I'm thinking, actually, the time etched into my mind was the bugler who played who 'Taps' at [President] John F. Kennedy's funeral and how he split that note.  And I recall asking my dad, you know, "What's that instrument?"  "That's a bugle."  And then I heard the bugler at the Boy Scout Troop, and that we were going to be going to camp.  And every morning, the bugler wakes everybody by playing 'Revelry.'  And I decided that I wanted to be the bugler.  So I said to my dad, "Please get me some bugling lessons."  And he said, "There's no such thing as bugling lessons, son.  If you want to learn to play bugle, you have to learn to play the trumpet."  And I said, "Well, please get me some trumpet lessons."  So, he put me into the band class at my middle school, which is junior high then, actually, it was still junior-senior.  And they had started in September and it was January for me.  So they were already three or four months ahead of me.  And I practiced so much that--first of all, they had to get a mute for my trumpet, and put me in the back room, and put pillows under the door so I wouldn't disturb anybody, because I practiced incessantly.  And by the end of the school year, I'd become the best trumpet player in my band class.  And so--oh, my dad was away.  That was that summer that he was at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland], and I think it must have been the summer band class, and there was a concert that we were doing, and my mom [Margaret Carey Forde] was there, but my dad was not there.  And I recall the band master saying to my mom, "So glad you could make it, Mrs. Forde.  Evan Forde is my star trumpet player."  And she was like, "What do you mean?" (laughs).  He said, "No, he's my best trumpet player.  He's my star trumpet player."  It was-- And so, I saw a connection between me practicing harder than the other boys and becoming the best.
Story_ID: 27098
Speaker 1: What was the name of your middle school?
Speaker 2: Well, when I went to middle school, the school went from seventh grade through twelfth grade.  So it was North Dade Junior-Senior High School [Bunche Park, Florida].
Speaker 1: North what?
Speaker 2: Dade.  D-A-D-E.
Speaker 1: Oh.  North Dade County.
Speaker 2: The name of the county.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was an all-black school.  And my father taught there.  And he taught senior high school science.  And by that time, he was no longer Athletic Director and Business Manager, but he had been at one point, Head of the Science Department, Athletic Director, Business Manager, and they quickly took the head of the department away from him, because he was doing those other jobs.  And one of the things that was interesting is he'd sometimes call me in when reps would come to sell the sports equipment, and one day he told me, "Watch this, son.  This guy wants to sell me some shoulder pads and helmets for the football team."  And my dad asked the guy, "So, do you really believe in this equipment?"  "Oh, yeah, it's gonna to protect your boys," so and so and so.  He said, "Really."  He said, "Well, try on the shoulder pads."  The guy put them on.  He said, "Try on that helmet you brought me."  My dad produced a baseball bat.  He said, "These pads are going to protect my boys from what type of force?"  He said, "Baseball bat-type force?"  And he said that more than half of the reps would just leave at that point.  But this one guy that day said, "Go ahead.  Take a whack."  And my dad didn't hit him too hard, but he's the one that he bought the equipment from.  Hit him across the shoulder pads, whack.  (laughs).  And the helmet, whack.  I was like, "Wow."  Said, "We got a deal."
Story_ID: 27099
Speaker 1: You mentioned the passing of [President] John F. Kennedy [JFK] (leading?) you playing the trumpet.  Did you have a--as you played the trumpet, did you have a role model as a trumpet player?  Were you exposed to jazz at all?
Speaker 2: No, see, because my true role model was that bugler who missed, took a misstep during the JFK, and really, it was still all about the bugle for me until the Boy Scout Troop went to Camp Sebring [Avon Park, Florida], and I hadn't surpassed our bugler, but I was good enough that the scout master said, "I'm going to have you two play together."  So I got up and we did 'Revelry' together every morning.  And, you know, so that was that immediate goal; something I was going for.  After that episode--after I got to play the bugle for my troop at camp--and something else very significant happened at that camp--so I played the bugle, and there was a big lake, a beautiful lake; so there was canoeing and fishing and all sorts of things.  Nobody in my troop passed this one test the first time.  And I was an accomplished swimmer by that time, but I learned to swim in the ocean, not in a pool.  It's very easy to float in fresh water--I'm sorry.  Salt water.  It's very easy to float in salt water.  But not so easy in fresh water, especially if you're lean.  And it was the floating test that had the people in my troop not passing.  And so--even me.  I could swim the distance, and as I mentioned, I could hold my breath for three and a half minutes.  By this time, it was well over--it was more like two and a half at that time.  And so I called my dad that night.  I got special permission from the scout master.  He said, "No.  The rule is you don't call home while you're in Boy Scout Camp."  He said--and I told him, "I am going to be the first boy in this troop to pass the swimming test, but I need to talk to my dad first," because my dad had taught me how to swim right out here.  And so I said--my dad said, "What do you mean you didn't pass the swimming test?"  And I said, I told him.  He said, "Well, you can't float on your back, but how many ways do you know how to float?"  I said, "Well, I know, actually I know two ways."  He says, "So what's the second way?"  He had taught me something called the prone float or the dead man's float.  He said, "You can hold your breath for a really long time.  Maybe you can do the prone float.  Fill your lungs with air.  That'll make you more buoyant so you'll stay on top of the water."  And he said, "You only have to come up for air about once every minute."  And he said, "Try it and see if that works."  And so I had the scout master lead me down there, and I went and I said, "I want to do the part of the swim test again for floating."  And, you know, I got in the water and I, you know, I swam out to the station where it was about my head.  And I did like a little flip and went into my--and he blew the whistle, "tweet-tweet."  "What are you doing, what are you doing?"  I said, "I'm floating."  Another guy said, "Okay.  Let's just watch."  And so I came up for air only about the first minute and a half.  I took a real deep breath, down for another minute or so; and after I'd done that three or four times, he blew the whistle and he said, "You passed."  So that night at the ceremony by the campfire, I got awarded--there was a candy called a Butternut.  That was the award of honor in my Boy Scout troop for being the first boy to pass the swim test, because I was the first black boy in the entire camp to have passed the swim test.  And then the next day, they had target practice or the rifle practice at the riflery range competition.  I'd never shot a real rifle before, but I was a sharpshooter with my BB gun, and I actually won first place at Camp Sebring with all of the kids for target shooting, and they tried to not give me the award because they said the boy who came in second place actually had a tighter grouping of the shots.  So I scored, like, a ninety-seven out of a hundred.  He had a ninety-three.  But they said, "Well, his shots were a group tighter together, and so his sight must have been off."  And my scout master, who was a police sergeant, said, "It's the responsibility of the shooter to test his weapon and set his sight prior to any competition or going into the field.  My boy won this competition."  And I got the blue ribbon.  So that night at the campfire, again, I got a Butternut, you know, which--so there's no candy allowed at the camp, but I was very proud.  I'm playing the bugle, when there's award recognition, the other--I showed a couple of the other boys how to do it, and eventually every boy there had passed the swim test.  And so I really began to feel important.
Story_ID: 27100
Speaker 1: You told a story, we came here about the bus ride over to the white school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's--that's--I was in the tenth grade when that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I began to make better grades in middle school I applied the lesson of the bugle, the trumpet.  I said, "I practiced harder, and I became the best.  I wonder if that would work with my studies a little bit."  So I began to study a little bit, and my grades, I became a "B", "C" student, instead of the "C" student or--and one of the interesting things that happened was that, the coach who was gonna later become my high school football coach, was my P.E. [Physical Education] coach in the seventh grade, and do you recall the Presidential Physical Fitness Awards?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: One of the test was the fifty-yard dash.  In the seventh grade, I ran the fifty-yard dash in 7.2 [seconds]; in the eighth grade I ran it in seven flat, 7.0 [seconds]; in the ninth grade I ran it in 5.5 [seconds], which tied the Dade County [Florida] ninth-grader record.  But I was already--I'd already decided I wanted to become a fast sprinter.  I first began to apply the working harder; ankle weights, running in the sand; a ten-speed, that little twenty-inch sprocket bicycle; looking at the films of the best sprinters in the world.  And that's a pretty dramatic jump in speed.  But my coach in the seventh grade, my P.E. coach was later to become my high school football coach, and I--one of the first classes in middle school I got an "A" in was in P.E.  And even though I wasn't that gifted, he said, "You don't quit.  You don't give up.  One more pull-up."  I could hear his voice.  "One more push-up, Forde."  We'd be doing things, "Don't you fall," you know.  And I wanted to learn how to do a somersault.  And, like, there was one kid who was just this gifted gymnast guy.  And he said, "You can learn how to do that. You have--arms need to be strong," or you need to do this and that, and he--so, he kind of set the seed telling me what I needed to do athletically, and then he kind of reaped the benefits later, because I became his player.  But he was known as the toughest, because this is a guy who had gone to Florida A and M University [Tallahassee, Florida] and got drafted by the Detroit Lions as an offensive guard when he only weighed one hundred sixty eight pounds.
Speaker 1: That's tough.
Speaker 2: Now, he didn't make the Lions' team, but he was a tough cookie.  Very tough.  You could hear his voice, like, sergeant--like a drill sergeant or something.  And there was something he saw in me.  He was--I got straight "As" in P.E., which changed my concept of myself athletically.  And he said, "No, no.  You just need to work on that.  You know, you're old enough.  You can start lifting a little weights now, you know.  You can wear ankle weights.  You can do this, you can do that.  Do more push-ups, do more sit-ups, do--."  You know.  And so he encouraged me.  I can hear his voice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: "Don't you fall.  One more.  One more.  You can do it."  You know.
Story_ID: 27101
Speaker 1: So high school, you were already at the same school, but you--when  you started--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  What happened, forced integration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Desegregation.  When I was in the eighth grade, it came about, and now this junior-senior high school was only going to the ninth grade.  My father [Samuel James Evan Forde the Second] was transferred to a school, a white school.  My sister [Bernadette] and the upperclassman who hadn't graduated yet, began to go to integrated schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: The senior high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Carol City High School [Miami Gardens, Florida].
Speaker 1: Carol City.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And at the time I went there, it was only 10 to 12 percent black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there--had it--had it been integrated before the year that you--?
Speaker 2: It was integrated by my sister's class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she was two years ahead of me.
Speaker 1: So had, so had the trouble been filtered out of the process by time--
Speaker 2: It's still not filtered out.  We had separate fortieth-year reunions two years ago.  Oh, yeah (laughs).
Speaker 1: So instead of--it wasn't completely successful experiment then?
Speaker 2: No.  And in many ways, it was an experiment designed to fail, if you ask me.  And the kids who I knew as the highest academic performers, waffled under the pressure, and the fear, and the intimidation, and--you know, so a couple of things happened to me in the tenth grade.  I was in the marching band at Carol City High School.  I got to play at the half-time of a Super Bowl; Super Bowl number two, Green Bay Packers, Oakland Raiders in the Orange Bowl.  And for--to let you know what my level of skill was with my trumpet, when I was in concert and in the tenth grade, what I played for my midterm exam was "Flight of the Bumblebee," on the trumpet.  That's quite a task.
Speaker 1: That is quite a task.  If anybody's  heard that, there's a separation of the notes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Toccata [virtuoso piece of music featuring fast-moving or lightly fingered sections] is very--is--if anybody can do that, is a good trumpet player.
Story_ID: 27102
Speaker 1: So I was in Carol City's Band [Carol City High School, Miami Gardens, Florida], and both of my parents were professional educators; and in March of 1968, the teachers in the state of Florida went on strike.  The Governor was Claude Kirk, and he refused to give in to the teachers' demand, which was a modest pay raise.  And so it was March the 6, March the 5, 1968, the teachers were on strike.  I went to bed just like I had every other night of my life, and I woke up in the middle of the night, and my house was on fire.  I was sleeping in the top bunk, and I was a very, very heavy sleeper.  And I woke up because I had a dream that I was in hell breathing in fire. And, I'd already breathed on so much smoke by that time that I was already impaired, and I jumped up, went running towards the fire which was in the living room area, and almost couldn't stop myself.  My arm was blistered, burned.  I got second-degree over most of my face; eyebrows, eyelashes, hair burned; and remembering that we'd done fire drills in our home, and attempting to get back to my bedroom to knock the window out with my Boy Scout axe.  I passed out in the hallway from smoke inhalation and exhaustion.  I had already breathed in a lot of smoke before I even woke up.  And--but my thought was, "I got to put this fire out."  And in the chaos, my mother [Margaret Carey Forde] is the one who first--who had (asthma?), first was awakened by the fire.  She woke my dad up, but she went running towards the living room where the fire was, which I eventually found out--I just found out year before last, that that fire that happened in 1968 was started by my sister, who turned on a space heater which ignited cotton brocade draperies in the living room.  All these years I wondered if was my slot car racing set's transformer, which was set up in that same area that had started the fire.  I didn't know, because we never talked about it.  I almost lost my life, my sister almost lost her life.  And so, there I was unconscious on the floor.  My--I got back to the bedroom trying--I tried to find my brother, couldn't find him, but the house was filled with smoke, it's dark.  He had run to my parents' room where my mom--when my dad caught up with my mom outside, said, "Calm down.  The fire is not near the bedrooms.  The kids know to go to their bedrooms.  They're going to expect to knock something out of the windows or get out through the windows."  And she, really out of it, knocked out the windows in the master bedroom.  But that's where my younger brother went; I was fifteen, he was ten, when he saw there was commotion and smoke, fire, head; he went to the parents' and he was unscathed, totally.  He just got out of the window.  But my sister was actually trapped in the restroom, not knowing what was going on.  She'd gotten up, turned on the heater, went to take a shower--or went to the restroom, and when she came out, the fire was right there at the door.  It melted the curlers of her hair.  It permanently changed the pitch of her voice.  Yeah, she was in the hospital about six weeks.  And for me, I was unconscious on the floor, and I felt somebody grab me by the collar and say, "Evan, wake up.  Evan, wake up."  But there was nobody there.  And I got up and crawled to my bedroom, and by that time, I was too weak to knock out my windows.  I couldn't find my axe or a bat or anything.  And the neighbors had knocked it out and pulled me to safety.  You know, I could hear my dad's voice, you know, calling for his children, you know, outside.  And it was really eerie.  And so I'm sitting there on the grass.  It looks really smoke, but I don't know that that's damage to my eyes; coughing my brains out.  My skin was too tender to touch, and I thought, "You know what, I almost died.  And a year from now, nobody would even remember that I lived, because I haven't done anything.  I haven't done anything for anybody else or I haven't done anything for myself."  And it was sitting right there that I decided that I was going to do something with my life, and I said, "It's going to start with me quitting the band and going out for the football team."
Story_ID: 27103
Speaker 1: A man that can--well, a teenager that can play "Flight of the Bumble Bee" had a career in music (laughs) too.  I mean, I'm just (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, what's interesting is I had to play that song after the fire [house fire in which Forde got burned], and the band director already knew that I was signed up for football, and he was very upset with me.  And I hadn't been able to practice because my lips were blistered; they'd been burnt.  And he insisted that I play-- play that song.  And he sat there very stoic while I played, and I could feel what I thought was spit coming down, but I couldn't stop in the middle of song to wipe it.  And when I played the last note, he handed me a napkin, and it was blood.  My lips were--.  But, see, I practiced.  I practiced the tonguing, and I practiced the--I could still probably do the keys from "Flight of the Bumble Bee" all these years later, because it was ingrained into my brain.  And he actually gave me an "A-plus" on the piece, and I got an "A," but he was very upset because he felt like he had invested in me, and I was leaving him for the football team.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, now why football, and--
Speaker 2: I mentioned that we played--our band played--so our band played--I always--I love football.  But I hadn't played JB or Pop Warner or Peewee League or Optimus, or anything, because I thought I needed experience to do it.  But I was already playing touch football in my neighborhood, and just based on my sheer speed as I was learning the game, imagine playing touch football on the streets, a narrow street, eleven guys on each side, and to be able to run back kickoffs all the way in touch football.  That's the type of stuff I was doing.  So--and I could catch.  I was practicing catching.  I could actually dribble a basketball-- football like a basketball.  I always had a ball spinning around; you know, you may have heard, like, some of the guys bouncing the basketball in the movie theater.  I was--always had a football in my hand, both hands.  And so I could really catch, and I could--like I said, I was very successful scoring touchdowns even in touch football. So I felt like, I'm big, I'm strong, I'm fast.  And so while I'm trying to decide what I'm going to do, I'm back at school, I've got bright yellow burn cream all over my face, and the dermatologist promised me nothing about how scarred my face would be or not.  And I recall going to school and kids teasing me.  And I remember there was--there was a young lady who I'm still friends with to this day, a very attractive young lady who is Caucasian, who said, "Leave him alone."  She got in front of the class one day.  "Anybody tease him again, you're going to have to deal with me."  And her name was Kathy, and she and I are still friends to this day.  And she later nominated to be yearbook king, which I won my junior year.  And so she said, "Now that you're the star, you owe me 'cause I made you."
Story_ID: 27104
Speaker 1: So--but, so I'm there with the burn cream that day and the football coach comes up to me and he says--he says, "You know, they tell me you're smart enough to be a college boy.  And I hear you're a hell of a trumpet player.  The only problem is, you have a sister who's two years older; she's up at Florida A and M University [Tallahassee, Florida], and I know a little bit about your parents' financial situation, especially after the fire," because our house had to be rebuilt.  It was concrete blocks, so the wall didn't burn, but the roof, all of the furnishings, and it took about nine months to rebuild the house.  He said, "Sam and Margaret [Forde's parents] aren't going to be able to afford to send you to school."  And that's when he said, "I don't--the only problem is, I don't know anybody who got a trumpet scholarship last year.  But if you come out for football," and he knew something about me, not just having had me in the seventh grade, but because I was in the band, I was in the physical education class called 'Varsity Sports;' so the varsity athletics and the band members were all in the class.  He said, "You're bigger, faster, stronger than a lot of my athletes.  Come out, let me teach you the game.  And if you do what I say with your intelligence and your raw athletic skills, I'll get you a scholarship.  But you're going to have to do what I tell you to do.  And you're going to have to not get discouraged if you're not playing," he said, "because there are a lot of kids here who have a lot more experience than you.  You're going to have to learn the game of football.  Let me teach you the game of football.  Don't worry about whether you're playing or not, or starting or not, or how many carries a game you're getting.  If you do what I say, I promise you I'll get you a scholarship for college."  And I got over a hundred scholarship offers by the time I graduated from high school.  About half of them were athletic and about were academic, because by this time I was a straight "A" student also.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you're a straight "A" student and you--
Speaker 1: Except for math.
Story_ID: 27105
Speaker 1: Before I leave football, what kind of season did you all have?  You have a good football season, or what kind of season did you have (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened is, the very first time I carried the ball in a scrimmage after looking like, the world's greatest natural running back--I played running back, half-back--the very first time I carried the ball in a scrimmage, I tore ligaments in my ankle.  And so I missed spring practice, which put me back even further.  And this coach took over as the co-- the head coach.  He was just an assistant coach then.  But I wanted-- I one of the reasons I wanted to become a running back was because the way our football team was, was heavily run-oriented.  We had to have a stable of running backs 'cause we were three yards and a cloud of dust.   And so that's what I was preparing myself for.  When he became head coach, he said in a press conference, "I think they made the ball that shape for a reason, so you could throw it."  And here was I was now one of several really excellent running backs on a team that was a throw-first team.  And it was interesting.  So it was his first year as a head coach.  I think we won six out of the ten games.  But the team did produce some, some offensive fireworks, and we actually had, like, a second team, all-county quarterback, and a second team, all-county wide receiver.  So.  But I was--I was in line to get in the game 'cause there were these--all these guys who had been starting for two or three years in front of me and had played every level--
Speaker 1: But you--
Speaker 2: --and I had--I actually had trouble learning the plays for football.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But did you achieve some kind of notoriety in football as a senior, in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, just that if I got to step on you, I was going to score.
Speaker 1: So did you score--
Speaker 2: I never got caught from behind, ever.
Speaker 1: Did you score a lot of touchdowns in your--?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, because I couldn't get in the game (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I scored--I scored--I scored a lot of touchdowns in practice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I was on the scout team.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I remember when the old coach had come back to watch that day, one day, I got a little screen pass and Stefan, the middle linebacker, cut to the outside, put a move on the quarterback, outran the safety and the quarterback from the other side, caught me about eighty yards down field. And that coach yelled at me, "Come here, Forde," grabbed me by the facemask.  "Who do you think you are, Superman?  You're supposed to follow your blocks.  So and so and so.  You know that."  And I said, "They were too slow."  And he said, "Yeah, but you do what I tell you.  You follow your boss.  You wait for them if you're--" you know, and I said, "I was about to get caught from behind."  And, you know, that, that, that practice was videoed, so you could see--I could just feel the flow catching up with me from behind, you know.  And so he said, "Get out of the game."  I said, "How was it for distance, coach?"  He said, "Go to the locker room, Forde."  But I was actually showing off for my old coach.  He saw that and was like, "Wow."
Story_ID: 27106
Speaker 1: So one of the reasons I got so many scholarship offers is not because of my performance on the football during games, but I was already running a 9.6 [second] hundred-yard dash when I was a senior in high school, which was about as fast as any high school runner in America was running a hundred [yard dash].  And I already weighed one hundred and eighty-five pounds or so.  So most of those guys were a little lighter than me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that with good SAT [Scholastic Assessment Test] scores and good grades, a lot of schools, a lot of football factories, that--whose names I could mention, were very interested in me and offered me scholarships.  And one very famous coach, whose name I won't mention at a very famous school for football, told me that if I came to his school, that I'd start by the time I was a sophomore, and by my senior year, I'd be the first black all-American from that school.  So I recall one school in particular offered me a track scholarship, and my dad said, "Such and such university, there're no black kids at that school.  They want you on the track team to do what?  Be the javelin catcher?"  (laughs).
Speaker 2: (unclear).
Speaker 1: And I kinda got his point. You know, like, yeah.  So in 1970, there were a lot of very prominent schools in America that didn't have many black students.
Speaker 2: Right.  So.  Let me go back to science here.
Speaker 1: Science.
Speaker 2: And you are an anomaly in the sense that you do not like math or math doesn't like you.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I would say it wasn't that I didn't like math.  Math didn't like me.  It was--what I found out in college and graduate school was that, calculus was very difficult for me.  But as calculus is applied in geophysics, it was very easy for me.  So there is something--there's a disconnect between what I call when I look at formula with the derivations and all of the equations, I call it flute music; there is a disconnect with me and the flute music and seeing how it is actually gonna be used to do my precious scientific research.  And earlier, it was just that I had so far to come academically that in mathematics every mathematical skill you learn is based on your having mastered--
Speaker 2: The previous skill.
Speaker 1: --the previous one.  And I just hadn't gone that far.  I had Algebra II as a senior in high school.  And there was also some indication, and I've never said this before publicly, that my grades, my performance in the class, were actually better than the teacher was reporting.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So that would account for you having a higher SAT [Scholastic Assessment Test] test--I mean scores than grades.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And I actually saw his grade book when he wasn't there one day, which, if we'd be discovered--there were several of us--and we didn't have Xerox machines back then and all that sort of thing, but those grades looked like they averaged out to be about a "B-plus" to me, and he gave me a "D" that marking period.  And, unfortunately, I later heard from somebody else that he asked a lot of questions about whether I was dating any of the white girls at school or not, which I haven't to not be, but he may have been trying to punish me for something that he thought wasn't right.  So, and--but when the assistant principal for--there's one--and the Dade County [Florida] System is set up, there was usually an assistant principal for curricula, and the other assistant principal was usually the one who handled disciplinary matters.  Well, that assistant principal was a Vassar [College, Poughkeepsie, New York] graduate.  And, first of all, when the scouts from Columbia University [New York, New York] came to see me, and I told my counselor, she said, "You'll never get into Columbia University.  Maybe if you played basketball instead of football, I could get you a scholarship someplace."  And so when I reported that to the assistant principal for curriculum, she basically, somehow, disciplined my counselor and said, "I'll take over from here on out."  And she also straightened out that math teacher.  I don't know what she did, how she did it, 'cause I told her what my concerns were.  And she said, "I will make sure that your application, your paperwork, I will be in touch with each of your teachers and make sure there's no bumps in the road between you and your Ivy League education, because I absolutely think that you're Ivy League material."
Story_ID: 27107
Speaker 1: I guess this is important to your later career--you took a course in high school called Environmental Oceanography.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My senior year, I had already had biology, physics and chemistry.  And so I was able to take an elective course for science.  And one of the football coaches, he was the offense line coach, was an avid scuba diver.  And he didn't start out as the original coach--I'm sorry--the original teacher for that class, but after the first marking period, he took over the class, and it was really a tremendous class.  Now, at this time, I was already interested in the ocean because I swam, I swam avidly.  I loved to swim.  I love the water.  I remember my dad showing me a map of Florida when I was a little boy.  He said, "Everything that's blue is water, everything green is land."  And then we'd, you know, come across a bridge like the one leading here to this island, I'd see people waterskiing and doing things in the water.  And I'd say, "I want to do that."  He said, "You're going to have to learn how to swim really well if you want to be able to participate in those things."  And that was part of my motivation for learning to swim.  And, and so Coach Cappas (ph.), who taught that class, would bring in whatever specimens he had caught from scuba diving that weekend.  Then we had a couple of aquaria in the classroom.  And I was already watching the 'Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau' on television.  Actually, my nickname for myself is Black Cousteau, by the way, but that's a totally different subject.
Speaker 1: That's for yourself.  Nobody would--you named yourself that.
Speaker 2: That's what I call myself now.  I just--the last couple of years I began to call myself that.  But I was watching the 'Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau,' I'm in this Environmental Oceanography class, and the scout from Columbia University [New York, New York] comes, and I happen to be in the oceanography class when he comes to get me and three of my teammates to take us to the coach's office to watch some film, to discuss things.  And when he asked me what do I want to major in--now, I already knew I wanted to be a scientist.  As a matter of fact, there had been an article in the local paper where I was the teen of the week.  And it said, the last line of it said something like, "When he becomes adult, Forde either wants to be a professional player or an astronomer."  And so I knew science was somewhere in my future or I was hoping it was.  Well, I knew it was in my future.  I was hoping the athletics--I wanted to be playing football on Sunday afternoons.  But so those were my aspirations, and they asked.  So I happened to be in that class, and so I said, when the scout asked me, "What would you like to major in?"  I said, "Columbia University, isn't that where they had all those anti-Vietnam riots?"  And he said, "Yes."  I said, "Well, do they have any courses in oceanography at Columbia?"  He said, "I don't know."  And he asked the coach if he could use the phone, and he called collect, and he said, "As it turns out, Columbia has one of the best oceanography schools in the world."  And I said, "Okay."  So I was impressed that he got it--you know, got the answer so quickly and wouldn't let me move from that spot at that moment.  And, as I said, I also was accepted at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and I found out that Columbia did have one of the best oceanography schools in the world.
Story_ID: 27108
Speaker 1: You graduated from high school in 1970?
Speaker 2: In 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you go off to Columbia [New York, New York], I guess, that fall.  Now, did you work over the summer?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I worked at a restaurant called Lum's where my job title was stove manager, which means I cooked the food.  But most of those were pre-packaged.  And I worked up to seventy hours per week at a dollar seventy-seven per hour, because I had a target of making seven hundred dollars to put towards my college education.  That was going to be my share of that--after my scholarships had paid everything, and I didn't want my parents to have to pay anything.  So I was successful in that they made contributions to my life, and education, and plane tickets, and all that sort of thing.  But that year, I got the largest scholarship at Columbia [University, New York, New York] had ever given to any student, because part of the way they calculate it, financial need was based on income tax returns and the year our house had burned up; you can imagine what that loss looked like on the income tax returns.  So--and my family--it took my family many years to recover economically from that, although we had great insurance, with Allstate [Insurance], we really were in good hands; but still, that was a tremendous loss.  Everything--everything that I owned except my trumpet was either burned or smelled so much like smoke that it was not useable.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, Columbia took that in to account, then I got a really tremendous scholarship.
Story_ID: 27109
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Columbia [University, New York, New York], in the fall of 1970.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --So your major was oceanography from the very beginning or ocean geo-(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And basically, I started out as a biology major.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I wanted to be a marine biologist.  I thought I'd come to work every day and I'd have my briefcase in one hand and my scuba gear in the other, and at lunchtime I'd be feeding Flipper, after watching so many episodes of Jacques Cousteau and the lessons from my science teacher in high school.  And the reality was that, there were few jobs in marine biology at that time, because there had been a boom in science that had sort of begun with [President] John Kennedy challenging our nation to go to the moon, and oceanography, marine biology in particular, was one of those emerging fields.  And so I came--the summer after my junior year, I came out here to this island, and I went to the NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] Laboratory [Miami, Florida] across the street, which is a fisheries biology laboratory.  It's a NOAA Laboratory also.  And they said, "We have a job freeze.  We have no jobs.  See that guy over there washing beakers and test tubes?  He's got a Ph.D. in marine biology."  So I'd already taken a geology course, and they said, "Well, you can try across the street, maybe they have something."  And I came across the street to this building, and the director of the laboratory was a marine geologist, avid scuba diver and that sort of thing, and they had a Marine Geology and Geophysics Division and he only had forty-five people in it; the largest, single laboratory here.  And were also under the hiring freeze and had no jobs.  But when he saw Columbia University on my resume and the partial transcript that I had up to that point, he called the director of the Marine Geology Lab [Miami, Florida] here and, who supposedly said, "If he's making this type of grades at Columbia, then he must be a really bright guy, and we ought to find a position for him."  And so they finagled something, and what I was under the first summer was something called WAE, when actually employed.  So I didn't have a full-time job, I didn't have a part-time job.  I was nowhere on the radar screen; like almost like a temporary employee, but that's how I got my foot in the door, because the other job I was doing that summer was working as a cataloger at the library at FIU.  So--
Speaker 1: FIU, that's--
Speaker 2: Florida International University [Miami, Florida].  They hadn't even opened yet.  And I am sure there are many books, so the books would come in, and I'd have to read the introduction and assign that a Dewey Decimal number and, you know, get the stamp printed, type and print it, put it on the shelf.  I'm sure there're books that are still lost because I misshelved them, miscataloged it, even back in 1973.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know. You may have done a perfect job. You still--
Speaker 2: I may have.
Story_ID: 27110
Speaker 1: Were there any professors or people at Columbia [University, New York, New York] that you would consider like mentors at this stage?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Everybody was a mentor.  And--but there were some who were more significant in my life than others.  The first very harsh lesson I learned was that, even though when I took the pre-Spanish exam prior to signing up for Spanish class at Columbia as a freshman, I placed in the third semester, but I started in first semester.  But I signed up for a seven a.m. class, so here I am away from school, playing football, couldn't make it to class.  I had an A-plus average, but hadn't attended the class enough times to actually pass the course.  So I went to the dean, pled my case, and he said, "Sorry.  It's the rule."  So that was a harsh lesson.  And I learned right then, have to follow the rules.  But the freshman composition teacher--so I thought, because I had been taking all these honors courses, I thought my English and English Grammar were good. I'd done well on the SAT on the verbal part.  But when he saw my first composition, and he graded it, and he said, "Wait, before class is over, Evan Fordee, Forday, could you come up after class.  I need to speak to you."  So everybody else is leaving class and I go up.  And he's got my paper, and I could see all the red marks on it.  And he says, very slowly, "Mr. Forday, do you speak English as a second language?"  And I said back very slowly, "I am trying very hard to learn English well."  He said, "I'll help you."  (laughs).  And so I knew I had a ways to go.  And so that first semester, it was very tough on me academically.  I failed Spanish, didn't do well in freshman composition, and that's where later my father [Samuel James Evan Forde the Second] said, that I became an oceanographer because that first semester so many of my grades were below sea level.
Speaker 1: I see.  I see.
Speaker 2: But I was not about to quit or give up.  And I said, "I just need to crank it up a notch."  And my concern was, "Suppose I do everything I know to do, suppose I try my hardest, and I'm still not good enough?"  And in my mind came that answer, the answer to my own question.  I heard two answers:  one thing was, "At least you'll know that you've done all you can".  But the second verse, voice I heard said, "There's nothing you can't do if you really put your mind to it and you're willing to try hard enough.  You can do it."  And so I really believe that, at no point after that first semester, that I think I was going to actually flunk out of school and recalled I had an academic scholarship.  So that was a danger.  I was on probation.
Story_ID: 27111
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that kind of stepped up to the help you or give you any--or like role models for you?
Speaker 2: Not at that point.  It was really just up to me, because the way the freshman year at Columbia was, the second semester was almost like a continuation of the first semester.  So what there was for me to do was to study harder, find a way to be successful academically, and then convince the teacher who saw me as "D" or "C" student, that I was really a "B" or "A" student; which sometimes, once that notion gets set--and speaking of that, actually there was-- the Spanish teacher.  When I took Spanish again second semester, it was not the same Spanish teacher, it was another Spanish teacher, who watched me participate in class and had a certain impression of who I was as a student.  So when we took the first quiz in her test, I scored a "D" on it.  And she called me up after class and she said, "Mr. Forde, why didn't you tell me that you weren't feeling well or were sick or there's something going on with you, because I have this test with a "D" on it, but I know that's not who you are," and she ripped it up.  "I'm going to give you a makeup next--exam next week.  You're an "A" student.  I know you are."  And she believed in who I was not yet manifesting myself to be, but she believed that I was an "A" student.  And I sort of had a little crush on her on top of that, and I was not going to let her down.  I became an "A" student in Spanish.  And within a year I was reading novels in Spanish, writing the essays in Spanish; and ten years after I got my bachelor's degree, I was in New York City [New York], I saw that Spanish teacher at a restaurant, and we had a conversation totally in Spanish for twenty minutes.  And she said, "Your Spanish is still impeccable."  But she believed in me, and I didn't want to let her down.  So that's kind of a theme in my life, didn't want to let my football coaches down; didn't want to let my father down, eventually; and didn't want to let my family down, you know.  That's something that really means something for me, because I found out about myself that I am not a quitter.  I am tough, tenacious, I refuse to give up.  But I'll do even more for the people I love and care about, people who are depending on me or who are believing in me, than I will for myself.
Speaker 1: Now, excelling in Spanish has got to have residual effects here in Miami [Florida].
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: To be able to speak fluent Spanish.

Speaker 1: In terms of oceanography, I think your degree was in geology (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, my bachelor's was in geology, and I met the most extraordinary professor--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Geology 101, and he said that first day, "When I'm done with you, you will never look at the physical world the same way."  And they called geology "rocks for jocks."  But I was--he made it very interesting.  And then to top it off, while I was in his class, he got some of the samples from--some of the first moon rocks to look at.  He had written a few textbooks.  His name was John Sanders.  And the textbook we used in class was Longwell, Flint, and Sanders, and he was one of the authors of it.  And he was an extraordinary person, and he found me somewhat fascinating, he said, you know, because I was an athlete at Columbia [University, New York, New York], and he said, I--he said, "I just really enjoy having you in my classes, and you really get this stuff, don't you?"  I said, "Yeah. Well," I said, "it's you, you're the professor, the way you teach it, it's unforgettable, unimaginable, you know."  You know, we'd go on the field trips, and he explained things, and I just found it really fascinating.  And that's substantial, because when I graduated from Columbia, and I was on the dean's list by the time I graduated, even though that senior year I took six science courses because I'd switch from biology to geology, and I had a lot of courses to make up, and so did not play football my senior year so that I could graduate.  And I did not know what would happen to my scholarship if I took longer than the four years and that sort of thing.  But I had several other courses with Dr. Sanders and some of the individuals who were the fathers of an emerging science called marine geology and geophysics.  So literally, I began to have as some of my professors the people who were proving to the world that the continents had once been together, that there was such a thing as seafloor spreading, plate tectonics were real; and I had a number of these individuals as professors.
Story_ID: 27113
Speaker 1: And so I was already working at NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration].  I had applied for a fellowship to go to graduate school, and me and about five thousand other students, for NOAA to pay for a year of graduate school.  And so when I got my degree, my bachelor's from Columbia [University, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: This is 1974, right?
Speaker 1: 1974.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yep.  May of 1974.  And I didn't apply to Columbia because I never thought I'd get in for graduate school.  And yet, I found myself not being accepted at many schools that I would later began to look at as second rate, third rate compared to Columbia in the fields of oceanography and marine geology and geophysics.  And I really didn't understand, and I'd just had a revelation, as a matter of fact.  I applied to go to the United States Naval Academy [Annapolis, Maryland] and was not accepted, and yet I got into Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and Columbia.  And only recently did somebody, who I discuss such matters with, say, "Did it ever occur to you that they had already fulfilled their quota of black midshipman for that year, and you--."  And I said, "I just thought, maybe it was my math.  Just wasn't--."  "Yeah, but if your math was good enough to get into three Ivy League schools, I think your math was good enough to go to the Naval Academy," was what the gentleman said.  But I never--it never crossed my mind, and maybe that's what happened to my applications for graduate school.  So I was going to go to the only graduate school that accepted me.  And Dr. John Sanders called me in the summer of 1974, and he said, "I was going through my records here, and I wanted to, you know, I was on a field trip at the end of the school year.  I never got to talk to you.  What are you doing about graduate school?"  And I told him where I was going.  And there was a long pause on the other end of the phone.  And so I was down here in Miami [Florida], he was in New York City [New York].  And he said, "Let me ask you a question.  Why did you bother to come to a first-rate school to get your undergraduate education if you're going to go to what I consider is a third-rate school for your advanced degrees?"  I said, "Well, I didn't start off well as an undergraduate, and this is the only school I got into."  He said, "Well, where else did you apply?"  And I told him the other schools.  He said, "Any of those schools should have been glad to have had you as a student."  He said, "You didn't apply at Columbia?"  I said, "Dr. Sanders, you know, with all due respect to your question, you know, had you ever seen my transcript that freshman year and all that?"  He said, "Yeah, but by the end of your undergraduate education, you were doing exceptionally well.  I know.  You never made anything lower than an "A" in any of the courses I taught you.  And other people at Lamont [Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University] have talked about you and how bright you are and all that."  He said, "Why didn't you apply to Columbia?"  I said, "I never thought I'd get in."  He said, "What are you saying?"  I said--He said, "Would you have come to Columbia if you'd gotten in?"  I said, "Are you kidding me?  Yes."  He says, "So, let me get this straight.  You didn't even apply here, but if you wan--, were accepted to Columbia, you would come here?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "Every year, I am allowed, as the head of the department, to admit one student based solely on my certifying them as capable of completing the degree, and I selected nobody this year.  If you want to come to Columbia but yet--if you want to come to Columbia, congratulations.  You're accepted."  I said, "The application processes ended in April and--."  He said, "You want to come here or not?"  I said, "Yes."  He said, "You're in."  He said, "You'll be getting a call from the dean's office.  Stay at this number.  Within the hour, you'll be getting a call from the dean's office certifying--."  I said, "What about my transcripts?"  He said, "We got your transcripts."  He said, "We know who you are.  You don't have to fill out an application.  You don't have to do anything.  You're in.  Congratulations."
Story_ID: 27114
Speaker 1: So, Dr. [John] Sanders mostly assuredly had a significant on my education.  Not only that, but when I went to graduate school, he became my advisor.  And it was a significant event for a number of reasons.  First of all, I knew that he believed in me.  But when I took my qualifying exam, which at Columbia [University, New York, New York], the way it works, is the qualifying exam allowed you to get the Master's degree, but qualified you to go on for the Ph.D.  And there was a teacher in graduate school who was the only teacher who I ever earned a "B" in his class, he insisted that I go on a field trip in the snow when I had strep throat and a hundred and four degree fever, and told me that I'd fail his course if I didn't go on the field trip that weekend.  And so the qualifying exam consisted of ten questions, and you had to answer seven of them.  They were in different areas: paleontology, marine geology, geophysics, geochemistry, oceanography, marine biology; that sort of thing.  And I knew who was going to grade the marine geology and geophysics question.  It was that professor I had.  And so I found seven other questions to answer on the qualifying exam, which generally speaking, you do answer the question in the field you're going to get your advanced degree in, but I didn't want any problems out of him.  And I actually--what I--I took a paleontology question instead, 'cause the others, they were--there was a certain group that you pretty much knew "I'm going to do this one, I'm going to do that one," and that sort of thing.  And so when the scores came back, this professor went to the--and I passed the qualifying exam--he went to the head of the department at Lamont [Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University] and said that I should not be allowed to get my degree because I had not answered the marine geology and geophysics question, which is the area that I was getting my degree in.  And it was not written anywhere in the rules that I got along with the tests.  He said, "Yeah, but it's customary and everybody knows."  So there was this brouhaha at the school.  And the head of the department didn't know me from Adam, and was--had gotten him to agree that if I would answer that question for him, you know, a separate setting and all that, successfully, that he'd allow me to pass the exam.
Story_ID: 27115
Speaker 1: Now, my advisor, Dr. Sanders, was on a sabbatical, sabbatical, excuse me, in Europe, and he was in, I believe he was in Great Britain [United Kingdom] at the time.  He was working his way back westward.  And he called the school and he asked how I was doing, and he heard about the issue with my qualifying exam.  And apparently, he had some very unkind things to say, but in addition to that, was in the United States of America in about fifty hours.  And when he came out of the head of the department's office, and the dean's office, they were congratulating me for being so versatile that I could answer questions outside of my area of expertise.  And I don't know what, but he apparently really let them have it.  But they went from "Oh, we don't know, maybe this and that because the guy--."  And it's funny how fate is because that same individual who had been the professor, whose question I didn't want to answer, applied to be the Dean at the University of Miami's Oceanography School [Miami, Florida].  About ten years later, I was already working here.  He saw me talking to people on the staff over there and asked me if I would put in a word for him.  I said, "I certainly will." (laughs).  'Cause he was one of three finalists for the position.
Speaker 2: Did he--
Speaker 1: He didn't get it.  So.
Speaker 2: We can infer that maybe (laughs)--.
Speaker 1: (laughs).
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay.  So--
Speaker 1: But Dr. Sanders, in terms of being a person who changed the course of my academic career, really did, and was there for me when--and I--you know, my father trained me to never look at my race as an excuse for my lack of credentials or performance.  And so it never ever occurred to me that anything negative that ever happened to me academically in the world anywhere, was based on anything other than my just not being up to the task or whatever.  But I was the first person of color to ever earn a Master's degree in a geoscience from Columbia University.  And, actually, there were two people on campus during the same time I did--that I was there who I recognize.  One was Eric Holder, who I recognized him; and the other one is David Patterson, who was the governor of New York for a while there, acting governor.  But Eric Holder was there from '69 [1969] to '75 [1975], and I was on campus from '70 [1970] through '76 [1976].  So anyway, I kept looking at Eric Holder on the news saying, "Where do I know this guy from?"  But, so anyway.
Story_ID: 27116
Speaker 1: I heard that your mother was kind of disappointed that you didn't become a doctor.
Speaker 2: Margaret Forde.  My dear mother, who, I'd just like to share with you that there is nothing in this world that my mother had or could somehow get her hands on that she couldn't get for me, if I needed it.  However, my mother was very much a person, a very--very much a social butterfly and thought, "Oceanography?  What's that?  Why can't you be a doctor of a lawyer?"  Until, I think, I was home for a summer already working for NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], we were at a Christmastime party, and after an hour in the party, the doctors and lawyers were crowded around me wanting to hear about my work as an oceanographer, because I was already going to sea for NOAA and doing research.  And she said, "Oh, they seem to know what that is."  And I always felt like she was a little bit disappointed still, "Why can't you be a doctor or lawyer?"
Story_ID: 27117
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your thesis, your master's thesis, and what aspect of ocean science were you delving into, and what, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the interesting things about working in this laboratory where the courses I took in graduate school and the emerging field of marine geology and geophysics, allowed me to go beyond what many of the scientists who are already working here had, because they hadn't had some of the coursework that I have had, and one of the very first thing that I ever did for NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] was make maps of the sea floor.  You know, the Titanic sank because it hit an iceberg.  So it was dark, it was night, it was foggy, and the lookouts couldn't see it until it was too late.  So, a very bright scientist thought, "We can use pulses of sound out in front of the ship, 'ping, ping, ping.'  If there's an object really close, the sound will come back fast, and we'll know there is an object there like an iceberg, we can turn the ship."  The device got pointed down into the water and began to measure the depth to the ocean floor, quite by mistake.  And that device is called an echo sounder.  So I used traces of echo sounders, knowing the depth, and to make contour maps of the sea floor.
Speaker 1: Now, how is a echo sounder different from sonar?
Speaker 2: Sonar is basically used to detect objects in the water; whereas, an echo sounder's sole purpose was to detect the depth of the ocean floor.  So you know what the sound of--the speed of sound is in seawater; you measure the time it takes for the pulse to go down and back up, you divide it in half and you have the depth.  And so, they eventually came devices that could trace the depth and then digital displays.  And so what I would do is digitize, because if we did have some, what we'd have to call primitive computers here back during the '70s [1970s], and I take these large pieces of paper with the numbers printed out by this computer printer on there, and they were the depths, and I'd actually sort of connect the dots and draw the contours by hand.  I'd work on maps that were sometimes, sometimes forty square feet.  So I'd actually kneepads and get down and do the traces.  And when I do the final ink copy, they'd hang it up on a wall, they'd photograph it, and reduce it down to page size.  So I became an expert at that, and it was a basic skill I'd learn in the classes with Dr. [John] Sanders in Geology 101, contouring.  And I really became one of the best, certainly one of the best contourers here in the laboratory, and one of the best in all of NOAA.  So I would make maps of the sea floor, and I was--I'd made a map of the ocean floor between Cape May in Jersey, off the coast of Baltimore [Maryland], Cape May, out there.  And based on my study of geology and knowing what the shapes were, I did my thesis on the fact that, on that bathymetric map, there were areas that showed submarine canyons.  There were canyons underwater larger than the Grand Canyon.  I eventually became one of the world's experts on those.  But also I noticed areas where there had been underwater landslides.  And I learned this in the classes with Dr. Sanders.  This is what it would look like on a bathymetric map, a map of the ocean floor with contour lines.  And that was what my thesis was on.
Story_ID: 27118
Speaker 1: And, eventually, I proved that those underwater landslides had occurred, and that was an area where the United States Department of the Interior had leased about $13 billion worth of drill sites to oil and gas companies, which $13 billion worth in 1976 was a lot of money.  And I showed that that area was unstable, that there would be under--there had been underwater landslides, that the slope was too steep, that we could--we could have loss of life and it could be an environmental hazard.  And eventually using geophysical techniques on one of the research cruises I went on, I was able to prove that with geophysical data.  So the, the Department of Interior took all of those drilling sites off the table, and they're still not drilling over there for oil or gas.  So, probably, the most consequential scientific discovery I'd ever made was that one.  However, and unfortunately, the scientists who were supervising me at the time, took credit for my discovery.  And I should have been--I gave him my notes, over fifty pages of written notes, my estimates of how big the underwater landslides were; it was my idea.  I actually operated the ship for the three days while we were doing the geophysical survey.  And while I was completing my last semester at Columbia [University, New York, New York], they sent the paper to be published without my name on it, except in acknowledgments.  I was acknowledged twice in that paper.  And I was told I would be an author on that paper.  So they--the most--and it was the most significant discovery that this laboratory had made up to that point.  It was a new lab, only six or eight years old.  And there were people from the press corps, people from the Navy, people from the oil companies wanting to talk to us and try to get us to change our minds about our findings and all that sort of thing, because they wanted to be able to drill.  And I had to sit in the background.  That paper resulted in thirteen publications for my supervisor at the time and her coauthors ,that I didn't get my name on any of them; I got none of the credit for.  And still to this day, I've received no formal credit for having done that work, but the laboratory director here now, when he heard about it, gave me a special certificate recognizing that.  But it's still, it's not in the literature that that was my discovery.
Story_ID: 27119
Speaker 1: What does a person in academics can do about such a thing?  I mean, is it--either they or--what could you--I mean, what were you thinking at the time that--?
Speaker 2: Okay.  So what I did was, I--when I found out that the paper was being published without my name on it, because my supervisor was away for the summer, and I was opening her mail.  I'm trying not--the person went to a very, very high position in another government agency by the way, after that, but hadn't published a paper in several years, and knew nothing about the sediments and the bathymetry and the geophysical methods I was using.  And it was actually her cruise that I was one, and one of her instruments didn't work, and that's when she came to me.  She said, "You're very familiar with this area.  What would you do if you had the ship for three days?"  And I said, "Well, I suspect there's these underwater landslides that we could use seismic reflection profiling, and we can use the 3.5 kilohertz profiler, and the R-beam echo sounder.  We could do the survey."  And she said, "I d-- How would the survey lines go, I don't know."  So I--because I made the map, the underwater map, right, the map of the bottom.  From memory I sketched it out.  And I said, "This ship will go this way, this way, this way, this way."  And I was on watch that night when we got the evidence we needed that the underwater landslides had actually taken place.  And I called my mentor who is no longer working here, the guy who had originally hired me that summer, who said, "With these grades, we need to find a position for him," and he was very excited, but he was no longer my lab director, and told him about it.  And so I called him and asked him what I should do when I found out that the paper was being published without my name.  And he said, "Go to the director, your division director and tell him."  And he said, "But before you do that, Xerox the paper and highlight everything in yellow that's directly attributable to you."  It was three-quarters of the paper.  Even the estimates I'd made of the size of the underwater landslide.  I said it was twenty-eight cubic kilometers.  Her final estimate was thirty cubic kilometers.  You know, it was very close.  These are calculations I'd done on the back of an envelope basically, you know, and she had her computer programmers, you know calculate that stuff.  And so the director, 'cause she still wasn't here, he said, "You did the right thing to come to me, and don't you say a word about this to anybody."  Now, I had already said something to my mentor, who's no longer here, and he said, "I will handle this.  Don't confront her, don't say anything."  And so I was being obedient.  And when I saw that the paper was--appeared on the list of approved for publication, I called my mentor back and I said, "What do I do?"  He said, "It is not too late to get your name on that paper."  He said, "It's awful suspicious, why would anybody be acknowledged twice in the same acknowledgments?  That's just a line or two, you know.  That's suspicious to begin with."  And he called the Lab Director here, and I don't know what that conversation went like, but then I got called in by the Lab Director who said, "Where do you get off airing dirty laundry for this laboratory outside?"  And I said, "I'm not airing dirty laundry.  He hired me.  He's my profession mentor," and all that.  "If you," he told me, "If I hear you breathe a word of this to another living soul, I will fire your ass.  Do you understand me?  Have I made myself clear?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  "Not another word to anybody."  And so I was threatened with being fired if I cried rape, or help, or I've being taken advantage of here.  And it happens occasionally in our profession.  And I understand that it happened to the person who was supervising me then; that when she was in graduate school, something similar had happened to her.  So she should have known better in how traumatic it could be.  But, like I said, her career continued to rise, and she became the deputy director of a government agency.
Speaker 1: Now, so how--
Speaker 2: By the way, it would be pretty easy to find out who it is, so I don't--I mean somebody who would know, you know, but I'm not trying to, you know.  So I was never able to discuss it with her.  And she left here in, like, a few years, and-
Story_ID: 27120
Speaker 1: But the next paper I published, I was the solo author.  I locked my office door at night, and the same Lab Director who told me he'd take care of it, when I first got the paper back from the publisher, I had one really favorable review, one negative and one that was in between.  He said, "Give that up.  Just go on to something else."  But I called my mentor who said, "Xerox the comments."  He said, "No, just read those comments to me, from the negative guy."  And he told me, "Oh, I know who that is."  He said, "And all he really wants--he hasn't criticized your science or your conclusions or your findings.  All he really wants is for you to acknowledge the work that he did prior to you in the area of submarine canyons.  So here's what I want you to do.  Wait six months, work on your other research.  Find two or three references on him, add them to your paper, resubmit it exactly as it is."  And the paper was accepted with changes they made over the telephone.  And I got to meet that guy at a conference, and I went up to him, and I said, "Oh, I'm very familiar with your work on submarine canyons."  And he said, "Why does your name sound so familiar to me?"  I said, "I don't know.  Maybe you saw my paper on these three submarine canyons off the East--."  He said, "Oh, yeah, yeah yeah.  Great work.  Tremendous work.  A great contribution to our field."  So I said, "There's more to this field than just the research and writing,"  and you have to understand, because I would have been--had I listened to the Lab Director at the time, I would have just given up on the work.  And that paper was nominated for NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] Paper of the Year.  After I was told "give it up."  "It's no good."
Speaker 2: This is--I would think that this place compares to academia in, I mean, to a university setting in a lot of ways.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, in thinking back to that time, I believe it was possibly an outside influence who got to my supervisor and said, "How in the world could a graduate student have envisioned this, come up with this, run the survey.  No, he's still in graduate school.  How could--.  No.  You were the chief scientist of that cruise."  Even though the ship was turned over to me for three days.  My hypothesis, my map, my survey, my idea, my initial analysis, fifty-some pages of my handwritten notes.  But I believe somebody else got into her head.
Speaker 2: Now, what was the craft--the name of the vessel that you were--
Speaker 1: It was called 'The Researcher'--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --at that time.  Almost three hundred feet long, about fifty feet wide; crew, a complement of thirty-some, usually eight, ten scientists at a time would go out for as long as four weeks at a time.
Speaker 2: So this is about 1977?
Speaker 1: The cruise, yeah.  The cruise--that actual cruise was probably done, oh, in 1975.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I--yeah, it had to have been.
Speaker 2: And the paper would be out in '75 [1975], '76 [1976]?
Speaker 1: Those papers started coming out in '76 [1976], '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And I had nothing to show for it.  So.
Speaker 2: Now I have a--now, were you discouraged by academia in some way, by all of this, because I know--
Speaker 1: Well, see, the academic experience, the experience at Columbia [University, New York, New York] was very positive for me, because it was one of their--one of the school's own, one of their senior professors, the department head at--of the geology department who saved me.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he trumped the professor who wanted to take me down, and he had something to say about who the head of that whole department was over there.  So, I had no negative feelings about that academic experience.  And I just saw him as the one rogue professor who was unhappy for some reason, who was maybe taking it out on me.  I never thought anything about racism or any such thing.  I just thought, "Wow, he's not a nice guy," you know.
Speaker 2: Now--okay.  So--well, so, you continued here and figured out ways to protect your work, in other words?
Speaker 1: But, it's hard to work alone when you need computer programmers.  You can pump a lot of more work if you have coauthors who you can trust, who you can believe in, who help you figure things out so you don't have to do all the work; doing not just the heavy lifting, but all of the lifting by yourself, it's very difficult, especially when you're a junior scientist because it takes a while to learn the craft. How the publication process works, and, you know, it was just very difficult.  Very difficult.  And not trusting.  Because I really didn't think I could trust anybody.
Story_ID: 27121
Speaker 1: Well, in '79 [1979], now, you were the--you became the first African American oceanographer to conduct a research mission above a submersible craft, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, what happened is, in 1977--actually it was in 1978, the American Geophysical Union had a meeting here in Miami Beach, Florida, and I gave a talk on submarine canyons.  And there was the chief scientist of NOAA's [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] National Ocean Survey at the time was a scientist by the name of Alex [Alexander] Malahoff, and he was in the audience that day when I gave my talk on the submarine canyons.  And he came up to me, and afterwards, and said, "That's the best speech I've heard all day, and could I have your contact information."  Now, there was a guy who I'd gone to graduate school with named Robert Embley, so he was up at Columbia, Lamont [Doherty Earth Observatory, Palisades, New York]; and we had sort of an interest in Marine Geology and Geophysics, and some interest in submarine canyons.  And we talked, and I actually sent Bob [Robert] Embley an application to work for NOAA.  I told him, "I'm already working for NOAA.  Great agency, maybe you can find some work with them."  And so he applied, and, unbeknownst to me, he had been hired by Alex Malahoff, the guy who heard me give this talk.  And so he went back to the office, and he talked about this guy he had met, who this young scientist who'd studied at Lamont.  "Maybe you knew him, Evan Forde."  He laughed at--Bob Embley laughed and said, "Evan Forde gave me an application to apply for NOAA."  So what happened was that Bob Embley--Alex Malahoff, the chief scientist of the National Ocean Survey had to testify before Congress, and had committed to dives in this little submersible called Nekton Gamma, and couldn't go.  He was going to have to be before Congress, and said, "I know who the perfect person would be.  He understands these canyons, he's written papers on them, he's made maps of them."  And he asked Bob Embley--oh, you know, it was maybe then that he asked Bob Embley, you know, "Have you ever heard of this guy?"  That was when he revealed it.  So, that's how I became the second scientist on that submersible expedition.
Story_ID: 27122
Speaker 1: So, tell us about the '79 [1979] trip in the Nekton Gamma.
Speaker 2: The Nekton Gamma, literally, the little yellow submarine, and the people who took the little yellow submarine out to our dive site and, I think, Wilmington [Canyon] or Norfolk Canyon where there're low bidders for the job.  So it was not a traditional mothership.  Now, the difference between a submersible and a submarine, is the submersible is dependent on the mothership to take it out where it's gonna do its work.  It's craned or lowered into the water, it's collected, put back on the ship at night, and all the navigation and that sort of thing is on the mothership.  And a submarine is totally self-sufficient.  It can go underwater and be submerged for days, weeks at a time.  But a submersible dive usually lasts hours.  Another thing is about the capacity of a submersible.  The Nekton Gamma can only have two people in it at one time.  The scientist lies on his stomach and can look out at the portholes on either side, and the pilot actually sits looking out of something called a conning tower to navigate.  And that particular submersible was tethered to the surface.  So there's actually a line tied to its tail with a float on the surface, so if they lost us otherwise, they'd know where we were.  And we had underwater communications.  And that little sub, I can barely get my shoulders into it to crawl down into it; very cramped, very damp.  The bottom temperature at, I think that one would go down to two thousand or three thousand feet.  It was still only a three or four degree centigrade.  So it was very cold.  And so what you do is, you take layers of clothing, 'cause you first get in, it's hot.  Why don't they use the heater?  The accident that happened with the Apollo astronauts where breathing pure oxygen, remember the three of them died up there on a practice run at Cape Canaveral [Florida].  So heating elements were out.  Besides, they use a lot of electrical energy, and your battery is your main supply of energy for the dives.  That's what you run the motor off of, the propeller to move the sub around in, and there was no heating elements; too dangerous.  So they stopped having pure oxygen and gave us a combination a lot more like the air we breath up here in the atmosphere.  And, but she needed a lot more than you need pure oxygen.  So it was cold, damp, scary.  When I heard that conning tower go "thwoomp," and the quiet in the sub; kind of a little shiver went through and I thought, "What in the world are you doing?" you know.  And I had already heard that that sub, that somebody had already died on that sub.  Steve McQueen, the actor, his speedboat had sunk in San Diego Harbor or San Diego Bay, someplace out there, and they were trying to demonstrate that this sub could be used for underwater recovery.  And they went down to two hundred and seventy-eight feet and they put a sling under the boat, they found it, and for the surface ship to bring the boat up.  And as it was being lifted it slipped out of the sling, came down, and the head of the boat cracked the conning tower of the sub and so the sub started leaking, and the pilot was injured; he actually had some brain damage.  But the guy who was lying in the scientist's position actually opened the hatch, pushed him out, but died himself on the seafloor.  He had on boots and couldn't never even get them off to try to surface.  And the guy was unconscious, floated to the surface, wound up in a clump of seaweed.  And the people on the surface did not know what happened because they lost communication with the submersible.
Story_ID: 27123
Speaker 1: And the guy is on the seaweed and he's floating face up.  A man and his son, who were fishing, had no idea of what was going on, more than a half a mile away, find this guy floating in the seaweed.  He's not breathing.  They drag him onto their boat.  There's a medical center on the bay, right on the water, and then driving him there across the waves.  They resuscitated him.  And he's in the 'Guinness Book of Records' for the world's longest free ascent.  He did regain consciousness and survived, and he's in the 'Guinness Book of Records.'  But I'd heard--okay.  So there's a guy who died in this sub.  And on my very first dive, there were abandoned underwater lobster pots and a tether that was on--the surface float got caught in this very thick polypropylene line for the lobster pots, and we were trapped underwater for several hours, unable to surface.  The underwater communication was sheared off, the hydrophone was torn off, so we couldn't communicate with the surface.  And we couldn't get but a certain--when we tried to surface, we couldn't get free of the lobster pots.  And the pilot on that particular dive was a guy who had been a Marine Corp helicopter rescue pilot in Vietnam, so he wasn't afraid of anything.  He used to get up every morning, and he'd circle the ship, swimming laps around the ship.  And somebody told him, "We've seen sharks, like, two morning in a row."  He said, "They're not interested in me."  And continued.  So he literally wasn't afraid of anything.  And when we lost--first we lost--we didn't know what was happening, why we couldn't surface.  But, when we lost communication with the surface, I said, "Don't you think we ought to try to surface?"  And he said, "Aviate, navigate and communicate is third."  I said, "Okay."  And it got to a point where he said, "I think we ought to try to surface.  It's beginning to get dark."  And he released all the emergency weights to make us a buoyant as possible, and we weren't surfacing, and he said, "Oh, shoot."  (laughs).  And I said, "And don't tell me you're afraid, 'cause if you're afraid, I'm terrified."  And I don't even know if the tail was kind of sharp, or a propeller or something cut the lines; somehow, we got free.  But that was my very first submersible dive.  And it was terrifying.  And so--
Speaker 2: So when you're in it, can you see under there?  I mean, you know, you got a mile--
Speaker 1: You can see (simultaneous) okay, with all the--with the most powerful lights, you can see, maybe with the sub, I'm going to say you can't see any further than twelve or fifteen feet away from the sub.  And, you know, the props are stirring up a little sediment, which is making it more cloudy.  And you always wonder if the creature from '20,000 Leagues From Under the Sea' is just out of sight, and you just can't see him, you know.  So, it's a little bit--they tell me that about once every seven or eight--one out of--I'm sorry, not once every seven or eight.  One every--one out of every seven or eight scientists, when they close that hatch, starts screaming, "Let me out of here," and "I just can't do it."  It's claustrophobic.
Speaker 2: Now, that the danger of it is aside--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --now, (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --I didn't--yeah.  I, you know, I don't scare easy.  I'm not afraid of much.  But I needed a day or two off before I was willing to dive again.  And I said, "I need to know, what safety procedures you're going to put in place here."
Speaker 2: Were you able to gather any data?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We had our underwater photos, but we had no samples.  No sediment samples, no rock samples, nothing.  They had a primitive--I want to say, manipulator or robot arm they pick up things with.  But we didn't have much except the pictures from that dive.
Story_ID: 27124
Speaker 1: Was it [the dive] better the next time?
Speaker 2: It was much better, and I really got into the excitement of diving and knowing that, you know--.  By accident on the way down, the descent lights were turned off, and I could see underwater bioluminescent creatures as we were floating down, and it was just astonishing.  Because even if you're only going a couple thousand feet down, you don't do it quickly.  You know, I don't remember the descent rates for Nekton Gamma, but the next year I did dives in Alvin.  And to do a two-mile down--to go down two miles, you take almost two hours, because the type--the sphere--so it's a large sub, but the part that we're in is only six feet in diameter, the pressure hull; made out of titanium, very thick titanium, very thick glass, and--but you don't want to apply the pressure of over four thousand pounds per square inch too quickly.  You go down very slowly, and you come up not as slowly as you'd descend, but you come up slowly too.  So an hour and a half ascent from two miles down.  So that's a big portion of your dive, if you're diving that deep.  But imagine the weight of a school bus on every square inch of the sub.  That's a lot of pressure.
Speaker 1: Does it affect--how does it affect (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No.  The interior of the sub is one atmosphere.  So it's the same as up here.  You maybe feel a little pressure in your ears or something, but it's not--
Speaker 1: Like being on an airplane is or something?
Speaker 2: Not even that bad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not even that bad.  But it's cold and it's damp.  And imagine the three of us in a sphere that's only six feet in diameter.  That's this wide and as tall as I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you've got equipment, and sonar, and radar, and a communications, and all kinds of things.  And it's getting colder, you know.  So I'd put on layer--I found that that was the best way to do it.  And there're no restroom facilities at two miles down, folks.
Speaker 1: I was thinking about that.
Speaker 2: No.  And I played that little macho game of not going to the restroom, which was horrible for my body, for my kidneys.  And, in addition to being cramped, when I get to the surface, I could barely walk 'cause I've really had to use the restroom.  But they gave us the little bottles like pilots have.  But I never--and actually, there was a woman on one of my dives with me.  So I wasn't really interested in--but, she used--she used her little bottle, like, a couple of times, you know.  'Cause one of the Alvin dives, the dive didn't last twelve hours, but by the time we got to the surface, there were twelve-foot seas, the weather forecasting wasn't as good as it is now, and that sub is not made to be sitting on the surface at twelve-foot seas.  Because the mothership had a big crane, and so they put divers in the water, who would attach to the sub, and then they'd maneuver the ship slowly and the big crane would lift it up.  But in twelve-foot seas, that's really a tricky operation.  You don't even want the divers in the water at twelve-foot seas, because the sub could hit up against them, knock'em into, you know--the sub is naturally buoyant.  You make it so it doesn't sink and it doesn't rise.  It's as light as a feather under water.  Imagine being three feet off the ocean bottom, and you're not sinking, nor are you rising.  And, you know, so the sub weighs many tons.  But under water, it's trimmed and made to be neutrally buoyant.  And it has a submersible pump that if we want to be heavier, they pump water on.  If we want to be lighter, they pump water out.  And they had special weights on to help it go down, so you wouldn't have that type of control, because it's got to be a pretty strong pump to pump water that's four thousand pounds per square inch.  You can imagine.  And you don't want-and it uses a lot of energy to do that.
Story_ID: 27125
Speaker 1: But it was in my second dive in Alvin in a submarine canyon that I'd ask the pilot to get a rock sample for me from a submarine canyon.  And he tried for about eight or ten minutes and couldn't.  And I said, "That's okay."  And he said, "No, I think I can get it."  Because for me, we're looking at walls of a canyon like the Grand Canyon, but under water.  And I said, "I'd like to do some radio carbon dating on that rock.  If we can see the age of it, we can have some idea about when that section of the canyon was formed."  I had an idea, but--anyway, he said, "No, no.  I can get it."  And in attempting to get the rock sample, he created an underwater landslide on top of the sub.  So, I know I can't see anything.  Before I could see twelve, fifteen feet, maybe out.  Now, I can't see anything except brown mud.  And I said to the pilot, "Ralph, what happened?"  'Cause you could feel the boom, boom, boom.  He said, "Looks like we got some mud on top of us."  I said, "How much mud?"  He said, "I don't know."  So he turned the propellers down and tried to push us off.  The sub didn't move.  And, you know, so the next twelve minutes or so, he kept trying different things.  He made the sub as light as he could possibly make it, and we still were not moving. Turned the props down, sub is light as we can, and I'm looking at the depth gauge.  And I've got a voice recorder.  I actually found some of the tapes from my Alvin dives.  But there's like a gap like there was in the Richard Nixon cape, where I'm not saying anything.  And some people say that's where I found Jesus (laughs), two miles down in Wilmington Submarine Canyon.  But I'm looking at the depth gaugue, which is digital, and all I want to see--all I'm interested in in the world at this moment is seeing the depth read one meter less than it did a second ago.  And eventually it flashed and then it was like going back and forth between the numbers, and then, you know, we slowly began to ascend.  But now we've made ourselves so buoyant, that we can't possibly continue the dive.  We've got to go up now.  As a matter of fact, if we go up at the speed we're going now, we take the chance of rupturing the hull of the sub.  So we had to pump water on to make ourselves as heavy as possible.  But we had to abort the dive.  So, anyway, that gave me pause for thought.
Story_ID: 27126
Speaker 1: And so what happened is, it's so cold in the sub, and I used to have really bad allergies.  And one of the things that would trigger my allergies was coldness and dampness, and, you know, that--.  So somebody saw me, that I would take a little plastic vial with me on all of my dives.  Now what was in the vial was something very similar to Benadryl.  It was an antihistamine called Chlor-Trimeton.  And so I told Bob [Robert] Embley, the guy who was on the first submersible dives with me, at the National Ocean Survey, the one that I'd gone to graduate school with.  He asked me, he said, "I always wanted to ask you, what is in that little vial that you take down with you?"  I said, "Well, you know, you knew what happened with the first sub-dives.  I told you what happened on my Alvin expedition."  I said, "Well, I decided that I, even though they have enough oxygen supply to last for the three of us for three days, there's nobody who could rescue us two miles down, there's no other sub that could go down and rescue us and all that, and I am not going to die a slow death and suffocate to death; that's cyanide.  If I know for sure, I'm going to go, I'm going to go quickly."  I was just joking, right.  So.  But he began to tell other people in the community about it and all that.  So there were two things.  There was that, and by that time, I told you about the voice recorders we take, and little did I know that my tape was going to be transcribed by his secretary and not mine.  And so when I had the first incident in the little yellow submarine, the Nekton Gamma, once we were free and it was clear that we were surfacing, and we reestablished communication with the service, I did my, you know, so the Jacques--my best Jacques Cousteau voice, which I said, "To zee average person, they would have been terrified; but to," at the time I said, "Captain Willie Cousteau, it is just another day in the, zee office," you know.  And so I noticed that whenever I called to speak to Dr. Embly or Dr. Malahoff, their secretary would always giggle just before she handed the phone to them.  "Hold on a second."  And one of the guys up there said, "Evan, this is--this is John.  Alex isn't here and Bob isn't here right now, but I want to know if I'm talking to the one and only, the world famous Captain Willie Cousteau?"  And I was like, "Oh, shoot."  So that was part of the lore.  Between that and the cyanide, it was--it was really interesting.  I'd talk to that other guy within the past two months, and he still calls me Captain Willie.  So it's kind of funny.  We had fun.
Story_ID: 27127
Speaker 1: What's the most memorable discovery from these trips down in the submersibles?
Speaker 2: Well, the most memorable discovery is, for me--so, you know, two miles down, there's not a lot of life.  You see the occasional fish that's adapted itself to life at that depth great--of that great depth.  They have eyes, but they don't function.  They can feel the heat from the lights of the sub, and they can feel the vibrations.  But there're underwater snails, holothurians they're called, that are translucent.  They have a purplish hue--they're slugs, deep-sea slugs.  They actually eat the sediment for the nutrients they can get out of it.  But those hadn't been discovered--they had been discovered prior to my expeditions, and some of the deepwater fish.  But we saw features under water--for example, imagine--you know, I mentioned earlier the sheer walls; sheer meaning straight up.  If this is the bottom--I always imagined that being underwater, being eroded, that there were no sharp angles, and I kept that in mind.  And the person who taught me how to make the maps of the ocean floor always told me, "There's no sharp angles under water, there're no sheer walls. There's no ninety-degree angles."  There are.  I saw the walls of a submarine canyon go straight up, not very more than a degree or two, for hundreds of meters.  I did not know, and we did not know that that existed.  And there were some anemones that had not previously been cataloged, that we checked, kind of as an exhibition, got credit for naming them and cataloging them.  We had a biologist on board, and we originally named them 'avalanche anemones' because we found them in areas where there had been underwater landslides.  And so that's what we nicknamed them, "avalanche anemones."  So there were--I was mainly able to, on the dives, because imagine thirty-five thousand dollars a day to do a submersible expedition.  And you get to get in a submersible with all of the support, and you can only see twelve, fifteen, eighteen feet maybe in front of you.  You've got the world's slowest engine, maybe in a nine-hour dive, maybe you can travel about a kilometer.  But you've got this narrow cone of vision.  The most interesting thing in the world could be right out of the viewpoint of or the power of the lights and you'd never see it.  As a matter of fact, I had an interesting discussion--actually, disagreement--with one of the scientists who went down with me, on whether we were seeing a feature that was very similar to something we'd seen forty-five minutes before, or if the sub got turned around, and we were just seeing the same thing from a different angle.  You know, I eventually won the argument.  But you don't know.  You can only see this small area at a time.  You can't go very far.  So you don't get to do a lot of mapping.  So what we tried to do was tie in what we saw on the dives with some of the detailed profiling in a detail of maps that I had made.  And we actually found that there was a system within the canyon, like a river within the river, where there'd been this underwater debris flow that actually had meanders in it that went more than a hundred kilometers long.  So, you know, that was the topic of one of our papers about this, submersible dives.
Story_ID: 27128
Speaker 1: Now, these canyons are off the coast of Virginia?
Speaker 2: There's over a hundred canyons between Cape Hatteras [North Carolina] and Nova Scotia [Canada].  And the prevailing theory is that, many of these canyons were formed after the last Ice Age.  So if you can imagine much of North America covered by a huge glacier that extended down to the Carolinas.  As the water from the glaciers began to melt, it's going to flow down slope.  And so, since there's a set amount of water on Earth, if more of this grows into ice, glaciers, snow, the ice caps are bigger, sea level is lower.  Much of what we call the continental shelf was exposed during our last Ice Age.  And as the glaciers began to melt and the ice produce these, like, rivers flowing down slope, many of them begin carve out little riverbeds, which were the beginnings of the submarine canyons.  Now, part of my work used the technology that allows us to look several kilometers, maybe as much as twelve or fifteen kilometers deep.  So I can not only see the "V's" and the "U's" of the canyons, but I could see the underlying layers.  And one my theories was that, since North America and Europe were once together, when they broke up, they left areas of structural weakness in the continental margin that, as the canyons began to erode down, they began to bend flow with these areas of weakness in the continental margins.  And I discovered that by actually taking--there were some detailed studies of three East Coast canyons, and plotting them down, didn't have the technology that we have today; but I put it on Mylar [a mapping program], and I plotted the axis and I saw it went this way, this way, this way, and this one.  But they were just off by a couple of degrees.  And I put them on Mylar, and I saw they matched up perfectly.  And I was told to never publish that, that people would think I was nuts.  But it was accepted--it was one of the things in that paper that became one of the papers of the era.  And to this day, that hypothesis is still accepted as one of the prevailing theories on mid-Atlantic submarine canyons.
Story_ID: 27129
Speaker 1: I supposed around this time, you'd become, become noted as a science explainer or science educator--I mean as a person who can talk to kids and explain what--
Speaker 2: Well, it's--yeah.  I was not particularly interested in talking to children or going out and doing outreach, and, in the beginning.  Nor was I particularly good at it.  I was very, very much interested in my career as a scientist, writing proposals, getting papers published; and a very dedicated scientist.  And two things happened.  The same lab director who was not able to assist me in getting for the credit for the work that I had done asked me to go to a school here in Miami [Florida], Dade County, and talk to a group of kids on their Career Day.  And I was still not happy with him about what had happened and was working very hard to try to get my science completed, and I said, "I don't know how, how familiar you are with the work I'm doing right now, but I'm pretty busy.  I don't have time to go and talk to school kids."  You know, "All the way where?"  And he said, "Okay.  I see.  Well, do you like working here?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "Kinda like it or really like it?"  I said, "I really like it."  He said, "Do you, do you like that plus your office you have with a view of the beach and the ocean?  You get to see the sunrise every--"  "Oh, yeah."  He said, "You want to continue to work here?"  I said, "Yes."  He said, "I'm asking you to go--"  And before he could finish, I said, "What was the name of the school again?"  And so I was reluctant, and word got back to him that I had apparently done a good job.  And so he asked me again, and I knew better than to say no.  But what happened is, I was explaining to my sister [Bernadette], who was teaching at the time, what I'd done with the kids, and she said, "You ought to come and talk to my kids."  And she was teaching at Rainbow Park Elementary [Miami, Florida], a school that I had attended.  And so I went to her school, and it was a great experience because the kids really loved me, and she was having trouble disciplining a few of them and that sort of thing.  But they loved me.  And she said, "Yeah, you know, you can come in here for an hour or two and be a wonder, but try doing this five days a week, eight hours a day and let's see how you do."
Story_ID: 27130
Speaker 1: But there was one little boy in her [Forde's sister, Bernadette] class who had been a real problem child.  She had even asked the principal to take him out of her class and put him in some special learning situation.  I don't know exactly how that was going to work.  But she said, that since I've been there, he had become an angel, and his mother came to see her and said, "What have you done to my child?  He's totally different."  And he wrote me a letter.  Thanked me for coming and said he wanted to be an oceanographer when he grew up.  That really changed things for me.  And I learned to look for the light coming on in children's eyes.  Somebody who maybe wasn't paying attention and then all of a sudden.  And I actually had kids begin to argue with me about whether or not it was really me in the picture getting into Alvin [research submersible], because I had a beard.  I'd been on a research cruise.  I met the ship off of Norfolk [Virginia].  I hadn't been home.  I hadn't seen my barber or a razor in about five or six weeks, and so I looked a little hairy.  But, "That's not you."  A little black kid.  Thinking, "That can't be you.  Black people don't do that."  And, you know, he was--that showed me that it was really necessary for me to get out and be a role model for kids that, perhaps, for some I might be the only person that look like them who they ever saw, who they knew did a nontraditional occupation.  Now, at this point, I had no idea that I was the first black scientist to do dives in the submersible.  I didn't know.  All right.  But, so I told my father about that kid and he said, "So, you know, I know things didn't start off all that well for you, but are you grateful for the public education that you received right down here in Miami, Florida, that allowed to get into Columbia University [New York, New York] and have the occupation that was the dream of your lifetime?"  I said, "Yeah.  Yeah, I really am."  He said, "Well, work to make that available for every child, because I believe every child deserves a first-class education."  And so, actually, that is probably my most favorite quote, is something that I tell anybody who will listen to me.  I've said it at school board meetings, I said it at community groups, and you know, I tell that to the teachers of the kids that I've talked to when I'm out in the community speaking to them.  I truly do believe that every child deserves a first-class education.  And, you know, it leads to part of my story is, things didn't start out so well for me academically.  But they didn't give up on me.  And so I tell children, "Look, if, you know, for some of you, things are difficult at home; some negative things have happened to you, but you are not the situation or circumstances.  You're bigger, badder, tougher than anything that's happened to you if your dream is big enough.  So, your past does not equal your future.  Whatever you're willing to work hard enough to achieve, you can get, but first you got to dream."
Story_ID: 27131
Speaker 1: By 1980, I guess it is, you had a meeting with Johnson Publications about writing for 'Ebony Jr.'  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: So, the first thing that happened is, 1979 I was featured as 'Ebony Magazine's' most eligible bachelor, and I was in a couple of other national publications where they just had a line or so and just mentioned me as being one of the most eligible bachelors in America, and--
Speaker 1: A regular feature, they would have, like, bachelorettes, too (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I'll show you the picture, I'll send it to you.
Speaker 1: How many--it would be twenty, thirty?  I don't know.
Speaker 2: I don't remember, but for that year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was the lead one.  I was the first one, but they had what I felt was a horrible picture of me.  But, you know what, I did look rugged.  There're sailboats behind me; I was squinting, the sun's in my face; I had a Fu Manchu moustache; but--and so, the editor of "Ebony, Jr." had seen that feature and contacted me and wanted to interview me for "Ebony, Jr." magazine.  And She had worked for Scott Foresman; they're the people who wrote the 'Dick and Jane' books, and she'd been the lead editor for them.  So she--very talented, gifted writer-editor.  And she interviewed me over the phone and--how did she--.  I don't remember how she got the pictures.  She got photos of me, and they did-'Ebony Jr.' did an entire issue on oceanography.  And I had the idea, so I'd seen, like, 'Mr. Wizard,' a science corner--something in--what was the name of the magazine?  'Highlights.'  One of the children's magazines.
Speaker 1: 'Highlights' or 'Children,' right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I said, "Why can't we do this for the readers of 'Ebony Jr.'?  And so, I approached her with it.  She says, "Sounds like a great idea to me."  She said, "Where would you get the material from?  It needs to be original material."  I said, "I'll write the experiments."  And she said, "I need to talk to Mr. Johnson about this."  And she told me that he wanted to speak to me by phone, and he did.  And I told him he could really set his publication apart, that--you know, and I told him that, already, as a condition to go to some of the schools--'cause I was already by this time getting invited to fifty, sixty schools a year--I said, "Sometimes, one of my conditions is, your library has to subscribe to 'Ebony, Jr.'  And you need to have it there and be able to show it to me in the library by the time I come."
Story_ID: 27132
Speaker 1: I'd make all kind of conditions.  "I need to talk to the whole school, not just one class of third-graders and that sort of thing." But, as I became more in demand, I was able to do that.  And one of my goals was maximizing my impact.  So I'd go to schools where I could make a difference.  And--so that was one of my goals, is high-impact visits.  And, you know, so I had the mandate from my father.  "Make this available for everybody."  And so I was wondering how I could I do that.  But one of the things that I could do is just show up, and make myself available, and be willing, until I got some skills as somewhat of a science educator.  Because, like I said, I wasn't particularly good.  It was sort of, like, "Wow, look at me," in the beginning.  But who I am now as a Toastmaster certified and Professional Speaker's Network, certified professional communicator; is a guy who's sort of Mandrake the Magician, and I guess Alex Trebek, Albert Einstein. I'm just--I even have elements of magic in my presentations to kids because I understand--well, first of all, there's a woman in--who's really helped me with the outreach.  I spoke to her class over thirty years ago.  And she's a retired educator now, and she's help provided the funding through a group she supports with the 'Friends of the North Miami Public Library,' that buys the chemicals and gadgets and gizmos, and things that I use, chemicals.  She said to me, about four years ago, "You know, I've seen you talk.  The kids love you.  But, have you considered taking your talks to a new level?"  I said, "Like what?"  She said, "Well, have you ever considered being a little more like Bill Nye, the Science Guy?"  Well, I was offended, because I thought, "What's wrong with the way I do things now?"  And I took a step back, and my dad told me, you know, "Before you judge something and look at it as criticism," he said, "always consider the source."  And this is a woman who's really facilitated me speaking to thousands of kids, right?  So I said, "What would that look like?"  So I went on Youtube and began to look at 'Bill Nye, the Science Guy,' and-- actually I gave one of the keynote speeches at National Science Teachers Association meetings several years ago.  And I didn't have that much of an audience because Bill Nye was signing copies of his newest book at that time.  And the director of conventions apologized to me.  She said, "I'm so sorry I put you opposite him."  I said, "I understand for anybody who wasn't there, because if I didn't have to talk, I would have been over with Bill Nye, the Science Guy, myself, you know."  So, I remember that experience.  And I remember it taking me four hours to get from where I gave the speech back to my hotel room, which essentially was just across the street.  Because at the National Science Teachers Association, you--if you were a speaker--if you're a presenter, you wear a badge that identifies you.  And there were literally hundreds of people who had gotten lost, or couldn't find it, or were with Bill Nye and got there too late.  And I spoke to hundreds of people before I could make it back to my hotel room.  And I was exhausted and hoarse.  And I saw the hunger for, you know, scientists who knew how to communicate with people in plain language.  And by that time, I had been chairman of my branch of NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], which is Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. We're the ones who do the weather forecasting and the research.  I've been chairman of NOAA's Education Committee, and had the idea that NOAA could make posters that could compete with the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] posters.  And that, because NOAA was an agency that was not well known.  And I'm the person who, as far as I knew, invented the phrase that, "NOAA is an agency that is to the study of the oceans and atmosphere, as NASA is to the study of space."  And so I was promoting NOAA.  And I may have been the originator of the phrase, NOAA Research, which for a period of a couple of years, almost in our organization would answer their phone, "NOAA Research."  But that was my idea.  I said, "We have to grow our own constituency."
Story_ID: 27133
Speaker 1: We got a new lab director here [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA], and I began to shift my research, which we can talk about that when we're ready, but I needed to focus on learning a field completely outside of marine geology and geophysics.  She was a satellite remote sensing specialist who had led a lab in France.  She was Swedish-born and had become the Director of this laboratory.  And we had a couple of mandates from headquarters.  One was to get--create a substantial web page.  One was to create a public affairs office at every laboratory.  And she was coming here, and she didn't have scientific support.  I actually taught myself how to write computer programs, and because I had been having to make my own scientific illustrations for years, I was about the laboratory's best person with Photoshop and other graphics programs.  And I taught myself web authoring at home with books, and I was actually one of the research divisions here; the Ocean Chemistry Division, I was the web master.  And when our webmaster left, and she asked the question, "Who do this on a temporary basis until we can hire somebody," she said, everybody told her I could.  And then when the mandate came from headquarters, "Who could be our outreach public affairs person," she said, most people said me.  And when she asked, "How can I get help with my computer graphics and all that," so she approached me one day, and she said, "Do you feel that your talents are well-suited to being in the Ocean Chemistry Division, or that you could flourish under a different leadership?"  I said, "What have you got?"  And she made me offer to come and do--be the webmaster, create the public affairs office here, and to do scientific support for her.  And I said, "That sounds good."  But I haven't been able to do any research at that time for about a year or two years.  And there were some difficult situations with the leadership; my supervisors and all that sort of thing.  And I said, "I will come to work for you, but you have to promise me a chance to do scientific research."  And at that point, we're sitting down negotiating, she stands up and puts her hand on my shoulder.  She said, "By all accounts you're a very bright guy, but have you ever taken any satellite remote sensing courses?"  "No."  "Seminars?"  "No."  "Have you ever taken any meteorology courses?"  "No."  "Not even one?"  And she sighs and said, "You'd have to be some kind of genius to make meaningful contributions to the work that I'm doing."  She said, "Do you understand?"  I said, "Yeah."  She said, "What did I just say to you?"  I said, "You'd have to--you said, I'd have to be some kind of freakin' genius to make meaning contributions to the research that you're doing?  So we have a deal or not?"  She just shook her head, and she said, "Okay.  I'll give you a chance."  And that's how I began to do the Satellite Remote Sensing.
Story_ID: 27134
Speaker 1: And within two years, I had coauthored a paper with her on a new satellite launched by NASA that the hurricane researchers used to detect storms when they first start spinning, usually when they're off the coast of Africa someplace.  So, when the galley proofs came back and the paper had been accepted, I went up to her and I said, "I guess I must be some kind of genius, huh?"  So, which was really fascinating, and I sort of got hooked on the idea, since we were no longer doing marine geology and geophysics here at this laboratory, that I could maybe make a difference with scientific research that would either improve people's lives or save people's lives, 'cause that's what hurricane research does ultimately, is we want to be able to increase the amount of warning time that people have, or know how these storms work. If it's going to form or not, where is it going to go, how strong is it going to be when it gets there, and our best way of figuring that out is by using the satellites, because we have aircraft that can fly in the storms when they are a few hundred miles away from the coast.  But Africa is almost three thousand miles away.  We don't have any aircraft flying over there.  We don't have buoys.  There's not real estate where we can launch weather balloons.  We don't have any data.  But the satellites allow us to make very good estimates of wind speeds, sea surface temperature, other factors that impact hurricane formation and their intensity.  And as I began to get to understand some of these satellites, and I had the understanding that the scientific method that we got taught when we were doing our science fai-- science fairs projects, works in any science, even though there's very specific knowledge that's necessary.  For example, you know, a hurricane is a storm that has a circular motion.  And I was looking at wind barbs from a satellite that had only been launched six weeks earlier, was one of the first human beings getting to see this data, and going around and asking my friends in the Hurricane Research Division, "Is this closed circulation or not?" Until I learned.  And I said, "You know what?  I'm going to find a case we know there is a hurricane, and this satellite saw it, and I'm going to go back upstream to where they first came off of Africa as a thunderstorm and see when I first could see the spinning motion begin."  And that's what we wrote our paper about.  And we saw Hurricane Floyd, for example, spinning forty-nine hours before the National Hurricane Center said it was even a tropical depression.  So, that was a pretty earth-shattering paper.  And I began to do other work, but I began to understand that science.  And my supervisor in that case recognized that I was the one actually doing the research, but she got the funding, she got NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] to pay my salary for six months.  And so I was very happy to be second author of that paper.  It was not my idea.  It was not my funding.  I had to be led by the hand, and I was shocked by how much-- the leeway and how much she trusted me.  But I actually wrote the text for the paper where she added some of the details stuff and the technical stuff that I didn't know.  And I did all the illustrations, and it was an exceptional paper.  And so I had arrived into the world of satellite remote sensing.  Now, what happened is, I'd really got the fervor.  I really got the passion for doing that work.  And by this time, I'm reading dozens of papers on tropical meteorology and satellite remote sensing, 'cause I want to understand.
Story_ID: 27135
Speaker 1: My--the lab director was needing me more and more, and she didn't like that I was doing so much outreach, even though she was all for it.  And so, without her knowledge or permission, I resigned as Chairman of the Oceanic and Atmospheric Research part of NOAA's [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] Education Committee.  I resigned, and she was shocked.  Everybody was shocked.  I just made a phone call and said, "I'm done."  And this who I think could take my place."  But I had gone to our bosses in Silver Springs, Maryland, that's where the NOAA headquarters are, to the Deputy Undersecretary of Commerce, and I said, "I have an idea for NOAA being able to compete with NASA at these meetings like the National Science Teachers Association conference with--for posters and we can get our name out there."  And she said, "Well, what have you got in mind?"  I'd made prototype of a poster and it was severe weather.  I said, "This impacts everybody in the world, severe weather at one time or another."  So, lightning, flash floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes.  And with--after she saw my presentation, she gave me ten thousand dollars of seed money.  I was still chairman of the committee by that time.  But when I resigned, we had a name for the first poster.  And nobody else on the committee had the vision that I did.  So NOAA made a few posters; one on tornadoes, one on space weather, one on physical oceanography; but they weren't what I was looking for.  So after I went to that National Science Teachers Association meeting, and I saw the passion, and now I'm involved with fifty thousand science teachers across the nation through the National Science Teachers Association.  I approached their director with the prototype I had for the poster--oh, 'cause I saw they had posters--and he said, "We're really not interested in doing posters."  "I said, "Would you please just listen to my idea?"  And I told him, I said, "Now, NOAA doesn't have the artist, we don't have the distribution, we don't have the audience to get this distributed like your organization do.  I'm proposing a joint project.  Well, the National Science Teachers Association gets to put your name on a poster with NOAA on severe weather, and I want to use your artist who made this poster over here or the one who did this poster over here."  He said, "That's easy.  They're the same person."  I said, "Good.  I want her."  And I went to the NOAA administrator--actually, I called a friend who knew him.  Called him on a Sunday afternoon.  She had seen my prototype.  She said, "I think you ought to talk to this guy."  And he says, "It's really not appropriate for me to speak to him under these circumstances if he's on the level you say.  Well, who is it?"  And she said, "Evan Forde."  She said, "Well, I know him from education.  I've even had him up here.  I'll talk to Evan."  And I told him.  He said, "Call my chief-of-staff tomorrow and explain it to him."  And in two days, he gave me the money to create the severe weather poster that was distributed to fifty thousand teachers.  And I estimated it's seen by 8 to 10 million kids every day.
Story_ID: 27136
Speaker 1: The poster was created in 2004.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you were telling me off camera about the--some of the politics in getting it done.
Speaker 2: Well, one of the reasons, in my opinion, NOAA's [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] previous posters, and there'd only been a few of them, didn't have the pizzazz that they should, is they weren't of interest to the general public.  And I began to-- "Look, if we're going to do a prototype of a certain type of poster, it should have wide appeal.  What does NOAA do that dramatically impacts the most Americans?  And it's weather.  But not just regular weather, "It's a high of 78 [degrees], low tonight at 53 [degrees], 30 percent chance of inland showers."  But the severe weather.  So the hurricanes, the tornadoes, the lightning, and flashfloods.  As I looked, and I said, "NOAA does forecasts for all of these."  But I didn't personally have all the expertise.  Although I could do the research on them, I felt to put together a poster-- there were all these agencies.  There is the National Severe Storms Lab, which actually does lightning and tornadoes.  The National Weather Service, which does flashfloods.  And the National Hurricane Center, which does tornadoes.  So I went to the heads of as many of those agencies as I could, including the NOAA administrator, who is the undersecretary of commerce, and said, "Who would you like from your organization to work with me on this poster?"  So I wouldn't look like it was an Evan Forde poster.  Because I was criticized by many of my colleagues and friends for the way that I did this, but I got the poster out in record time, and the National Science Teachers Association bound fifty thousand of the posters into their journals and mailed them to teachers for us.  I got seventy thousand posters created, drafted, designed and mailed for fifteen thousand dollars.
Speaker 1: These are slick paper, magazine paperweight posters, colorful (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, they're on the desk right by you.
Speaker 1: --informational.  We'll show them at the end.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: But I'm just, it's high quality-- (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well, the other things--there were a number of things.  So I looked--one of the things I looked at, you know, when people in my agency were complaining about how NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] seems always beat us at the punch in terms of public relations, I said, "Maybe instead of speaking so badly about them, we ought to try to emulate them."   And I actually got several NASA posters.  And when I'd go around to the schools and talk to the teachers, I ask them, "Why do you like this?"  "Oh, it's bright.  It's colorful.  It's cartoony.  It's--" you know.  And another thing I found out about the NASA posters is, at that time, they seemed to be two levels.  One level is one side of the poster would be something that was visually, graphically pleasing that would get your attention, and that you kinda understand the science, maybe on about a fifth-grade level.  And the more detailed stuff was on the other side.  And I said, "But every classroom has got to have two posters, 'cause you can only one poster facing out."  Another thing I found out is, they weren't these big, huge posters like NOAA was trying to make, because a teacher has got a limited number--amount of space on her bulletin board.  Never occurred to me before.  So I tried to roll all those elements in there, and that's what I got.  I got an illustrator who was illustrating children's books and illustrations for the National Science Teachers Association, which basically went up through senior high, but I did all of the writing that I did, because the poster were accompanied by articles in their journals, actual science articles, about the science of severe weather and severe weather safety.  And so, I wrote articles for the two different levels of their magazines.  One for elementary school and one for high school kids.  But I actually wrote all of the text that I wrote on the posters at a level for middle-school kids.  That way a bright elementary school child could understand it.  And it could be expanded to greater vocabulary for the senior high school students.  And that became my model for my outreach talks, too.  So anything I developed, like the course I created oceanography.  It's developed for middle-school kids.
Story_ID: 27137
Speaker 1: Let's talk about that.  That's called OCEANS, right?  (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: OCEANS, yeah.  It took me four days just to come up with the acronym.
Speaker 1: Oh, what's the acronym (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: And so it's (laughs)--
Speaker 1: Go head.
Speaker 2: "Oceanic Curriculum Empowering Achievement in Natural Sciences," which spells OCEANS.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.  And in the state of Florida, as many states have, there's a statewide test that, oftentimes, determines whether a child is going to get their high school diploma or not.  And in Florida that's called F-CAT.  Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test.  And so my immediate target for OCEANS was schools where the school itself was one of the lower-performing schools in Miami-Dade County on the science portion of the F-CAT test, and that was going to become my target, with a specific target of trying to improve the scores of students who were underperforming in science.  And so that actually was part of, the sort of the test that students in the class had to pass.  They had to--the kids who were interested, but just not really not doing that well.  And my challenge was to write a course, create a course from scratch, because I wanted to be able to take it nationally if it took off, without looking at anybody else's material.  So I began to go to physical oceanographers that I knew from the marine geologists, biological oceanography, chemical oceanography, and say to some of the people who were in that field, and especially the ones who were doing outreach, "If you could-- only had two hours to teach everything in the world there was to know about physical oceanography, what would you try to teach in those two hours?"  And I did the same thing for marine geology and geophysics, for chemical oceanography, for marine biology.  And so I added technology, and I added F-CAT lessons on math and science to every single lesson.  And I worked with a lot of professional educators.  And I was also told by the professional educators, "You need a pretest and a posttest, because it takes money to teach this course, and you need to be able to prove to the people who are going to fund you that your teaching this course is making a difference.  And it may take a year or two to see it in the F-CAT--which we have seen it by now, by the way, "But the first thing you can do is, with the pre-test and the post-test."
Story_ID: 27138
Speaker 1: So I did have a little experience writing curricula because the University of Miami [Miami, Florida] had a program called INSTAR, Investigating Nature Through Science Teacher Active Research, where they partnered with the Dade County School System, and we taught graduate-level course to Miami-Dade County teachers; an intensive two-week course every summer.  And I was a volunteer in that course, actually helped with the writing of the initial proposal when it hadn't been funded.  And one of the things I included was that, we needed a professional educator on staff, and that we needed the teachers to show evidence that they were using the work in their classrooms for the people who were funding the course, 'cause it was an expensive professional development course.  And so I volunteered helping the other strands at first.  Other strands or other topics like marine biology and all that.  But I told them, "You ought to have a tropical meteorology.  You need to have a meteorology theme."  And one of the professors was not invited back for the third year, and the head of the program came to me and said, "You said we should have a tropical meteorology course.  Write one."  And I created a tropical meteorology curriculum, and it took me about three and a half months to do it.  And, you now, I looked at a lot of the master's level programs, because these were three graduate credits offered by the University of Miami [Miami, Florida].  And it was there working with the professional educator that I learned some of my craft, learned how to write a test.  I knew how to write a test badly in the beginning.  But who knew it to much ri-- took so much work to write a simple test that was keyed for the different types of learners.  Not everybody learns the same way.  And, you know, my sister, who later became a counselor said, "If you're going to school now with the same educational barriers that you had back then, they have said that you were learning disabled."  Which simply means, you just don't just process information the same way as everybody else.  But the teachers who worked with me told me, "You need to write a test that allows people who are a little more visual, some who are more--" you know.  And I had no idea of how difficult it was to write those tests. And so I was always testing.  I tested my classes every day, and it wasn't that I was testing the students so much, but I was testing myself as an educator, because I had no experience.  But at Columbia University [New York, New York], before you get a bachelor's degree in anything, you have to take at least, at least two education courses at Teachers College.  You've probably heard of Teachers College.  Absolute degree requirement back when I was in school.  Absolutely.  So maybe I wasn't totally clueless, but it really takes a professional educator to help translate all this knowledge and high-minded stuff into something that a third-grader can understand.
Story_ID: 27139
Speaker 1: And somebody asked me, "What's the greatest speech that you've ever given," and I tell'em that I was told that I was going to speak to group of about sixty middle schoolers.  And when I got to the library that afternoon, there were kids from three years old to fourteen years old, some of whom were sitting on the carpet, because there was standing room only waiting to hear me speak.  And my speech was not catered for children of that age.  And the person at the library, the librarian said, "Well, can you handle this?"  And I said, "I need you to stall for me for about ten minutes."  And I went out--what I did was, I went outside and prayed (laughs), 'cause because I had no idea of how I was going to--.  But, you know, I had some rocks in my car from the parking lot here that I was collecting, 'cause many of them had fossils in them.  You now, south Florida was once under water.  You see coral reefs, little fragments of fish, shells, all kinds of stuff, right.  I had some of those.  I saw a Walgreen's Pharmacy across the street, I went over there and I got some food coloring, and I had a magnetic stirrer that was battery operated, and I did things where I mixed the colors.  I said, "We're going to paint a picture, but I only have three colors.  I have red, I have yellow, I have red, I have blue.  Okay, what colors would I need to paint a picture of outside?"  You know, and I actually mixed the colors with the kids with that, and then I'd--you know.  Because I was supposed to talk about geology, astronomy and chemistry to the middle-schoolers.  And--but I tied it all in.  I--"Who was the--what's a fossil?"  You know.  And somebody said, you know, "It's a rock."  Somebody else said, "It's a rock that shows something was once alive."  And I said, "Okay."  And I got the youngest kids, and I poured the bag of rocks out on the table.  And I got anybody under the age of ten.  I counted I had enough rocks.  I had about thirty rocks.  And so I said, "Each one of you come up here and get a rock and look at it, and I want you to show me if you can see an impression or something that looks like that once alive," you know.  And the kids were so cute.  The three year olds, they're holding the rocks up their ears, and they're doing--it was one of the cutest sights I could ever imagine.  And for the main part they were right.  And sometimes they had a piece of concrete, you know.  But there was that, and I did some other things, and, and it was a great, growing experience for me.  And at the end of that, and I noticed this pattern.  An hour-and-a-half later, I was totally exhausted.  I needed to rest before I could carry the stuff back out to my car, because to be--to come from nowhere and to create and to look at each child--but that's what part of the professional training I've gotten, I don't just give the same speech no matter who's the audience.  I'm looking to see if a person who's listening to me is getting it or not.  And if they don't, I need to find another way to explain it, you know.  And sometimes that explanation comes from someplace that's certainly outside of me.  It's supernatural.  You know, and it's that I've really have the will to share myself fully and engage students, and have them be interested, and see themselves for who they can be, and to start a fire or ignite something that would create a dream in them, you know.  So, that's who I am as a still learning educator, but I've just recently in the last year or two or three began this, call myself educator too.
Story_ID: 27140
Speaker 1: With all of this experience in the public schools now, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community now?
Speaker 2: Well, one of my biggest concerns for our community is that, although we're at an age with the technology that we have, where--I'll start with something that's somewhat benign, and that is, standing in front in front of a microwave oven that's making your popcorn going, "come on, come on, come on," okay, so we're impatient.  We have become a society that wants everything instantly.  And the child who sees the technology and wants everything instantly, wants success instantly, too.  And there're things that you have to work on.  And would you say that, you know--I'll pick a Miami [Heat] athlete, who many people would know right now, and that's LeBron James.  So do you think LeBron James shot a basketball better his tenth time he did it, or his ten millionth time he shot a basketball?  And I don't if he can even get up to that number, but it, you know, goes back to something my father told me.  He said, "All things being equal, you are going to--" and I said basketball for a reason, because there was a time when I couldn't shoot a free throw or a layup.  And he says, "Just you've never done it before.  But who do you think is going to have a better chance of hitting that free throw?  The kid who is shooting his tenth time or ten thousandth?"  And he used to say, "Repetition is the mother of skill."  You know, so he combined a couple of things that I'd heard, you know.  You know, "Necessity is the mother of invention, repetition--."  "Repetition is the mother of skill."  So when you can do it in your sleep, then you can really do it.  You know, because practice does make as close to perfect as we're going to get.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  But it was, it was knowing.  And the big challenge to me, as a freshman at Columbia feeling like I was over my head.  That was what I--when I learnt [sic] the amount of work it takes to reach a true level of excellence, not just for your class or your school or your community in your area, but that can stand up to any competition.  Because while some kids are on their Facebook page, or Tweeting, or Googling this, or watching the 'Housewives of Beverly Hills,' or whatever they're watching, some other child someplace is reading a book, or studying, or using the Internet for, to do science lessons, or reading, or shooting free throws, or at batting practice, or working on running faster, or catching, or getting trained someplace, or lifting weights, or swimming, or whatever it is that their dream is.  And, and since I mentioned athletics, I'd just like to say that in my case, the fact that I was interested in athletics and developed my body, really helped me achieve my goal of becoming a scientist.  Because it was my--the Ivy League universities and the other great schools in America and across the world, could have all the straight "A" students they want.  They're looking for students who are interested in their community, students who are well-rounded, who are going to add something to the study body.  In my case, I mean, they saw that I played trumpet, and I played sports, and I ran really fast.  And I was a good student.  And, you know, I talked to the dean of admissions at Columbia [University, New York, New York], because I later became a residence counselor there, and I joked with him that, maybe I'd only got accepted because of my athletic skills.  He said, "I would never, ever accept a student who wasn't academically capable of being successful at Columbia University."  And that's how the good admission directors are.  They want you to succeed.  They want you to be successful, but they want a well-rounded student body.
Story_ID: 27141
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you'd do differently if you could?  Would you recommend--?
Speaker 2: No.  I-- I would have started playing tennis younger.  I started playing tennis when I was twenty-one, and I actually became a tennis instructor and a tennis coach.  And I've had a bunch of kids to get college scholarships for tennis.  And, and (coughs)--excuse me.  I'd like a sip of water.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Me, me, me, me.  (clears throat).  I think the frog is gone, maybe not.  So you had just asked me if there was--
Speaker 1: Anything major that you would do differently.
Speaker 2: Majorly that I would do different, differently.  I would have taken my studies seriously a lot sooner than I did, because it seemed that I was always playing catch-up, especially in the subject areas that required one skill building on another.  Another thing that I would have done is, I would have begun to play certain sports, like tennis, younger.  I began to play tennis when I was twenty-one, and I coached tennis, and taught tennis at some of the local universities, and even at some of the private tennis clubs here.  And I think I've--my skill set would have maybe taken me to a point where I could have excelled as a professional tennis player had I started earlier.  And I would have taken my golf more seriously, even though at one point I had a seven handicap.  Avid golfer, but I didn't make the time for the game that I needed to really get to a real level of excellent, but I could beat most everybody I knew with a seven handicap.  But as far as other regrets or concerns, you know, I have--my son is in medical school, and in some regards, I wish I'd maybe become a father younger, except I maybe had the physical attributes and stamina at that point, but I didn't have the wisdom that it would take to raise a child the way I was able to raise my son, and I'm still learning.
Story_ID: 27142
Speaker 1: Now, do you-- do you just have the one son.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I actually have a stepson who I raised, too.  I've not been in communication with since he and--and his mom and I got divorced.  But he lived in my household for fourteen years, and he does not contact me.  I have no communication with him.  And we didn't have a disagreement or falling out or anything.  We used to go to golfing games and [Miami] Heat games together, and we were buddies even after he moved out.
Speaker 1: Relationships are complicated.
Speaker 2: Well, he was living with my ex-wife's mom, so who knows what the propaganda over there is about me.  And it just may have been that, you know, I don't know.
Speaker 1: No, we can't--it's hard to speculate.
Speaker 2: I mean, it's--
Speaker 1: But you were married for twenty-years, right?
Speaker 2: Twenty-one years.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yep.  And he lived in my household for fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: So he was seven when we got married.  Yeah, I raised him.
Speaker 1: And your sister is still--what's (unclear)?
Speaker 2: My sister [Bernadette] had been a professional educator and counselor in the Dade County Public School System [Florida], and she retired about three years ago.  And she lives probably about twenty minutes away from me, and we're in constant contact.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before your parents passed, were they--did they really understand now--it sounds like with your father [Samuel James Evan Forde] (simultaneously) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, my dad ate it up.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My dad loved the fact that his, his son was a scientist.  And I went from not appreciating him--it's amazing.  By the time I got my Master's degree, my dad had, somehow, become a genius (laughs), and one of my best buddies.  We played golf together, we went bowling together, we went fishing together.  He came to my house when my mom [Margaret Carey Forde] got on his nerves.  And absolutely, you know, when I lost him I lost a friend.  And part of my brain trust.  And--actually, I lost him, and I have a cousin who was ten years younger than--thirteen years younger than my dad and thirteen years older than me, who was a police officer in New York City [New York] while I was in college in graduate school.  And he was a big brother slash father figure to me.  And I lost him and my dad within about nine months of each other.  So it was devastating to me.  The two closest men to me in the world, I lost them both in such a short time.  So, you know, one of the things my dad said to me before he got too ill to communicate well was that, he said, "Your"--, and he called me "Flash," and it was a high school newspaper thing, just an intramural game where I scored three touchdowns prior to me being on the football team, and the person who wrote the little article about the, you know, the "Interact and Key Club", something--he referred to me as "Flash Forde" in the article.  And my dad liked calling me Flash because it was pretty amazing to him, he said, to see me blossom athletically from a kid who was so unlikely to become any kind of (laughs)--any kind of sportsman at all, you know.  And so he enjoyed calling me Flash.  And he said--and I said, "Well, Dad, that kind of emb--"  He said, "Well, would you prefer I call you Dopey or something?  I mean, it's not such a bad nickname.  Think about it, you know."  So, to his dying day he called me Flash.
Story_ID: 27143
Speaker 1: So, in talking about my dad and the influence he was in my life, and how he and I became really great buddies, but I could always depend on him to tell me the truth.  And he told me that I should always keep one friend.  He said, "And it might be a friend that I wouldn't see all the time, but who I can depend on to tell me about my butt."  I said, "Like what?"  He said, "You can't do that, that's crazy, that's mean, that's stupid, that's wrong.  Somebody who'll tell you the truth.  In case you ever get too high and mighty, they'll bring you back to earth, you know."  But I re-- I recall being at a gathering, and I'm the toast of the town, I'm, you know, the oceanographer, been featured in these magazines, and somebody said, one of his buddies, one of his fraternity brothers--and I later joined Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, graduate chapter here [University of Miami, Miami, Florida]--said, "Wow, your son, you know, got the tennis, he's got the this and the that and the blah blah blah.  Your son is a man of many talents."  And he smiled, and when the guy left, my dad said, "Yes.  M-I-N-I.  Why don't you get one thing and become really good at it?"  (laughs).  But that was that.  And, you know, I mentioned that my dad had said that, Samuel James Evan Forde, and he named me Evan Bernard.  He said, "Had I known you were going to turn out so well, I would have given you my whole name."  But on that same trip, he kept telling me when I got the master's degree and he came up for the graduation, he said, "I'm really proud of you."  And I said, "I get that you're proud.  Thank you."  He kept repeating it all day.  He said, "No, you don't understand.  When you were in about the fourth grade, your mom [Margaret Carey Forde] and I stayed up talking 'til really late at night, I don't know if it was one or two, and we decided that if we could just get you to graduate from high school, maybe even middle school, we'd get on our knees and thank the Lord."  And I said, "Wow, it was that bad."  Said, "Yeah.  We were really concerned about you."  So that is--so I tell friends that have teenage boys, I say, "You know, the number one question you ought to be asking yourself, instead of just, you know, allow yourself to be frustrated and all that and just say to yourself, 'My boy is all right, I know, I'm raising him the best I can.  I just need to find out who's giving my son stupid pills.'"  (laughs).  'Cause that's how many teenage boys act for a while.  And then maybe the light comes on.

Speaker 1: Is there anything we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Let me think.  So, science education, really important for this nation, especially for minority kids, especially for African American kids, I believe.  And so when I say that, I select schools where I can make the best difference or the biggest difference.  I would say, if I drew a map of the schools I've been to in Miami Dade County [Florida], the vast majority of them would be in inner-city areas where I think I can make the biggest difference.  Because I get several hundred invitations a year to speak, even locally.  And I just can't do it.  So my time is precious.  And another thing I do is, I use annual leave, even though my agency allows me to go out and speak as, you know, as part of outreach.  I take leave to do it.  And, because I don't want there to be any conflicts, I don't want there to be any question.  I'm doing it because I want to, and when I want to, and in as much time as I want to, and I don't want to have to think that somebody is looking over my shoulder.  So, over the years, maybe not the last two or three years, but generally over the past twenty years or so, I probably volunteer three hundred to five hundred hours a year in the community.
Speaker 1: I think the community appreciates it.  About 2009, there was a--
Speaker 2: Evan Forde Day?
Speaker 1: Day, right.  Right.
Speaker 2: That's pretty cool.
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) (unclear) population, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's pretty cool.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, they gave me the key to the city, but it didn't fit anything (laughs).
Story_ID: 27145
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last question is about legacy and--.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a man who really cared about each and every child in America receiving a first-class education, and who devoted my talents and abilities in a tangible way to make that happen.  So, there are biographies about me in hundreds of textbooks by this point.  There have been museum exhibits in at least four museums that I know of.  If I drop from sight right now, in some way I would have some sort of role, especially in African American history.  I'd like to rise just above it being, that what I've done is significant, you know, as an African American.  However, at that point, you know, my skills as a scientist, especially with--my having changed fields at least three times by now.  I'm not able presently to be at the very top of my field as a scientist, not yet, but the--which would probably bring you to the final question about the research that I'm doing now.  But, but yeah, I want to be known as a person who made a difference for others.  That would allow me to rest in eternity in peace.
Story_ID: 27146
Speaker 1: Now, I get that you want me to ask you about the research you're doing now (laughs).
Speaker 2: Well, you can.
Speaker 1: Yes, I think we should.
Speaker 2: Because if you're interested.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: So, what are you doing--?
Speaker 2: So, going back to the laboratory director who hired me out of the Ocean Chemistry Division with the Satellite Remote Sensing.  So, for years I was looking at satellite data, and looking at equations, some of which I was putting into the programs I was using to make the plots and not understanding the science.  And I got a rudimentary understanding of hurricane science or what's basically called tropical meteorology.  So, what happened is, that director retired--I'm going to say six years ago.  But I was in a seminar where somebody had discovered that there are dust storms in the Saharan Desert that are so large, that they travel across the entire Atlantic Ocean, and make it to North America.  And that the impact of these dust storms on hurricanes is that, a hurricane that really becomes entrenched in one of them, is usually gonna weaken, sometimes die all together.  And so, but we have only been able to monitor these dust storms called Saharan air layers since about 2003 in near real time.  And realizing that some of the earlier work that I'd done with the satellites, used the parameter that's collected from the satellites called, Integrated Atmospheric Water Vapor.  It was just one of dozens of terms in these equations.  But I thought, water vapor atmosphere.  If there's a dust storm present and it's sampled by a satellite, dust is dry; it's really gonna make the amount of water vapor present a lot less.  Because, see, the relative humidity of the ocean out in the area where hurricanes usually form, is 80 to 90 percent.  But in one of these dust storms, the relative humidity is as little as 12, 14 percent.  That's a big difference.  See, humidity is one of the constants that you need for a hurricane to form and develop and to strengthen, because that's where the transfer of the heat energy takes place. So, I said, "If it's possible for me to see this with satellites, we've been collecting this type of satellite data ever since 1987 reliably.  I used it in this other study.  I wonder what it would look like, this--one of these Saharan air layers."  So I looked at one that I knew had just happened a couple weeks ago, and then I went back to 1987 and began to look through the satellite passes.  So we got two, three satellites, two passes a day, a hundred eighty days, and the hurricane season; well, June through November, right?  Looking at every pass of every satellite for every year since 1987 to see if the hurricanes that we experience, the ones that weaken suddenly, the ones that were weak and then all of a sudden got stronger.  If Hurricane Andrew [1992 hurricane], which was so weak for so long, was in one of these Saharan air layers, and then it strengthened so quickly because it got out.  And that was the first storm I looked at.  And that's the truth for Hurricane Andrew.  It was a small category one, just making it because it was in a Saharan air layer, and when it got out of the Saharan air layer, got into slightly warmer water, less wind shear, it went from a category one to category five in a matter of less than two days.  And the forecasters missed it because they didn't understand it was in this really dry air.
Story_ID: 27147
Speaker 1: So, by going back and cataloging every hurricane since 1987 that was in one of these, or near one of these Saharan air layers, would help to make our intensity forecast models better, better because one of the primary things is the humidity in a hurricane.  But we didn't have the ability until I had this idea to look back in the past.  We could only look from 2003 forward.  And I've allowed us to go back to 1987.
Speaker 2: You know, there's an atmospheric scientist at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], who's sending students over to Senegal to measure the particulate--well, examine the particulate matter in those (aromatic?) storms.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: They blow, you know, westward across the Atlantic--
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  And the dust is one thing.  And we have satellites that can measure the dust.  But dust is not a good proxy or replacement for the Saharan air layers once they get several hundred kilometers off the coast of Africa, because, maybe you've heard that wind shear is negative for hurricanes.  If you're a hurricane, you want the wind five miles up to be the same speed and the same direction as the wind on the surface.  But if you get wind shear, maybe it's twenty miles per hour of up here, and all--it would blow the top right off of an hurricane, or cause it to be like a spinning top, and instead of being upright, it's tilted.  And that doesn't allow it to strengthen.  Also, the--there's a thermal inversion, so it's warm right near the surface of the Earth.  It gets cooler as you go up in the atmosphere, but the layer where the dust is, it gets hotter here.  So the thermal convection from the ocean surface, the transfer of heat energy doesn't work as well if have one of these layers.  So it's dry, it inhibits the convection, and there's the localized wind shear, which also inhibits the strengthening of hurricanes.  So it's sort of-- I'm able to look back in the past at what happened before we even knew to look for these features.  But it's a massive job.  And if the research would go a lot better if I had four or five graduate students working for me.  Anybody want to volunteer?  Come on.
Speaker 2: I think Howard might have some that are willing to work with you.  That's why (simultaneous) (I raised that?).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Which is very labor-intensive, yeah.
