Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Also born in Athens, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In about 1905.
Story_ID: 13534
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father's [William McKinley Stovall] side of the family.  How far back can you trace that side of the family and what do you know about them?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  Only to his, to his father.  I didn't know him very well because he died before I was born.
Speaker 1: Your father, your grandfather?
Speaker 2: No, my father's father.  My grandfather on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were any stories passed down about where the family came from or what they were doing during slavery or the Civil War, or Reconstruction or any of that?
Speaker 2: Not on my father's side, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  What did they do for a living, do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, my father was first a, a cook for the University of Georgia in Athens.  And then in 1941 he moved to first New Haven [Connecticut], stayed there for a few weeks and then to Springfield, Massachusetts looking for work.  And he found work in Springfield at the Westinghouse Corporation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did his father do?  I mean your grandfather.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I imagine he was a farmer of a sort.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there were woodworkers in the family.  My uncles were woodworkers.
Story_ID: 13535
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother's [Irene Brightwell] side of the family.  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Only to my great-grandmother, my mother's mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, and are there any stories about that side of the family that have passed down about what the family was doing, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, not passed to me because I was never particularly interested.  I was a, grew up as a now kind of person.  I was really only interested in what I was doing at the moment.
Speaker 1: That's not atypical of what we have today.  (laughs)  That's why we--these oral histories are important, because people don't--but, so other people in your family know some of that history you're saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  My sister does.
Speaker 1: So there's no significant stories that you can remember or recall, or anything that you would think that would be interesting from the history of the family.
Speaker 2: No.  There's a mistake on my birth certificate, which gives my father's [William McKinley Stovall] name as, as my name.  But that was, you know, was typical at that particular time.  I was born in 1937 so stories of my grandmother when I was a kid, but nothing really that I remember or that was passed down.
Story_ID: 13536
Speaker 1: Did you ever visit Athens, Georgia with your parents?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: So they really didn't keep in touch with anything going on--.
Speaker 2: No, they did but, but my father [William McKinley Stovall] said that he didn't go to so much trouble to leave Georgia in order to have me go back to be jailed or killed.  He had bad thoughts and bad memories of, you know, he could just imagine, you know, the way that I was raised, you know, there was no way I was going to get off the sidewalk and go and walk into the gutter, you know, because another person of a different color was walking past.  You know, that kind of thing.  And he couldn't even imagine what my response would be or he could imagine what my response would be but he couldn't imagine what the response, you know, certain Southern white people would be to someone like myself even at a very early age.
Speaker 1: Now that's significant, I mean what you just said there is significant historically, you know, it speaks to the reason he left.  I mean, not that its--you know, I think sometimes you think these things are self-evident, you know, why would he want to get out of Georgia, you know, but the details are important.  Did he have a personal story of, of, of why he--.
Speaker 2: No.  He didn't, he didn't complain.  He, his only statement was that he was too young for the first World War and too old for the second.  He definitely--the one statement that he made which I now realize was his greatest gift to me was he didn't want his sons to grow up in the South.  And so there was, I have a sister who is three years older and, then myself, and then two brothers two years in stair steps.  So after my youngest brother was born, we moved.  He was born in forty-one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And went north.
Speaker 1: So, so, you were actually born in Athens but moved--.
Speaker 2: I was born in Athens but we--but grew up in Springfield, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: What was your father's personality like, and what kind of person was he?
Speaker 2: Well, he was very quiet.  He worked, he never missed a day's work.  The significant memory that I have of him is that he, along with packing his lunch, he also packed a half pint of liquor every single day.  And then he would have it at breaks and at lunch, and so on.  And I only actually seen him drunk once or twice, but it might have been several times.  And you always knew when he was getting close to having had too much because he would go into the kitchen and start making cornbread.  And he made cornbread that was the worst stuff you've ever tasted in your life with just water, and then we--.
Speaker 1: I think we call it hot water cornbread.  I've heard of it.
Speaker 2: It could be.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But everyone would have to try some and I wouldn't.  I never had to because my mother [Irene Brightwell] protected me from(laughs), you know, from all that.  So, she would always have something else for me to do.
Story_ID: 13537
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother [Irene Brightwell].  What kind of personality did your mother have or what did she do?  Did, did she work as well or did she?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she first worked for the Springfield Armory right after we left Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Should we keep going?
Speaker 1: Pause a second here.  Pushing your seat a little back further will be better.
Speaker 2: Try pushing it back with your hand.
Speaker 1: Alright, we were talking about your mother and what she did for a living.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was a, she was a statistic actually.  She was one of the people who was recruited to work and she worked in the Springfield Armory [Springfield, Massachusetts] during the, oh the, I guess the forties [1940s] through early fifties [1950s].
Speaker 1: War related?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she worked past the making of, you know, huge quantities of munitions.  And then when the soldiers started--when the male soldiers started coming back home, the women were laid off, and so she became like a housekeeper.
Story_ID: 13538
Speaker 1: Did either of your parents get much education in Georgia?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [William McKinley Stovall]--I don't know if he made it as far as high school.  I know my mother [Irene Brightwell] did.  But they had a sense of the value of education, you know, which they passed on to me.  And when I say that my mother protected me from those kinds of things, which was the levels of alcohol consumption, you know, throughout the extended family.  But she also protected me from, oh just the general lack of understanding of what a higher calling would be so to speak, you know, like the zeal for education which I had, you know.  So she was a very interesting, strong woman, you know.  It was definitely a matriarchal family, and so I would say that she was immensely unusual, you know, woman.  She was the kind of woman that Fanny [Lou] Hamer [civil rights activist] was.  You know, that kind of person who had a vision of what she wanted her children to be.  Unfortunately, one brother died at the age of, I think he was thirty-three, my--the brother who is two years younger than I am from alcohol-related--and my other brother has never really had a whole job, a full-time job.  He drinks.  My sister, she's the only one I'm actually in touch with.  She's just a wonderful person, and so from the age of--well from my first age of recognizing the powers that exist in families, I realized that I was the oldest son that everyone had been expecting.  And so she just fell into it also.  And so I became the oldest son and what I was given was this, you know, access to books and music, and you know and all that, it was open to the whole family but I was the one who really wanted it.  So when I say that my father couldn't imagine what, what my reactions would be dealing with the South, you know, he knew that this was--I guess I would have been something to deal with.  It's hard for me to imagine because I don't have an aggressive personality, but what I do have is a sense of right that no matter what goes down, right is right as far as I'm concerned, if it kills me.
Story_ID: 13539
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  See, my mother [Irene Brightwell] had been married once before as a young person, very young, and my father [William McKinley Stovall] came after that.  So there are actually--I have two half sisters who periodically I hear from them but not very often, and they weren't a part of my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there like quite a few people in the family who (unclear) in Georgia, or, or--was your father and your mother the only representatives of their families that went north to Massachusetts?
Speaker 2: No.  After my father went, he then had--he brought two brothers along with him, or they came soon after.  And so they lived with us and he cared for them until they got jobs and were on their feet so to speak.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know,  he just had a vision about--as I said, he was a quiet man.  Very, very hard working and he had, you know, had a strength that I didn't understand until we were having a college discussion at one point and I said that--well the only thing I really wished was that my father would, would have put something away for me so that I could have, you know, attended college without having to had to have a full-time job.  Just to have made life a little bit easier.  And then after I told that, that--you know, made that statement several times, I realized the gift that he had given me was at great expense to himself because he would have been fine staying in the South.  He was a respected cook.  And as part of, you know, being part of the university [University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia], you know, he was protected.  But he had that idea that he didn't want his sons to grow up in the South.  And, of course, in those days people thought about the sons first and then you know the daughters benefitted from whatever the family could benefit from.
Speaker 1: So his move did more to improve your lives actually than, than his own then in that sense.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 13540
Speaker 1: And so, what you're saying is your mother [Irene Brightwell] and I guess other family members saw you as a special person who is focused on the ideals that she had articulated to the whole of you, but you're the one who focused on it. Tell us about growing up.  What were some of the sights and sounds, and smells of growing up when you were little.  What did your community look like, and what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, it was kind of a usual, normal New England community.  The first house that I remember was several blocks from the elementary school [Hooker School] where I went.  I remember coming home for lunch, because that's what you did during those days.  Always with several kids, you know.  My mother made bread two or three times a day so I was constantly saying "Why can't we have sliced white bread like they sell in the stores?"  And these little kids who were coming home with me would say, "Well, I'll give you my bread if you left me come home with you for lunch."  They didn't know what, what true home cooking was.  My mother was a sensational cook.  So I grew up with a, you know, with an attitude of, you know, adventure and exploration, and wanted to experience other things.  And while I valued the home, you know, because it was a wonderful surrounding, I made things, you know, I made little items of furniture and that kind of thing, so I never had to do household chores, you know, I didn't--I don't think I washed dishes until I had an apartment of my own.  Because--and after two of my siblings who said, "Well, why doesn't he have to wash dishes?"  You know, after supper or clear the table.  And my mother said, "Well, because look what he just made for me."  And I would have made something that, that in the kitchen, that she needed or repaired the curtain stretcher.  Remember the curtain stretchers that our parents all had?  You know, and set them up.  And, you know, and all the neighbors, and all the family members who needed something done, you know, would find me to get it done for them because I had what they used to say was--well, "The boy has good hands," you know.  So there was hardly anything that I couldn't do.  But I was--I think that I was led to that because, you know, first of all I had the, you know, whatever the gene pool, you know, delivers in terms of families.  I had that, that ability, you know, with my hands.  And I had that sense that, from my, from my mother's notion that I should be constantly busy.  And from--you asked about my grandmother, her daily admonition was "Idle hands are the devil's workshop."  So, I wasn't going to have anyone possess my body, I was going to be, you know, totally busy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you make your own toys and things like that?  Or did you get time for--.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I had plenty of time to play.  But I don't remember, I don't remember play so much.  I do remember there was a giant old tree that we had hung ropes from, and we went through our Tarzan stage, you know.  So we swung through the trees, and then we had gunfights from the OK Corral, you know, with wooden pistols and stuff like that, you know.  So, I had a lot of fun growing up.  I consider it like a normal childhood but there would be a certain time that I would, you know, just sort of, you know, be bored by that and I would go in and read a book, or listen to some music, or whatever.
Story_ID: 13541
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had access to books and music--you said your mother [Irene Brightwell] made sure you had access to these things.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Always.  And always art supplies.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That sounds wonderful.
Speaker 2: Yeah, wasn't bad.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you--well what kind of art did you experiment with when you were young?
Speaker 2: Well, I had drawing lessons at an early age from a guy who lived up the street, who taught me to draw horses.  And then, of course, then I was encouraged always to write and, you know, write your thoughts, write your ideas and so on.  And so I wrote stories, you know.  Probably the most significant story that I wrote that was sort of read to the whole school because it was so funny was the dog who came after me after I had been sent to the store for a loaf of bread.  And everybody knew about this dog, and if you walked by that house, chances are the dog would chase you.  And, so I had this loaf of bread and I was carrying it--I'm not sure why I wasn't carrying it in a bag.  I probably was, but according to my story, the dog came after me.  He missed me the first time on the way to the store because I out-ran him.  And on the way back, I guess he was poised to get me and so he just came within a hair's breadth of getting me.  The bread went up in the air and then the slices came down like rain, you know.  And as I described the story, I'm sure the slices multiplied and multiplied, so, you know, the kids and the teachers all really loved that, you know, because they loved description.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But does the dog get you? (laughs)
Speaker 2: No, the dog didn't get me.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Story_ID: 13542
Speaker 1: My father [William McKinley Stovall] used to tell stories, he told stories at night.  And so I think the, the significant memory of him that I would have of his telling stories, you know.  And the subject didn't matter but it was that he was a descriptive storyteller.  Even though he was a quiet man, his stories were mesmerizing.
Speaker 2: Were his stories about the South?
Speaker 1: Well, we used to love ghost stories and he could come up with ghost stories, I mean that--you know like, "Hear that?  I hear it."  And my mother would say, "Willy, you don't hear anything."  He says, "Nah, I hear it, I hear it."  And he would call her "'Rene," you know.  "'Rene, if you keep saying that, nobody's going to believe me."  And so she wouldn't say anything else and he would--I didn't realize that she was part of the act, you know. (laughs)
Speaker 2: They, they'd tell ghost stories.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Can you remember any of them and where they took place?
Speaker 1: Well, they were, you know, walking, walking past a cemetery and being lured into it.  Of course, there's always the ghosts on the second or third floor in every house, and he wants to take possession of the house.  And there something always about chains jangling.  So I don't remember them specifically but I think it must have been from that, that I learned to, you know, like take a story, because you know, when my son was born he used to love to hear stories.  That's how we would entertain and we, in the car, so instead of reading to him I would just make up stories and tell him.
Speaker 2: Do think pretty much that's what, what your father was doing making them up on the spot, or was he--.
Speaker 1: I think so, yeah.
Speaker 2: Because I was wondering if he was passing them down or making them up.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure he was passing them down because, you know, storytelling--that whole, the whole notion of a narrative--see, I never really thought of myself in terms of--I guess its kind of a--maybe a selfishness.  Certainly, a tunnel vision occurrence where I really only focus on what I'm doing at that particular time.  And I used to say that to my interns, that I could sit in the middle of Connecticut Avenue and continue drawing, you know, with traffic going around me.  Because if you're serious about what you're doing, there's no distraction powerful enough to stop you from making your art.  And so I think that the--I had a sense of, you know, how to perform what I needed to do in order to be an artist.  So the stories would have come from that, which is to just pluck a story out of, you know, mid-air and then build on it, you know.  All you need is a germ of an idea.  And if you have a good vocabulary and you know enough words, you can do anything with ideas.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did your father's stories have reoccurring characters?
Speaker 1: That I don't remember specifically.  I know mine did.  So I started out with that last statement to say that there is a great tradition of the narrative, you know, that was one of the appeals that Jacob Lawrence and I had together.  That we used to love to tell each other stories.  We often told stories in the form of jokes.  But and Jacob was a narrative painter.  So I think it was that whole sense of the narrative that kind of guided me through life.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think a lot of Black people can remember folks in the neighborhood or their relatives sitting on a porch in the summertime telling stories, some from down South, some they make up, you know.  Kid will sit and listen.  We have a great tradition of that.
Story_ID: 13543
Speaker 1: Tell me about school, now.  Where'd you go to school in Springfield [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the elementary school was Hooker School, which was just a few blocks from where I lived.  And then junior high school was Chestnut Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the high school was Springfield Technical [Community College].  It was at Chestnut Junior High that I first realized what I really wanted to do was to make art.  And there wasn't an art high school in Springfield, of course.  So the closest thing to it was Springfield Technical that had two art teachers, and the one, Helen Norgard [ph.] who became my teacher of choice, not that you could choose your own teacher, but I somehow ended up with her classes, probably by her design.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were drawing and creating art even in elementary school, but you didn't really think that there was a career in it until high school.
Speaker 2: No.  I knew that that's what I wanted to do but I had no idea what a career was.  I just knew that what I was happiest doing was making things.  You know, whether I was making things on paper or drawing or writing, or drawing, you know, whatever.  I just knew that I was happiest when I was in my own element expressing whatever I wanted to express.  I mean, I didn't think about it as expression at those particular years.
Story_ID: 13544
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of a student were you in high school?  Were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I remember one of my--the other high school art teacher gave me a B on something and I insisted that my mother [Irene Brightwell] come back to school with me to--I mean I was so upset about it, my mother came back to school with me and we protested.  Of course, I don't think the grade changed but I just thought it was totally unfair.  But this particular teacher, she had decided since I was such a favorite of Helen Norgard that I needed to have some level of comeuppance.  And I probably did, I was--I could be, you know, difficult, haughty, and because I knew a lot of words, you know.  I could say things that could really infuriate teachers.  It only happened a couple of times in my career, you know, because I'm generally, as they say, I try to be non-combative, non-confrontational and so on.  But it was in college that a teacher said to me--well, she said in general to the class something about the Italian Renaissance and a certain painter.  I don't remember specifically what it now, was now.  But I said, "Well, if I made add some information to what you've said according to, as according to Fusari, but according to" and I quoted, I don't know, three or four different authors who had done further research, that painting should be attributed to such and such.  And it was an arguable point, but I had more sources than she had.  So she went to the head of the department and she said that--because she argued with me in class, and I just kept giving her more facts of why that was the way that it was, you know that decision.  And when she got to Professor [James] Porter to complain, he said, "And who was the student, again?"  And she said, "Stovall," you know.  He said, "How many sources did you have?"  And she said, "Well, I just had my lecture."  He said then "Did he quote his sources?"  She said yes.  And he said, "And how many did he have?"  And she said "Four," and Professor Porter says, "And did he have the books with him?"  She said, "Yes, and he offered to show them to me."  He says, "Well, don't you know how to quit when you're, you know, when you're ahead?" (laughs)  And so, she just, she had a real problem with me from, you know--because there was no way I was ever going to back down, you know.  Because I knew I was right, you know.  When I found the first discrepancy then I went reading further, you know, to get to the bottom of whatever the problem was.  And it turned out that the--because I was taking German as a class and the German scholarship was much advanced over whatever source she had, which was an Italian source at that particular time.
Story_ID: 13545
Speaker 1: Let's go back to--I want to go back to Springfield [Massachusetts] for a minute.  What was the political atmosphere of Springfield in terms of black people and white people.  Was there a black community, a segregated community, or was it all-open, or what was it like in Springfield, Massachusetts?  That is the capital of Massachusetts, right, Springfield?
Speaker 2: No.  Boston, No, Worcester, is it Boston or Worcester?  I can't remember.  I should know.  The capital may be Worcester.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's either Worcester or Boston.  I'm just not sure.  It's more likely Boston, though.  Anyway, that's embarrassing not to know that.  The political climate racially is that Springfield was ten percent black.  But it was also not more than ten to fifteen percent almost everything else that you could think of.  There was the Italian neighborhood, the Irish neighborhood, the Portuguese and so on.  There was even an Asian community, it wasn't very large.  And there were frequent confrontations between the blacks and the Italians, and the Italians and the Irish, you know, whatever.  We had of course of predominance of Irish policemen.  Black people were generally service people.  Jewish people were the merchants and so on.  There was a whole neighborhood of Jewish people called Forest Park.
Story_ID: 13546
Speaker 1: But the high schools were centralized along State Street [Springfield, Massachusetts].  So there was the technical school, classical, commerce, the trade school was further out, and there was a Catholic school, which was just around the corner, and the whole city, that's where you went.  To those particular high schools.
Speaker 2: That's an interesting arrangement. I've never heard of that in any other town.  Where you have like a different high school focused on one vocational track or another, different, separate.
Speaker 1: Well, if you were going to go to college in liberal arts, you would go to the classical high school.  If you were going to, perhaps, skip college and go straight into business you would go to the commercial high school, called Commerce [High School].  If you were in the technical school, then pretty much you were headed to Rochester Institute of Technology [Rochester, New York] or Mass-MIT, Mass [Massachusetts] Institute of Technology [Boston, Massachusetts], or whatever.
Story_ID: 13547
Speaker 1: And the reason that there were two art teachers there [Springfield Technical Community College, Springfield, Massachusetts] I've never quite figured out.  But the one, Helen Norgard, my teacher, she was a gifted, wonderful woman who had a sense of what could happen with students.  And so she led us to a sense of, I guess, informed destiny, is the word I would use.  That, that we had the potential to be artists and intellectuals.  And it was fun.  You know, why not do it?  My other teacher, the one notable statement that I remember her making that "You can be anything, except a bump on a log!"  And, of course, she looked down on certain students because she was sure they were gonna be bumps on logs, you know.  But I think I was a bit too much personality for her because she should have really liked me, but she didn't.  I think it was because the other teacher liked me so much.
Story_ID: 13548
Speaker 1: Were there very many black teachers in the school system?
Speaker 2: No black teachers that I know of.  It's funny how things changed.  And changed in major cities.  You'd have to, it's exactly the reverse now.  You'd have to go some, you know, to find a white teacher in most public schools now.  And when you do find one, they're mostly young.  Because they want to contribute something.  As I was growing up the teachers that I saw were uniformly white.
Story_ID: 13549
Speaker 1: So when you were a senior in high school did you see yourself going to college right after graduation?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you graduated in what year?
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 1: 1957.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  From high school.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, did you have a college in mind?  Or did you have advice about college?
Speaker 2: No, I had a college in mind.  As a matter of fact, I had a scholarship to the Rhode Island School of Design [RISD, Providence, Rhode Island].  I was only there for about a semester and my father [William McKinley Stovall] became very ill.  He died at the age of  fifty-six.  So I went back home to help support the family for, I think, six years, before I could come back to college.  And at that particular time, everybody said who knew anything about what was happening in the world, is "Why go back to that art school when you could go to Washington [D.C.]?  That's where things are happening.  The world is about to change in Washington, because black people are protesting for their rights."  And that interested me.
Story_ID: 13550
Speaker 1: Now, what did you do during that six-year span [gap in his college years]?  Did you, what kind of work did you do?
Speaker 2: I worked in a supermarket.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I also worked briefly at a bookstore, and briefly unloading railroad cars.  That was all in addition to working.  I worked a lot because we needed a lot of money, because, my father's income, just suddenly, stopped.  The insurance company had really done a number, you know, as insurance companies had done back in those days.  And there was nothing.  In spite of the fact that he paid all his money for insurance, year after year after year, and suddenly the claim was ruled, he died of a heart attack, you know.  But there was something about his dying, and his coverage that didn't give us enough money.
Speaker 1: You know, just in the last five years there, studies have been conducted on insurance companies in the black community.  And a number of class-action lawsuits have been filed, you know.  Metropolitan Life [Insurance Company] had to settle a big one because they routinely cheated people out of their--.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: So it's just another hazard of being black in America, I guess.  Okay.  What insurance company was it?  Maybe we can get it on the record.
Speaker 2: You know I'm not going to remember the insurance company, but it was probably Metropolitan Life or something like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Metropolitan Life is the one that had the big class action suit that I remember.
Speaker 2: Because they operated in and around Springfield.  I think they were a Hartford [Connecticut] company.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So for six years you did that.  What else did you do for those six years?  Did you continue to do artwork?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had, I took evening classes at the George Walter Vincent Smith [Art] Museum [Springfield, Massachusetts].  And, as I say, I worked.  I worked seven days.  In the supermarket where I worked, that was always great fun.  Actually it was the supermarket where I worked when I was fifteen that I first learned to silkscreen.  And it stayed with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would you silkscreen the signs?
Speaker 2: Silkscreen the grocery signs.
Speaker 1: Did you mostly have that kind of work to do at the supermarket when you were there?
Speaker 2: No, I was stocking shelves, and whenever they needed signs made I would go and help their sign painter who was there doing it.  After a while I began to do it.
Speaker 1: So, six years is a long time.  I just wanted to get a feel for what was going on, those six years.  How was your social life those six years?
Speaker 2: Oh.  I had a girlfriend who I eventually ended up marrying at the age of, I guess I was twenty-three.  And it was one of the silliest things I've ever done, except that we produced a daughter who's a wonderful girl.  She came in 1960.  1960 she was born.  So it must have been 1959 that, that I was married, in 1956 or fifty-seven [1957] when I graduated from high school.
Story_ID: 13551
Speaker 1: During this six-year period, and I can't help but thinking, think that, with all the intellectual pursuits you were engaged in and all the things you were trying to do.  There are other mentors here, other people that were, you know, served in some kind of guide or inspiration.  Were there other people besides your art teacher at Springfield Tech [Springfield Technical Community College]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, there were--there were actually a number.  And they were, they were the people who actually, probably significantly began to inform my life.  In terms of what I would, you know, become.  This actually is the kind of question I was hoping to have the whole interview on.  There was the girl, Jane, who was very, very beautiful.  And she used to sit for me while I learned to paint, because, I was not in art school, but I wanted to continue.  And I was doing the George Walter Vincent Smith [Art] Museum [Springfield, Massachusetts] art classes.  Well, Jane used to come and sit for me.  Her, her faith in my ability--you know, because there's a transfer of energy between the artist and the model and then back to the artist again.  And if you're not getting positive feedback, you know, it's hard to, it's hard to complete that portrait in a way that makes sense.  And then there was the girl that I dated who I eventually married, who, you know, she was there in my studio.  And she was like my dad--she was very quiet; she never said anything.
Story_ID: 13552
Speaker 1: And, after we were married, I realized she had real opinions.  And her one single opinion was that I shouldn't pursue art school on a full-time basis, that I should get a job, a full-time job, and work, and go to school part time.  Because, after all, art wouldn't amount to much ever.  That's what my father always said.  She was amazing like that.  And, so we divorced after, actually we didn't divorce.  We separated after like, roughly, three years.  But by that time we had a daughter who I said, I committed, that I would take care of her.  The daughter, I would send childcare payments and that kind of thing.  But I couldn't live with her.  So we left.  By that time I had left Springfield [Massachusetts], and come to Washington [D.C].  And before the year was up, she decided she should go back home to her mother with the baby.  So I stayed, you know,  here in Washington [D.C].  Sent money for payments, and began to pursue a life there.  So her, recapitulating that, that I was never going to make it, as an artist.  She later said that she never would have divorced me if she'd known I was going to make any money.  I mean, she's a sweetheart, you know.  But my daughter who, now at the age of forty-two, is a judge in St. Louis [Missouri],  I mean, she's a--the one thing that my wife ever said to me after the separation was that I was the one who had given her, my daughter the sense that she could personally accomplish.  And, you know, so at the age of forty-two to become a judge is pretty significant.  Which means she has already finished law school, and you know, I'm trying to do that same thing.  My son is, is twenty now.  It's a big gap.  I never thought that I was particularly interested in having children, until one day she said, "I'm pregnant, and this is what I've been waiting for."  So, and I'm trying to give my son the same sense, you know, that sense that you can accomplish. And that accomplishment need, you know, there's a lot of fun that you can have while accomplishing.  And you get yourself in with a bunch of good friends who are forward-moving and good-spirited people, you know.  And you can, you can make a life.  But you need a sense of music, and a sense of poetry, and a sense of literature, and a sense of art and all that.  You know, to make a full life.
Story_ID: 13553
Speaker 1: There were a couple of friends who hung out at my studio, because that was another thing my mother [Irene Brightwell] did.  She made sure that, that I had a studio at a time that I really needed a studio.  And it was a room that was--I wrote a poem about it--suspended between the first and second floor.  We could only reach it from the back of the kitchen, the back stairs.  Or coming down from the third floor.  You know, there was a little winding, you know, it was a big house.  At that particular time houses in Springfield, Mass [Massachusetts]--you would have a house that was like five or six rooms on each floor.  And one was called the first floor, you know, right apartment or house; and then the second floor.  They weren't like duplexes here where houses split in half and you have all the levels.  (Clears throat)  You would only have the one level.  But through an agreement that she made with my uncle who owned the other half of the house, that I would have that particular room.  That would be my room, and that room became my studio.  So my friends were welcome to come night and day.  You know, they would come in quietly and we would hang out.  And we would listen to music, you know.  I had the, the biggest speaker around.  And so we played Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis, and the Modern Jazz Quartet, and Dave Brubeck [jazz musicians].  And, you know, it was a life.  And then I had my pictures on the walls, and put album covers on the ceiling, you know.  It was, it was great.  And then we would go on long walks, you know, and sometimes we'd play chess.  We'd play chess for sometimes two or three nights in a row without ever going to bed, you know, after we all finished our work at the various places where we worked.  And we'd play chess.  And I read also, well at a early age I started reading philosophy.  And so I continued reading philosophy.
Story_ID: 13554
Speaker 1: This was self-directed study.
Speaker 2: This is all self-directed study.  But I can't really say self-directed study because at a certain, certain point--I'm jumping around here but Helen Norgard, my high school art teacher, I was ill for a period of--I guess two or three months, with the whooping cough.  And, this was during my early years of high school [Springfield Technical Community College, Springfield, Massachusetts], and she brought to me the Metropolitan Book of the Opera.  Which I read several times cover-to-cover, and listened to opera music.  And she's also the one who after I came back one summer and said that I had discovered silk-screening, and that it's just the most magical thing going, and the next day she brought in a silkscreen kit, you know, that was mine.  You know, that she brought in.  And she gave it to me, and she says, "You can also use silkscreen to make art, and let's make some art!"  So she was, you know.  So, those, those are the kind of things that, like, if you ask self-directed study, I don't think anyone really ever totally directs themselves.  But you, you have these choices out there, and you make your choices.  And if you make the right choices, then that goes on to inform you of other choices that you could or should make.  I'm, I'm sure I've made some bad choices too, you know.
Speaker 1: Sounds like something appeared to be deep that you were willing to wade in and see how deep it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Uh, huh.
Speaker 1: That's good.  So are there any other mentors or people that pop up or people who gave you the germ of an idea or something in conversation.  I can imagine all these friends, and all this interaction is creating constant ideas.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  You know, to have people who like affirming your life, and really thinking that you're something, you know, at least a little special, then you want to not be irresponsible but at least come up to--that, well, there's two different kinds of people.  There the ones who can respect the fact that their friends think they're special, and then they try to make sure they deserve, you know, the treatment they got.  And there're the others who take advantage of that, you know.  And I was always the, you know, luckily the, for me the opposite, you know.  I wanted to make sure I deserved what I got.
Story_ID: 13555
Speaker 1: Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] - Now, you say you were advised that you may as well go to Howard and get a, you know, than go back to the Springfield [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well, I had, I had so many--I was back in Springfield supporting my family having left the Rhode Island School of Design [RISD, Providence, Rhode Island] where it was a miserable existence.  Well, the art school was fine, but Providence, and still is, I think one of the more prejudiced cities, you know, in the country.  To be a small northern city, you know, there's just so, it's so layered and sectionalized.  And I think the people there are just aggressively angry, you know, and it's--.
Speaker 1: You got Brown University there?
Speaker 2: That's where Brown University is, you know.  It's an angry--it's an angry place.  And I think Providence will have a real problem with my saying this, but - because the mayor of Providence [Walter H. Reynolds], at least up to a couple of years ago, would give any artist who came and established a studio downtown, you'd have free rent, you know.  There was, there was a lot of, there were a lot of perks that were given to the arts in order to, I think make Springfi--make Providence a friendlier place, certainly arts friendly.  I'm not sure how well he did, you know, but, but I left Providence gladly because of, a, I went back home to help support my family.  Because the place, where I lived, was a horrible place, it was where the family had one room.  You couldn't cook there.  So I had, I lived on graham crackers and peanut butter.  It wasn't, wasn't what I was accustomed to.  Uh, not that my family was wealthy, but my father was a, you know, factory employee and he worked every single day of his life.  So, you know, we had enough to sustain ourselves.
Speaker 1: Food on the table?
Speaker 2: Yeah. But it was the idea of going to a place and making a change that mattered.  And it's interesting that no one in my family, and certainly not even the extended friends and family.  None of us thought that [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was the hero, and the leader that he later became.  He developed, I could use the word morphed into, you know, what he, after a while, knew he should be or had to be.
Speaker 1: Did you know him?
Speaker 2: No, I never, never met him.  But I was curious because, you know, philosophy leads you.  I had already read the Bible, and, you know, Malcolm X was out there, and he was coming to Springfield [Massachusetts] making frequent visits and talks.  Martin Luther King was getting around the country, making, making his talks and people were hearing.  You know he was, sermons in churches and so on.  And there were other people who were talking.  A lot of people were talking during the fifties [1950s].  And when, when my son and I, and my wife, we watched some television show that has to do with the fifties [1950s], I think, 'American Dream,' [sic, 'American Dreams' television series] and he would be, he would have so many questions about the fifties [1950s].  I was trying to explain to him that the fifties [1950s] was that period where all of America realized that it could change.
Story_ID: 13556
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's a, and I wanted to be, I wanted to be part of that, you know. So in 1962 I left Springfield [Massachusetts], and came to Washington [D.C.].  And became immediately involved in the, SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] , all the political parties that were the parties interested in changing the world, so to speak.  They needed artists who could make posters, and I was willing, you know.  I was fast and, I was cheap cause they were free.  (Laughs) The guy who I worked for, you know, would let me use art or left-over materials or whatever, and sometimes I would silkscreen them.  But the point is that it was easy for me to realize a sense of worth and a sense of being, you know, like essential in the community.  And that was, you know, that was a good thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's something that artists during the days of protests, not that they're completely over with, can always make a contribution making placards, and signs, and flyers and contribute their art.  So you lent your hand to some of the efforts to change society?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  At one point I went back to Springfield because there were having a, they were finally having their big, big moment for a protest.  I went back to Springfield and made posters on the courthouse steps.  And never got home, because by the time I finished making the posters that they needed, it was time for me to get back to Washington for class.  (Laughs) I told my mother--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: To visit your mother and making signs--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Well, no, they, they wanted me to come back to Springfield to make the signs, so my mother didn't even know I was coming, you know.  I mean I told her after.
Speaker 2: So you were there and didn't even get chance to see her.
Speaker 1: No, didn't see her.
Story_ID: 13557
Speaker 1: You were using your art to help the [Civil Rights] Movement to change society?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And around SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and other organizations.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever go South with of the people that went South?
Speaker 2: No, no, I never, I--but, I think by the time, by that time my father's lessons had instilled, you know, were totally instilled in me that I didn't need to go South.  One of the things that, that we were doing, SNCC was, you know, the whole office would get locked up, you know, for protesting something (laughter), and I said, you know, once to Stokely [Carmichael, civil rights activist], "Man, you got to tell everybody that not everyone needs to go to the protest.  Someone needs to stay back and man the office and can tell us when someone's gonna be locked up or, you know, when everybody's gonna be locked up, you know, or just, just keep in touch."  And he says, "Well, man, nobody wants to stay back by themselves, you know."  So that was the deal.  That's why people didn't--cause if you've ever wondered why the protesters all got locked up, you know, with no information flow, that was the reason.
Speaker 1: If somebody stayed back, at least there'd be somebody to get them out, right?
Speaker 2: (simultaneous)  Right, get help, yeah.  Well, they would eventually let them use the telephone, and then they would call, you know, and then we'd start the process of getting them released and so on.
Speaker 1: So you worked with Stokely Carmichael and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and H. Rap Brown [civil rights activist], and my goodness, can't think of his name off hand.  It's terrible.  But I worked for those people and, you know, a lot of the people from various churches and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 13558
Speaker 1: Now, did you participate in the March on Washington in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: I went.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you make any signs for it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  In terms of participation, you know, I felt as if I was outside of, you know, that, you know, because I was fine myself.  You know, I, I'd actually seldom ever been denied anything.  So I didn't have a personal stake, you know, in the protest.  And I think that's why it was a good thing for people like myself to be involved in the protest because I realized a need that people would have for advocates and for greater access.  So, so you didn't have to necessarily need, (unclear) I imagined myself with the same attitude as say, someone like [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], you know, who could really speak well, who could talk the police out of throwing him in jail, you know, which he did lots.  So I saw myself as, as a person who was there observing what was going on and then my contribution was to be ready, willing and able to make those signs for them.  So that's what I did.
Story_ID: 13559
Speaker 1: What other aspects of the so--of life at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], you know, made an impression on you?
Speaker 2: The social life made a real impression on me, you know.  As a matter of fact, all of the, I mean Howard University was like the, the center of beautiful black women and they all saw me as a, as a wonderful brother, but none of them were particularly interested in me except one.  And she turned out to be mean as a snake.  So I didn't go there, you know, I didn't go that way, you know.  The social life at Howard was probably a lot more involving than any experience that I'd ever known, and I spent a good deal of time avoiding it, the late-night parties and, you know, and the all-day parties and all that.  The part of Howard that I liked best was getting in the art seminar or one of the art rooms and sitting down and having a discussion, you know, about whatever it was that we were studying or what somebody was painting or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and who were some of the bright people that you met at Howard that really had some good discussion?
Speaker 2: Well, Mary Lovelace [O'Neal] is one, who is in California now, is a very good painter.  And Franklin White, who was an educator.  He's in Venezuela now painting.  Lloyd McNeill [artist and composer] who was at--or not Lloyd McNeil, I'm sorry, goodness, I can't think now.  Toby Benjamin came after.  Mary Lovelace, Starmanda Bullock [artist and educator] who was Head of Department for a while.  It's hard to think of all the names.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so what were some of the highlights of your course of study at Howard University.  I mean what would you see as like, I guess the points where you learned something you didn't know, and you moved beyond that?
Speaker 2: Well, my two history teachers, Porter and Shapely were just amazing people.  And I guess I've always put an unusually high importance on, on the knowledge of history and how you've used it.  I mean I'll never forget, I was painting a ballerina dancer and the, Professor Porter came in, and he said, you know, "That's--you obviously have never seen a ballet."  And I said, "Well, I don't think I'm interested in ballet."  He said, "I know you're not, but you need to see a ballet if you're gonna paint a ballet dancer.  It's as simple as that," you know.  He didn't have to say anything more than that.  So I went and saw a ballet, and he was right.  In order to understand what ballet dancers do in that pose and, you know, that, that sort of energy, you know, you need to be there.  So, if you don't have people like that, you know, in your life, then you'll end up missing what the pursuit of creativity is all about.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just had a good question--oh, now, you took courses other than in the art department, right--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --what other courses did you, what electives did you pursue, I guess?
Speaker 2: Well, German, and there was a couple of writing courses.  I--those were very enjoyable-(simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: Now, Sterling Brown [poet] was at Howard there, wasn't he?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I didn't have poetry with him.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I knew who he was.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other teachers in the other disciplines that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, Professor Wells, who was considered the Dean of American printmaking.  He was just an awesome person, you know, a big personality and a small man.  He had a real sense of the order of art and printmaking.  So he's really the one who taught me that, that you could, in fact, be a printmaker.  And Lois Jones, who was one of the world's most (unclear) people.
Speaker 1: Lois Mailou Jones [painter]?
Speaker 2: Yeah. (Pause). Well, James Porter was head of the art department at that particular time.  And this man I, that I mentioned, John Shapely, S-H-A-P-E-L-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he taught Art History as well, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you glad you went on to Howard instead of pursuing, like--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  As a matter of fact, I understood, I understood why Howard had such esteem and such honor, and in looking back on it from, from now, from this particular period and realizing, since the racial restrictions were lifted, you know, from American universities and a lot of those students went other places, the best and brightest of the black American, you know, intellectuals graduated from either Howard University or Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], you know.  I mean Howard was the real lure.  It changed once they could, you know, those int--you know, the young intellectuals could get into Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and, you know, Columbia [University, New York, New York].  And it took a real bite out of, you know, Howard University.  And Howard, being one of the few traditionally black colleges left, is on a constant program to lure students back.
Story_ID: 13560
Speaker 1: You left Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] in '65 [1965] or was it?
Speaker 2: I, I left '62 [1962], that I left Springfield [Massachusetts].  I never left Washington [D.C].
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you were a student at Howard until?
Speaker 2: '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: '65 [1965], yeah, okay, all right.  So what did you do after Howard?
Speaker 2: Well, when I graduated I had a, a job secured that I was gonna be the, the foreman, well, I was already the foreman of this shop where I worked, that I was gonna continue that work for a couple years, save money, go to graduate school.  The man who owned the shop was offering more money for doing that, than I could turn down.  And you need school for, you know, you need money for graduate school.  And I was determined not to owe money for the rest of my life if I went to graduate school.  The other schools that I could have gone to, that a lot of my buddies went--where did they go, I think, I can't think now where they would have gone, you know, were other graduate schools.  Well, Carnegie Mellon [University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] was one.  One of my friends went there.  Columbia [University, New York, New York] was another.  But I remember Professor [James] Porter saying to me that he wouldn't accept me back.  As a matter of fact, he volunteered that I shouldn't apply to, for graduate school at Howard.  And I wanted to know why, and he says, "I'm glad that you asked.  You've learned what we have to teach you here.  There's no point of you coming back here to our graduate school.  And you'll have, you'll have me and the same other teachers that you've had, you know.  We, we already know what you can do, and if you're gonna be a true art historian, then you need to go to at least two or three more colleges.  So as you start with"--and so I decided that I would start with Rochester Institute of Technology [Rochester, New York].  That's where I wanted to go first.  It's interesting that that's where my son chose to go.  But what I was interested in was a different level than what he was interested in.  But they didn't accept me on the basis that you have to have your own direction set to accept the courses that they were offering.  And I had my own direction set to pursue the direction where I thought I should go as an artist, and had actually written a very, very long, and what I thought was a good letter, explaining what I wanted to do, was to design modular units of furniture for low-cost housing because we were anticipating what the, the population of the world was gonna be like in major cities, and that apartment building was gonna become very, very popular.  And the letter that I got back saying, "You might try such and such a school or such and such a school, but we don't, but we do not have a program that allows you to design your own graduate course."
Story_ID: 13561
Speaker 1: So what did you do next, I mean, what was your option?
Speaker 2: Well, I decided that I would talk to the guy that I was working for, Harvey Botkin, and maybe work for a year or two for him, and then go to another graduate school.  Well, it turns out that in 1967, this is two years after I graduated, there was a exhibition at DuPont Circle [Washington, D.C. neighborhood] that I was invited to be part of.  And during the course of that exhibition, we show--we sold prints and posters and had, you know, added to it, did silkscreen demonstrations and so on, and just made a wonderful thing.  And I realized that I didn't need graduate school at that point, that it would have been nice to have it, you know, because that's what we, we do.  You know, you take your, all your credentials and that becomes, you know, who you are, you know.  Well, my credi--credentials were all working credentials.  So at a certain point, I was invited to, to this man's house who said, "Tell me what you'd like to do.  I'm impressed already with what you do."  And that thing that I was, had done was to--the, the part of the exhibition that I did, was to sort of reshape the way that you enter a new gallery and the experience that you would have, that kind of thing.  So he wanted to know about me.  I wanted to know why he wanted to see me.  And he said why he was interested, you know, the dynamics of art that makes people go outside the box to create something.  And so I had done that.  And he offered me a grant if I could write a proposal on what I wanted to do.  And he said, "Do you know how to write a proposal?"  And I says, "Well, yeah, of course, I do.  I'll write a proposal and have it back for you, you know, in a couple of days."  And the proposal I sent, gave, gave him back was that for a certain amount of money, I could build a studio, have at least two different people who I would teach to print and could have a bunch of people around us, and that the idea was anyone who learned from us, would have to teach one of the other young, younger people.  And he said, "Fine, done.  How much will that cost?"  I said, "Well, it's right there, $10,000."  And he gave it to me, you know, ten thousand dollars just to--giving, is like giving you $100,000 today.
Speaker 1: That was some big--a lot of money in those days.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, so I established my studio.  And the guy that I had been working for, Harvey Botkin, allowed me to use his shop, you know, to build some of the stuff that I needed because I wanted to build my own silkscreen table, which is still there after all these years, and use his vehicle, you know, to pick up my stuff.  It was, you know, he was a great, he was a great friend, you know, but I also worked very, very hard for him.  And his way of paying back to me was to be as helpful as he could be.  And one of the things that he said was, he didn't want to just have a comp--another competitor out there, especially not me because I was his chief foreman.  And I said, "Well, I'm not gonna be your competitor.  What I want to do is fine art printing.  I'm not interested in the commercial work.  I'll send it to you, you know."  So that's what I did.  I sent him the commercial work, and I did the fine art until people got used to the fact that I was a real silkscreen printmaking facility and not a commercial shop.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you've done that ever since basically.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 13562
Speaker 1: Tell us about your artwork.  Now, that's something we haven't discussed yet.  You've, you have continued to make furniture.  We saw some examples of that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you want to tell us about that first, and then we'll talk about--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, there's a--there's not much to say about the furniture except that--I'm sorry I'm fidgeting so much.  My basic feeling, my basic theory about making furniture is that furniture is, in fact, a box, you know.  And you cut into different shapes, and you attach it in ways according to, you know, the stress that that furniture might endure.  You know, for instance, a chair endures a lot more stress than a, than a table.  You know, a table, you build it, it just sits there.  But a chair has to go through all kinds of things.  So it's the way that you put the attachments on, you know, that make a difference.  But you saw some of the furniture, the furniture in the house, and I build everything out here.  And while it's not as dressed up as house furniture would be, it really works for a studio.
Speaker 1: Okay, there was a particular desk you showed us a picture of that you designed.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And is there a special story around that?
Speaker 2: Well, the guy that I designed it for was U.S. Attorney during the Watergate fiasco [1970s political scandal involving President Richard M. Nixon].  So, we got a lot of amusement out of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, who was that?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Earl Silbert.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we built it, a black Formica and made it heavy and chunky looking so that it would like his office was grounded, you know.  I, you know, that's, that's, that's one thing that you can do where a furniture maker is concerned, is that almost every furniture maker, you know, puts his personality, somehow, into that piece.  It's like a transference thing.
Story_ID: 13563
Speaker 1: Now, you're known mostly for your prints, and can you tell us about, you know, your technique and what you--about your printing technique and what your subject matter is?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm a silk-screen printmaker, which means that I work with oil-based inks, and the idea is to make your drawing or painting or whatever, through silk screen, look as much like the original as possible.  In, in doing that, you make the silk screen look even more incredible as a silk screen.  And so I've now done enough silk screens that the, the whole nature of, of, of printmaking is kind of like a second calling for me.  It's an opportunity to, to make the prints and at the same time, to break it down, separating out the colors and sometimes I use those colors again.  Once they're separated out, and meaning that I--you have a, a double-layered plastic film, and you cut your shapes, and whatever shape you cut out, once you adhere the balance into the silk, the silk is open where you've cut out your design or layout, and then the rest is filled over.  And so it becomes like a, an open stencil.  And once you put ink on top, and you force the ink through the screen, it comes off to the paper.  So you have a direct method of printing.  So it was using, using the medium like that, since I was like fifteen and a half years old, to totally, totally understand everything about it.  That was my goal because I saw in that particular medium the ability to satisfy all my intellectual interests.
Story_ID: 13564
Speaker 1: Now, I want to ask you about your subject matter, and, and, and--You seem to be inspired by nature.  Can you explain why, your--?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, I guess it's because of the seriousness of how I view life in my own pursuits.  And it would seem only natural for me to go back to where things began, to go nature.  My own personal philosophy has it that you could either go inside yourself or outside.  And since I feel that a lot of my sustenance comes from in, kind of, an interior sense of who I am, and what I'd like to be.  So even when I, often when I do landscapes they're not directly referenced to an actual place, but it's a place in my head where I would like to be.  So it has to do with dream, which is very important to me, and that whole consciousness of dreams.  But also I do flowers because I think flowers are simply beautiful.  And I like that, you know, I like, like doing things that are beautiful.  But also it's a challenge.  And I also feel that there are lots of people who are in fact, doing a figurative type work, and, of course there's a lot of people doing flowers and that kind of thing also.  But I feel that my flowers have a different, a different look and a different presence.  I've actually challenged people, from time to time. Say, "Okay, where have you seen a flower done like this before by another artist?"  And it turns out that my, actually that my flowers and landscapes are pretty much wholly original.  Now that's not to say that I haven't learned or been influenced by lots.  It's hard to imagine that I could have printed for more than seventy artists in my time and not have been influenced by some of them.  I don't see the direct influence myself of how one person has influenced me to do a different line or something like that.  It would be a subtle thing.  Certainly not to, like take a whole idea.  You know, for instance I can, I can do Jacob Lawrences, I can do, you know, Elizabeth Catlett, I can do Lois Jones, I can do Sam Gilliams, you know.  I can do all those things, you know, because I've done them.  But to, I don't know which, which artists' idea would be better than, than my own idea.  I know what sells better, but since I'm not, since you know, commerce does not enter into a level of importance in my art.  It doesn't matter that another artist has an idea that has more popular appeal because I think that I sell enough of my own art to be secure.
Story_ID: 13565
Speaker 1: You paint trees, or water, birds.  I haven't--do you paint any other kinds of animals?  'Cause I've only seen birds.  But, I haven't seen all your work.
Speaker 2: No, that's pretty much it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Why birds?
Speaker 2: Because of freedom.  It all has to do with the freedom, the freedom to exist, the freedom to have an imagination.  The birds are indeed a, for me, a metaphor of humankind.  For instance, well the print over on my right there, of all the birds in the sky.  That's all the birds from, representing all the people of the world who have come together to discuss world hunger, and there's always a, I always have a symbol of energy and a symbol of happiness in all my work.  And so that red bird represents, you know, the, the bird that will come back from all those other people and spread the word that there's good stuff happening out there.  So that's, I always have to have a sense of hope in whatever I do.
Story_ID: 13566
Speaker 1: Most of your work--I wouldn't say all-but most is, most of the work is framed in a circle.  Is that, why, why the circle?
Speaker 2: Well, it has to do with the, my own personal orientation to life, and that is that it's cyclical.  That there's a beginning and there's an end.  You know, I'm not particularly religious in a denominational way.  Indeed, I think that I don't go to church because I prefer to be in my studio, and on a Sunday morning I feel that I'm doing the Lord's work by being in my studio and doing good things, you know.  Where I could be out, you know, doing a number of other things.  And indeed, having someone reinterpret, you know, the Bible, or to give a, a sermon on human behavior and how to treat other people.  You know, I mean I practice good works on a daily basis, you know, because "no" doesn't happen to be in my vocabulary when it comes to helping other people.  People know where to find me.  So the circle for me represents that whole sort of being, you know, it's the centeredness about it.  It exists in my poetry and so on.
Story_ID: 13567
Speaker 1: The colors that you use--I've seen like the earth tones.  I've also seen bright, you know, colors that are not earth tones.  Do you have a, do you have a philosophy in terms of the colors you use and why you use certain colors?
Speaker 2: No, I don't because, as I said before, I think I'm so much of the moment, you know, that I'm working that whatever color seems to appeal to me or inspire me at that particular time.  But, but I'm also very much a victim of my own, sort of, sense of order.  So if I've laid down a certain color then it's almost, you can almost bet that it's going to be something logical in that sequence, you know.  So if I've put down an orange, chances are what's going to follow that orange is going to be a deeper tone of orange, you know, and then, finally, an accent.  And so that accent of the orange would probably be a green or a certain kind of blue.  So because, you know, there should be an order of things the way that I, that my mind has it when I'm making art.
Story_ID: 13568
Speaker 1: Speaking of order, your studio is extremely orderly.  I mean it's, it's, those who can't see they, they can see you on this video.  But, we, we're in your studio, and everything is in its place.  There's no doubt about it.  Really, really in order, I mean.  Do you really strive to, well, I guess you must strive, but why do strive to have such order?
Speaker 2: Well, that, that's simply a, for a very, very simple reason.  It has to do with economy, and it also has to do with the fact that I work, you know, generally twelve hours a day or so.  And that is to make the very best use of my time, you know, producing whatever I feel.  So whether it's art or furniture, or writing a poem, or, you know, if even writing a, writing a note or a letter I always do the very best I can.  And I, so, I do everything as economically and as efficiently as possible.  And so if I say to you or one of my helpers I need a certain thing that's in my studio, then I can describe to you exactly where that thing is, you know.  And also it means that I can go back there and find it myself.  Now, the only place I fail is in, on my desk.  I haven't managed to (laughs) to conquer my desk.  It's like a, this giant behemoth all by itself, you know, that's defeating me constantly.  And usually what I'm looking for is right in front of me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of people are, fail at the desk, you know.  This is a wonderfully orderly place.  Now, in terms of your writing--you, you, you write poetry--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Describe your poetry for us.  I mean what--
Speaker 2: All right, before I answer that, let me go back to the orderly thing in the studio.  And that is that in order to be a printmaker and deliver clean prints, which is also a part, it's almost a contract that you have to have in order to serve the artist whose prints you're making very well.  That in addition to having the print beautifully made, you want, you want to give them clean borders.  And the back of the print should be clean.  So that the only thing that's on the print, you know, be, should be what you intended to have there.  And, if you don't have a sense of order, like clean tables.  All my helpers you will know when you talk to them they'll tell you that whenever you finish a job, you clean off the table completely.  And you make it ready for the next job that might come along, whatever that job is.  And also, my mantra for life is "Do everything as if it's the last thing that you're going to be doing."  And it's on that that your presence on earth will be judged.  You know. So, I mean that sounds like a lot of hokey, but the truth is I live my life every day that way.  So, and I try never to have anything that's left over, that's careless, you know, or whatever.
Story_ID: 13569
Speaker 1: Now, about your writing--you write poetry?
Speaker 2: Uh, huh.
Speaker 1: And do you write prose?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I tend to write more prose now than poetry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what kind of things do you write about?
Speaker 2: Well, right now I'm writing mostly about art, but sometimes I write short stories in addition to that.  The short stories are generally about my life.  You know, the funny incidences that happen and so on.  But I love writing prose best because it has to do with summoning up a sense of passion, emotion, information that, that makes you want to read whatever it is that I'm writing about.  And you do that by writing interesting words, and putting words together that lead you from one sentence to the next.
Speaker 1: Now, are, have you published very much of your work?
Speaker 2: Some.  Yeah.  (Pauses)  But that hasn't been one of my primary concerns.  It gets published in manuals and journals, and sometimes in books and that kind of thing.  But my chief interest in life is what I'm doing.  So, I feel that history will take care of itself where, you know, where my work is concerned, you know.  I mean, it, it's a joy to come across a book that has my, you know, some of my work in it or, you know, something like that.  Whether it's written, or one of my pictures, or whatever.  But, you know, the reason that I work is because I love the act of working.
Story_ID: 13570
Speaker 1: In terms of exhibitions--artists must have exhibitions to sell their work in.  What was your big breakthrough--well, you gave us a story about a big breakthrough shortly after you left Howard University [Washington, D.C.] that launched your career basically.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But what are some of the other benchmarks in your career as an artist?
Speaker 2: Certainly the one that stands out the most would be my Retrospective Show at Howard University [2001] that showed seventy-some odd works, where I could have easily had two hundred works in that show.  But the space was limited, but I had all the galleries.  But it showed roughly thirty years of printmaking, you know.  And, the idea, the idea is what I've tried to do with my, with my life is to make silk-screen printmaking a thing of honor, and a thing of beauty, and to take silk, take the stigma of silk-screen printmaking as a commercial medium and make it a fine arts medium.  So that people who see it will understand, "Hey, this is a silk screen that's all done by hand."
Story_ID: 13571
Speaker 1: It's all done on one screen, on one table that I made in 1968.  And so I have silk screen prints that look like watercolors, look like acrylic painting, looks like oil paintings.  Some that look like charcoal drawings, you know, and this is all through, because I see silk-screen printmaking as an interpretive medium.  And the whole idea is to take, like when you buy a, a, you see a [Vincent] Van Gogh painting, to give you an example, and you want that Van Gogh painting but you know it's in some famous museum where hundreds of thousands of people can see it.  Now, the best thing that you can get from that would be a photographic reproduction of it, which doesn't really satisfy but you at least have the image.  Well, if I print for lesser artists who are still alive--and almost everyone is lesser than Van Gogh, you know, because of that huge thing that he carries with his name--then I can make really good quality prints by hand that are almost as good, not several steps removed, but like the next step from his interpretation with a brush is my interpretation with a silk-screen print.  You know, so that from the very short distance they look, you know, as much alike as two things should look.  So that you have, you have something of the artist's work that's not just the one piece which is museum bound, but you can have like a hundred or a hundred twenty-five or thirty really good silk-screen prints of an artist's work.
Speaker 2: Okay.  As a printer of other artists' works than of your own work you approach-we were discussing during the break-as an artist.  I mean you, you exercise some creativity in the production of these prints.  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 1: Well, when I exercise my own creativity it's always because I've put myself into that artist's work, so that I become his hands because of the silkscreen medium.  Because I have a very definite style of my own which I'm happy with.  As a matter of fact I have two styles I work in.  There's my landscape style, and then my sort of, a, design style where, you know, (unclear) I do things that are more sort of "hard edge", you know.  Uh, but in so doing, I'm happy with my own works.  I don't need to copy another artist's work unless I'm making a print for him.  So, the way that I generally operate is to give my all to the project that I'm working on, and to always know that I wouldn't be doing that project if it were not for that artist.  So, consequently my, my ego doesn't enter into it, you know, at all.  So every choice that I make is a choice that I imagine that he has made or should have made.  And in most cases the artist that I work, work, work with, if I'm changing something it's because I've done as best I can with the silkscreen print medium and it still doesn't satisfy me.  So then I make a call, and I tell them that, 'well, this is what, what I have now.  It doesn't satisfy me, you know.  Can you think of some alternatives for me?  Do you want come see it?  Do you want to come discuss it with me?  Should I just do it and send you a proof (you know, if they're from out of town)?'  And that always works out.  I've only ever had two failures.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, who are some of the artists you, you work with here?  I know we, we were looking at some of the works during the break, and uh--.
Speaker 1: Well, uh, Jacob Lawrence, and Elizabeth Cavnet (?), David Driscoll, James Wells, Lois Maylu (?) Jones, um, Rocky Stevenson-who happens to live right around Washington, he lives in, um, I can't think of this little city now:  Glen Echo.  Gene Davis, when he was alive, I made a lot of prints for him.  I hope I said Sam Gillingham.  That's, there's, there's a lot.  Robert Mangold.  They're all listed in my catalogue.
Speaker 2: Jonathan Greene?
Speaker 1: Jonathan Greene.  Yeah
Speaker 2: (Unclear) Who's who of artists.  So this is uh, preaks (?) - additional products that an artist can sell that are high quality.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --by going this route.
Story_ID: 13572
Speaker 1: What about the uses of history and--.
Speaker 2: Well, I go back to that old adage that says that, "To know nothing of the past, and to have no realization of your presence is to have no future," and, that, it's more important to me than anything possible.  Because in order to be the best that I can be, because I can't control the future, the only thing I can truly control is how I feel about things.  And I really can't even control that.  I can't control my feelings, but I can control my reaction to my feelings and also to, to my reaction to your action.  So, I think back in terms of history and I'm informed by everything that has gone before me that has been pleasant, and I don't mean pleasant, I mean that the absolute meaning of pleasant that is a (unclear) transference of feeling.  So I think back on that, and I realize that what I really like is a pleasant intellectual exchange, you know, of energies.  What I like is--I collect opera because I really love it very much, and an example that I use often, is in [Giacomo] Puccini's opera, 'Madame Butterfly,' that the ultimate sacrifice is to give up one's child.  And so here's Butterfly who loves this man, not because she's spent so much time with him, but because it's just a tradition to love your husband.  So she has married this man because she came with the property that he bought, and she's had his child because that's what wives do.  And then he goes away, and he comes back with, with the wife that he actually chose, who didn't come with the property.  And he says, "We haven't been able to have children.  May we have this child, which is my son?"  And she gives up that child, and of course because she's been dishonored, first, because he went away and left her and she had to withstand the criticism of her family and her neighborhood, and because he's come back with another wife, and she has suffered that embarrassment.  And now he's asking her something that she can't deny him because she's a good wife.  So it has to do with those absolutes.  And absolutes are very important to me because absolutes are, that's the stuff of reality.  And it's also the stuff of our imagination.  And so she gives the child and commits hari kari.  There are other examples where in, in La Boheme, where he says, "I love your, what do such beautiful hands do?"  And he explains why he finds, why he's fascinated with her hands.  And she falls in love with him because he loves her hands.  And there's that, so that's love at first sight, you know.  They had no other basis for being in love except that.  He loved her beautiful white hands, and she loved the way that he loved them, you know.  And then they realized what they had together wasn't enough for a whole life.  So, if you use your history, and you find your sources of history, and for me, finding my sources of history which informs my art is, has to do with the story, the telling of stories.  Again, it has to do with that narrative factor that I learned from my parents.  Now it's not that I want to illustrate operas, but I take all that energy and all that passion and all that emotion, and I pour that into a single line that I might draw.  And I say, "Okay, this line is going to be what divides the one part of this paper from the other part."  And then I'll know after I see this line what will either extend from it or what it will implicate itself, you know, on that line changing the surface of that paper, you know.  How will I draw you into it, and if indeed, do I want to draw you into it or do I want the art to come out, you know, to meet you?  See, its all that.  And, without a sense of history you don't know that.  You learn from Barnard Newman [painter] that two opposing colors will either make a color come forward or recede, and once you've learned that lesson, you know, you'll know how to handle the color.  And I often say--and I love this part of my life.  And if there's, if there's an ego that's really effective where I exist, it's because I know I have enough vocabulary and I know enough words, and because I'm earnest and serious that when one of my helpers asked another last night about some painting he was doing.  And he said, "Well, I seem to be painting the same thing over and over again, and I can't quite get out of it.  And I guess I'm going to have to work this out."  And I said just offhanded, "Well, you won't be having that trouble much longer, because as soon as I have time to deal with you next week you're going to be looking for another way to go," you know.  And, you know, I said that realizing that--and I hadn't planned to say that to him, you know, but I know that I have to have, you know, an intellectual, you know, influence over his art and over his thoughts in order to, for him to be the best that he can be.  Because at some point someone did that same thing to me, like Professor [James] Porter when he said, "Go to a ballet," you know.  If you haven't seen a ballet, how are you going to paint a tutu if you don't know the way it moves, you know?  And so, so I was all set to go on painting my, you know, stick-figure ballets until I realized that hey, you don't know anything about the way a tutu moves on a human body, you know.  And when I think back on the, a film that I saw, 'Degas,' and [Edgar] Degas' affection for painting was such that it consumed his life.  There wasn't anything, any other life for him, and then he saw this, this girl dance, and he realized that she was different than all the other dancers that he had seen before.  And there was something about the way that she moved, and her posing and so on.  And so he did this sculpture of her which is, which is always been the quintessential ballet dancer.  You know, just in a very simple, you know, like first or second movement pose.  And so if you, if you use your history the right way, then you bring to that history an understanding of what you want of yourself.  And I said to my, my son that you need to be in love with your ideas.  You need to, you know, gain passion to express them, you know. And that's what I think is important about life because we're not that far removed from, still from the animal, or the food gathering stage, you know.  So the, what we have is these usable thumbs, and our intellect which takes us to other times and other places.
Story_ID: 13573
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry that you asked me that because (laughs), it's something that I struggle with every single day, and that is, if I have any concern or any hope at all, you know, for the black community it would be that--and it shouldn't be that important to me, but it is important because I think that it shouldn't be that important to the person that determines whether or not he's going to hire us and give us an opportunity--but it's the language.  The use of the language, non-standard use of English, which has been an, the most embattled of all the things that black people has had to go through, you know, that's the one, you know.  And in many ways it's the, the use of non-standard English that has given people, you know, a sense of sustenance that can carry them from one problem to, you know, through another, you know.
Story_ID: 13574
Speaker 1: Well, the reason that even, even people who are, because that's another thing is I, I like to listen carefully to people.  And I find that some people who--I really can't stand the way they talk, but I love to hear what they say.  And the way that they, that they're most comfortable communicating, you know, it's like, you know if you're warm you take off your sweater.  So they take off all those trappings that they've learned, and they get so, what they consider down and dirty.  And, you know, and then, you know, and then this fracturing of standard English happens.  Now, it is interesting that, in terms of emoting you can make your point more often by the use of slang.  But you can also use that slang in a, in certain ways that it's engaging.  So, as I was explaining to you, 'Madam Butterfly' and 'La Boheme,' I said to one of my interns a month or so ago that "I want you to listen to 'How to Listen to Opera.'  And listen to this man's explanation and get the sense and the feeling of the power of his imagination which, which allows you, who have no interest in opera whatsoever, to really get engaged in it, and really listen to the words that he uses."  Even when he uses slang, you know, he uses it in an intelligent way, and when he gets down and dirty, he tells you, "Now, this is down and dirty and I'm saying it this way so that you'll understand that she intended to kill her husband, she intended to do him in and to make him suffer, you know."  And you can do it musically.  The, as I explained in another paper that the composers who write great music, they write it in such a way that it's a, that it's a formula.  So that you know when you hear certain sounds, and the use of certain statements, that this is according to a formula where when the actors or singers who perform this music, perform it in a certain way that you understand immediately what's happening.  It's a time-honored tradition.  So the people who want to do something different than that, go away from that tradition and they try for a different kind of expression and they use it. So the, the ghetto expression, for instance, you know, it really works on people who are in the ghetto, from the ghetto, but in terms of personal explanations and personal exposition of their real intelligence they're gonna lose out on a better world, you see.  So it's hard to take a person from, from what they know who feel very happy, and say, "Okay, if you can talk like this, you know, speak like this, then I'll give you this job because I can't stand to hear, you know, that ghetto level language."  Then, are you taking anything from that person when you insist that?  And that's what the culture nowadays is all about.  You know, I'm sure you've met, we all have met some really crackerjack intelligence in people who speak in the worst manners possible.  And, you know, I think about what my parents used to say, "Well, you know, he sounds like a fool but he ain't no fool." (Chuckles) But, somehow in the back of your mind you know that you've been guilty of that prejudice.  And it is a prejudice, and it's an unwillingness to tolerate that nonstandard use of English.  And as you, you know, as you suggested earlier, television now entertains us on a regular basis.  And the movies entertain us on a regular basis.  And we also, we know that it's going to be short-lived because then something else is gonna come along to take its place.

Speaker 1: Over the years you've been about many projects and you've known quite a few of the top artists, and you've encountered other people, too.  There's a story that you told when we were looking through the photos about George Meany [president of the AFL-CIO].  You want to tell us that story?
Speaker 2: Well, my neighbor, Fred Rooney, who is a [U.S.] congressman from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania area, who is very much loved there, and he was a congressman for more than twenty years.  His hero was George Meany, and he had always wanted to have his photograph taken with George Meany.  But there was no way that he could get to George Meany's office so he traded me something that I wanted, but I didn't want anything. But my wife had always wanted to have lunch in the [U.S.] Senate dining room.  And so she said, "If you take us to lunch at the Senate dining room, then I'll get Lou to do this." And "do this" meant going to George Meany's office and posing for photographs with him.
Speaker 1: Now, you had access because of the work you'd done for him.  AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Organizations], I guess, the labor union?
Speaker 2: Right.  I had done the print for the AFL Labor Studies Learning Center [sic, George Meany Center for Labor Studies], which was named after George Meany.  And, in the order of things as they are, there was no way that George Meany could deny a photographic opportunity for, you know, a young black artist.  It was as simple, simple as that, and that was the way it was put to him.  So he acknowledged that he would be there for that photographic session.  And while we were there, waiting for the photographer to get set up and so on, Fred Rooney was pacing the floor.  And his wife was there, and my wife was there, and so on, and Fred and myself.  And, at one point he said to George Meany, "Well, you've quite a view there."  And George Meany, who I thought to be fairly much comatose, suddenly stood up and paced back and forth several times in front of his window which overlooked the White House [Washington, D.C.].  And he says, "Well, that young buck [U.S. President John F. Kennedy] down there, he got himself into office, and now I want to make sure of what he does, keep an eye on him." I thought that was really, really funny and also very telling, you know.  I, of course, had no interest in being there.  I was there because of my friend Fred who is a very wonderful person, who wanted his picture taken with his hero, you know, which reminded me of another thing, that your heroes are not, are often not all that willing to spend time with you, especially for something like a photographic opportunity.  So I decided several things in my life over a period of years based on experience that--growing up as a kid I never had a new bicycle.  So I bought my son a bicycle.  And he says, "But I'm not really using a bike now, I'm trying to drive cars."  "Well," I said, "first of all you're not going to get a car for quite a while, and here's a new bicycle because growing up I never had a new bicycle.  So take this bicycle and enjoy it." (chuckles) But I realize I was living out my own, you know, sense.  And, you know, so by Fred Rooney being, having his hero as George Meany doesn't mean that George was going to have, you know, you know, a great feeling for him.  But I decided that if I were ever became anyone's hero, I would definitely give them more than the time of day.
Speaker 1: And you do, uh, mentor quite a few young people, from what I'm gathering, interns, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: And you were, you've known, well, you have a, seem to have a special relationship with [artist] Jacob Lawrence.  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: We had, we had a great, great relationship, I mean it was just, Jake was like--Jake never had kids himself, and I, I think that I was so much like Jake in my overall personality and stuff like, and he was very comfortable with me.  So I spent some very, you know, private moments with Jake when he was--well, more than moments, days when I would be there signing prints when Jake wasn't feeling well.  And he needed physical help, you know, in order to, you know, just get to the bathroom and get his clothes changed, whatever.  And, at one point Jake said, because Gwen [Knight Lawrence] was saying to Jake, "Jake, we've gotta get ready, you know, you haven't changed your shirt yet, and they're expecting us to dinner soon."  And Jake was in his wheelchair during those times.  And he says, "Well, I'm just--"  She says, "What are you putting off this, what are you doing, putting this off so long?  They're expecting us to dinner soon."  And Jake still didn't say anything, and I didn't say anything.  And Gwen says, "Are you ashamed to change your shirt in front of Lou?"  And he says, "Well, I don't want Lou to see me naked!"  And I said, "Jake, I've already seen naked."  He says, "Yeah, but if you see me a second time you'd tell."  (Laughs) Yep, you have to sorta know Jake in order to understand his sense of humor, but he had this amazing sense of just sort of encapsulating, you know, the words and so now I've told that I saw him, you know, having to change his shirt and had to help him do it.  He was an immensely private person with a heart of gold that just sorta went out to everyone.

Speaker 1: What about the young people that you've mentored or come in contact with?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm realizing that, that, you know, the more, kind of well-known I've become, the more people who, you know, have a demand on my time.  And, and also it's, because I've reached a certain point where I need that time in order to develop my art and to continue developing my art.  So, as a matter of fact I said just yesterday, you know, "Be careful what you ask for," because if you ask for some level of recognition, or fame, or fortune or whatever, there's gonna be people who'll want to, you know, be with you and associate themselves with you for whatever reason.  You know, often it's for good reasons, but you realize that, you know, you now have the power to do what you would like to do where art is concerned, but the time is diminishing because you have to spend so much time doing other things.  So, my advice to, to young people is, you know, you, you have to match your, you know, your zeal to become important with your ability to, you know, to reach out.  And, if anything, to, you know, learn to sacrifice sleep and maybe some of the leisure things that you would do in order to do the things that you really want to do.  Because there are things that people really want you to do, that you must do in order to satisfy your public.

Speaker 1: When you look back at all the, all of your works, and all the things that you've done, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I would love, I would love it to be, you know, some of the (chuckles), it's silly but I'd love it to be some of the things that I've written.  Because I think that you, well, I think back on the thing that I did where my mother was concerned.  Once I opened my own studio and I sent my mother a package with a letter explaining that everything in this package, considering the wrapping, the packing, everything about it, I did, you know, the matting, the framing, the art, and so on.  Explained the whole thing to her, and my mother wrote back this note of how beautiful the framing was and the packaging, and so on.  And so I called her up, and I says, "Well, Mom, you didn't say anything about the art."  And she says, "Oh, Louther, everyone knows you can draw."  (Laughs) So, you need a certain kind of reality every once in a while to enter into that.  But I was, I wanted her to really understand that I had become what she had wanted me to be, which was fully successful, that I was able to do everything in that package which having to do with art.  You know, that not did I only make the art, but I packaged it properly and sent it, and so on.  And that's what she was celebrating, you know, but, but when she left me or when I left her as a child, she had already done her job.  She had already made sure that I had whatever sense and assurance that I needed in order to become an artist.  What she didn't know, which I didn't know either and didn't even care about or think about was that the business of living as an artist.  I learned that as I went along.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is slightly different from the legacy.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Probably as a really serious person who, who loved and enjoyed everything about life.  You know, the good parts of life that transport us to, like a higher calling.  So, in other words, when I was a kid I was very, very naïve, and I thought that if I could just be smart enough I could walk into a room, and everybody would know.  And everybody there would share some of the intelligence that I had gathered.  I mean, I don't know how many people think weird things like that, but that the intelligence should so apparent that it would be, that it would rub off.  I wanted to have a life of intellectual pursuit and intelligence.  That kind of thing.  So now I feel that what I would like people to know is that kindness is probably the thing that is most significant, you know.  So I try to be kind.

Speaker 1: Is there anything that you'd do differently?
Speaker 2: Like what?
Speaker 1: Well I don't know.  Is there anything that you would do differently in life if you had it to do again?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, that I would do differently.  Yeah, there are some things.  There, there are some people who, who I don't talk to anymore, simply because I feel they have just used me up, and I've gotten to a point where I think that time is limited and there's a certain amount of work that I want to get done.  So I don't want to spend that time with these people who have spent, who have taken up so much of my time, you know, with foolish things.  And I wish now that I had the capacity to say it and do it a different way, to separate myself in a different way.  One of my great friends, of years backwards, [singer] Roberta, Roberta Flack and--I was never one because I think I always knew enough people, but also it's more because I did, I never needed whatever the glow was from, you know, from a famous personality.  Because I was too busy working on my own work, you know, and the glow never was important to me.  But one of the reasons that Roberta removed herself from, you know, from public life, you know, is just that it just sort of overwhelmed her, and then there was also a person who was stalking her, so I'd heard, over a period of time it made life very uncomfortable, you know, for her.  Because it was difficult to get through to Roberta on the telephone after a while and she was someone I used to talk to frequently.  And it certainly wasn't because I was a nuisance, you know, but it was simply that she really needed to protect herself.  So she removed herself from lots of friendships, you know, when she moved up to New York.  And I thought, "That's not a good way to be either."  So, you know, it needs to be kind of a conscious easing off of everything, and let people know that, you know, "I used to be there for you, just as you were there for me, and I'm essentially still there.  It's just that I'm going to be a little bit more difficult to get to."  If that makes any sense.

Speaker 1: And lastly--I guess, well,  I remember you'd ask about this--what would you tell people who, what would be your advice for future generations?
Speaker 2: Well, if they're art people, then I would say to all the young artists that my simple advice is to love what you do, and loving it the way that you should, you'd want to share it.  And in order to get to share it, you're gonna have to have a certain amount of openness in order for people to want to come to you in order to share and see what you've done.
