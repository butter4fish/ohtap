He would say, "marvelous", and so that was just a phrase he used, and then people really started referring to him as "Marvelous". And so he was always chipper and very upbeat, and so I sort of picked up on it.
Story_ID: 28298

Speaker 2: Yeah, I really can't. We haven't really done a family tree. I just know from word of mouth, you know, what, you know, they, they lived in Fort Valley. And they basically worked in the community there in Fort Valley in the different, different work sites that they had in Fort Valley, I guess.
Speaker 1: So was--did your grandparents like--so they lived in town in Fort Valley?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they lived, they didn't live on a farm, at least not that I know of. My, on my father's side, I think I have a little bit more about what happened with him, but on my mother's side, no, they lived in the city part of Fort Valley.
Speaker 1: And what kind of work did they do?
Speaker 2: Mainly worked in, I guess there was--what did they have? Blue Bird Body Company in Fort Valley. That's where my mother worked there, and they also have Fort Valley State University. They worked in different capacities there.
Speaker 1: Now, is Blue Bird the bus company?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that it? Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's the home, home site for Blue Bird Body Company, and it's a bus company, international bus company. So they have that, and then they also have the peach industry, Peach County, in the peach state. And so a lot of the agricultural work too. The family worked in that.
Speaker 1: So Fort Valley is known as Peach County?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it is--
Speaker 2: Peach County in the peach state.
Speaker 1: In the peach state of Georgia.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Georgia, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess that's why I like peaches so (laughter) 'cause I ate so many of 'em growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they're good for you.
Speaker 1: Alright, now, there's a--you said, I know Fort Valley State College is there.
Speaker 2: Yes, Fort Valley State University now.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you have--
Speaker 1: That's a historical black college, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, so you have the different industries they have there, with the college. We had Blue Bird Body Company, and you also had Pearson Mills where they made baskets and, for packing the peaches as they, you know, distributed the peaches throughout the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they worked, different ones worked in different areas, in those three areas.
Speaker 1: Peach baskets, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, that's how they used to distribute them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, can you give us your grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Mary Mathis Jacobs. And my grandfather is George Jacobs.
Story_ID: 28299
Speaker 1: So did your mother [Alice Jacobs] talk about what it was like growing up in Fort Valley [Georgia] and what was going on when she was coming up? She was born in '31' [1931], right, 1931, so--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, 1931. No, not a whole lot other than just they lived all together, you know, and, was a close-knit family. And the town wasn't that large so, Fort Valley [Georgia] wasn't that large. And so they just lived together. She talked about her grandmother, Abby Mathis.
Speaker 1: Okay, what did she do?
Speaker 2: I think she used to work, a domestic worker, I think. And she would cook and clean. I remember that. And they talked about how she cooked, how well she cooked and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did your mother have a chance to go to school and finish--
Speaker 2: Yes, they went to school, high school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --finished high school.
Speaker 1: You know the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Hunt High School.
Speaker 1: Hunt High School.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Same with my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your father grew up in Fort Valley too?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, he grew up in Fort Valley too, but his family was, his mother died when he was a baby, you know, he was born. And so he was re--he was raised by his grandmother mostly. And his mother's name was Marie.
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about him separately. I'm just trying to get your mother--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --now. But, so in terms of your mother's side of the family and what your mother was doing, did your mother have an occupation that she wanted to pursue after school or a dream or something that she wanted to fulfill when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't--she could have been a lot of stuff. She's the stronger side of, stronger person in terms of making decisions and so forth. But, no, no, she worked at both Fort Valley State and Blue Bird Body Company. So she didn't indicate to--she didn't say, she just wanted us to go to school. And she wanted to take care of her family. So she was more of the, the home person, but very decisive and very strong.
Story_ID: 28300
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Willie.
Speaker 1: W-I--
Speaker 2: W-I-L-L-I-E, Lee, L-E-E, Jones.
Speaker 1: And what's his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October the 28th, 1928.
Speaker 1: And he was born in Fort Valley [Georgia] also?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, actually, I believe it's Fort Valley.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what are the--how far back can you trace your father's side and what are the stories about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Oh, his side, I think he talked a lot about his side on--I don't have the dates and all, but he talked about his father and his father was, name is Sidney, S-I-D-N-E-Y, Sidney Jones. And his mother died about, right after he was born. So he lived with his, his mother's mother, his grandmother. And so he was reared among his uncles, uncles and aunts.
Speaker 1: What was his grandmother's name that raised him?
Speaker 2: Now, I'll have to give you that.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was raised by his grandmother?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And, now, what did his family do? Were they doing the same kind of thing?
Speaker 2: They were in Roberta [Georgia], so they were in a farm, in the farming area. And so we traced his family--in the Roberta area of Georgia is where you had a lot of the mixing of races, I guess. You had blacks and whites, and so his father's father was white, I believe.
Speaker 1: Now, when you mean mixing of races was something that was done openly or something--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --or something that--
Speaker 2: Well, you just had kids being fathered by people of different races, of white males, I guess. So I believe--and we don't know. We can't trace that back, or we haven't tried to, but there's indication from what we heard that his great grandfather was white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they must have been big landowners too 'cause they talk about a lot of the land should--was taken, that he should have had.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a situation where his great grandfather was white, and actually raised children, you know, black children. I mean he had--
Speaker 2: No, he did not.
Speaker 1: He did not?
Speaker 2: His grandmother raised him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they just knew of the great, great grandfather being white. So they never married or--
Speaker 1: But the great, great grandmother then had a relationship with this white man, who owned this land?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably.
Speaker 1: And so, did she get any benefit out of that relationship in terms of--
Speaker 2: Not that I know of. But all that we know is when his father died, his aunts, his father's sisters, who had moved to Boston [Massachusetts], they came back and it was obvious that they were mixed and in terms of being half white, in terms of their complexion and everything else.
Speaker 1: You said they came back?
Speaker 2: Yes, they came back for his funeral.
Speaker 1: For, okay--
Speaker 2: And we hadn't really seen them or communicated with them that much, but I remember that as a, early on in my childhood.
Speaker 1: And, so what is the claim, the land claim? I mean was there some promise made to them by the--
Speaker 2: No, we just know there was land, and people, you know, word-of-mouth, they know about it. And that's all, you know, nobody ever pursued anything.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wonder. We hear these stories. Sometimes these white fathers of black children leave some provision for their kids to have land later on down the line. It may not be a lot, but they leave some kind of provision for 'em.
Speaker 2: And, you know, don't have anything in writing though. You don't have anything that you can prove that--and so people would just claim it and take it 'cause, you know, a lot of land that was owned by blacks was taken. And there's no trace, especially if you have no, nothing to prove that this is your land.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying that the children of this white man were on his land, working land that he owned, and after he died--after he left, other white people came and just took it 'cause they--there's no real legal right to it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's no record, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yep, so, you just don't have anything to say, to make a claim, that you have any--that you can get anything as an inheritance of any type. So.
Speaker 1: Right, okay, okay.
Story_ID: 28301
Speaker 1: So did your father [Willie Lee Jones] have any stories about growing up that he shared with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he talks about, you know, he was, he grew up with his aunt and his uncle. And so they were, they grew up as brothers and sisters. And I think he, he did a lot because he was not, you know, he was not a brother or sister. So he had to do all the work. So, he--a lot of the things, but he was happy, and he was always very dedicated to family. And he valued family so much because he didn't have any brothers and sisters, but he had aunts and uncles that he grew up with, so. And he talked about them and did everything he could. But they always got, they got--it was like a Cinderella story. They got what was best, and he got what was left over. But he was the smarter of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your father have a chance to finish high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he finished high school.
Speaker 1: Now, was the high school right there in town?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay. So they were fortunate in that sense that there was a high school there, you know, they didn't have to go to another--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the high school there--
Speaker 1: --county to go-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: He completed all the, he completed everything and did not march because he didn't have a suit to wear. And so they talk about that. He talked about that a lot, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But a lot of students now, they have suits to wear and won't march (laughter).
Speaker 1: And won't put 'em on.
Speaker 2: Won't put 'em on (laughter).
Story_ID: 28302
Speaker 1: Did he [her father, Willie Lee Jones] serve in the military at all?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: Because when he was young, he had an injury on his leg that has reoccurred, I guess. It's an injury that, I think it took him--his grandmother, he talks about that a lot. His grandmother took him to the hospital for years to get treatment on that leg. And so, they used to call him cripple hen because they had a little strut because of that leg. And, and so, over the years, he, you know, would care for it, and recently, in the last three years, he hit again, he hit his leg gain, and it became, you know, infected. So it has like a chronic infection on the leg. He's 84 years old. But every time we go to the doctor, the doctor said--we used to have the doctors look, and he--and it's been something he's had for, since he was about four or six years old. And, you know, after he was out of the hospital and everything, he'd been treating it himself if it gets infected, and so. And the doctor--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: It's a chronic infection, I mean that can't be cured?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's--it's an area on his leg that's weak. And if he hits it or something, it may, you know, a wound might develop. So he had no problems with it. It's just he would hop on it, you know. But in the last three or four years, he was treating it, and it became very infected, and we were really afraid that he was gonna lose the leg. But he, we were able to find a doctor who was working with him, and now his leg is just fine. So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he's 84 years old.
Speaker 1: So all his, his whole life he tried to treat it himself, is what you're saying?
Speaker 2: He has been taking care of it himself. And every time we'd go to the doctor, the doctor says, whatever you're doing, keep doing (laughter). And so--
Speaker 1: It didn't work though (laughter).
Speaker 2: I said, what? You know, so, but it's--and so I was concerned, you know, when I looked at it three years--two years ago. And it looked, didn't look right. And so we started really going to the doctor, and going, trying to get some additional help on it 'cause the local doctor was saying that. And so we got some--but they were still the same thing. The wound center in Macon, Georgia, this critical center, healthcare center, same thing. All that they can, and so, he has a chronic--she says it's a chronic infection and just keep, keep it clean and keep it--
Speaker 1: It's actually a wound that won't heal.
Speaker 2: It's on his leg in the front part.
Speaker 1: It's like an ulcer or something or--
Speaker 2: Well, it opened up before--at first it was just a lesion. Then he wouldn't show it to anybody. We just knew he had it, and he was treating it with methylaide (ph.) and different things, keeping the--antibiotics on it and so forth. But I think he--I don't know whether he was getting a little dementia or what or he was just concerned about it, but he showed it to me. I would go home, and he wouldn't show it to anybody, but he showed it to me. And when I saw it, it had started to open up, and I got scared. And we went to the doctor and started getting additional treatment for it. And so, and it started getting better, getting all of the infection out of it.
Speaker 1: So it's fine--you say it's fine today?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: It's healed now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's much better now. And he--it's not like it was. It's totally different. He's not hopping on it, and it's healed.
Speaker 1: But he can, he can never really heal it right?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: It would never really heal up?
Speaker 2: It has, it started to close. Before it closed, and, you know, he had--it was okay. But if he hits it or something, it might open back up. And so, but the doctors didn't want to close completely this time because they wanna continue to clean it, you know, get in and clean it out and treat it. So, I think it's healing on the inside. The problem was, I think, it was closing up and still not healed on the inside. So, it's better now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28303
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No (laughter), no. I know both of them really liked to dance, and back at that time, they used to go to these dances. And so both of them--they try even now, at 80 years old. The church had a dance, and my mother [Alice Jacobs] has a little cane (laughter), and my father [Willie Lee Jones]. And they would get out and try to show everybody how to really dance, 'cause they say people don't know how to dance these days. So, so I have a picture of that. Maybe I'll send you a picture of them dancing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I know they had to meet in town there, growing up since they were in the same little town--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but is there a story about how they fell in love or what, anything?
Speaker 2: No, not that I know of. I have to find that. I just know they were dating each other. They were dating, met at a dance hall, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: And they liked the same thing, I guess, liked dancing.
Speaker 1: So did they get married in the late '40's [1940s] or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they got married in, yeah, about '48' [1948] or '49' [1949], something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: I should know that date (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, well, when you consider their personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they walk, talk, what they're interested in, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I take after my mother, yeah. A lot of people say I look like her, and especially, when I was younger, and she's more, very decisive and take charge. So.
Story_ID: 28304
Speaker 1: Okay, now can you name your siblings for us and tell us where you fall in the order?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, my sister, Wilhelmena, it's W-I-L-H-E-L-M-E-N-A, Wilhelmena Jones Hill is the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm next, Jeanette. Willie, my brother who just died, Willie Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he wasn't a junior then. He was--
Speaker 2: Well, he was Willie Cleveland Jones, Jr. And that was all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They just changed the middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I have Angela Jones Hill. She's next and my youngest brother is Danny, D-A-N-N-Y, Lee, L-E-E, Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My two sisters' married names are Hill. But they are not related. The Hill's they married are not related (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, okay. So, now, so this was your household growing up. Did any grandparents or other relatives live with you growing up?
Speaker 2: Not in house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had two sisters that died between--there was eight years between me and my brother, Willie. And between that time, there were two sisters that died, one that had pneumonia, Marie. She was about four years younger than me. And right after that my mother [Alice Jacobs] had another baby, Vera, V-E-R-A. And she, she only lived about nine months, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then after that, then she had Willie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28305
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Do I have the early--
Speaker 1: An earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest, oh. Yeah, I have a lot of 'em. I think about Christmas, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, no, "an" earliest childhood memory, the first thing that you remember, "an" earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Just one (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well, the first thing, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Whatever is first (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess it's still Christmas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Under the tree. I remember, the earliest I can remember is crawling under the bed in my mother's [Alice Jacobs] room and I saw a string, and I pulled the string. And it said, "moo". And I bumped my head 'cause it scared me, and then I got up from under the bed, and I never went back. But then I remember that Christmas, my sister that died, Marie, she had a toy, and it was cow. And when you pulled it, it says, "moo, moo", and so that's it. But I never made the connection that, about that Santa Claus didn't bring it, you know, that it was under the bed (laughter). But that was one thing that stood out. And I think about my father [Willie Lee Jones] always carrying us fishing with him. I went fishing with him, and then I remember my sister and I, for Christmas, we got, we got guns, holsters 'cause I grew up with my cousins.  And all of the cousins were male, and I had a gun holsters. I had black. She had brown. And my father drove the car while we walked, you know, with our friends, but he sort of followed us to make sure everybody was safe.
Story_ID: 28306
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sights. I, the sound that I hear are trains, you know, train tracks. The train--
Speaker 1: Did a train run like near your home?
Speaker 2: Near our home, yeah. And we used to play on the, on the railroad track, walk on the railroad track. It's a wonder I still have legs or ankles (laughter). But we used to walk on the thing, balance ourselves and walk on the rails. And we never played chicken because we could hear the train coming. But I think about that, and then I played with a lot of my cousins who are male. And so we used to climb trees and we would, used to walk in the--between the trees there were little mud waterholes or something. We'd walk out there. And I'd, you know, I just remember cutting my feet a lot 'cause I was barefooted a lot, couldn't wait till summer to take off my shoes and to run and have fun in the summers. So the sounds would be trains. And just playing outside.
Story_ID: 28307
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe your neighborhood for us? Did you, you know, what kind of house did you live in and was there a name for your neighborhood or--
Speaker 2: Not really. It's just everybody, you knew everybody. And when you--everybody, I think people in that area worked at that factory. And you knew everybody, not everybody, but a lot of them worked at the factory. And so, and then some went on to Blue Bird Body Company. And so there's Pearson Mills, I think that was the name of it where they made the baskets.
Speaker 1: Was that nearby?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was nearby where we lived.
Speaker 1: About how far would you say?
Speaker 2: About a five-minute walk.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And so, in the area where I grew up, a lot of people knew each other and you walked and the roads were not paved, so they were--but they were good roads. You know, they didn't have a lot of holes in them.
Speaker 1: Were they gravel or were they--
Speaker 2: No, they were sand or--
Speaker 1: --just some sand.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I guess they had red clay in Georgia. So they were hard, sandy but not a lot of holes and stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so there was no name for your--now, I imagine that Fort Valley [Georgia] was segregated and white people lived one place and black people lived another--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I would guess. But there's not name for the black community.
Speaker 2: Well, at different sections. Like you had a place, Gaino (ph.) was one area. Vineville [Georgia] was another area, and this was over between where that mill was and where Fort Valley State [University] was, so it was just that area. And it wasn't called--Vineville was over here and Gaino was back there. So this was sort of like in between them. So right behind Vineville, so, I don't--
Speaker 1: So, alright, okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't know what section they would call it, unless I've forgotten it. So, I'll ask that question.
Speaker 1: So, was there some kind--did the railroad tracks separate black and white people or was there any physical barrier?
Speaker 2: Not really, but it just ran through the town. So you have blacks on both side of the railroad track, and so. In fact, my aunts lived across the railroad track, and we were over on one side, and it was just, just the way it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28308
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Church, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: St. John--well, St. Peter AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church was the church that all my family members are members of.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my great grandfather used to, as I understand it, used to go down and build the fire, you know, when they had to heat up the church, when they didn't have a heater. So, my great, great grandfather used to do that. And his name was Dad Mathis. His name was Willie Mathis, you know, but they--everybody called him dad all over town. They just called him dad.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Okay, so did you have any special role in the church when you were a youngster growing up?
Speaker 2: I just went to Sunday school, and when I went to college, I served briefly as a secretary, you know, for the church.
Speaker 1: You didn't sing in the choir or anything or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --have a youth choir or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did all that little--the usual stuff, you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, I'm asking about the usual stuff, you know. I'm not asking about anything that's so special that nobody else could do it. I, really, I'm asking about your life and what you did. So.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, I participated in Sunday school and sang in the choir, did the Easter program. And, and I attended church, of course. And later on, when I was in college, I served as a volunteer secretary. And so--
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite pastor--
Speaker 2: A favorite what?
Speaker 1: Pastor?
Speaker 2: Pastor.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I know AME switches them up, right? You don't have the same one--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're itinerant (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, I volunteered with Rev. George, Ulrich George. I think he was from--it's U-L-R-I-C-H, I think, George. And I think, he's died since then. He was in Atlanta [Georgia] for a long time. And I believe he was from the Islands.
Speaker 1: That sounds about right with the name Ulrich.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ulrich, yeah.
Speaker 1: There aren't too many Ulrich's that I know, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so he, I think he was. But he was a favorite, and, then, of course, I went on to college and moved here to Huntsville [Alabama] and still active with the AME church.

Speaker 1: Where did you start school, grade school?
Speaker 2: High school?
Speaker 1: No, grade school.
Speaker 2: Grade school, Peach County High--what is it? I guess it was Hunt Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Hunt Elementary School, okay.
Speaker 2: And then Hunt High School.
Speaker 1: So, did you go to kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Un-un, no.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: I don't think they had it then.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you started right up in the first grade?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, first grade.
Speaker 1: Now, could you read already before you started school?
Speaker 2: I probably could read and count because my father [Willie Lee Jones] used to smoke cigarettes, and we didn't like him smoking cigarettes, and so we would hide cigarettes from him. And so he knew we were hiding cigarettes, I guess. So he would pay us--he said, anybody can find him a cigarette, he'd pay us a nickel or something. So, (laughter) and he would also make us count, you know, we had to add in our heads, like you cannot use your fingers. You had to add it up in your head. So we learned a lot of mathematics and other things from our parents, you know. And I think he was more of the science oriented, even though he didn't go to college. He was always showing us different things, how to do things, make things.
Speaker 1: For instance, you know--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: For instance?
Speaker 2: For instance, like he worked on his cars all the time, and he would make things work. And he'd show us how to do it, you know, he'd say, just do it like this. And he was always saying, use your head for something other than a hat rack. And different, you know, little sayings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he showed us a lot of little things to do.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay. Is there any particular thing that you liked to help your father [Willie Lee Jones] do?
Speaker 2: Now?
Speaker 1: No, when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, anything that I liked to help--well, he used to--and it's funny though. He used to always work on his car, and he would slide under the car. You know how they raise the car and I said, why, he doesn't worry about the car falling on him? So sometimes I would slide under there just to see what it was like. And I didn't help him. I was just nosy.
Speaker 1: You didn't hand him the tools or anything?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did. He would have--well, I guess you're right. I did help him.  He'd say, hand him this and that. So I helped him do that. It was easy for me to slide under there and hand him things. So.
Speaker 1: So you kind of learned about how the car worked by--
Speaker 2: I didn't learn. I just helped (laughter); assisted. So.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: I knew the different wrenches though.
Story_ID: 28310
Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I really hated if I had to miss school for anything 'cause I felt like I missed out on something if I had to stay home for any reason. So, and I remember that, you know. I hated to miss school.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have favorite teachers in school?
Speaker 2: I had several.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a teacher who died in sixth grade. And at the time, she was just, she was just everything you wanted in terms of--she was friendly, she was beautiful. And she was so pleasant, and she was encouraging. And she was, I think she was a relative of the founder of the school. So.
Speaker 1: Now, who was--so she died while she was your teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she died while we were in school. Not long, we didn't--she died before I graduated from, before I got into high school.
Speaker 1: Was she a Hunt?
Speaker 2: She was a Hunt.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Hunt (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Now, that makes sense. That's good enough. That's what a sixth grader would know her as.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mrs. Hunt, yeah.
Speaker 1: And who was the, now, the founder of the school was a Hunt, right?
Speaker 2: Henry Alexander Hunt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Also the founder of Fort Valley State [University], one of the founders of Fort Valley State University.
Speaker 1: So Henry Alexander Hunt, he's a local hero in the black community, I guess because he founded the school.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah, I went to school with some of his grand kids.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories about him that are passed down, any stories about Henry Hunt that are passed down?
Speaker 2: No, not--just, I just know relatives that, you know, people who were relatives of his, that we were in school together. That's all. The history of Hunt, no. It's written down somewhere (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I'll look at it, so.
Speaker 1: Did they try to teach you--did they let the children you know, you know, who he was?
Speaker 2: The kids in the college and the university?
Speaker 1: Well, no, at your level in grade school, when you were in grade school?
Speaker 2: In grade school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They probably did. I just, you know, I should have refreshed myself on that, but I didn't look back at that.
Speaker 1: I just wondered, you know, 'cause--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I don't--
Speaker 1: --you know, it takes a lot to found a school, and somebody like that--
Speaker 2: It does.
Speaker 1: --you know, you would think, I've heard--
Speaker 2: It's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --lots of stories about people that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and because the school and the, the elementary school and the high school and the college, all there, we participated in Founders Day, and a lot of, a lot of what was celebrated, the host, the black community would participate in it. So it was almost like the, we went to college there before we got to college, you know, when we participated in different things that were open to the community.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was, would this take place in the summertime, just before--
Speaker 2: What? The Founder's Day?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Founder's Day.
Speaker 2: No, no, it--they would have special events, I guess, and the kids would go over there sometimes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it wasn't an annual event like the Founder's Day?
Speaker 2: Not that I can remember, but at Fort Valley State, yeah, they had Founder's Day, but I don't remember us being in elementary school going over as a group, if that's what you're saying.
Speaker 1: Right, I was thinking--
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember that.
Story_ID: 28311
Speaker 1: When you were in grade school, can you remember a time when you think you were first keenly interested in science?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, I had, in grade school, in the seventh grade, I had a teacher, Mr. Reed, and I think that's when I became interested.
Speaker 1: Was it, you say Reed?
Speaker 2: Reed, R-E-E-D.
Speaker 1: Okay, Mr. Reed.
Speaker 2: And we did several things. But I became more interested in the tenth grade when I took a class in biology from Mrs. Gilbert, G-I-L-B-E-R-T.
Speaker 1: Now, this is Hunt High School by now, right?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: This is Hunt High School now?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: It's in the same building or is there a different--
Speaker 2: It was a different--you had different buildings, you know, have like different wings, A, B, C, D wings, and then you had the high school part. And then you had another part, elementary part, a little bit down the street. So, it was--so it wasn't like you were that far apart.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, was there, so before the tenth grade, you said, your teacher, Mr. Reed, you know, did some science experiments and--
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Your teacher, Mr. Reed, did some experiments when you were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did a few--
Speaker 1: --in sixth grade?
Speaker 2: -- in the seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Seventh grade?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, what kind of thing did he do, if you can remember?
Speaker 2: I don't know what, just like little physics, some physics things and just interested, things you talk about, nature, science, outside. I don't remember anything particular. But I just remember--maybe he was the one who was encouraging me to pursue science. I don't know. But I remember that science became of interest there. So maybe he is the one who saw some potential.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you interested in the natural environment when you were growing up, you know, 'cause I know there's a lot of nature around there, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Fort Valley [Georgia]. So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I was. I used to wash dishes and sing to the birds (laughter). I was so short, and I used to have to stand up on a stool to wash dishes. And I used to sing to the black birds, and I remember that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, what would you--would they sing back? Is that what it was or--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know, I just used to--
Speaker 1: You'd just sing a regular song or was there something the bird--
Speaker 2: I remember the words. I'd say, "Hi, Mr. Blackbird, Hi, Mr. Crow--" (laughter). I remember that first part of it. I don't remember all of it, but I remember singing to the birds, you know. And, 'cause we were just very, you know, I would go inside to do whatever I was assigned to do. If I was assigned to wash dishes, I'd run in to do that, and then I'd be back outside. And we used to skate, skate a lot, and how did we skate in Fort Valley? You know, they had this area where they had cement, right, not too far behind our house where they had a storage area. And so everybody would get skates, and we would farther out there and skate,--
Speaker 1: Was this part of a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --roller skates.
Speaker 1: --the lot of somebody's business or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, where the Pearson Basket place, they had the area where they had the baskets in storage. And then, I guess they had cement, a cemented area that was available, and we made it a area where we would skate and play hockey (laughter). And whenever I tell people I played hockey when I was young, they said, nah, you're kidding. I say, no, we had skates and we had a stick, and we would hit something back and forth, way back then.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it a wooden--did you hit a ball or something slower--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, we'd just--
Speaker 1: --something that's like a beacon.
Speaker 2: --make up something, a top or something, and we'd hit it. One team would hit it this way, and we'd hit it that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On roller skates. And we had a stick, and so it's a wonder I didn't, haven't killed myself (laughter), but I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28312
Speaker 1: How did you do in school? What were your grades like?
Speaker 2: In school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Mostly A's, and I finished the top female in my high school class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had mostly all A's except for--my physics teacher died. And I used to be, I was his assistant. And so I had all A's, but when he died, he was trying to cut the limbs off of a tree, and he fell out the tree. I think it was the blood pressure or something. So I used to be his assistant, and they brought someone in who didn't know physics. And she gave me a B or a C. I had all A's, but she didn't know physics, and so what it did was, it made me number three instead of Number One or number--and it made her brother Number Two. So--
Speaker 1: Her brother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, her brother (laughter). So--
Speaker 1: That sounds like--were you suspicious of that?
Speaker 2: I didn't, you know, all I--I was still--we were still in shock 'cause Mr. Stemberts (ph.), you know, was a favorite, and I worked with him. And I did all, I set up all the physics experiments and that was just the semester before we graduated. And she did that. And so instead of that--I think we got graded every six weeks or something. And so for that six-week period that she was in charge, she gave me a B or a C, I don't know what. Whatever it was, it moved me to the highest female, but still in the third--I was--graduated third in my class.
Story_ID: 28313
Speaker 1: Were you involved in activities in high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: Student library assistant. I just liked to read, I read a lot of Greek Mythology and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I worked there in the library.
Speaker 1: Now, why were you drawn to Greek Mythology, do you think?
Speaker 2: I don't know, imagination, I guess. And I've got a vivid imagination, and I like arts and I draw. And I wrote. Sometimes I write poetry, so.
Speaker 1: Did you, in those, now, when you graduated, you graduated from high school in 1968?
Speaker 2: Sixty eight [1968], uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so that's--did you have favorite poets? Did they, did you read the works of--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did you read the--
Speaker 2: Endymion [by John Keats], yeah, and Phillis Wheatley is the one I read. I remember her, I liked her, and Robert--
Speaker 1: Frost?
Speaker 2: Not Frost. The love story man (laughter). I can't think of his name either.
Speaker 1: This is, somebody's that's alive now?
Speaker 2: Nah, un-un.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just remember Endymion, and I--
Speaker 1: Endymion, now, what is that? That's a--
Speaker 2: That's a poem.
Speaker 1: Poem, by--
Speaker 2: I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Endymion, okay.
Speaker 2: But I read a lot of, just poetry and stuff, and I read a lot of books. I remember "Anne Boleyn" that was the one. Maybe I liked tragedies or something (unclear). And--
Speaker 1: That's one of the wives of Henry VIII, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Phillis Wheatley, I say I liked hers, Sojourner Truth, a lot of black history things I read.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're getting--you were getting black history in school?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: You were getting black history in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I don't--we did it the usual way they study black history during February. But the books, you know, because I was in the library. I used to take the books and read them between classes or while I was working if I didn't have anything else to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were basically, you said so a lot of the information you were generating yourself because you had access to the books and would read?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it wasn't that the school was teaching black history as such?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a very good teach--the school was very, you know, I think I was fortunate because my high school was located near Fort Valley State [University], and many of the professors who came to Fort Valley, their spouses would work at the high school 'cause in--I had the, I was fortunate to have French in the sixth grade. And we had a sixth grade teacher who came, and she, she taught us French for a whole year in the sixth grade. We walked in the classroom, and we spoke French from the moment we entered her class until we left. And we learned a lot of the folk songs and a lot of the customs of, of French people. I actually think she had some French background in her. So, and that was one part of school that I really cherished. Then I had French again in the 11th grade.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And then Spanish.
Story_ID: 28314
Speaker 1: What about popular culture when you were growing up? Did you get a chance to go to the movies any or did--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you like music, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did. We did the movies every Saturday, you know, Saturday afternoon, we'd walk, and go to the movies. It was, of course, 25 cents (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was this a black theater or was it a--
Speaker 2: Well, they had one theater, you know. The blacks were in the balcony, I think. Yeah, we were in the balcony, and white were in the lower part. And we liked it like that 'cause we'd thrown popcorn down (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I've heard this story a lot.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Say what?
Speaker 1: I've heard a lot of people say that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a good time and so, I think when they--it sort of like faded, faded away after they integrated it. And, but it was fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, and what about music? Did you, was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Music.
Speaker 2: Music. Oh, well, I--it was interesting that I had exposure to a wide variety of music, not just black music, but country-Western, pop music, a lot of Elvis Presley, and we actually used to go to all of his movies, you know, the movies he had and enjoyed them. So, and, of course, being in Fort Valley [Georgia], we had James Brown and Otis Redding, Sam Cooke. They were right in the local area and Jackie Wilson. So we used to imitate--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --I used to sing Jackie Wilson songs all the time.
Speaker 1: So you say they were close by. They actually lived close by?
Speaker 2: In Macon [Georgia], yeah, they used to come, they used to frequent--come to the Macon area, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Sam Cooke, Otis Redding was from Macon. And so all of those were very popular in the area, so, and they would come to Fort Valley, to different clubs there.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But we heard them because my parents, they would go and see them, you know. And so, we'd go.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was your favorite Jackie Wilson?
Speaker 2: I liked Sam Cooke--
Speaker 1: Sam Cooke, okay.
Speaker 2: --Jackie Wilson, but I really appreciated Otis Redding. So I liked 'em all. So, I don't know which one's favorite. I just liked them, all of those, James Brown--we used to always, couldn't have a party--we couldn't have a party without a James Brown record. A party wasn't a party without it.
Story_ID: 28315
Speaker 1: We, you know, in the summertime, we had yard parties, right? So we didn't have big places to go and rent to have parties. So you'd go over to your friend's house, and they'd have a light outside, a little light, not much (laughter). But used to have yard parties outside, and they were wonderful parties, you know. And they played the music, so.
Speaker 2: Okay, so when you were a senior in high school, you say you were the top female student to graduate, now, in--did you have, how--did you have like good laboratory facilities in high school, when you look back on it, in terms of science preparation? Do you think you were really prepared well?
Speaker 1: Yes, my high school did. I know that's not typical. Again, I say, I don't know that the school, all schools were like that. And ours may have been an exception because we were so near Fort Valley State [University], but I had trigonometry. I had physics and I had biology. I had many of the hard sciences to lay the foundation for me. So.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so, now, what kind of counseling did you get about school, about college?
Speaker 1: Well, again, the person I talked about, Mr. Stembirch (ph.), he used to talk to me, the individual--not necessarily the counselor, but the teachers used to encourage us in terms of, you need to go to college. And you need to think about majoring in this area 'cause you're good in this area. And so that was a lot of encouragement, but I guess the most encouragement I got was from my father [Willie Lee Jones] because he, he just felt like education was so essential. And he always talked to us about going and finishing our education.
Speaker 2: Okay, did your--now, you have an older sister?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, did she go to college?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she finished. She's a--
Speaker 2: So you already had somebody in the family in college?
Speaker 1: Um-hum, she was in college. She's three years and, she was already in college two years ahead of me. So.
Speaker 2: Now, where did she go?
Speaker 1: Fort Valley State.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now, did you consider going to some other school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I considered Spelman College briefly.
Speaker 2: But what was the clincher for Fort Valley State?
Speaker 1: Well, because it was nearby and there were very good things. There were good teachers there. Many of the teachers in my church, so that had some impact.
Speaker 2: Okay. Alright, so people knew you already, and you knew them--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: I already knew them, they knew me.
Story_ID: 28316
Speaker 1: Okay, so how was it? Was Fort Valley State [University] about the way you thought it was gonna be?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was. It was very enjoyable. I enjoyed being at Fort Valley State University. It was--
Speaker 1: Now, did you live at home?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And walked to school. I was like five minutes away.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you wanna live on campus? (laughter)
Speaker 2: No (laughter). I did when I pledged for two weeks, I guess (laughter). But not, I really didn't have that desire. You know, I got everything I needed, and I went to the dorms. I didn't see any big advantage of staying in the dorms when I could be at home eating my mother's [Alice Jacobs] cooking and stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did you decide to major on in, at Fort Valley State?
Speaker 2: I initially said natural science, and then I went into biology, specialized, because natural science was too broad. And I just wanted to specific, you know, specifically go into the biological sciences.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in natural, if you major in natural science, you're preparing yourself to be a teacher, basically, is that it?
Speaker 2: I was. I was preparing myself to be a teacher, to be in biology, biology education, really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I did take, take teacher education courses. So it was like biology education.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well, what if--I know you pledged AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] in college, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And did you do that right away or did you wait a while?
Speaker 2: My sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Sophomore year, okay.
Speaker 2: I had biology majors encouraging me. And so, I think there may have been one person in my family who was an AKA then. But she wasn't an influence. It was a friend of mine who was the influence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, again, our Sunday school teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so, now, who were the significant teachers at Fort Valley State, I guess, in terms of---
Speaker 2: Significant teachers?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in terms, you know, that they really--that you really back on--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That influenced me?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There are several. I worked for an artist, Mr. Dallas. I had a job with him. So he used to do sculptures and so forth. So I talked with him a lot. So that was outside of my major, but that was my interest, you know, how to--
Speaker 1: Did you still draw?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I took a course to, so they could evaluate it, evaluate your art talent, and they were--admitted me to this art school. But my father [Willie Lee Jones] said, no. Well, you gotta go to college (laughter), but, but so, he was an influence. And my science teacher, biology department chair, Dr. Morehead.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a biologist and Dr. Steel, Robert Steel, he's a physicist.
Speaker 1: He's a physicist, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And Dr. Black.
Speaker 1: And what did Dr. Black teach?
Speaker 2: Dr. Black?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Human physiologist, human anatomy and physiology.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in terms of mathematics, did you have calculus in college?
Speaker 2: I had, yes, calculus. What was it? Theory? I had logic, and I had calculus, I had trigonometry. And, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I guess Algebra.
Story_ID: 28317
Speaker 1: Now, this is, now, you started out--I neglected to ask you about this, but in '68' [1968], Dr. King [Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated while you were in high school, I guess. This is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --just before you graduated, right?
Speaker 2: I remember it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was--how did people take it?
Speaker 2: I remember that day because we were walking down the hall and a teacher was running up and down the hall. And I remember my homeroom teacher, we were in the hall, and she said, she said something, and she was just, you know, crying. And so I remember that day. And I remember where I was.
Speaker 1: Where were you?
Speaker 2: In my--at least when she told me, I was in the hallway.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there a memorial service on the campus for him or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think we had a assembly, pulled everybody into assembly.
Speaker 1: Now, this is '68' [1968], now, when you graduated, but through you high school career, I mean through the four years you were in high school, there are all these changes in the South. You had SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] down here and people organizing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --voter registration. There was violence, people were killed--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hosea Williams came through when this (unclear) yeah. We had a lot of that, but it was almost like Fort Valley [Georgia] was isolated from a lot of the activity in terms of the, you know, the protests and so forth, but we remember--I remember Hosea Williams and, in something that he was doing. And so we saw it on TV, but it wasn't, not like it was there in Fort Valley.
Speaker 1: Did you know, well, did you know--did any of your teachers and the people at church, you know, participate? Did they go to Selma [Alabama] and march from Selma--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: --to Montgomery [Alabama]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I can't remember any of them doing that. There probably were, but I just don't remember.
Speaker 1: Were adults voting when you were growing up in Fort Valley?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, they were.
Speaker 1: So politically, Fort Valley is dominated by, I'm sure it was dominated by white people, but--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --black people could vote in Fort Valley?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, what happened in 1972, when I went--well, '68' [1968] when I went to Fort Valley, then you had black--white mayor, but you had a change taking place. And when I was in school, we did have some people running for office, and we actually did voter registration and had people, you know, letting the dogs off on us, you know, when we went to try to get people registered to vote because you had so many blacks in Fort Valley who dominated, you know, the population of blacks was much higher than whites. And so we started getting 'em registered to vote. And the backlash from that was that we had a white faculty member to file a suit against Fort Valley State saying that Fort Valley State was too black. And that's when that whole--I don't know if you remember, the whole issue came up with Fort Valley State being in court 'cause we had a teacher on campus at the university to file a lawsuit against the university saying it was too black. And that was because we were out there registering more blacks to vote. And they voted in, blacks into certain positions in the city.
Speaker 1: Now, I remember dialogue in the early to 'mid-70's [1970s] about these states claiming that they wanted to integrate the black college, I mean, you know, and there was fear that the black colleges would be eliminated as such by, you know, being completely integrated.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they were afraid of, because we had these students at Fort Valley State [University], that the students were gonna take over the city, and, which eventually, you didn't have a takeover, but you had a lot of the students being, having an influence because they were out there helping to get more people registered to vote and then helping them to go down and vote and voting in different people. So, I think that was the fear, and so to counteract that I--this is just my thinking, that they filed that suit against Fort Valley State because, and saying that it was too black. We had to go to court, and I think I graduated before the suit was over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the fellow that did it, that filed the suit?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, but I remember--it was several of us were in school at that time. I don't know if you know Thomas Doerch (ph.)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He's, Tommy was in school with me. And--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was influential in a hundred black men.
Speaker 2: One hundred black men.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So we were all in there together, working and trying to get the vote, voter registration in Fort Valley going. So. And we attended court when they filed the lawsuit. Then, of course, we graduated and went on to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have an organization of students, organization, I mean by name? I mean a name of a group that--
Speaker 2: When we were doing that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you and Thomas Dorch (ph.)--
Speaker 2: No, I just know we were some of the ones who were involved in it, and I don't know if his fraternity--I think it was Alpha Phi Omega, I don't know if they were doing it. But I don't know of an organization that was spearheading it, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: But it was probably was a NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], so, but I just know we were a group of college students helping.
Speaker 1: Were any faculty members advising the students--
Speaker 2: Yes, we did, Isaac Crumbly, Dr. Isaac Crumbly in the biology department and botany.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was in biology and botany, and he was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, botany. My, I worked with him.
Speaker 1: Taking the lead on Civil Rights?
Speaker 2: Yeah. He was very much involved in different things, not only the political part, but also in--we used to what you call "Christmas Cheer", where we raised money to give kids who needed, you know, during Christmastime, different things, fruit, candy and toys, new toys and so forth. So we did that during the holidays. We did that for about three years before I graduated. So you called it "Christmas Cheer".
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a program that he initiated too?
Speaker 2: I worked with him.
Speaker 1: Isaac Crumbly, okay.
Speaker 2: Isaac Crumbly, yeah, he and his wife.
Story_ID: 28318
Speaker 1: In terms of Ohio State [University], did they recruit you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They, Ohio State had a program where they were inviting the top five students from HBCU's to come to campus. And they had a big recruitment day called "A Graduate and Professional Visitation Days. So I was selected as one of the five students from our school. We traveled there and we visited the department that we were interested in. And they admitted us and gave us a fellowship. Those who, you know, qualified, you know, had competitive applications were offered a fellowship. So I got a five-year fellowship. So (laughter), I think, I look back on it, and I say, why did I get a five-year fellowship for, 'cause--for a four-year program. It takes four years to get a Masters and PhD, but they gave me a--I had a five-year fellowship. And so, actually, it was in, you just had to maintain your grade-point average. So they paid me a stipend. They paid everything. If I had a book fee, they paid for that. They paid for my cap and gown. So I just had to maintain my grade-point average. And I finished in three and a half years.
Speaker 1: And did they still keep paying you?
Speaker 2: They paid me to go to school (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Did they still keep paying you after you graduated (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, they, I had five years if I needed it. Now, I imagine because I came from Fort Valley State University, a small school, 2,500 students and I went to The Ohio State University, 69,000 students at the time that I went there, they probably thought I needed more time, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And actually, my first quarter there, I was placed in all of the tough classes. I had, I was in the, a class called experimental phycology. I had the physiology classes, and I had mycology classes. And they were--
Speaker 1: Was this by your choice or--
Speaker 2: No, you know, they suggested the classes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, those are the toughest classes when you look back on it?
Speaker 2: Yes. They were. One of the classes was experimental phycology was a class for PhD candidates. I was a Master candidate, and so the class was only eight students in it. And experimental phycology, I hadn't even had a phycology class. So this was experimental phycology, and I had, you know, assignments that you had to go out and, in nature, isolate Axenic cultures of algae from nature and, you had to get the samples, bring 'em back in class and take the cell of an Alga and drag it through the media and create an Axenic culture, Axenic, meaning without bacteria in it. So, so, of course, it was challenging but I did it, you know, I did all of the courses, but the professor was interesting.
Story_ID: 28319
Speaker 1: And it's one, its one story about graduate school I'll never forget, and I talk about it--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because it was a person--and I guess I have to talk about a class first to let you know. It was a different class. There were only eight in it. There were three students who were Masters students, me, a white female and a white male. And the other five were PhD candidates. And every time we--we had different things to do, but every time we would have papers, the teacher--I would sit here, and there white female, who was Kathy, a good friend of mine, she was sitting across from me. It was a long table. When the professor handed out papers, he would hand Kathy her papers, and he'd hold them until she grasped the papers. When he handed to me, when my hand went out, he would drop the papers before I got them. So, and he did that for maybe three times. Then I picked up on what he was doing, and then whenever he'd hand papers out, I would turn my head away, and I wouldn't look until he laid them down. And then I'd get my paper and then pass them on. So it was, it was something that he did. And that carried over into the class, you know. Kathy and I worked on all of our things. It was an experimental class so we had projects. And we worked together. All of the labs we did together. But whenever I got my lab back, I had a minus one, and she had a perfect paper. So I got nine and she got 10. And she said, why did you get the nine? I said, I don't know. And this all, 'cause we worked together on it. So the final, we did that all semester, and so the final exam in the class was for us to read five papers. When I was in school, I had a photostatic memory, you know, because I was, I was in Ohio, and my folks were in Georgia. I didn't have anything else to do. I studied. And so, I did the five papers, and so we scheduled--only had one hour to take the exam. When I went for my one hour exam, I go in, and he says to me that, he said he wanted to ask me some questions. And he said, you're my first experience with a black person. Do you mind if I ask you questions? And I'm, I'm 20 years, and I said, okay, I don't mind you asking questions. I'm naive. He said, well, I notice that you have friends, you have black friends that come to the lab, and you have friends, you're friends with Kathy, and you have white friends. And he said, if your friends were going--which friends would you go with if you were going somewhere? Who would you choose to go with? And I said, it depends on where they're going. And he said, well, say for instance a party. I said, well, if they're going to a party, I'd probably go with my black friends because we like the same kind of music, and I've been to some of the other parties, and I'd probably go with my black friends. He said, okay, that's fine. And then he went on to ask me, what was my--what did I think about whites in the North and whites in the South? What was the difference? And I said, well, I've experienced both, and I said, basically, I don't see--there's no difference.  There's some feelings that are covert, some things are covert and some things are overt. Now, where did I get that from? I had been looking at the Watergate series, and so those two terms came up, overt and covert actions. And so, and I was really experiencing that. And so then he went on to drill me on, until about 30 minutes. And then he said, okay, let's go for the papers. And we had to talk about the papers. So he asked me questions about the papers. I answered them all. So I said, okay, Dr. Hoststetter, (ph.) at the end. He said, well, thank you, Jeannette. And I said, oh, what did I make? And he said, well, you got a B-plus. I said, I got a B-plus? I said, how did I get a B-plus? He said, well, some of your questions, you answered them, but you left a little bit to be desired. And I said, oh, okay, how could I challenge that? It was just subjective opinion. So, at the end of the semester, I got all A's and one B-plus from him. So it was my, that was my first experience at Ohio State, and it was challenging. It was the toughest semester, and the rest were fine.
Story_ID: 28320
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were saying this one professor--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --didn't really wanna give all A's anyway?
Speaker 2: I think he was trying to measure, and he was a new professor, and I later learned that he was up for tenure. He did not get tenured. And he actually was dismissed from The Ohio State [University], and he lost his wife too. He went out on a trip. His wife threw his clothes out (laughter). So it was poetic justice.
Speaker 1: He was going through a bad period.
Speaker 2: I guess (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so, alright, but the rest of the--you said the other two and a half years were fairly--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I enjoyed it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --easy by comparison?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at Ohio State [University] is a very enriching experience for me. I really don't even regret what happened with Dr. Hoststetter and what happened in that class 'cause it was a growing experience. It was my first experience with any kind of racism, really, even having grown up in the South. I had not come, been confronted that way and experienced someone doing that to me directly, so.
Story_ID: 28321
Speaker 1: So, but other than that, Ohio State [University] exposed me to so many different things. I had the experience of working with Dr. Frank Hale.
Speaker 2: Oh, Dr. Frank Hale.
Speaker 1: And he was a wonderful person.
Speaker 2: Tell us about Dr. Frank Hale. I know about him, but tell people who he is?
Speaker 1: Oh, Dr. Frank Hale was, he was the former president of Oakwood University, and he left Oakwood and went to Ohio State University and served as the, I believe he was the graduate dean and associate provost. And he developed the graduate visitation days program, professional visitation days program where he recruited--he put a strategy together to recruit minority talent from HBCUs around the country. So he selected 50 schools and invited five students, the top students from each of the schools. And he was really using the same strategy they used when they try to recruit football players. So they said, where's the talent? And instead of trying to get them to play football, he was finding the talent to bring them to a university so that they can get degrees in the sciences and math and engineering and the medical and health profession fields. So he was using that same strategy, and as a result, I think I was in the first, in one of the first classes he had, either first or second class of groups that he brought. But the year that I graduated, I believe that was the year that there were more blacks to graduate from, in a--with PhDs on the campus of any university, the largest number, I believe. And I don't know if that number has been topped since. So, it'll be interesting to find out. But I do know, as a result of his efforts, that year that I graduated, we had more blacks to receive PhDs from one university as a historic moment.
Speaker 2: Okay, and, of course, there's a Frank Hale Center at Ohio State now. He's, you know, they honored him a couple of years ago there at the school. He's well known.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes. And he wrote a book and he--we worked with him, after I got there, and I helped to, helped him with the program when I was there, and then when I came to Alabama A and M, for 13, 14 years I took students back and participated in the program.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that was an important move, and I guess--now, that's something, that's an initiative taken at a Big 10 school that allowed black undergraduate from the historically black colleges to get graduate degrees, get their PhDs--
Speaker 1: Advanced degrees and--
Speaker 2: --and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --health profession. They also went into dentistry and medicine too. So it was a wonderful opportunity, and I'm glad that they still have versions of that in place now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, so instead of like, just trying to figure out what you were gonna do, he provided the direct pipeline for you to come there and get what you need and--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright, and what he couldn't do is to make you qualified. You were already qualified, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's right (laughter). You have to have the grades. And so, what they were asking the schools to select their top candidates and top five students, and to bring them. And so when I went, our--well, when I even took students, I took--the students completed an application. We had the letter of recommendation and the transcripts. And so when we took the students, we almost--they already had everything in place, and it was just a matter of whether that department selected them or they were recruited by the graduate school, so.
Speaker 2: But it took a person like Dr. Frank Hale to make the connection because he knew the historically black colleges and he knew Ohio State.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, because he had been at Oakwood College, and he knew that there was talent. And, of course, people say, they can't find any qualified blacks in this area and that, but they could find football players, you know. And, but they can't find 'em in science and areas. He put a strategy together, and I think it's been emulated in some areas. But he did a fantastic job.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And he touched a lot of lives.
Speaker 2: Alright, and you seem every proud to have worked with him.
Speaker 1: Yes, I was honored. In fact, he, he wrote a book, and he mentioned our names in it, several of us who worked with him.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay--
Speaker 1: 'The Angels Watching Over Me', I think is the name of the book.
Story_ID: 28322
Speaker 1: Now, you are introduced to fungi study at Ohio State [University], right, that's when you first got interested in the study--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of fungi. Now, tell us about how that happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I took a course from Dr. Roland Seymour, and it was mycology class, and he--and I found that very interesting because we were able to integrate the class. It was field and lectures, and we went outside and hunted down mushrooms (laughter) and brought them back and, and we had the technical part, the theoretical part and the application. So I found it very interesting, the variety. And then I took a course from the department chair, Dr. Schmitt, John Schmitt, S-C-H-M-I-T-T, who was the, in medical mycology, and I had a borderline interest in health, the health profession and so forth. This was close to being in the health profession. And so I said, I took a very, an interest in pursuing a degree, specializing in medical mycology.
Speaker 1: So, just for the record, mycology is the study of fungi?
Speaker 2: Study of fungi, and medical mycology is the study of fungi that cause disease. And so this is a group of organisms that range in size from the very microscopic to the huge macroscopic puff balls. So, they have, it's a vast variety of organisms in this group.
Speaker 1: How big is a puff ball?
Speaker 2: Oh, they can be several meters in size, and then you have the smaller ones, the microscopic ones that you can only see with the naked--with the microscope, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, well, go on. I just wanted to make that clarification about what it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so a lot of research is still to be done in fun--with fungi that cause disease in man and other animals. And so I thought it was a great area to look at.
Story_ID: 28323
Speaker 1: Now, what is, what are some of the familiar diseases that are caused by fungi that, you know, in plants and animals?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the ones people mostly are familiar with are the, what they call the ringworm infections. That's the layman's term for it, but they are called tinea, T-I-N-E-A, but we know the laymen know ringworm, ringworm infections of the fingernails, toes, skin, hair, those kinds of infections are some of the typical ones, jock itch, that's another one.
Speaker 1: Athletes' foot is a--
Speaker 2: Athletes' foot--
Speaker 1: --part of it.
Speaker 2: --fungal infection. And ringworms on the body and so forth. So those are the typical ones. The others are some that are not so typical, but are very harmful and dangerous, sometimes fatal. Some such as the histoplasmosis, sometimes confused with tuberculosis. In some areas, you have the blastomycosis.
Speaker 1: So histoplasmosis, is that a lung infection by fungi?
Speaker 2: Yes, a respiratory, and--
Speaker 1: Respiratory, okay.
Speaker 2: --it, sometimes it has been misdiagnosed because you may have some scarring of the tissue and people might think you have tuberculosis but it may be histoplasmosis. The thing about fungal diseases is that treatment is not the same. Fungal diseases really have to have a drug that has a sulfur component on it that, so the things that would help bacterial infections won't help fungal infections. So it has to be specific for a fungal infection.
Speaker 1: So, what is the difference in a bacteria and a fungus in terms of what, how they're treated?
Speaker 2: They're different organisms.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A bacterium is different from a fungus so they're totally, two different kinds of organisms. In fact, the, the--as I say, you have a range of organisms from microscopic to macroscopic, but the fungi have their own kingdom now. So instead of just having the fungi in with the plants which is where they were, 'cause they say it's botany, but we have our own kingdom now, and it's the kingdom fungi. So you have all of the organisms grad--classified there. So, and there are fungi that are edible, fungi that, food groups, and you have the Shiitake mushroom. They are grown in Japan to help feed and nourish millions of people. You can grow it quickly, and you can provide nutrients for a lot of people in a short period of time. So when you're thinking about trying to feed the world, you try to say, oh, how can we cultivate the mushroom so that we can feed a lot of people over a quick period of time so that it takes as long as it takes to grow a corn plant, you know, in order for that to grow so that you feed people. If you can get out there in the field and grow mushrooms and you can quickly harvest them and feed people. So--
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: --I think that is something we need to look at in addition to some other--that's one aspect of it.
Story_ID: 28324
Speaker 1: But you also need to look at, as the world expands, that we need to look at how do we treat diseases that are caused by fungi because studies are mostly centered on treating bacterial infections and not fungal infections. And so in some cases, all we can do is make sure the patient is comfortable, but in terms of curing, the infection is not there yet. So.
Speaker 2: So, are you--do I hear you saying that the cures for fungal is hard--I mean--
Speaker 1: They're difficult to treat. Some of them, in fact, in one of my classes yesterday, we were just talking about how you can get some infections, and they're chronic, meaning that they're there and they reoccur, and they reoccur, and it's very difficult to treat, but they're reoccurring. And then they're--it's not as if you're gonna cure the person of the infection. But there's some, if you catch them early on, the prognosis is good. But if you don't get it treated right away, and you just disregard it and ignore and just say, it'll go away, then it just gets worse and worse and harder to treat.
Speaker 2: This is a fungal infection?
Speaker 1: Pardon?
Speaker 2: You talking about, specifically about fungal infections?
Speaker 1: Fungal infections, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, the longer you wait with a fungal infection, is it worse than if you wait a long time with a bacterial infection or what?
Speaker 1: Well, I don't wanna compare it in that regard. I'm just saying that in terms, in terms of bacteria, you pretty much have some drugs that can treat bacterial infections. In terms of fungal infections, the drugs that they have will treat them, but often the side effects are so devastating that you probably wanna go on and just see how far you can go with it because there are fungal drugs that will cause damage to the liver and to the kidney if you stay on the drugs over long periods of time. So the best thing to do if you have an infection is try to treat it quickly, and before it manifests itself or over, you know, gets deep into the system.
Speaker 2: Now, I had a friend in college that had some sort of a fungal infection in his mouth and throat or something. And they were treating it with bacteria or something, and then the bacteria--
Speaker 1: Antibiotic--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the bacteria grew, and they had to treat that with something else, and he said it was like a--they kept going back and forth till they--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --they were trying to achieve some kind of balance with it or something.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what happens. Many of the fungi are opportunistic, meaning that if the opportunity presents itself, they will take over. Fungi are present in your body already, just as bacteria are. And so if there's an imbalance in the system for any reason, then the fungi will take the opportunity to take over. And so as long as you have the balance and the chemicals, then the bacteria and the fungi will keep each one in check. But if there's some type of imbalance, fungi will probably take over and cause a much greater problem.
Speaker 2: Because they're harder to deal with than bacteria?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in terms of treatment, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, is there--now, how do they--is it the way they grow that makes them difficult to treat, I mean more difficult than say, bacteria?
Speaker 1: Well, different ones, you know. The fungi, the mycosis are classified based on how they penetrate the body. So those that are superficial, then you have cutaneous, subcutaneous and systemic. Of course, the ones that get into the systemic, those are the visceral organs, and they're harder to treat and cause more of a problem. The ones that are superficial mainly cosmetic, and so your nails, you can pretty much get something, some treatment on those or your skin. That's, but once it starts to penetrate into the tissue and it grows, it's much more difficult.
Story_ID: 28325
Speaker 1: So what is the, I guess the worst fungal disease?
Speaker 2: That I've seen?
Speaker 1: That you, yeah, that you heard--or the most--I guess the worst in terms of it effecting the most number of people in the--well, I guess both--well, tell us what you--
Speaker 2: I think what I've seen in books and on TV--I haven't seen any of the systemic infections personally. But [outside noise] my knowledge of, of the fungi, the systemic ones seem to be very difficult. They--recently, they had a incident with meni--fungal meningitis where the steroids were contaminated with the fungus. And, of course, you heard about, some people, they knew that they were contaminated, and they had been injected with the contaminated steroids, and all they could do is just wait because they, the people didn't suggest anything else. And that's a typical example. They could do nothing but wait, and I don't know if they've come up with anything since then. But that's a, that's serious when you get fungal contamination in the central nervous system, and that's serious. Then you have some that are more grotesque in terms of how they look, the Blastomyces where the limbs are disfigured and in some cases, all you can do is amputate. And so it's very, it's very gruesome to see that.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Blastomyces dermatitidis is the fungus, the disease is Blastomycosis, B-L-A-S-T-O-M-Y-C-O-S-I-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'll show you some pictures.
Speaker 1: Okay, is that, does that disease typically take place where? I mean--
Speaker 2: In tropical areas, in some of the un--the developing countries, is where you might find a lot of these fungal diseases where people don't frequent the doctors as much as we do in America or where the areas may be contaminated with the spores or fungi that cause the diseases. So you'll find it in some of the developing countries, more so than you will in the countries like America where medication is much better than it is in some of the other countries. So--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Now, I will say that because of the way the world is, and because we are able to--the transcontinental travel, spores can be picked up from Africa and brought to America in hours, within hours. So whatever one country is suffering from, we all have to be worried about it because I guess that's why the World Health Organization [WHO] is so important because things can be transmitted so quickly. We have to all be concerned.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we talked to two climate scientists at Howard [University] who actually study the winds, the harmattan as they come across Africa, carrying, you know, seeds and particles and microorganisms across the ocean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, spores, within hours--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true. And so, in fact, I had a grant from the National Institutes of Health [NIH] where I actually sample soils from Huntsville [Alabama] to Pensacola [Florida] and we found all kinds of spores, spores that are not endemic to this areas. But they were present here. So how did they get here? And, of course, the answer has to be, you know, the transatlantic travel and other ways in which people travel, they carry things with them, and they carry spores. You can't control spores, microscopic spores and other kinds of things that are transmitted.
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of tropical--are the most dangerous fungi in the tropics or, I mean in terms--because of the heat and the dampness?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there are some that are--they are, some of the worst ones are tropic, subtropical.
Speaker 1: Okay, I wondered if they, if it made any difference, 'cause I know, say if you're in a cold climate, would you be--
Speaker 2: Well, you do have fungi that are able to exist in very hot climates and very cold climates. So they have been recovered in both climates, extreme environments. Because of the nature of the fungal cell and the cell wall, they can form what you call resistant spores that will be, enable them to exist in adverse conditions, too--conditions where it might be too dry, too hot, too cold.
Speaker 1: So would the fungi--so it would be suspended as a spore in that kind of a--
Speaker 2: Yes, they--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Until it got--
Speaker 2: --that is a mechanism through which they reproduce, and so you have spores that can be sexual spores or asexual spores. And from those spores, other organisms can be generated.
Speaker 1: Okay, so even if a fungi does not necessarily thrive in a certain area, say in the middle of the desert or in the North Pole or some place or South Pole, then those spores might still be there, you know, waiting on the right condition?
Speaker 2: Waiting on a, they're waiting on conditions to be favorable. Or, they're not waiting on them, but, you know, when conditions become favorable, then they will grow.
Story_ID: 28326
Speaker 1: So, now, you worked on a tropical fungi for your PhD dissertation, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And this is called "Black Piedraia"?
Speaker 2: Piedraia.
Speaker 1: Piedraia, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, it's an ascomycete, is--the disease is called black piedra. And it's caused by piedraia hortae. I don't know, ascomycete, locular ascomycete (ph.). And it really just forms this ascostramata on the hair shaft.
Speaker 1: Now, what is an ascostramata on the hair shaft?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's the, it's the structure that contains the spores, and it forms around the hair, and it just look like a nodule, a little nodule on the hair shaft, so you can--if you had a metal hair comb, and you comb your hair, the, the locular ascomycete, the ascostramata is so hard, in that you could hear, hear it tanging against the metal hair comb. And it doesn't, when I looked at it, I got some, some samples from Brazilians, Indians who had, had contracted the diseases and we just looked at them. And they really don't do anything because, of course, the hair is already dead. But it's present on the hair, and it was interesting to see what kind of organisms they were, what were they doing in terms of the morphology and nutrition and so forth?
Speaker 1: But they don't--do they feed on the hair itself or--
Speaker 2: Well, they were utilizing the nutrients from it, but it doesn't cause any problems to the body, the person.
Speaker 1: Would--
Speaker 2: All you have to do is cut your hair, cut it, cut your hair off.
Speaker 1: Okay, but say if you didn't cut your hair, would your hair--would it eventually eat up your hair (laughter) or what?
Speaker 2: Well, if you didn't, you'd just walk around with those nodules on your hair, and it wouldn't cause any problem to the person. But you'd just have that on your--it'd just be a cosmetic problem.
Speaker 1: Okay, you mean like having dandruff or something?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't see any problems with dandruff or any, any response of the person to the nodules on the hair.
Speaker 1: No, I was just saying, would it be like having dandruff where it would--
Speaker 2: Oh, it wouldn't, no--
Speaker 1: --be cosmetically, you know, people would say, oh, what's that stuff coming out of your hair?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it wouldn't, and you wouldn't be able to see it unless they just had a lot on the hair. So.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's not considered a disease?
Speaker 2: No, it's not any--deadly or anything. It's more or less an infestation.
Speaker 1: It's something that probably a lot of people have that wouldn't even know they had it?
Speaker 2: No, it's very rare. Actually, we were, really need to look at it further and see if, in fact, it's something that could probably--more should be looked in plant pathology. And so I, you know, that's just something we're, we were talking about at one time, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is--do people in the tropics, do they, is there anything that they can do to prevent like skins infections, I mean, I know that people in Africa use a lot of shea butter and things, you know, on their skin and that sort of thing. Does that do anything to deter fungal infections?
Speaker 2: I don't know that it does, but I would imagine if, for skin infections, just keeping the area clean and not, avoiding areas that might get contamination. A lot of people get contaminated because of puncture wounds or because of where they are and the spores are present. And then they contract them because of contact with where the source is, so. It's just like if you have spores that may be present on thorns, in, out in the garden or so forth. And many people get sporotrichosis because the fungus is on the thorns, you know, on the, on the plant. So when the thorns create a portal of entry or on your skin, then the spores get in and cause the problem, get into your system. So as much as you can keep your skin intact, and not have any trauma there and keep it clean, and your immune system is strong, then you pretty much may not have a problem with fungal infections.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, in terms of your PhD dissertation, what were your findings, I guess in terms of your study of piedraia [hortae]?
Speaker 2: Well, I was looking at that time, at the nutrition of it, and what was--I was just really doing basic studies on the growth and morphology of that fungus, which had not been look at and so forth. And that's basically what we did, look at what was, what it grew best on, and would encourage the growth and what didn't and what vitamins and other things that stimulate the growth. So.
Speaker 1: Now, did it advance the field of fungal research, I guess?
Speaker 2: Not at, well, not advance the field. It's just a basic scientific study. Like you do a basic study on an organism, and that's what that was, just to give it increased the knowledge in terms of that particular organism. And just as with my Master's thesis, I looked at Candida albicans, and I think I got so much response to that one, even an invitation of Israel,--
Speaker 1: Now, what's the common name for Candida albicans--
Speaker 2: Candida albicans--it's sort of like thrush, they call it thrush or thrash. Some people say thrash, but thrush of the month and in different parts of the body. It's a yeast infection. And I looked at that that organism and it effects the Clorox , you know, the chlorine on it in trying to make sure you get rid of it out of the water system because it's in wastewater, and it can get in the drinking water system. And I got so much response to that, one article, you know, one paper that I was doing on that one. And it's interesting. And it just shows that a lot has, there's so much to be done in terms of work on fungi, and fungi that are present in, everywhere--we say fungi are ubiquitous because they're in the air, they're in the water, they're in the soil. And they're all around us, and so what, why don't you get an infection? And you might, you don't get it because of your own individual susceptibility or resistance at least, and your own immune system. You know, these are things that, if you have as strong immune system, maybe that helps keep you healthy, you know.
Story_ID: 28328
Speaker 1: So that imbalance can be caused by too much antibiotic?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I've heard that before--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they have a rule now, you know, time--some time back, they did not have that rule about 10 antibiotics. So you take 10 now, and then you have to go back and get, you know, re-evaluated before they'll give you some more. And so before you can be on antibiotics too long, which will kill off the bacteria, and because you're doing that, that allows the fungi to grow. And they will flourish. So, you're eliminating one problem and creating another one. And so--and because fungi and bacteria are already in your system--they're just not causing a problem.
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you this. Now, we've talked to microbiologist, and they all seem to agree with what I've heard on television and read in the paper, New York Times, and other places, that these antibiotic sprays and hand wipes and things they use--too much of use of those makes it, you know, easy for the really virulent, you know, kinds of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --microorganisms to grow.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would cause them to develop a resistance, and so you won't be able to do anything, you know, to control them--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And you can't (unclear) (simultaneous), you can't spray those.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's just like that little joke they said about spraying roaches and then the roaches become so immune to the spray that, you know, it doesn't do any good to spray them anymore. They're resistant to it. And similarly, if you use too many of those antibacterial things, it's the same thing.
Speaker 1: Now, is there, do these antibacterial sprays, do they affect fungi too?
Speaker 2: I don't think so because they are anti-bacteria, and so for the fungi, we need something that's gonna work on the fungi specifically, so.
Speaker 1: The products that contain bleach, are they the best thing to use on--
Speaker 2: That contain what?
Speaker 1: Bleach.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Are they the best thing to use against fungi?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I use it a lot and so, because we use Clorox to clean the surface, and if you have molds and a potential for molds in areas where its high humidity, we use a percentage of bleach, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you hear a lot about black mold now in people's homes and that sort of thing. Is that--tell us what the danger of that is and how dangerous is it?
Speaker 2: It's very dangerous. I just saw, I showed a film to my classes, Stachybotrys, it's very important now, that if you have young kids in an area, and the area has been wet and that you make sure that the water is cleaned up very quickly and that the mold is not allowed to grow or the water sets there and allow--and then mold grow, that you can't--you're not aware of because it gets, sometimes it can get into the air system. And depending on how much Inoculum or how much spores the child breathe in, it can have some very adverse effects on that child.
Speaker 1: It would create a lung infection or something--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Lung infection--
Speaker 1: --a respiratory infection?
Speaker 2: --bleeding of the lungs and eventual--they've had a case where kids did have bleeding in the lungs, and they died. So, and they knew--they had no idea what had happened. And they had two babies in the room, and one baby was close to the ventilation system than the other. And so they didn't understand why one baby got so sick, and the other one got sick, but not as sick. And it was because that baby was, was getting a lot of, and breathing in a lot of the spores. So, it's very, it's very important to--
Speaker 1: On the, in the same vein, you could probably appreciate the irony of this, but the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center in Wilberforce [Ohio] was recently closed down because it was infected with white mold.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, at Wilberforce [University]--
Speaker 1: That was the black museum.
Speaker 2: --University?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the black museum's infected with mold and had to be closed. And it cost like a couple hundred thousand dollars to abate this problem in a relatively new building. The building was erected in 1988. So--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a new building.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There's something wrong with the ventilation system then. They were not getting enough air in and the moisture was being retained too much, apparently. But I think that's very important, as you--in the construction of buildings now, that, to look at how, that there is ventilation as it--it's very difficult though. But the ventilation is very important to make sure the air circulation is in there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would have thought that it wouldn't have been a problem in that building because it's a big, cavernous kind of building with a lot of--it seems that it's proper 'cause it has a lot of air space, you know, which makes it hard to talk in there, sometimes because of the echoes and--
Speaker 2: What about the moisture? What's causing the moisture?
Speaker 1: I don't know. It's in a woody, surrounded by woods on the old campus of Wilberforce, but it's not, it's not like it's in the woods, you know, so you wouldn't think that--
Speaker 2: That's interesting.
Speaker 1: There's no running, there's no water nearby except ground water, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's something wrong with the humidity, controlling the humidity in that building, it sounds like.
Story_ID: 28329
Speaker 1: After you receive your PhD at Ohio State [University], you--now, this is in '76' [1976]. You went immediately to Alabama A and M [University]?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I graduated one day and I was here the next.
Speaker 1: So did they recruit you?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had, I had some, a friend at Ohio State [University] who was a graduate of Alabama A and M. And I guess they passed the word, and I was recruited. I had applications from several places, recruitment from other places. The Fish and Wildlife industry wanted, were trying to get me and Corning Life Science Division in New York and Scherer Pharmaceutical, they were trying to get me based on Candida albicans, the work I was doing with that.
Speaker 1: Now, we probably should stop, I mean and go back to that on some level 'cause you said this was such a popular study that you did--
Speaker 2: The Candida?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Candida albicans study.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because Candida albicans is an organism, but candidiasis is the disease. At that time, Scherer was working with Gentamicin, I think that's the drug that we're talking about. But they were trying to come up with something to treat Candida infections. And, 'cause they--it was their opinion that Candida was the bug of the future. That was in 1976. It still is. I mean it's, because it's already present in your body. It's in your body, it's in his body and my body. We, it's already present in your body. And so what happens is when there's something, changes in your chemical makeup, if you're taking vitamins or taking something that shifts your chemical makeup, then Candida can cause a problem. And there're almost 14 different things that Candida can cause. It's been implicated in the cause of colds, the common cold, arthritis, meningitis, a whole list of different things that they say are caused by Candida infections. And so I had this gentlemen who said, oh, you worked on Candida, so, I wanna interview you. So, I was called there to Scherer Pharmaceutical--I think it's Scherer-Plough now. And I got an interview there based on that. But I decided that I wanted to teach. I wanted the classroom interaction and not just the laboratory stuff.
Story_ID: 28330
Speaker 1: So Alabama A and M [University], in 1976, so you were hired as an assistant professor of biology--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --here, and, so I guess you like it here because you've been here a long time.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But what was it like when you got here? Did, was there--
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked it because--and I chose Alabama A and M because I was saying that in three years I would probably go to work at Meharry Medical College. And, but I chose Alabama A and M because they had in their graduate program a course in medical mycology. I didn't see that anywhere else at any other HBCU, where they had a course in their graduate program listed as medical mycology. So that was the reason. And I, my intent was to stay here three years.
Speaker 1: Now, was there another professor here working on fungi, you know, teaching--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that medical mycology course?
Speaker 2: Well, they had a joint program with UAH, and there was a professor at the University of Alabama-Huntsville, who was, who had an interest in medical mycology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was on our books, but we didn't have anybody specifically doing it here at A and M.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you could offer the course, but from the other professor, but not from someone here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they have a joint program between A and M and UAH, and we shared our courses. And so their professor taught the class. And so when I came, I could teach it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, some--from the very beginning, you were a member of the graduate faculty, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Alabama A and M offered a Master's degree in biology--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: A Master's degree.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did they offer that when you were in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I came they were just getting it started.
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying when you were--no, well, you weren't in undergraduate school here, but, yeah. But they had it here--they, oh, they were just getting it started when you came?
Speaker 2: Just getting started when I got here.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so then you helped build the graduate program, I guess?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes. Had a number of graduate students, so.
Speaker 1: And what was it like then, and what is it like now in terms of the graduate program?
Speaker 2: Well, when I first came over, we had a number of young people my age, you know, who were recruited here for the department. And almost all of us had PhDs from other universities, you know, major or majority universities like Ohio State University, Rutgers [University], Cornell [University] and so forth. So we had a, it was a very attractive department. And in similar, you know, it's maintained that somewhat now. It's just that, the only thing that we were looking forward to is getting, developing our PhD program. But we have PhD programs in other areas, and now we have a PhD program in the department, but we were trying to focus on one in biology. But it's in another area, environmental science, that we're working on that now. So.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28331
Speaker 1: Now, you, in '76' [1976], you got a National Science Foundation grant for--okay, for Isolation and Characterization of Enzymes and Other Substances Produced by Potential Fungal Pathogens, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: Fungal Pathogens, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were studying fungal pathogens?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I was talking about the projects that we have by, to go and isolate them from the soil.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Okay, so now, has it been--what was your, what was the percentage of time you had to spend teaching as opposed to research? Was that a balance that you liked or--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, on the books we always say, you know, 40, 60. But in--that's within the normal 40-hour work week. But you find yourself doing more than that, you know, on the weekends, after hours and so forth. So you really, if it's something you're interested in, you're gonna go beyond that limit that you have. You really don't stay within that. So that's fine. It's comfortable. I don't have any problems with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, what was the department like when you got here? Who were, I mean what was being taught in the department? How many members of the, I guess, the biology department?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's changed so much over the years. I've been here 30-some years though. It's gone through all kinds of changes and, in terms of people either retiring or people leaving to do things, different things. In fact, for about seven years, I left the department and worked in an administrative role for about seven years as a vice president. So.
Speaker 1: Now, that's from what period to--
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: What time period was that?
Speaker 2: From 1989 to '96' [1996], I think, yeah. So, but prior to that, I had taken leave to work at NIH, and just to learn more about what was going on at the National Institutes of Health and to get more insight. And they had a program that Dr. Sidney McNarry (ph.) asked me if I would participate in, you know. He said I should, it was a good program. He thought I would, I should apply for. And so I applied for it, and I was able to get it, and I spent six months at NIH learning about the in's and out's and learning how to manage grants and contracts and attract more dollars to the university. So while I was there, the president of the university came, visited, and after that encounter with an NIH in there, he asked me would I return to help build the research enterprise at the university. And so I did. I came back.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was your official position when you came back in '86' {1986]?
Speaker 2: Assistant Vice President.
Speaker 1: Eighty-nine [1989], so you were Assistant Vice President?
Speaker 2: Assistant Vice President for Research and then I think after one year became an associate and then Vice President.
Story_ID: 28332
Speaker 1: What's the most exciting research that you've been involved in?
Speaker 2: I think, the one that I did with NIH [National Institutes of Health] when we were going across the state, that and some work I did with the Army Science Board, when I was totally in an area that was different from what I was used to. But we were looking at things that could help improve the deployment of supplies to soldiers in the Army, so. I think that was very, very interesting to me.
Speaker 1: Was this in terms of fungus--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Working on (unclear) (simultaneous)--no, it had nothing to do with fungi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just a, it's just a study of how we could do something to improve some problems that the Army had identified that they had. So.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is an administration, administrative--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought that was interesting. But in terms of fungi, you know, of course, the one where we're isolating the fungi into different areas, that was most interesting. And now, we're looking at some other things--
Speaker 1: In different areas like--
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: I mean the areas--
Speaker 2: From Huntsville to Pensacola, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay, geographic areas, okay, alright.
Speaker 2: Geographically, and also in different types of soil and the different kinds of organisms.
Speaker 1: Okay,--
Speaker 2: I was amazed--
Speaker 1: --so is there a substantial difference?
Speaker 2: I was amazed at the, the range and the variety organisms that we found in Huntsville and the ones that we found in the State of Alabama that are supposed to be endemic to other areas. And so that was amazing to me. So I just, I think it may be something that we need to go back and look at genetically, look at some of those organisms and looking at the, at them from a genetic standpoint, so.
Story_ID: 28333
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask this question. I'm just--how fast do fungi evolve and change--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: How fast do they grow?
Speaker 1: No, evolve and change?
Speaker 2: Well, it depends on, you can--
Speaker 1: If you got a species of fungi, does it change much over time? I mean, you know, are you--
Speaker 2: It depends. I think you can have mutagenic changes and you can have changes that are environmental, you know, something that's caused by the environment. So it depends on, you know, what you, what you're looking at, so. But I would imagine it's not the same as it is with higher organisms because they are microorganisms. Fungi, you know, were involved in the first, some of the first studies that they did when it, during the Beetle and Tatum studies to look at genetics. And so, and the one gene theory that they had, so I would imagine, it would be something that doesn't take as long. And it doesn't take as long as it would higher organisms to study genetic changes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it doesn't take as long for--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --fungi to mutate as it would some other--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, are they faster than bacteria?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know. I haven't--
Speaker 1: Haven't put 'em on (unclear) (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I haven't timed them (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, you know, it makes you, you know, everybody knows the story of, you know, seeing 'em spring up overnight, you know. You see fungi where you didn't 'em before, you know, big ones too, outside. You know, you're saying like I didn't see this--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you see angel rings, huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You got there, you don't see 'em one day, and the next day, because they accumulate, much of the body of a fungus is, vacuole, a water vacuole. So they take in a lot of moisture. And so because it takes in a, moisture, you can look out there one second, and you don't see anything. And the next day or next couple of hours, you'll see something because a lot of the body of the fungus is water.
Speaker 1: So, in that regard, it's like a balloon or something that's deflated and all of a sudden it's, now, it's gotten full?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess, that's a rough example, yeah.
Story_ID: 28334
Speaker 1: Now, in '82' [1982], you studied fungal immunology at the Centers for Disease Control, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was that important?
Speaker 2: Was that what?
Speaker 1: Important?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was. It was interesting too because it was at the same time that they were doing all of the, the inquiries about AIDS. You know, we had a roundtable at CDC [Centers for Disease Control] looking at xenoantigens for fungi to see, okay, if you look at this xenoantigen on the surface of the fungus, can you identify it, you know, rapid detection and so forth. And at the same time we were there, they were bringing in people, a roundtable was going on about AIDS. And it was very interesting.
Speaker 1: I mean is there any relationship between fungi and AIDS?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I didn't think so. I--
Speaker 2: No, I was just saying we were there at CDC, and I remember that, you know. There's no connection. Well, let me back up. In fact, one way that they have said that a person has AIDS is the presence of coccidioidomycosis, present in certain parts, you know, oozing out the ear and out the mouth.
Speaker 1: There are fungal--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeast, so that's, that's one of the signs, and it's not because--it's simply because AIDS suppresses the immune system. And the fungus is there, and so that was one of the things. Okay, we know that this is what it is. And that's one of the signs of it, so, not directly, but indirectly, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, also, I know you took part in 1983 in a fungi conference in Tokyo, Japan.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is the Third International Mycological Congress.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: It was wonderful (laughter). It was my first trip out of the country, and I've since been to six continents now, but that was my first. And it was exciting. It was a chance to participate in an international congress about mycology. We presented a couple of papers jointly with a colleague at Howard [University]. But we were, that's where we first learned about the Shiitake mushrooms, and we actually went to the university and were able to look at their collection of fungi, go out in the field and see how they grew the Shiitake mushrooms. So it was very exciting, and in addition to, of course, visiting China and going to every Buddhist temple (laughter), and seeing the Great Wall of China and the Ming Tombs and just getting a chance to see China and Japan. So it was wonderful.
Story_ID: 28335
Speaker 1: Okay, in terms of eating mushrooms, I know you're into immunology more than this, but do mushrooms--you were speaking about the nutritional content of fungi before, and I read that there's not really a lot in fungi.
Speaker 2: Shiitake mushrooms, the Shiitake.
Speaker 1: Just in Shiitake--
Speaker 2: The Shiitake mushroom is, you know, they have done some studies on it, and they have fungi that not only produced and provide nutrients, but they also are helpful in combating cancers and the tumors and so forth. So there're all kinds of medicinal purposes--uses of fungi in addition to nutritious. And they don't have all the nutrients you need, but they have some.
Speaker 1: Okay, and if you go to Panera Bread or something and they offer you a Portobello burger, is that--
Speaker 2: Wonderful.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, but does it have any protein? That's what I'm--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it does.
Speaker 1: Where's the protein content in a mushroom?
Speaker 2: In the Portobello mushrooms. So go ahead and eat one.
Speaker 1: Are they high in protein?
Speaker 2: They do have some protein. I don't know--they're not like meat, but they're good.
Speaker 1: Okay, I was thinking if it's gonna be a meat substitute, it should have a, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you don't need all of that.
Speaker 1: --protein content at least or something close. But, okay, so there is some. Alright, so, okay, so, let's see, and you also studied biotechnology at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] in regards to--was this in regards to mycology too?
Speaker 2: No, we were just looking at some different, way back then, they were just looking at different biotechnology techniques, you know, that were--we just went over some during that summer. And at that time--what year was that?
Speaker 1: This is 1984.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it's technology that was emerging at that time, yeah.
Story_ID: 28336
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talking about your stint at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology]. So you were just there over the summer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just for, I guess, a two-week program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To look at new technologies they had at that time, which are probably old now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, who would be considered now, I guess, today, to be the leading scientists in mycology?
Speaker 2: Who would be the what?
Speaker 1: Who would be the leading scientist in mycology or what institution is leading the way? Is there a leader that everybody clearly recognizes?
Speaker 2: There were so many that are gone on now, you know. You have some that we considered, this was--he wrote the bible on mycology, [Libero] Ajello. It's A-J-E-L-L-O. And [Norman Francis] Conant was one. They say, if you had a book, you have to make sure you have these in your library. And then several others, you know, but those are the two key ones.
Speaker 1: Ajello and Conant?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I have the, I have the little book. I give all of my students Conant's book. It's a blue, leather bound. It has all of the old pictures in it, all the pictures. But he has all the basic information, and it hasn't changed too much. But names change, a couple of names changed.
Speaker 1: Say in order to do your studies on fungi, do you--what instrumentation do you use? Do you use microscopes or just, is that, or was there any other kind of?
Speaker 2: Basic microscopes and I just did the lab, the bench into isolating them and looking at and growing them in culture and so forth.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if computer, any computer technology or something like that is used to study fungi now?
Speaker 2: Oh, in terms of just viewing them, in terms--
Speaker 1: Right, I guess viewing them or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can do that now. But, yeah, you can do that now. We have, we're working jointly with the physics department, and we're trying to do some nano technology to see if, in fact, you know, silver or gold nano particles can assist in inhibiting the growth of fungi. So, we're looking at that. It's just, it's not anything that I've done before, but it's just something new that we're starting to look at.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, fungi, basically, if I remember my basic biology, grow through these small strands of, what do they call 'em?
Speaker 2: Hypha.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what again?
Speaker 2: Hypha.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, you have the spores, the spores begin to germinate, I guess, and they form filaments. And those individual filaments are known as hypha. And if you have more than one, they're hyphae, and if you have a bunch of hyphae, they form mycelium, which is the body of a fungus, yeah.

Speaker 1: In--you authored a number of textbooks. I don't know when you started writing textbooks, but let us--
Speaker 2: Well, they--just for my classes, and, because they're--I've found that many textbooks, they have a lot of information that you don't get around to a lot of it. And so I sort of tailor my classes, my lectures and so I put textbooks for most of the classes like for my mycology class, I put together the notes and the information I want them to know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the references and so forth. And likewise with the intro to health careers class. There's really no book that I can find to do, to transmit the information I want the students to have in that area because there are so many different health professions, over 200 different ones. And since that's what I do, serve as the health professions advisor, I want them to know about the major ones and the health profession areas, in addition to the ally health areas. So I put all of those in one document, then try to direct them in terms of what they should do to prepare to be successful candidates for medical school or an ally health profession schools, with all of the timelines, what you need to do the freshmen, sophomore, junior year. So all that, putting that in one document, it takes time, and what I have is documents that have evolved over the years. And every year I change it. I add to it, I take out and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you come up with a new edition every year.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And some of them are introductory botany, a laboratory manual that goes with that, introductory mycology, notes and laboratory manual, health professions guide book for undergraduates.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 28338
Speaker 1: You taught, you spent a year, was it a year at Florida A and M [University] as adjunct professor?
Speaker 2: Not a year. It was a summer. It was as an adjunct--it was two summers. They have a life science training program that they had gotten funded by NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], and they needed faculty present to work with the students because we led them with projects for the Space Shuttle. We actually prepared projects that flew on the Shuttle. And so I was hired to serve as adjunct professor, and it was through the pharmacy department that I had the grant. So I was hired through that department.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, yeah, so this is in 1986?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I did it two summers.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay.
Speaker 2: And that was a wonderful experience too because it was prior to the Challenger disaster, so I went just prior, you know, the summer before that. And we had a chance to--we had the gold pass from Admiral Truly, and we were able to go to the launch sites, Launch Pad A and B. And we also were, visited the vertical processing facility, the orbital processing facility. And we actually went out to where they recovered the external tank, the solid rocket boosters, I'm sorry. And so, and I actually drove on Launch Pad. I drove a van where they actually launched the Shuttle. And the Shuttle was mated, and we drove up there. But Admiral Truly was in the van, and he actually, you know, we went all the way up there, and, of course, you can't have anything that's flammable or anything. And then we had to do exactly what he said. He said, "Drive, you stop when I say stop." So when I went out there, and then we got out and looked around, there was a big drop (laughter) down there where all of the water comes out. And I said, oh, what if I had made a mistake (laughter). So it was, that was another lifetime experience too, to get to see a lot of the things that the people who had worked there for years and years at Cape Canaveral, they had never seen what we had seen.
Story_ID: 28339
Speaker 1: Now when you became--you were speaking a few minutes ago about becoming the assistant vice president, working on the NIH [National Institutes of Health] project here, and then in '89' [1989] when you're vice president here at Alabama A and M [University], you were involved in founding, I guess--and correct me if I'm wrong, the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]--what's it called? The Space Grant Fellowship program--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --NASA program?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, so this is--this puts Alabama A and M in a consortium of other--
Speaker 2: Schools.
Speaker 1: --schools that are working with NASA?
Speaker 2: Right. The schools, UAH [University of Alabama, Huntsville], Auburn [University] and several schools formed that as a--and there are other schools nationwide in the Space Grant Consortium, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I think there're over 50 other consortiums, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --involved?
Speaker 2: Yeah, our students participate, compete for that.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us something about it. It seems like it's really a big--
Speaker 2: Something about what?
Speaker 1: About that program, the Space program. It seems like it's really, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, you know, the--which one? The one that's encouraging--the Space Grant program is encouraging students to become involved in research related to the Space program--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and things that can be done. And I think it's a great opportunity. I think there're a lot of things that happen with the Space program, spin-off's from it, that people really don't know all the benefits of the Space program itself. And so I, you know, was interested at one time, in the whole Space program, and even flying (laughter). So I actually did the rod and frame test where they test to see if you would get space motion sickness. The rod-and-frame, and so that you can tell, well, what is up and what is down and so forth. And I also did the, what'd you call it? The human sleigh--
Speaker 1: Yeah, when they test you for "G" forces, your ability to withstand--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I did all those tests, and we had a chance to interact with many of the astronauts, and so many of the experiments that they did when I was there, similar kinds of projects students could do with the Space Grant Fellowship program. So I think it's a good opportunity to try to attract students to that, to NASA and working with NASA programs.
Story_ID: 28340
Speaker 1: Now, as you were saying before you did mostly administration between 1989 and '96' [1996], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So what's the, I guess the highlight of, or the--of that year?
Speaker 2: Well, one, one of the reasons I accepted that when the president at that time suggested it was because I had learned a lot at NIH [National Institutes of Health] in terms of what other institutions were doing in terms of supporting us, basic research, sponsor programs. Our institution did not have many of the kinds of support things in place, and having been a research person with grants, I wanted the office to be user friendly, to be a place where faculty could go and get the kind of support they needed to apply for grants and contracts. And so between that time, I put a lot of effort in trying to make it that. And so we were able to move the research enterprise at A and M. In 1989, I think we had about 4 million when I went in. And we moved it from that to about--and that's four million a year. But we moved to about $20,000,000 a year when I left. But we had a total portfolio of about 60 million, meaning multi-year awards. So it took a lot of effort, a lot of consortia, collaborations with other institutions to build it up to that. And so I was, that was the highlight that we were able to form relationships, to show that together, you could attract more money and so, that's what we did and before it became real popular to collaborate and to partner, we were doing that back then, so. But it really takes a lot of energy.
Story_ID: 28341
Speaker 1: And in '97' [1997], you joined the Links, right? And this has become a major--
Speaker 2: A charter, a charter member of the local chapter.
Speaker 1: This is the Huntsville chapter.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us a little bit about Links, and what you did with Links?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, The Links [Inc.] is a group of professional women who come together for friendship and service and--to the community, and believe in giving back and the name Links is synonymous with friendship and service. And we had a number of different projects that are conducted by The Links in the community in terms of international programs, arts, education and so forth. And we have different projects here at A and M in terms of--not A and M, but in the community (laughter), in terms of health professions, or trying to get students, get more information out about healthcare and the need for that and families, successful agents. So, again, the Links are there to, as volunteers to the community, to help in any way that we can to provide service.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are The Links like more locally focused than say the AKA's?
Speaker 2: No, we have international--the Links are international and have, have chapters in more than 275 different countries now--different areas at least. We have more than 275 chapters, I think. And we go out to Brazil, I think we have Germany and the Caribbean, the Bahamas. We have chapters all the way out there. So we have about 11,000 members. So, it's not just local. It's international.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28342
Speaker 1: Now, you came back to research and teaching more or less in what, '98' [1998] or before?
Speaker 2: Ninety-six [1996].
Speaker 1: Ninety-six [1996], okay. And what have been some of your activities in that regard since then?
Speaker 2: Since I've been back?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean--
Speaker 2: I don't think they've stopped (laughter). Well, it just seems like they're--I've been the faculty center president for six years when I came back, and--which means that all the faculty concerns and so forth that I'm able to help do some of that. So I felt like an Ombudsman sometimes, and I've had a number of--I continue to work as a pre-med advisor and trying to get students involved in, you know, into health profession schools. And I still have research projects, and have graduate students who are--in fact, that's what my graduate students are working on now, looking at gold-now particles. So I still have a hand in a lot of different things to some extent. And in addition to keeping active or keeping current with my classes and mycology, medical mycology 'cause there's nobody else who can teach them (laughter)--teach that class here. So I'm the one to teach it, and have a lot of university committee appointments. So, promotion and tenure and honorary degree committee. So those committees I chair, so--
Speaker 1: Now, you--
Speaker 2: --it keeps me busy.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in 2004, you started serving as Director of the Center for Biomedical Behavioral and Environmental Research here, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Well, that is a result of going to NIH [National Institutes of Health] the second time. I went the first time in 1989, and I came back here, and worked on building a research office. And the second time I went, they had enhanced the program so that when you go there, you--they give you money, and you come back and you can do something with it. So I decided I wanted to come back and try to start a center so that I could try to stimulate the involvement of faculty in biomedical and health, in environmental health research. And so, that's what that center is about and it's about trying to stimulate or get other faculty members to also get interested in health research so that we can have an impact. And so that's what, what we attempted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. You've also been a consultant with the United States Army Science Board, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For a long time (laughter). Yes, I, since 1992 or '93' [1993], somewhere around that timeframe, I was--they made a visit to Alabama A and M, and to do some exploratory, just inquiry about HBCUs and capabilities. And I was vice president at the time, and I was invited to participate or see if I was interested in serving on the science board. And I said I would. And then I submitted my materials, and then they went through the normal investigations and so forth, what they do to be on a federal board. And I was selected, and I got top secret security clearance and served up until--I was appointed by Army Secretary Togo West, and the first appointment was by him. And then I think you serve six years and then get another appointment. And so that's what happened. And then when I rotated off, then they asked me to come back on because the Missile Command had a study on chemical and biological warfare, looking at certain things. And they wanted me to serve, so I came back on then. And then I served until 2011 'cause I was really beyond the timeframe (laughter). So I served, and I got the Commander's Award for service.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you also served as a consultant to the American Institute for Biologists Neon Design Team. Now, what was--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Neon Design Team.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Neon, the big science, yeah, I did. I served on that. When they initially designed, pulled it together, and they were the Neon Design Team, and they were talking about big science, and so I did serve on that. It was very interesting. And I think we did get a project through, over in our forestry area to look at something that was, grew out of that whole project.
Speaker 1: So, well, can you tell us anything about it? I mean what was--
Speaker 2: I'm not involved in that one, so they were--it was in our forestry department, forest services. But--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but we did convey the information. They didn't have any fungi involved in it. So.
Speaker 1: Alabama A and M at this time offers a Masters degree in biology, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, but we offer a PhD in plant and soil science and a PhD in physics, a PhD in reading, and a PhD in food science. The PhD in plant and soil science is probably gonna be renamed some time--I don't know, but it has to be revisited because we have made some structural changes. And so hopefully, the environmental--the biological environmental sciences will be in that restructure. So we're hoping to look at that.
Story_ID: 28343
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what are your future plans here at Alabama A and M [University ]for the department and the school, I guess?
Speaker 2: Department?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, we have combined biology with environmental sciences, and it used to be just the biology department and not biology, biological environmental sciences, and we see strong potential there because of the emphasis of looking at the environment now. And I think that's a great combination where we can pull together the resources of both departments, to focus on some very, very urgent needs for the country in terms of the environment, climate, and so forth. So I think as we try to strategically plan for the future, I think we have the right structure in that we just need to try to focus on, on taking advantage of some of the opportunities that are out there now.
Story_ID: 28344
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point in your career, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. I don't think--I don't regret anything, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just, sometimes I think I worked too hard for--in the research and development. But I was just working on things I was interested in and so I did spend a whole lot of time on it and sort of probably focused, and I sort of left the science part and got in administration. But I was still keeping up with the science because I had, I still had the environmental technology and waste management consortium, and I had some other science things, but I was just thinking, I was just involved in so much of the university activities that I should have--I could have balanced it a little bit more than I did. But I, I don't regret it, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, and likewise, if you look back at everything you've done to this point, what would you consider to be the milestones? What would you consider to be your professional legacy to this point?
Speaker 2: It has to be the students that I have impacted, and I was just overwhelmed with, with, you know, having gone through my brother's death and how the people and the responses that I got, you know. It opens your eyes and you just don't know who you've touched, you know. And that was interesting.
Story_ID: 28345
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African [American] community today?
Speaker 2: That we don't desert the HBCUs (laughter) because I think there's a role for black colleges. And I don't know that you need to--they're HBCUs. That's what they are historically. But I just hope--and we tend to do that, you know. We, I have so many students. They go somewhere else and they come back. You know, they end up coming back. And then they come back, and we teach them, train them, and they go on and do well. And there's something that happens at HBCUs. It used to happen more than it's happening now. I don't know if it's still happening at the same rate, but it's a nurturing and a caring and something that people get at an HBCU. I don't--I just believe that. I've been at a majority institution. I know how it felt. I've been to a HBCU. I know you have other challenges, but the emotional challenge is different. And I think it has an impact. It shapes the individual. And I think that's very important. And I know people are leery about saying that. But I think it's very real when you see what's going on today in universities and the gap of the emotional connection that people are just willing to do anything to people. And I think we've got to find a way to reach people where there's an emotional connection that you care about people that's--you don't wanna--you wanna still strive, but you wanna, you still need the caring part.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think particularly, I've heard people say that in the STEM areas, especially, HBCUs are more important.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because you can lose, you can really lose a student in an area that's hard--challenging, not hard. But, and they can just be excellent students, and if you don't get the emotional connection or make connection some kind of way, they can, they're lost in the wayside. And they had so much potential. And so I believe HBCUs do a lot to encourage students in STEM disciplines.
Story_ID: 28346
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family. I know you told us about growing up, but do you have children of your own?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay. Married or--
Speaker 2: Un-un.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You keep up with your brothers and sisters, I know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Are your parents still alive?
Speaker 2: Um-hum. My mother [Alice Jacobs] and father [Willie Lee Jones] are--father's 84. My mother's 82. She'll be 83 in April, 16th of April.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they--are the proud of you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, my father, when I go home, you know, he's telling everybody, you know, talking about "my daughter". And so, yeah, all of them are. My parents and my brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews and so forth. And I, actually, I have my young niece, she said, do you know you've been around the world? I said, what? And I had not thought about it, you know, the way she said it. And she said, well, you've been here, you've been there. I said, oh, you're right. I have. I haven't been to Antarctica, but I've been to other, the continents. So, but they'll keep up with you more than you--you're so busy, and they're keeping up with me.
Speaker 1: Now, did your other brothers and sisters finish college too or did they--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah. They went to Fort Valley [State University]. Everybody finished at Fort Valley. And so one sister's at the Post Office. She went to Fort Valley. She had a year or so, and I had a brother who is in business. And then the younger--the older sister that was reading specialist, she got a Master's in that.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know before we did this interview, we found out that your brother had passed who actually worked here--
Speaker 2: Worked in the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --after Fort Valley, right?
Speaker 2: --in the biology department as a laboratory manager and safety officer. Yep.
Story_ID: 28347
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: You haven't asked me about the presidents.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, what do you think about the president, then, 'cause this is something--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The presidents here that we, I was hired under R. D. Morrison. He's a very historic phys--figure among HBCU land-grant institutions. And I had a great relationship with him, Richard David Morrison. Then after him, it was Dr. Douglas Covington. He was at Radford University, and he was here first, and then he went there, and I thought he was a great organizer. He was also a Ohio State [University] graduate. So those are the two presidents that I really had great admiration for. And then, of course, the president who hired me as a vice president was Dr. Carl Mulberry. He was an A and M [Alabama A and M University] graduate. And we have Dr. Andrew Hugine now, who was president at South Carolina and came here. So, I'm working with him now. He seems to be a great person. Hopefully, he will help--he's helped to stabilize things and move them forward. So.
Speaker 1: Is the State of Alabama behind Alabama A and M [University]?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Is the State of Alabama behind the school, I mean really (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Is it a good relationship or is it--or can it improve and--
Speaker 2: Oh, it can. We can get, we get the funding. We get some good funding--not good funding, but we get funding. We could get better funding for the university. So I would say, to somewhat, they are behind us to some extent. But it could be better. It could be more supportive. We could get more funding than we get.
Story_ID: 28348
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As somebody who helped, helped students, helped people, who cared, who wanted--I wanted my students to live up to their full potential. I think if I've done anything, I've tried to recognize the potential in students that have come my way and to try to steer them in a way so that they can be all that they could be and to live up to their potential and not squander it and have regrets that they didn't do the things that they could have done. And so, although you can't avoid that, you know, you can try to help, and that's what I try to do.
Story_ID: 28349
Speaker 1: That picture is a picture of me. It's in Dr. Richard David Morrison's book on the history of Alabama A and M University.
Speaker 2: And that gives the year, 1992.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little about this?
Speaker 2: Okay, that's an introductory mycology study guide and learning notes that I developed for my mycology class.
Speaker 1: Now, are they used in other HBCUs too?
Speaker 2: No. I haven't tried them (unclear).
Speaker 1: Where are they published?
Speaker 2: I should. They've asked about it.
Speaker 1: This is the "Majors and Minors of Health Careers" book for pre-professional health majors.
Speaker 2: That one's published. This is the first book I did. It's "Biology Study Guide and Learning Notes" in 1976, I believe.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of me in the bio-sketches for members of the Army Science Board.
Speaker 2: That's a news release when I was selected as "Woman of the Year" by the female students at the university.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) I think this picture is same--
Speaker 2: I think that's the same one.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of me when I was a member of the NIH Extramural associates program.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me with my brother, Willie, who's recently deceased, and it was during the time I received my PhD.
Speaker 1: This was in 1980 when I made a trip to China to attend the International Mycological Congress.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me with my friends at the Ohio State University. We formed a singing group (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Black Graduate and Professional Student Caucus. That's what that is.
Speaker 1: Okay, what's the name of the group?
Speaker 2: I don't know what we called ourselves (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's a picture of me when I attended a biomedical research symposium in Virginia, Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Okay, that must have been my first year employed at Alabama A and M University, 1990-what, 1996 or '97' [1997].
Speaker 1: Wouldn't that be '76' [1976]? This was first year--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1978 or so, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of me and my father when I graduated with a BS degree at Fort Valley State University.
Speaker 2: That's me in my office with one of my students from Africa.
Speaker 1: That's me returning to Alabama A and M [University] when I took summer students on a recruitment trip.
Speaker 2: To "the" Ohio State University.
Speaker 1: At "the" Ohio State University, put the "the" up there. You see it?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's me as a member of the Links Incorporated doing work in the community with young students.
Speaker 2: Me, along with colleagues and a Texas Southern University, I served on that NASA advisory, research advisory board.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) This was the high school graduation picture, 1968, I guess.
Speaker 2: You're too skinny on that one (laughter).
Speaker 1: I remember that one.
Speaker 2: That's me along with Dr. Joe Johnson, his wife and Attorney Thomas Todd.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me and my baby sister, Angela, at her wedding.
Speaker 2: That's me as the vice--as the president of the faculty senate, attending a meeting with the member of the Board of Trustees.
Speaker 1: These are other members of the Board of Trustees, and me.
Speaker 2: Wow, this is a picture of me at the, at the Forestry Laboratory--I think that's the fire control unit in Macon, Georgia during my high school years--no, during my senior year at Fort Valley State University. The fire control unit.
Speaker 1: It's in San Diego, California attending a conference, Abrecom's (ph.) conference, with student presenters.
Speaker 2: A picture of the inauguration of the president of A and M, along with colleagues.
Speaker 1: Who's the president there?
Speaker 2: No, he's not in there. The president, Andrew Hugeeni, just a bunch of us together on--
Speaker 1: It's me, receiving an award from the president of the faculty senate.
Speaker 2: Attending an Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority Founders Day.
Speaker 1: In the laboratory with a colleague and student workers who serve on the REAP program. That was the REAP, R-E-A-P.
Speaker 2: This is attending a Howard Hughes Institute, medical institute program.
Speaker 1: That's me with several of the female mentors, science faculty and students in the university.
Speaker 2: Let's see, NIH (unclear) associates program meeting.
Speaker 1: Now, where are you here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I bet you can't find me.
Speaker 1: You're in the science class officers--
Speaker 2: Senior class officers. You don't see me?
Speaker 1: I can't see it (unclear), I can't tell which one.
Speaker 2: That's me right there (laughter), senior class officers, high school, and the senior council.
